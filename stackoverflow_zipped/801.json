any can join with 150 of B. Since only one (150) in Table B is left and 151 already assigned to 151 under exact match, one record of A will be join to null.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say, since 150.4 is appearing first in tableA it can go with 150 of TableB.\r\n\r\nAnd 149.8 will remain unmatched.

Or perhaps a date/time field will serve.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58352035/why-is-last-selecting-first-in-ms-access/58352117#58352117","title":"Why is Last selecting First in MS Access?"}],"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":11277108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3343b06b3a374699e66f7eb9da348790?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jossy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11277108/jossy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58352117,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570870695,"creation_date":1570866583,"question_id":58352035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58352035","body_markdown":"I have the follow SQL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT tbl_G_stats_atp.PK_G, tbl_G_stats_atp.InjuryCnt\r\nFROM tbl_G_stats_atp\r\nWHERE (((tbl_G_stats_atp.ID_A)=89) AND ((tbl_G_stats_atp.DATE_S)&lt;37500))\r\nGROUP BY tbl_G_stats_atp.PK_G, tbl_G_stats_atp.InjuryCnt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt produces this result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---------+-----------+\r\n|  PK_G   | InjuryCnt |\r\n+---------+-----------+\r\n| 1203857 |         0 |\r\n| 1203881 |         0 |\r\n| 1203890 |         0 |\r\n| 1203913 |         0 |\r\n| 1203916 |         0 |\r\n| 1203989 |         0 |\r\n| 1204001 |         0 |\r\n| 1204102 |         0 |\r\n| 1204172 |         0 |\r\n+---------+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to select the last record so have used this SQL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT Last(tbl_G_stats_atp.PK_G) AS LastOfPK_G, tbl_G_stats_atp.InjuryCnt\r\nFROM tbl_G_stats_atp\r\nWHERE (((tbl_G_stats_atp.ID_A)=89) AND ((tbl_G_stats_atp.DATE_S)&lt;37500))\r\nGROUP BY tbl_G_stats_atp.InjuryCnt\r\nORDER BY Last(tbl_G_stats_atp.PK_G);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever it returns the first record (1203857).\r\n\r\nI realise I can use this SQL as a replacement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT Max(tbl_G_stats_atp.PK_G) AS MaxOfPK_G, tbl_G_stats_atp.InjuryCnt\r\nFROM tbl_G_stats_atp\r\nWHERE (((tbl_G_stats_atp.ID_A)=89) AND ((tbl_G_stats_atp.DATE_S)&lt;37500))\r\nGROUP BY tbl_G_stats_atp.InjuryCnt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I&#39;d like to understand why it&#39;s doing this.

When you pass it into the function, the function is expecting a `UInt`, and the compiler cannot implicitly cast from `Int` to `UInt`, so you have to do it. Here is one way to do that:\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        ZStack {\r\n            ForEach(0..&lt;self.Cells.count, id: \\.self) { i in\r\n                Text(&quot;&quot;).position(self.test(UInt(exactly: i) ?? 0))\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnother way to fix your problem is to just change the test function&#39;s parameter to be of type `Int` and deal with casting to `UInt` inside of there if you really need to have it be a `UInt` and not just an `Int`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58352019/swiftui-using-foreachs-argument-causing-error-unable-to-infer-closure-type/58352833#58352833","title":"SwiftUI, using ForEach&#39;s argument causing error &quot;Unable to infer closure type&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":248,"user_id":782130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6959b42080c140ab4bfb6e58c8de449c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MetroWind","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/782130/metrowind"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58352833,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570873238,"creation_date":1570866433,"question_id":58352019,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58352019","body_markdown":"I have a simple View struct, in which there&#39;s an array of `AnyView`.

I cannot find where a tuple exists in my last code\r\n\r\nEach element of `bus_stop_ID` is tuple.\r\n\r\nTo recap, you have a list of variable-length tuples and you&#39;d like to find the most common element across that entire structure.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a perfect use for [`collections.Counter`][1]:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bus_stop_ID = [(&#39;id1&#39;, &#39;id2&#39;, &#39;id3&#39;), (&#39;id1&#39;,), (&#39;id1&#39;, &#39;id3&#39;, &#39;id5&#39;)]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; [(stop_id, count)] = sum(map(Counter, bus_stop_ID), Counter()).most_common(1)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; stop_id\r\n    &#39;id1&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; count\r\n    3\r\n\r\nHere:\r\n\r\n - `map(Counter, bus_stop_ID)` counts bus stop ids in every route separately;\r\n - `sum(..., Counter())` aggregates the counts across routes;\r\n - `.most_common(1)` returns the most common bus stop id in the aggregated counts (as a single-element list containing a 2-tuple that consists of a bus stop id and its count).\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fist concatenate all the routes (using `sum()`) and then do the counting:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; [(stop_id, count)] = Counter(sum(bus_stop_ID, ())).most_common(1)\r\n\r\nThis is shorter but less efficient since it needs to concatenate all the routes into a single (potentially giant) tuple.\r\n\r\nA — somewhat fancy — way to sidestep this inefficiency is by using [`itertools.chain()`][2]:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; Counter(itertools.chain(*bus_stop_ID)).most_common(1)\r\n    [(&#39;id1&#39;, 3)]\r\n\r\nThis simply iterates over all bus stop ids in the first route, then the second and so on, doing the counting along the way.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I benchmarked all three methods on an arbitrarily chosen list of 10,000 tuples and the results are quite interesting:\r\n\r\n    In [11]: %timeit sum(map(Counter, bus_stop_ID), Counter()).most_common(1)\r\n    1 loop, best of 3: 235 ms per loop\r\n    \r\n    In [12]: %timeit Counter(sum(bus_stop_ID, ())).most_common(1)\r\n    1 loop, best of 3: 2.64 s per loop\r\n    \r\n    In [13]: %timeit Counter(itertools.chain(*bus_stop_ID)).most_common(1)\r\n    10 loops, best of 3: 17.3 ms per loop\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter\r\n  [2]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58352012/finding-the-most-common-element-in-a-list-of-variable-length-tuples/58352067#58352067","title":"Finding the most common element in a list of variable-length tuples"}],"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":11929900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qUjRaudVykE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdpXybodAuB1xtNZGY5jBY0MhOpAg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Python 101","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11929900/python-101"},"last_editor":{"reputation":379807,"user_id":367273,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1ed2b0c87f602ef30229f5c4b04eff6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"NPE","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/367273/npe"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570871539,"creation_date":1570866374,"last_edit_date":1570871539,"question_id":58352012,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58352012","body_markdown":"I am writing a code that returns the most common bus stop number in a bus route (from a csv file).

But IMO it&#39;s rather clean and easy to understand and it won&#39;t bite you when one of your names include a pipe symbol as my previous code would.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351990/build-one-list-out-of-two-with-excel-vba/58352689#58352689","title":"Build one list out of two with Excel

can avoid **storing** multiple boxed instances of the same values by implementing a cache of pre-boxed values that are used frequently. For example if the number `0` and the boolean `false` are inserted frequently as values, you could implement a memory-optimized dictionary like this:\r\n\r\n    public sealed class ObjectDictionary&lt;TKey&gt; : Dictionary&lt;TKey, object&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly object _cached_0 = 0;\r\n        private readonly object _cached_false = false;\r\n\r\n        public new void Add(TKey key, object value)\r\n        {\r\n            if (value is int &amp;&amp; (int)value == 0)\r\n            {\r\n                base.Add(key, _cached_0);\r\n            }\r\n            else if (value is bool &amp;&amp; (bool)value == false)\r\n            {\r\n                base.Add(key, _cached_false);\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                base.Add(key, value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe original boxed zeros and falses that are passed to the `Add` method will then be eligible for garbage collection immediately, since they won&#39;t be stored inside the dictionary.

The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the\r\n&gt; first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the\r\n&gt; outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are\r\n&gt; compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items\r\n&gt; to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the\r\n&gt; lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of\r\n&gt; two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If\r\n&gt; one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter\r\n&gt; sequence is the smaller (lesser) one.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-types\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that Python 3 no longer allows comparing arbitrary pairs of objects (which was the case in Python 2).

However, you modified str[4], str[5] and str[6] which are out of bounds and such undefined behavior will result in a disaster.\r\n\r\nWhat you should do first is to create an array holds at least `sizeof(int) * 8 + 1` chars. (`sizeof(int) * 8` for the binary representation, one for the null-terminator) Then start your convention.\r\n\r\nAnd I also suggest that the str should not be a global variable.

I would prefer not to put it in a global registry or some such, to avoid polluting the namespace.\r\n\r\nIs there something I could do with a closure?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351884/referencing-lua-table-object-after-script-has-been-run","title":"Referencing lua table/object after script has been run"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","asp.net"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4693,"user_id":8453502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yAbWw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dhananjai Pai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8453502/dhananjai-pai"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570865400,"post_id":58351880,"comment_id":103057870,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351880/browser-close-event-call-webapi-using-javascript#comment103057870_58351880"}],"owner":{"reputation":241,"user_id":1241888,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMtF5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vishal Patel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1241888/vishal-patel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2059,"user_id":4479165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fb7faf1344075e6252156358b64e539?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theduck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4479165/theduck"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570884268,"creation_date":1570865068,"last_edit_date":1570884268,"question_id":58351880,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58351880","body_markdown":"I am facing issue I would like to call javascript function or web API when user clicks on the browser close button.\r\nScenario \r\n\r\nI tried `window.onbeforeunload` but having issue as it asks for Leave or not if click on leave it should call javascript function on cancel nothing is going to be happen.\r\n\r\nBelow is the code I am using:\r\n```js\r\nwindow.onbeforeunload = function (e) \r\n{\r\n   callwebapi();return &#39;test&#39;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351880/browser-close-event-call-webapi-using-javascript","title":"Browser Close Event Call WebAPI using Javascript"},{"tags":["html","css"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5240,"user_id":2605604,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9RN4n.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2605604/simon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570932240,"post_id":58354459,"comment_id":103072314,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351877/combining-and-aligning-multiple-divs-into-a-single-shape/58354459#comment103072314_58354459"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":107371,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"last_editor":{"reputation":107371,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570921589,"last_edit_date":1570921589,"creation_date":1570885522,"answer_id":58354459,"question_id":58351877,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58354459","body_markdown":"Here is an easier idea where you don&#39;t need any complex calculation and a lot of transform:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .hexagon-wrapper {\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      background-color: green;\r\n      width: 40%;\r\n      margin: auto;\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .hexagon-part-red,\r\n    .hexagon-part-yellow,\r\n    .hexagon-part-blue {\r\n      width: 30%;\r\n      display: inline-flex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .hexagon-part-red:before,\r\n    .hexagon-part-yellow:before,\r\n    .hexagon-part-blue:before {\r\n      content: &quot;&quot;;\r\n      padding-top: 115.47%;

There are a number of questions about this already, but in my specific case I need it composed of 3 identical shapes that are different colors.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 specific requirements:\r\n\r\n 1. The overall size of the hexagon must be controllable by a single value. In my case that is the width of the `.hexagon-wrapper` class\r\n 2. The hexagon shape must be centered horizontally and vertically within it&#39;s parent (`.hexagon-wrapper`), and that wrapper must also be centered horizontally and vertically within its parent (the outermost div)\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll notice there are some problems with my attempt:\r\n\r\n 1. The 3 pieces that make up the hexagon arent tightly aligned,\r\n    and the overall shape starts to break apart when you change\r\n    `.hexagon-wrapper width`\r\n 2. I&#39;m using some magic numbers to translate the individual pieces, and they don&#39;t guarantee that the pieces will stick together after resizing, nor do they really guarantee that the elements are perfectly centered horizontally and vertically\r\n\r\nIs there an easier way to do this, or some simple math that I&#39;m missing? Basically, how do I keep the pieces together, and how do I ensure everything is centered?\r\n\r\nI did consider creating a 3D cube and using `transform3d` to ensure everything sticks together, but I *do not* want to go with this approach because I have had many anti-aliasing issues when using `transform3d` and want to avoid that altogether\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .hexagon-wrapper {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      background-color: green;\r\n      width: 40%;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      margin: auto;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .hexagon-part-red {\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      width: 27.85714285714286%;\r\n      padding: 0 0 32.16760145166612% 0;\r\n      transform: translate(112%, -50%) rotate(-60deg) skewY(30deg);\r\n      background: red;\r\n      margin: auto;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .hexagon-part-yellow {\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      width: 27.85714285714286%;\r\n      padding: 0 0 32.16760145166612% 0;\r\n      transform: translate(-49%, 25%) rotate(0deg) skewY(30deg);\r\n      background: yellow;\r\n      margin: auto;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .hexagon-part-blue {\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      width: 27.85714285714286%;\r\n      padding: 0 0 32.16760145166612% 0;\r\n      transform: translate(-69%, 25.1%) rotate(60deg) skewY(30deg);\r\n      background: blue;\r\n      margin: auto;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;span class=&quot;hexagon-wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;hexagon-part-red&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;hexagon-part-yellow&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;hexagon-part-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351877/combining-and-aligning-multiple-divs-into-a-single-shape","title":"Combining and aligning multiple divs into a single shape"},{"tags":["reactjs","flask","axios","request.form"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9624313,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zygEM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Preetam Keshari Nahak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9624313/preetam-keshari-nahak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570866844,"post_id":58351905,"comment_id":103058155,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351874/unable-to-get-request-body-in-flask-api-using-request-form-from-axios-request/58351905#comment103058155_58351905"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":259,"user_id":11241667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d9901803963e61cb4e185ee93b63f59?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Komal Sakhiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11241667/komal-sakhiya"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570865287,"creation_date":1570865287,"answer_id":58351905,"question_id":58351874,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58351905","body_markdown":"You can try this way.I hope it will helps you.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n    axios({\r\n          method: &#39;post&#39;,\r\n          url: &#39;/user/12345&#39;,\r\n          data: {\r\n            firstName: &#39;Fred&#39;,\r\n            lastName: &#39;Flintstone&#39;\r\n          }\r\n        });","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351874/unable-to-get-request-body-in-flask-api-using-request-form-from-axios-request/58351905#58351905","title":"Unable to get request body in flask api using request.form from axios request"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9624313,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zygEM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Preetam Keshari Nahak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9624313/preetam-keshari-nahak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570890417,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570890432,"creation_date":1570865013,"question_id":58351874,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58351874","body_markdown":"I have written a flask api which recieves post request params using request.form.

You should start specifiing those things and get more into details. For example for a diet plan you can think about the properties such plan could have. Properties are e.g. the length of the plan, the nutrition you need and maybe some sport-excercises. Just some samples. Then you may split up the nutrition in one table and so on. Now you can think about if you want to do all the database stuff on your own, or use a framework. Actually the whole database stuff seen in MySQL and so on is done on a webserver, because of security leaks on the client (decompiling, traffic reading, ...). If you want to save data on the local storage or in a local db (SQLite would be you choice) then you should also think about if you want to use an API for that (e.g. RoomAPI by [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack))\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;General thing&lt;/h1&gt;\r\nYou should get your self a clear mind which architecture you want to use. You can store data on a webserver and transfer the data via web-interfaces e.g. [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) with JSON or XML. You can also store data on the local device in a file or in a database (which is basically also a file with specific interface requirements). You have to decide and consider you require the exchange on multiple devices or just for one device on it&#39;s own.\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Planning your structures&lt;/h1&gt;\r\nAfter you know which architecture you want to use, you can start planning. First of all I would suggest you to get an abstract view of your project. That means just writing down what you want to have and then start writing down the corresponding properties. For a diet-plan this may be the name of the plan, the length, required nutrition and so on... After that you may know, oh okay, I also need a table with the food and you will see (automatically) that there will be a connection. If you see the connection just draw a line connecting those. In an ideal situation you already know the relation of this connection (One to many, Many to one, Many to Many, One to One, see this stackoverflow article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3113885/difference-between-one-to-many-many-to-one-and-many-to-many). \r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Implementing your structures&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Anything I do is handcrafted&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nIn the case you want to do all on your own you may use a gui tool for databases to design your database. You can also use commands to do that, what need much more effort. You can decide on your own and on your knowledge.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Pro for gui&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n* Easy to use\r\n* Fast creation of the tables\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Contra for gui&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n* May use some cryptic names for indexes and keys\r\n* &quot;May don&#39;t let you look behind the scenes&quot;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;I rely on APIs&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nYou can also rely on APIs. That means often, that you can program the class according to your plan, then annotate it and the connections/relations would be managed by the api. Such abstraction-layer is Room for Android or Doctrine for PHP, those are just samples and there are much more.\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;h1&gt;\r\nHow you get the data into the database and out of the database is your thing. You could rely on easy use of APIs or get your things done by yourself. It should be a little guide for you to understand database design.\r\n\r\nP.S.: If someone has things to edit, do that!
