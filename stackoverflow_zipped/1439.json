mem;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      StoredRecord() : idx(0), mem(nullptr) {}\r\n\r\n      StoredRecord(uint64_t _idx, unsigned char* _mem) : idx(_idx), mem(new unsigned char[SIZEMACRO(_mem)]) {\r\n        memcpy(mem, _mem, SIZEMACRO(_mem));\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      static std::shared_ptr&lt;StoredRecord&gt; createShared(uint64_t _idx, unsigned char* _mem) {\r\n        return std::make_shared&lt;StoredRecord&gt;(_idx, _mem);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // Some getter for idx and mem\r\n    };\r\n\r\nIt doesnt do much, takes the memory and uses `SIZEMACRO()` (which evaluates the first bytes as uint32_t and uses this as the size, works well) to determinate the size of the memory chunk, allocates the same size and copies it.\r\n\r\nThese `StoredRecord` are kept in an `std::vector&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;StoredRecord&gt;&gt; m_records` in another class.\r\nNo problem here whats-o-ever.\r\nHowever, the code crashes when used as follows:\r\n\r\n    const uint32_t a = 1800;\r\n    const uint32_t b = 1900;\r\n    const uint32_t c = 2000;\r\n    unsigned char data1[a]; \r\n    unsigned char data2[b];\r\n    unsigned char data3[c];\r\n    memset(data1, 0, a);\r\n    memset(data2, 0, b);\r\n    memset(data3, 0, c);\r\n    memcpy(data1, &amp;a, sizeof(uint32_t));\r\n    memcpy(data2, &amp;b, sizeof(uint32_t));\r\n    memcpy(data3, &amp;c, sizeof(uint32_t));\r\n    m_records.push_back(StoredRecord::createShared(0, data1)); // fine\r\n    m_records.push_back(StoredRecord::createShared(1, data2)); // fine\r\n\r\n    // crashes with &quot;malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)&quot;\r\n    // at mem(new unsigned char[SIZEMACRO(_mem)])\r\n    m_records.push_back(StoredRecord::createShared(2, data3)); \r\n\r\nHowever, if I decrease `c = 1900` everything is fine. With a, b or c above ~1950, it crashes with the `malloc invalid size` when run with GDB or run normaly.\r\nI&#39;ve also run my code with valgrind, **there no crash happens** and it dosn&#39;t even complain about that `new unsigned char`. I already double-checked the `SIZEMACRO()` and it evaluates fine to 1800, 1900 and 2000. \r\nWhat puzzles me is the error-message &quot;invalid size&quot;. Why can&#39;t I malloc more then ~1950 bytes here?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199753/malloc-invalid-size-unsorted-on-new-unsigned-charsize","title":"malloc(): invalid size (unsorted) on new unsigned char[&lt;size&gt;]"},{"tags":["django","gis","django-queryset","intersection","geodjango"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12153188,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDU02zXG69_o3JyzFtuxWyCeDXd4IIAnKqisq_3kw=k-s128","display_name":"Sacha Bernheim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12153188/sacha-bernheim"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570012308,"creation_date":1570012308,"question_id":58199752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199752","body_markdown":"In my model, I have a Polygon Field.\r\nIn my query, I would like to compute the area of the intersection between this field, and a predetermined circle, in order to find the proportion of the circle&#39;s area that is recovered by my Polygon model field.\r\n\r\nHere is my model definition: \r\n```\r\nclass WDPA(models.Model):\r\n    site_code = models.CharField(max_length=200, primary_key=True)\r\n    site_name = models.CharField(max_length=300)\r\n    iucn = models.IntegerField(default=0)\r\n\r\n    geom = models.MultiPolygonField()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my query:\r\n```\r\ntile = Tiles.objects.filter(start_long__gte=float(form.cleaned_data.get(&quot;latitude&quot;)), \r\n                                        end_long__lte=float(form.cleaned_data.get(&quot;latitude&quot;)),\r\n                                        start_lat__lte=float(form.cleaned_data.get(&quot;longitude&quot;)),\r\n                                        end_lat__gte=float(form.cleaned_data.get(&quot;longitude&quot;))\r\n            )[0]\r\n            \r\n            tiles = [tile.tile_id, tile.near_0, tile.near_1, tile.near_2, tile.near_3, tile.near_4, tile.near_5, tile.near_6, tile.near_7]\r\n\r\n            center = Point(float(form.cleaned_data.get(&quot;longitude&quot;)), float(form.cleaned_data.get(&quot;latitude&quot;)), srid=4326)\r\n            circle = center.buffer(0.01802)\r\n            \r\n            zones = WDPA.objects.filter(tiles__in=tiles).annotate(\r\n                    distance=Distance(&#39;geom&#39;, center)\r\n            ).order_by(&#39;distance&#39;).filter(distance__lte=2000).annotate(\r\n                intersection=ExpressionWrapper(F(&#39;geom&#39;), output_field=PolygonField()).intersection(circle).area\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I can&#39;t call .intersection() method, it causes this error:\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: &#39;ExpressionWrapper&#39;

this.domElement.getBoundingClientRect().width;\r\n    this.domElement.innerHTML = `&lt;div&gt;${width}&lt;/div&gt;`;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I insert my WebPart into the SharePoint workbench, the number 736 is shown.\r\nHowever, if I change the layout of the section from one column to something else, the number doesn&#39;t change.\r\n  \r\nWhat do I need to do to trigger the render function as soon as the layout (and therefor the width) changes?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199732/spfx-how-to-re-render-my-webpart-on-section-layout-change","title":"SPFx: How to re-render my

Thanks in advance\r\nAny Help or suggestion is really appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199725/how-to-load-multiple-templates-css-and-js-on-handlebars-express-js","title":"How to load multiple templates css and js on handlebars express.js"},{"tags":["reactjs","mui-datatable"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11771463,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wEcaxBKooqM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reP4qRjAzuSoJAxufm5MfZQq9vKxw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11771463/rana"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570012170,"creation_date":1570012170,"question_id":58199724,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199724","body_markdown":"I am using mui-datatable in my application (https://github.com/gregnb/mui-datatables).\r\nThe &quot;Select All&quot; checkbox in header checks all the records in the table.

I purchased a Zigbee Dev. Kit to understand the devices.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning i used the XCTU software from Digi to configure the devices. After all that worked fine for me, i tried to communicate with my NUCLEO board over UART with the Zigbee device.\r\n\r\nTo enter the AT command mode i have to send &quot;+++&quot; over the UART.\r\n\r\nThis is how CUBEMX generated my UART initialisation\r\n```\r\nstatic void MX_USART1_UART_Init(void)\r\n{\r\n  huart1.Instance = USART1;\r\n  huart1.Init.BaudRate = 9600;\r\n  huart1.Init.WordLength = UART_WORDLENGTH_8B;\r\n  huart1.Init.StopBits = UART_STOPBITS_1;\r\n  huart1.Init.Parity = UART_PARITY_NONE;\r\n  huart1.Init.Mode = UART_MODE_TX_RX;\r\n  huart1.Init.HwFlowCtl = UART_HWCONTROL_NONE;\r\n  huart1.Init.OverSampling = UART_OVERSAMPLING_16;\r\n  if (HAL_UART_Init(&amp;huart1) != HAL_OK)\r\n  {\r\n    Error_Handler();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI Wrote the first function to enter the AT command mode.\r\nIn main.c i included my Header where my function is stored.\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;XBEE_AT_CMD.h&gt;\r\n```\r\nInside the while loop i call my function like this, passing huart1.\r\n```\r\nwhile (1)\r\n{\r\n if( AT_enter_CMDmode(&amp;huart1) == 1 )\r\n {\r\n    printf(&quot;OK \\n&quot;);\r\n }\r\n else\r\n {\r\n    printf(&quot;failed entering CMD mode \\n&quot;);\r\n }\r\n HAL_Delay(1000);\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe Function it self looks like this. It simply sends &quot;+++&quot; to the Zigbee. After that i am receiving the answer.\r\n``` \r\nint AT_enter_CMDmode(UART_HandleTypeDef *huart)\r\n{\r\n\tchar receive[3];\r\n\tHAL_UART_Transmit(huart,(uint8_t*)&quot;+++&quot;, 3, 100);\r\n\tHAL_UART_Receive(huart, (uint8_t*)receive, 3, 100);\r\n\tif( strcmp(receive,OK) == 0 )\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn 1;\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn 0;\r\n\t}\t\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAfter i enter the AT command mode by sending &quot;+++&quot; the device is answering with an &quot;OK&quot;. But this just works sometimes. I tried to apply some delays because in the Datasheet it says you should implement a guard time before and after entering the command mode. Sometimes i get an answer which is similar to the expectet &quot;OK&quot; but without an Carriage return at the end or two &quot;O&quot; and one &quot;K&quot;. When i put a Breakpoint after ``` \t\tHAL_UART_Receive(huart, (uint8_t*)receive, 3, 100); ``` I see different answers from the device. \r\n\r\nAnswer 1: &quot;\\rOK&quot;\r\n\r\nAnswer 2: &quot;\\r&quot; \r\n\r\nAnswer 3: &quot;O&quot;\r\n\r\nAnswer 4: &quot;OOK&quot;\r\n\r\nthe answer i am looking for is  &quot;OK\\r&quot;\r\n\r\nIt looks like there is an issue with the UART timing maybe? Did i passed the UART handler in the right way to the function? It feels like i am not reading the UART properly, but not sure.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199705/xbee-transparent-mode-communication","title":"XBEE Transparent mode communication"},{"tags":["docker","passenger","startup","next.js","phusion"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":522756,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cda6d458524857eb26970eb0ac76effb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gihrig","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522756/gihrig"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570261161,"creation_date":1570261161,"answer_id":58246343,"question_id":58199702,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58246343","body_markdown":"There are several subtle problems in the OP question.\r\n\r\nMost notably, Passenger seems to require that the app root path, defined by `root` in the nginx configuration above, has a top level folder named `public`. This folder must not contain an `index.html` file and probably should be empty. This is shown in examples, but not spelled out as a hard requirement in the docs.\r\n\r\nSecond major error is that Passenger bypasses the port specified in the app&#39;s `server.js` (3000 in this case) and replaces it with the port specified in the nginx configuration. So the docker run command changed from:\r\n\r\n&gt;docker container run --name nhe_app -p 80:3000 nhe_app\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n&gt;docker container run --name nhe_app -p 80:80 nhe_app.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the best advice I can give is:\r\n\r\n1.

combining all three into a single output file.\r\n\r\nI just spent far longer than I expected diving through how to do that in FFMPeg, and you may very well be looking to do something far more complex so, by all means, feel free to replace with your own. :)\r\n\r\nNotes I think are not as relevant anymore from original posting:\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; The file name matches until it sees the word High. Everything after High is not needed, (it is just a random string), so trying to match is an issue.\r\n\r\n**I find that a little unclear:**\r\n\r\nAre ALL files going to have &quot;Highc&quot; or is &quot;Highc&quot; going to be Unique to each video?\r\n\r\nOr is &quot;High&quot; going to be unique to each video and &quot;c&quot; and everything after it is going to be able to be ignored?\r\n\r\nIE: Do you only need to look for `PAV_PRG_13683` or is it `PAV_PRG_13683High` or is it `PAV_PRG_13683Highc`\r\n\r\n**ALSO Are the Underscores always going to be present?  What about the `PAV` and `PRG`?**\r\n\r\n*I suspect that the only value that every file defines uniquely for each move/audio pair is either unique value is either `13683`, `13683High`, or `13683Highc`.*\r\n\r\n*IE.  I believe Every File will be prefixed with `PAV_PRG_`&quot; making this value unnecessary to match and allowing the process to work much more simply.  Its unclear if &quot;`High`&quot; or &quot;`Highc`&quot; are also the same on all files, but if the prefix is truly not needed it would be easy either way.*\r\n\r\nStill, for now I will assume that High is nonunique, so all files have &quot;High&quot; for now\r\n\r\n**That said, I am able to determine the correct Left and Right Audio Channels.**\r\n----\r\n\r\nI noticed that the space between High and c clearly has a 00 and 01 on the audio files, Audio channels generally alight to Channel 0 = Left Channel, Channel 1 = Right Channel. (Whether the source was Stereo, 2.1, or 5.1.)\r\n\r\n  When handling audio tracks Software will follow this default method of referring to the channels and should output to files with 00 indicating the first audio channel (Left), 01 Indicating the second audio channel (Right) unless some action was taken to change that behavior.\r\n\r\n**Under the above assumption, this would do the needful.**\r\n\r\n Note you will need to edit the script to have the correct paths set in the variables provided.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199690/finding-file-matches-variable-assignment-using-a-bat-script/58204724#58204724","title":"Finding File Matches &amp; Variable Assignment using a .BAT Script"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":11993157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SVjyMK5NiIY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd_ksNxy-o6L167l2UcV4N0_h9hsg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"A Person","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11993157/a-person"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20441,"user_id":6738015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FYDxX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Compo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6738015/compo"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":101,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58204724,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570320857,"creation_date":1570011945,"last_edit_date":1570015927,"question_id":58199690,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199690","body_markdown":"I am trying to assign a file to a variable in a [tag:batch-file] and then also assign another 2 files into anoter variable.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am having an issue.\r\n\r\nFrom research, I found how I can do the assigning but does anyone know how I can do the below.\r\n\r\nFrom a folder or text file, (either is fine), find the `.m2v` video file and assign that to `Var1` then find matching audio in `.wav` and put that in `Var2` and the third is also an audio `.wav` with mathcing name and assign that to `Var3`.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am having is trying to find the matching `2` audio files to the video.\r\n\r\nThe video file is named as:\r\n\r\n    PAV_PRG_13683Highc450277201906251802090353.m2v\r\n\r\nAudio 1 is:\r\n\r\n    PAV_PRG_13683High01c450211201906251802090376.wav\r\n\r\nAudio 2 is:\r\n\r\n    PAV_PRG_13683High00c450211201906251802090368.wav\r\n\r\nThe file name matches until it sees the word `High`.

than looking very scary from a security point of view, there is nothing wrong with the code you posted.\r\n\r\nTo debug issues with running these commands, impersonate the web server user (`www-data`). That way you can run all these commands as if you were the PHP script and see what errors they might be causing. \r\n\r\nTo do this open a terminal in your Raspberry Pi and run `sudo su www-data -s /bin/bash`.

Although I think it is a different situation to be able to achieve what we would define as consistent data. \r\n\r\n**Context:** \r\n\r\nWe have a set of rules to implement on a ETL server. These rules are either:\r\n\r\n - acting on one row.\r\n - acting inter-rows, in one or different tables.\r\n - acting the same way between two runs (It should maintain the same constraint on all data, or just the last n runs); \r\n\r\nThe third case is different from the second, as it holds when the 2nd case holds but for a well defined number of runs. It might be applied for one single run (one file), or between (1 to n (previous) or on All files).\r\n\r\nTechnically as we conceived the ETL, it has no memory between two runs: two files (but this is to be re-thought)\r\n\r\nFor the application of the third kind of rule, ETL needs to have memory (I think we would end-up back-upping data in ETL); Or by re-checking infinitely (a Job) on the whole database after some time window, So data ending up in database do not necessarily fulfill the third kind of rule in-time.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nWhile we have a continuous flowing data, we apply constraints to have a whole constrained database, the next day we will receive a backup or a correction data for say one month, for this time window, we would like to have constraints satisfied for only this run (this time window), without worrying about the whole database, for future runs all data should be constrained like before without worrying about past data. You can imagine other rules that could fit [Temporal logic][1].\r\n\r\nFor now, we only have the first kind of rules implemented. The way I thought of it is to have a minified database (of any kind: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB ...) that back-up all Data (only constrained columns, probably with hashed values) with flags referring to consistency based on earlier kind of rules.\r\n\r\n**Question:** Are there any *solutions / conception alternatives* that would ease this process ?\r\n\r\nTo **illustrate** in a Cook programming language; An example of a set of rules and following actions:\r\n\r\n    run1 : WHEN tableA.ID == tableB.ID AND tableA.column1 &gt; tableB.column2\r\n           BACK-UP \r\n           FLAG tableA.rule1\r\n    AFTER run1 : LOG (&#39;WARN&#39;)\r\n\r\n    run2 : WHEN tableA.column1 &gt; 0\r\n           DO NOT BACK-UP \r\n           FLAG tableA.rule2\r\n    AFTER run2 : LOG (&#39;ERROR&#39;)\r\n\r\n*Note*: \r\nWhile constraint programming is in theory a paradigm for solving combinatorial problems and in practice can speed problem development and execution; I think this is different than a constraint solving problem; As the first purpose is not for optimizing constraints before resolution, probably not even limiting data domains; It&#39;s main concern is to apply rules on data reception and execute some basic actions (Reject a line, Accept a line, Logging...).\r\n\r\n*I really hope this is not a very broad question and this is the right place.*\r\n
