But one run should suffice for most cases.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test **one specific board**, you could also test &quot;for ever&quot; until you switch off. This is helpful to probe the wiring with an oscilloscope, too.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test **in the field** while running the application software, you can use a high priorised timer interrupt to test one byte at a time. This runs &quot;for ever&quot;, too, of course. And make sure that your test restores the old value.\r\n\r\nBut first you have to decide what kind of errors you are looking for:\r\n\r\n1. Hardware errors like open or short circuits in the wiring. This is quite possible.\r\n1. Hardware errors like a partly defective RAM. I never had any of these. The RAMs I tested worked perfectly or not at all, put aside mistakes like wrong access cycles.\r\n\r\nFor the **first** kind I would test like this:\r\n\r\n1. Write and check all 8 patterns with only one 1-bit into any address (data 0x01 ... 0x80)\r\n1. Write and check all 8 patterns with only one 0-bit into any address (data 0xFE ... 0x7F)\r\n1. Write different patterns (like incrementing numbers) into the address with all 0-bits and all (up to 16) addresses with only one 1-bit (addresses 0x0000, 0x0001 ... 0x8000)\r\n1. Check the patterns at the addresses\r\n1. Write different patterns (like incrementing numbers) into the address with all 1-bits and all (up to 16) addresses with only one 0-bit (addresses 0xFFFF, 0xFFFE ... 0x7FFF)\r\n1. Check the patterns at the addresses\r\n\r\nIf a check fails, you could abort the test loop and report the error. The tested data bit or address bit gives some hint for the actual error. If you like to probe the wiring, just report and keep going.\r\n\r\nThis is really fast and reveals many permanent errors. For transient errors you need to repeat the test.\r\n\r\nFor the **second** kind you need more sophisticated tests. Some of these depend on the *real* physical organization in the RAM, concerning rows and columns of bits. You might like to search the web for &quot;factory RAM tests&quot; like &quot;galloping patterns&quot; (&quot;galpat&quot;).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these tests take a long time, as you noticed. But I&#39;m afraid that there is no way around.\r\n\r\nA very simple test will write a sequence of pseudo-random numbers into the RAM and then check the sequence. Make sure that your number generator produces a period at least as long as the size of the RAM, for example by using a number wide enough. You will use just the lower 8 bits of it, however. You could use a [LFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073365/software-algorithm-to-test-sram-on-microcontroller-at-high-speed/58074782#58074782","title":"Software algorithm to test sram on microcontroller at high speed"}],"owner":{"reputation":1401,"user_id":5141989,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3dPUW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5141989/mike"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58074782,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569308712,"creation_date":1569301431,"question_id":58073365,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58073365","body_markdown":"I have an 8051 microcontroller with external ram attached to it and I want to test the ram to see that it can store and load data correctly (which I think it currently does not).\r\n\r\nIn my program, I have it where the value 80h is written to 1st byte of memory and the value increments as each memory address is incremented but the value rolls over to zero every 256 bytes starting with the 128th byte.\r\n\r\nThis is my function:\r\n\r\n    ;extended memory test.

try.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m just afraid if I test a location too many times, then my program will spend forever testing memory before it begins doing anything useful.\r\n\r\nLuckily I own some microcontrollers that can execute instructions at about 40nS each.\r\nI have others of the same family that execute instructions at about 0.5uS each.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo whats the best way to test a ram chip already installed in the system without spending too much time on the testing?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073365/software-algorithm-to-test-sram-on-microcontroller-at-high-speed","title":"Software algorithm to test sram on microcontroller at high

The code itself is pretty straightforward:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid writeToFile(std::string fileName, const char* buf, size_t bufSize) {\r\n    boost::filesystem::ofstream outFile(fileName, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary | std::ios::trunc);\r\n\r\n    boost::iostreams::filtering_streambuf&lt;boost::iostreams::output&gt; out;\r\n    out.push(boost::iostreams::lzma_compressor());\r\n    out.push(outFile);\r\n\r\n    boost::iostreams::copy(boost::iostreams::basic_array_source&lt;char&gt;(buf, bufSize), out);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to build it, I get a bunch of linking errors:\r\n\r\n* Undefined symbol: boost::iostreams::lzma_error::check(int)\r\n* Undefined symbol: boost::iostreams::lzma::stream_end\r\n* Undefined symbol: boost::iostreams::lzma::default_compression\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m already linking to both libboost_iostreams-mt and libboost_system-mt, since if I use bzip2 or zlib equivalents, everything builds just fine.\r\n\r\nI currently get boost through MacPorts, and I have version 1.71.  (I updated my ports and ran `sudo port install boost` a few hours ago.)  Running `nm` on my copy of libboost_iostreams-mt.dylib shows symbols related to many other compression algorithms that Boost.Iostreams offers, but the LZMA-related symbols are nowhere to be found.  **What can I do to get a library with the proper symbols I need?**\r\n\r\n(Technically, I don&#39;t NEED to use LZMA for my purposes here, and I could probably also work around this by grabbing lzma.cpp from [here](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_71_0/libs/iostreams/src/lzma.cpp) and compiling it in with everything else, but I&#39;m still curious as to what a general fix would be.)\r\n\r\n**Edit 1:**\r\n\r\nIn response to n.m.&#39;s comment, I&#39;m building this as a command line tool through Xcode against the .xcconfig file below, so my exact build command is whatever Xcode spits out.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) /opt/local/include/\r\nLIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) /opt/local/lib/\r\n\r\nOTHER_LDFLAGS = $(inherited) -lboost_iostreams-mt

One article could have many compatible articles and, at the same time a compatible article has its parent as compatible.\r\n\r\nArticle A is compatible with B, so B is compatible with A.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this I created a One to Many relationship where I have two tables:\r\n\r\narticles and compatibles\r\n\r\nThe columns of `articles` are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$table-&gt;bigIncrements(&#39;id&#39;);\r\n$table-&gt;string(&#39;code&#39;, 20)-&gt;unique();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile `compatibles` table columns are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$table-&gt;bigIncrements(&#39;id&#39;);\r\n$table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger(&#39;primary_id&#39;);\r\n$table-&gt;string(&#39;primary_code&#39;, 20);\r\n$table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger(&#39;secondary_id&#39;);\r\n$table-&gt;string(&#39;secondary_code&#39;, 20);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create an article I need to save the data two times, on right and inverse way, thus, assigning a compatible to an article, that article is assigned as compatible of the first one:\r\n\r\n    $articulo = Articulo::findOrFail($request-&gt;get(&#39;id&#39;));\r\n\r\n    foreach ($data[&#39;compatibles&#39;] as $value) {\r\n\r\n        $secundario = Article::select(&#39;id&#39;)-&gt;where(&#39;code&#39;,trim($value[&#39;compatible&#39;]))-&gt;first();\r\n\r\n        $secondary_id = $secondary-&gt;id;\r\n        $primary_id   = $article-&gt;id;\r\n\r\n        $article-&gt;compatibles()-&gt;createMany([\r\n                [\r\n                    &#39;primary_id&#39;       =&gt; $primary_id,\r\n                    &#39;primary_code&#39;     =&gt; trim($value[&#39;codigo&#39;]),\r\n                    &#39;secondary_id&#39;     =&gt; $secondary_id,\r\n                    &#39;secondary_code&#39;   =&gt; trim($value[&#39;compatible&#39;]),\r\n                ],\r\n\r\n                // inverse\r\n                [\r\n                    &#39;primary_id&#39;       =&gt; $secondary_id, // secondary_id on primary_id place, but insert sentence doesn&#39;t respect this.\r\n                    &#39;primary_code&#39;     =&gt; trim($value[&#39;compatible&#39;]),\r\n                    &#39;secondary_id&#39;     =&gt; $primary_id, // primary_id at secondary_id place\r\n                    &#39;secondary_code&#39;   =&gt; trim($value[&#39;code&#39;]),\r\n                ]\r\n            ]\r\n        );\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe first registry is perfectly saved but its inverse repeats the `primary_id` instead saving the secondary_id in its place.\r\n\r\nIf I do `print_r` to debug, the arrays shows correctly, but for some reaseon that I can&#39;t figure out it doesn&#39;t insert same data.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust in case, I paste my Models\r\n```\r\nclass Compatible extends Model\r\n{\r\n    protected $connection = &#39;stock&#39;;\r\n    protected $fillable = [&#39;primary_id&#39;, &#39;primary_code&#39;, &#39;secondary_id&#39;, &#39;secondary_code&#39;];\r\n\r\n    public function article()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this-&gt;belongsTo(&#39;App\\Article&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Article extends Model\r\n{\r\n    public function compatibles()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this-&gt;hasMany(&#39;App\\Compatible&#39;, &#39;primary_id&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have to say that all this process is excuted within a DB transaction.

At any time, each role in the table is assigned to one (and only one) rendering device and to one (and only one) capture device. That is, the assignment of roles to rendering devices is independent of the assignment of roles to capture devices.\r\n\r\nThe first sentence above answers the question if roles are mutually exclusive. Devices are not excluded from handling audio I/O. Instead the roles define which device is used for specific activity in a system with multiple devices. For example, a communication software would do audio capture/rendering using devices set to role `eCommunications` while in the same time media playback would go to another device.\r\n\r\n[Automatic Device Role Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/device-roles-in-windows-vista#automatic-device-role-detection):\r\n\r\n&gt; Consider a scenario in which a computer has a default rendering device, the speakers, and a default capture device, a microphone. The user connects a USB headset to the computer. After the appropriate drivers are installed, the operating system attempts to detect a role to assign for the new audio device.\r\n\r\nand, as an example,\r\n\r\n&gt; ...The communication application can enhance user experience by implementing behaviors such as ducking by handling notifications from the device endpoint.\r\n\r\nUPD\r\n\r\n&gt; so only &quot;ONE&quot; role can be assigned\r\n\r\nNot true, and the documentation has a clear statement on that.\r\n\r\nThe API you are referring to allows you to get default device for specific role. The same device can be default for another role in the same time.\r\n\r\nLet me pull this one from comment once again: &quot;Roles help you choose between [multiple] devices instead.&quot; Roles put no constraint on applications&#39; use of audio devices. They just help to pick proper device in the case the system is equipped with several, and than there might be also role-specific customizations for the devices, think for example of echo cancellation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073231/what-do-the-eroles-enumeration-values-in-windows-core-audio-apis-represent-are/58073497#58073497","title":"What do the ERoles enumeration values in Windows Core Audio APIs represent?

So what is this `ERole` then? An audio mixing configuration that plays &quot;well&quot; (subjectively and statistically) with the target content types? A latency setting? or a combination of the two or more properties?\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nThanks for @Roman R.&#39;s answer. Now more questions still fitting the question title:\r\n\r\nDoc of `IMMDeviceEnumerator::GetDefaultAudioEndpoint` says:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nHRESULT GetDefaultAudioEndpoint(\r\n  EDataFlow dataFlow,\r\n  ERole     role,\r\n  IMMDevice **ppEndpoint\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; role\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The role of the endpoint device. The caller should set this parameter\r\n&gt; to **one of the** following ERole enumeration values:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; eConsole\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; eMultimedia\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; eCommunications\r\n\r\nso only &quot;ONE&quot; role can be assigned; And since `ERole_enum_count` is not a real option as in most enum custom protocols, how would one make sure &quot;`all of the roles`&quot; be played by a single device, as mentioned in [the Device Roles][1] and your quote on that page?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/device-roles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073231/what-do-the-eroles-enumeration-values-in-windows-core-audio-apis-represent-are","title":"What do the ERoles enumeration values in Windows Core Audio APIs represent?

to find out the issue. This is if you are a new user trying to use SQL Server Management Studio for the first time on your local machine.\r\n\r\n**To start SQL Server Management Studio**\r\n\r\nOn current versions of Windows, on the **Start** page, type SSMS, and then click **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**.\r\n\r\nWhen using older versions of Windows, on the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2017**, and then click SQL Server Management Studio.\r\n\r\n**To determine the name of the instance of the Database Engine**\r\n\r\n1. Log into Windows as a member of the Administrators group, and open Management Studio.\r\n\r\n2. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, click **Cancel**.\r\n\r\n3. If Registered Servers is not displayed, on the **View** menu, click **Registered Servers**.\r\n\r\n4. With **Database Engine** selected on the Registered Servers toolbar, expand **Database Engine**, right-click **Local Server Groups**, point to Tasks, and then click **Register Local Servers**. All instances of the Database Engine installed on the computer are displayed. The default instance is unnamed and is shown as the computer name. A named instance displays as the computer name followed by a backward slash `(\\)` and then the name of the instance. For SQL Server Express, the instance is named `&lt;computer_name&gt;\\sqlexpress` unless the name was changed during setup.\r\n\r\n**To verify that the Database Engine is running**\r\n\r\nIn Registered Servers, if the name of your instance of SQL Server has a green dot with a white arrow next to the name, the Database Engine is running and no further action is necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the name of your instance of SQL Server has a red dot with a white square next to the name, the Database Engine is stopped. Right-click the name of the Database Engine, click **Service Control**, and then click **Start**. After a confirmation dialog box, the Database Engine should start and the circle should turn green with a white arrow.\r\n\r\n**To connect to the Database Engine**\r\n\r\nAt least one administrator account was selected when SQL Server was being installed. Perform the following step while logged into Windows as an administrator.\r\n\r\n1. In Management Studio, on the **File** menu, click **Connect Object Explorer**.\r\n\r\n- The Connect to Server dialog box opens. The **Server type** box displays the type of component that was last used.\r\n\r\n2. Select **Database Engine**.\r\n\r\n3. In the **Server name** box, type the name of the instance of the Database Engine. For the default instance of SQL Server, the server name is the computer name. For a named instance of SQL Server, the server name is the `&lt;computer_name&gt;\\&lt;instance_name&gt;`, such as **ACCTG_SRVR\\SQLEXPRESS**.\r\n\r\nIt should work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073212/having-trouble-connecting-to-the-sql-server-management-studio-database/58245832#58245832","title":"Having trouble connecting to the SQL Server Management Studio database"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11997515,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd6f35acb377af9072332c7d839ce509?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marzipan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11997515/marzipan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11997515,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd6f35acb377af9072332c7d839ce509?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marzipan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11997515/marzipan"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":82,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58245832,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570256098,"creation_date":1569300181,"last_edit_date":1569563610,"question_id":58073212,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58073212","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve newly installed SQL Server Management Studio (&quot;SSMS&quot;) and tried to connect to the database which is the first login screen that opens upon opening the application.

From [the documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join):\r\n\r\n&gt; `pub fn join(self) -&gt; Result&lt;T&gt;`\r\n\r\n&gt; Waits for the associated thread to finish.\r\n\r\n&gt; In terms of atomic memory orderings, the completion of the associated thread synchronizes with this function returning. In other words, all operations performed by that thread are ordered before all operations that happen after join returns.\r\n\r\nWith this new knowledge, it is clear that what your code actually did was: create a new thread, wait for it to its completion, and then create the next one. So it is still sequntial and clearly not what you intended.\r\n\r\nThe solution is straightforward: create all the threads first, then wait them to finish as showed below:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::thread;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let handles = (0..100)\r\n        .into_iter()\r\n        .map(|x| {\r\n            thread::spawn(move || {\r\n                ping(x);\r\n            })\r\n        })\r\n        .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    for thread in handles {\r\n        thread.join().unwrap();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn ping(x: i32) {\r\n    // Do

In development, I&#39;m working with the `/dev/ttyp0` and `/dev/ptyp0` pair, where my go process connects to one and I use `screen` to connect to the other.  I&#39;ve written a function that, combined with `serial.Config.ReadTimeout`, reads for up to `ReadTimeout` or a given byte sequence is received.  That function is:\r\n\r\n```golang\r\nfunc readToTermination(s serial.Port, termination []byte, rate time.Duration) []byte {\r\n\tvar out []byte\r\n\tlterm := len(termination)\r\n\tfor {\r\n\t\tbuf := make([]byte, 128)\r\n\t\tn, _ := s.Read(buf)\r\n\t\tout = append(out, buf[:n]...)\r\n\t\tl := len(out)\r\n\t\tif l &gt;= lterm {\r\n\t\t\tif bytes.Compare(out[l-lterm:], termination) == 0 {\r\n\t\t\t\tbreak\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\ttime.Sleep(rate)\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn out\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis avoids burning up CPU cycles doing nothing with a debounce.  When I test with `termination = []byte(&quot;\\n&quot;)` and screen, the `break` never triggers because it turns into `[]byte{97, 11}` (two distinct elements, something like screen flushing after each keystroke).  On the other hand, if I do something like `echo &quot;foo&quot; &gt; /dev/ptyp0`, the break triggers correctly.  Echo implicitly seems to be sending a `\\n`, or the closing of the connection does so.  I see `\\r\\n` for `echo foo` and `\\r\\n\\r\\n` for `echo &quot;foo\\n&quot;`.\r\n\r\nSo my question is:\r\n\r\n(1) why is there a difference in behavior here?\r\n\r\n(2) how do I get the behavior I really am after with a carriage return for the termination?  Perhaps I should use EOT instead?

If yes, you can just goto google &quot;what is my IP&quot; and see if both the values are same. Security Group (SG) setting does not get refreshed or changed on it&#39;s own(unless you are allocating a new Security Group).\r\n\r\nOne more thing you can try.

Or are the edits I&#39;m making to my security group&#39;s inbound/outbound permissions not being saved correctly?\r\n\r\nTo be clear, here&#39;s the order of events of how things have been going:\r\n\r\n* Haven&#39;t worked on DB for a few days, attempt to connect from my R sessions. I get an error.\r\n* Use browser to go to AWS Console and edit my security group&#39;s Inbound/Outbound rules by selecting &quot;My IP&quot;\r\n* Try again to connect to my DB from my R session. Hooray! It works.\r\n* A few days later - pick up the project again, attempt to reconnect to my AWS DB from R, and it no longer works...\r\n* Repeat this cycle of madness\r\n* Make post on SO hoping for an angel to help me\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t a debilitating problem, it&#39;s just extremely annoying to have to re-do my security settings every time I want to connect to my AWS DB.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073174/connecting-to-amazon-aws-postgresql-database-from-r-session","title":"Connecting to Amazon AWS PostgreSQL database from R session"},{"tags":["python","deployment","subprocess","google-cloud-functions","gcloud"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4406,"user_id":609290,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUBht.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DazWilkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/609290/dazwilkin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569385866,"post_id":58073173,"comment_id":102575019,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073173/gcloud-function-deploy-with-os-subprocess-winerror-2-the-system-cannot-find-t#comment102575019_58073173"}],"owner":{"reputation":491,"user_id":5379479,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pyxkT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5379479/jed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":491,"user_id":5379479,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pyxkT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5379479/jed"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569334494,"creation_date":1569299897,"last_edit_date":1569334494,"question_id":58073173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58073173","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve got some Google Cloud Functions that I&#39;d like to deploy from a python script using the os.subprocess.run command.

I&#39;m not even sure if it works because I&#39;m stuck with what to do next:\r\n\r\n\r\n    protected void getJSON() {\r\n        String url = &quot;http://192.168.8.29/api/v1/version&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        try {\r\n\r\n            URL hmAPIEndPoint = new URL(url);\r\n            HttpURLConnection myConnection = (HttpURLConnection) hmAPIEndPoint.openConnection();\r\n    \r\n            if (myConnection.getResponseCode() == 200) {\r\n                // Success\r\n                // Further processing here\r\n                Log.d(&quot;getJSON&quot;, &quot;Got a 200 back from the openConnection()&quot;);\r\n    \r\n                InputStream responseBody = myConnection.getInputStream();\r\n                InputStreamReader responseBodyReader = new InputStreamReader(responseBody, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n    \r\n                JsonReader jsonReader = new JsonReader(responseBodyReader);\r\n    \r\n                // I need jsonReader to be something I can reference like jsonReader[&#39;version_id&#39;]\r\n                \r\n                jsonReader.close();\r\n                myConnection.disconnect();\r\n            } else {\r\n                Log.e(&quot;getJSON&quot;, &quot;Didn&#39;t register a 200 response. Actual: &quot; + myConnection.getResponseCode());\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n        } catch (MalformedURLException mfe) {\r\n            Log.e(&quot;getJSON&quot;, mfe.getStackTrace().toString());\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n            Log.e(&quot;getJSON&quot;, e.getStackTrace().toString());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFrom here there are like 500 sites that tell me to just parse the json line by line but that seems... stupid.  Is there a way that I can get the jsonReader thing into an object like a described above?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58073152/inexperienced-in-java-fumbling-my-way-through-a-rest-api-client","title":"inexperienced in java.
