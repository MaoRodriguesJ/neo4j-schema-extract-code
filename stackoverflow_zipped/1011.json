I am thinking that when you eyeball logs, you are on the alert for error type messages and ones of this nature would be considered distracting.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Stackdriver logging provides an exclusion capability.  You can provide sets of filters that cause Stackdriver to discard log entries that you explicitly choose not to keep.  This is described in detail here:\r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/exclusions\r\n\r\nI found the illustration at the page particularly helpful.\r\n\r\nWhat you will likely want to do is forumulate a query that matches exactly this type of message.  I haven&#39;t tested it but something loosely like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlogName = &#39;cloudiot.googleapis.com%2Fdevice_activity&#39;\r\njsonPayload.eventType = &#39;DISCONNECT&#39;\r\njsonPayload.status.description= &#39;ALREADY_EXISTS&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have a filter expression that matches just the messages to be excluded, you can then use that filter as an exclusion filter.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302120/many-mqtt-disconnect-already-exists-error-in-google-cloud-iot-console-log/58306114#58306114","title":"Many &quot;MQTT disconnect - ALREADY_EXISTS&quot; error in Google Cloud IoT console log"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8115,"user_id":1552344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74fc8cd7f9ef31c587c69ad382f33f13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"class","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552344/class"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8115,"user_id":1552344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74fc8cd7f9ef31c587c69ad382f33f13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"class","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552344/class"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571715851,"last_edit_date":1571715851,"creation_date":1571715530,"answer_id":58496753,"question_id":58302120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58496753","body_markdown":"The MQTT connection to the device bridge has a few special properties that can cause disconnects.

It looks to me like you&#39;re trying to connect the same device twice and it&#39;s causing a disconnect.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s possible that you have a client that tries to open up two connections, or you are connecting a second client. If you&#39;re connecting the same device twice, the device will be disconnected.  Maybe your client is setup to open up multiple channels or your application logic is reconnecting without disconnecting.\r\n\r\nThere are various other reasons for disconnects, for example, if you try to publish with the incorrect QoS or to an invalid topic but this doesn&#39;t appear to be that given publish is working on subsequent connections.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302120/many-mqtt-disconnect-already-exists-error-in-google-cloud-iot-console-log/58496753#58496753","title":"Many &quot;MQTT disconnect - ALREADY_EXISTS&quot;

When using `sass-loader`, `css-loader`, and `style-loader`, the `require` will pass the Sass source code through those loaders and the result is JS code that will insert the transpiled CSS into a `&lt;style&gt;` element on the page at runtime.

Because webpack processes each Sass file independently, as it&#39;s `require`d, each component&#39;s Sass file will need to import any variables/mixins it needs.

of working and issue facing of this code. Kindly go through once to understand my issue and question:\r\n\r\n[Live Demo Link][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18BZr_6_3_vlV6q8ubA5QVoOIs8S2i_aD/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n\r\nFor Eg:\r\nList of Each Video is been given. Now i click on any item to view its Live Video. First it will check that the video of current channel is Live or not. If Live will fetch Live Id and can see Live Video present in channel. If not live than fix video id stored in Firebase will be fetched and video with fix id will be played. \r\n\r\nHere its working as per i said before but what happens when i click on one item, first Live Id is been fetched in back-end and stored in Shared Preference. If not live than Firebase id is been fetched but in both cases video is not getting play first time. When i go back, activity gets finished and come back to list than again i click any item but now last time whatever id get fetched it gets played and not the one i clicked next time. It means it does not do parallel task that when i fetch data on same time it gets loaded but gets played second time i click.\r\n\r\nEven in shared preference the data gets stored first time and than i read value from Shared Preference but don&#39;t know somehow value is not getting and played first time. For more understanding please go through Video showing working of App.\r\n\r\nKindly guide me what changes i should make to have proper working of the app to have video play live first time only.

Is this possible?  If not, is it possible for JavaScript to save the html needed as a file either on the user&#39;s station or in temporary files and then attach as text to an email, or would this still need manual intervention from a user to attach the file?

n2 is less than the resolution you want (it&#39;s about 400 ns on my PC after a couple of iterations).\r\n\r\nYou can then use the difference between `n1` (or n2 or an average of the 2...) and `m *

of `System.currentTimeMillis()`, which may be &gt; 1 ms. So no guarantee that you will get microsecond resolution.\r\n- Corollary: this probably doesn&#39;t work in all environments (you may never get n2-n1 small enough - or it may be 0 just because the resolution of your system is too low).\r\n- `System.nanoTime()` may be out of sync over long periods - so this is a trade off between precision and performance.\r\n- You also need to account for possible arithmetic overflow.\r\n\r\nSee also:

On top of Each tab there&#39;s a ScrollView with different schema (3 different fragments with a lot of ImageButtons) and in the first and the second tabs, below the schema, there&#39;s a TextView, a button and another fragment (same for both, with different data).\r\n[Here&#39;s a representation of the ViewPager structure. ][1]\r\n\r\nPlus, when selecting an item from the drawer, I want to replace this whole ViewPager with another fragment and restore it once the &quot;home&quot; item is selected again. Right now, this works but the app gets lag and, because of this ViewPager and his nested fragments, it lags even when loading the &quot;home&quot; the first time after the login. \r\nSo far I was able to make it all working, but I think the layout is heavy and messy, so I would like to know if there&#39;s a better way to achieve this result.\r\n\r\nactivity_main\r\n\r\n    &lt;DrawerLayout&gt;\r\n      &lt;include layout=&quot;@layout/app_bar_main/&gt;\r\n      &lt;NavigationView/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/DrawerLayout&gt;\r\n\r\napp_bar_main\r\n\r\n    &lt;ConstraintLayout&gt;\r\n      &lt;AppBarLayout&gt;\r\n       &lt;Toolbar/&gt;\r\n     &lt;/AppBarLayout&gt;\r\n    &lt;FrameLayout\r\n      android:id=&quot;@+id/fragment_container&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ConstraintLayout&gt;\r\n\r\nfragment_home\r\n\r\n    &lt;FrameLayout\r\n      android:id=&quot;@+id/fragment_home&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;ViewPager\r\n       android:id=&quot;@+id/view_pager&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/FrameLayout&gt;\r\n\r\nfragment_tab\r\n\r\n    &lt;ScrollView&gt;\r\n      &lt;ConstraintLayout&gt;\r\n        &lt;FrameLayout\r\n          android:id=&quot;@+id/schema_container&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;TextView/&gt;\r\n        &lt;ImageButton/&gt;\r\n        &lt;FrameLayout\r\n          android:id=&quot;@+id/calendar_container&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;/ConstraintLayout&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ScrollView&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, right now there&#39;s the main activity with the drawer/NavigationView which includes &quot;app_bar_main&quot;. This one is just a Toolbar and an empty FrameLayout. I&#39;m replacing this FrameLayout (id:fragment_container) with different fragments, depending on the item selected in the NavigationView. When starting the app is replaced with &quot;fragment_home&quot;, which holds the ViewPager and in this ViewPager each tab it&#39;s a &quot;fragment_tab&quot;, where I replace the first FrameLayout (id:schema_container) with a different schema (fragment), depending on the index of the tab, and the second FrameLayout with another fragment representing a daily calendar.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s all working as it should, but I think it&#39;s a big mess because of all these nested fragments/replacements.\r\nIs there&#39;s a better/more efficient way to organise this layout or to achieve this same result?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XVEsL.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302013/drawerlayout-and-viewpager-with-too-many-nested-fragments","title":"DrawerLayout and ViewPager with too many nested fragments"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":11901310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx9PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krishna Savani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901310/krishna-savani"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570688284,"post_id":58302011,"comment_id":102993134,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302011/how-to-display-blogs-as-a-grid-with-wordpress#comment102993134_58302011"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1204,"user_id":1939291,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YLMDq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MistaPrime","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1939291/mistaprime"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570626912,"creation_date":1570626912,"answer_id":58305035,"question_id":58302011,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58305035","body_markdown":"The grid is made using CSS once the HTML is output using wp_query.

course, right after I post this problem I&#180;ve been sitting on for so long, I find the solution...\r\n\r\nSo if anyone has a similar problem:\r\n\r\nIt seems like OpenCL really doesn&#180;t like it if you declare array elements right in the declaration of the array itself.\r\nSo instead of writing:\r\n```\r\n float3 EdgePositions[12] = {(float3)(0, 0.5, 0), (float3)(0.5, 1, 0), (float3)(1, 0.5, 0), (float3)(0.5, 0, 0), (float3)(0, 0.5, 1), (float3)(0.5, 1, 1), (float3)(1, 0.5, 1), (float3)(0.5, 0, 1), (float3)(0, 0, 0.5), (float3)(0, 1, 0.5), (float3)(1, 1, 0.5), (float3)(1, 0, 0.5)};\r\n```\r\nI now wrote:\r\n```\r\nfloat3 pos0 = (float3)(0.f, 0.5f, 0.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos1 = (float3)(0.5f, 1.f, 0.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos2 = (float3)(1.f, 0.5f, 0.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos3 = (float3)(0.5f, 0.f, 0.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos4 = (float3)(0.f, 0.5f, 1.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos5 = (float3)(0.5f, 1.f, 1.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos6 = (float3)(1.f, 0.5f, 1.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos7 = (float3)(0.5f, 0.f, 1.f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos8 = (float3)(0.f, 0.f, 0.5f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos9 = (float3)(0.f, 1.f, 0.5f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos10 = (float3)(1.f, 1.f, 0.5f);\r\n\tfloat3 pos11 = (float3)(1.f, 0.f, 0.5f);\r\n\t\r\n\tfloat3 EdgePositions[12] = {pos0, pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4, pos5, pos6, pos7, pos8, pos9, pos10, pos11};\r\n```\r\nand it works like a charm now.\r\n\r\nI still don&#180;t really get why this isn&#180;t allowed or returns false values, so if anyone knows and likes to elaborate, I would very much apprecitate it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302009/opencl-kernel-returns-strangely-huge-numbers/58303993#58303993","title":"OpenCl kernel returns strangely huge

have been trying to move my Marching Cubes algorithm from the CPU to the GPU with an OpenCL kernel for a while now.\r\n\r\nThe problem I&#180;m getting is that a function in my kernel returns strange values, so I wrote a test case where I specify the possible return values in an array of 12 float3s with the float3 components being 0, 0.5 and 1 (see code below)\r\n\r\nFor some reason I get weirdly large numbers though, e.g. an edgeIndex of &quot;11&quot; returns the float3: (-145085952., 6.600e-43#DEN, 0) while it should be (1, 0, 0.5). The y coordinate basically is 0 though as far as I&#180;m aware so that&#180;s not the problem, but the x coordinate is what&#180;s giving me headaches. \r\n\r\nAt first I thought OpenCL might have a problem with converting the given values to float3s so I specified them with &quot;.f&quot; (e.g. (float3)(0.f, 0.5f, 0.f)). This only resulted in even more strange and different results which makes me think that I have to make a mistake somewhere.\r\nI&#180;m fairly new to OpenCL (this is my first real project using it) and I haven&#180;t been programming in general that long either so I hope I&#180;m not making some newbie mistake here but I tried to tackle this and related problems for days now and I can&#180;t find a solution.\r\n\r\nI narrowed down the problem as far as I could and tested whether the code is doing what it should for each step that it takes. Up to the function call of &quot;CalculateEdgePos&quot; everything seems to be going fine and I get the expected results. I stripped the function of all the unnecessary code (therefore you can ignore the &quot;values&quot; parameter as it&#180;s not being used right now) but now I&#180;m at my wits end. \r\n\r\nthe function returning the strange results:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfloat3 CalculateEdgePos(int edgeIndex, __global int* values) \r\n{ \r\n\tif(edgeIndex == -1) \r\n\t{ \r\n\t\treturn (float3)(-1,-1,-1); \r\n\t} \r\n\t\r\n        float3 EdgePositions[12] = {(float3)(0, 0.5, 0), (float3)(0.5, 1, 0), (float3)(1, 0.5, 0), (float3)(0.5, 0, 0), (float3)(0, 0.5, 1), (float3)(0.5, 1, 1), (float3)(1, 0.5, 1), (float3)(0.5, 0, 1), (float3)(0, 0, 0.5), (float3)(0, 1, 0.5), (float3)(1, 1, 0.5), (float3)(1, 0, 0.5)};\r\n\t\r\n        return EdgePositions[edgeIndex];\r\n} \r\n\r\n\r\nand the part of the kernel with the function call and the result getting send back to the CPU \r\n(edgeIndex is calculated fine beforehand):\r\n\r\n__kernel void MarchCubes(__global float* outVertices, __global int* values, __global int* edges) \r\n{ \r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\tfloat3 vertexPos = CalculateEdgePos(edgeIndex, values); \r\n\tfloat coords[3] = {vertexPos.x, vertexPos.y, vertexPos.z}; \r\n \r\n\toutVertices[get_global_id(0)] = coords[coordIndex]; \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf anyone of you has any tips or help to offer, I&#180;d greatly appreciate it.\r\nIf you need any more code snippets let me know but I think this should be sufficient as it&#180;s only the specified function that acts weirdly.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nfoodius","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302009/opencl-kernel-returns-strangely-huge-numbers","title":"OpenCl kernel returns strangely huge

I can be wrong but what you are looking for boils down to either dependency injection or strategy design pattern both of which solve the problem of executing dynamic code at runtime via a common interface without worrying about the actual implementations. There are also much simpler ways just like u desrcibed creating an abstract class(Interface) and having all the classes implement this interface.\r\n\r\nI am giving brief examples fo which here for your reference:\r\n\r\n1. Dependecy Injection(From wikipedia): \r\nIn software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object. A &quot;dependency&quot; is an object that can be used, for example as a service. Instead of a client specifying which service it will use, something tells the client what service to use. The &quot;injection&quot; refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the object (a client) that would use it. The service is made part of the client&#39;s state. \r\n\r\nPassing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.\r\n\r\nPython does not have such a conecpt inbuilt in the language itself but there are packages out there that implements this pattern.\r\n\r\nHere is a nice article about this in python(All credits to the original author):\r\n\r\n[Dependency Injection in Python][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Strategy Pattern: This is an anti-pattern to inheritance and is an example of composition which basically means instead of inheriting from a base class we pass the required class&#39;s object to the constructor of classes we want to have the functionality in. For example:\r\n   Suppose you want to have a common add() operation but it can be implemented in different ways(add two numbers or add two strings)\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n     \r\n     Class XYZ():\r\n\r\n        def __constructor__(adder):\r\n\r\n            self.adder = adder\r\n\r\nThe only condition being all adders passed to the XYZ class should have a common Interface.\r\n\r\nHere is a more detailed example:\r\n[Strategy Pattern in Python][2]\r\n\r\n3. Interfaces:\r\nInterfaces are the simplest, they define a set of common attributes and methods(with or without a default implementation). Any class then can implement an interface with its own functionality or some shared common functionality. In python Interfaces are implemented via abc package.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://medium.com/@shivama205/dependency-injection-python-cb2b5f336dce\r\n  [2]: https://medium.com/@sheikhsajid/design-patterns-in-python-part-1-the-strategy-pattern-54b24897233e","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302001/selecting-executed-method-of-class-at-runtime-in-python/58302329#58302329","title":"Selecting executed method of class at runtime in python?"}],"owner":{"reputation":592,"user_id":8473031,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4878bfc9d6a80397a8446111fffa4dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RoQuOTriX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8473031/roquotrix"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58302329,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570617692,"creation_date":1570616499,"question_id":58302001,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58302001","body_markdown":"This question is very generic but I don&#39;t think it is opinion based. It is about software design and the example prototype is in python:\r\n\r\nI am writing a program which goal it is to simulate some behaviour (doesn&#39;t matter). The data on which the simulation works is fixed, but the simulated behaviour I want to change at every startup time. The simulation behaviour can&#39;t be changed at runtime.\r\n\r\nExample:  \r\nSimulation behaviour is defined like:  \r\n\r\n    usedMethod = static\r\n\r\nThe program than looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    while(true)\r\n        result = static(object) # static is the method specified in the behaviour\r\n        # do something with result\r\n\r\nThe question is, how is the best way to deal with exchangeable defined functions? So another run of the simulation could look like this\r\n\r\n    while(true)\r\n        result = dynamic(object)\r\n\r\nif `dynamic` is specified as `usedMethod`. The first thing that came in my mind was an `if-else` block, where I ask, which is the used method and then execute this on. This solution would not be very good, because every time I add new behaviour I have to change the `if-else` block and the `if-else` block itself would maybe cost performance, which is important, too. The simulations should be fast.   \r\n\r\nSo a solution I could think of was using a function pointer (output and input of all `usedMethods` should be well defined and so it should not be a problem). Then I initalize the function pointer at startup, where the `used method` is defined.  \r\n\r\nThe problem I currently have, that the used method is not a function per-se, but is a method of a class, which depends heavily on the intern members of this class, so the code is more looking like this:\r\n\r\n    balance = BalancerClass()\r\n    while(true)\r\n        result = balance.static(object)\r\n        ...\r\n        balance.doSomething(input)\r\n\r\nSo my question is, what is a good solution to deal with this problem?\r\n  \r\nI thought about inheriting from the `balancerClass` (this would then be an abstract class, I don&#39;t know if this conecpt exists in python) and add a derived class for every used method. Then I create the correct derived object which is specified in the simulation behaviour an run-time. \r\n\r\nIn my eyes, this is a good solution, because it encapsulates the methods from the base class itself. And every used method is managed by its own class, so it can add new internal behaviour if needed.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore the `doSomething` method shouldn&#39;t change, so therefore it is implemented the base class, but depends on the intern changed members of the derived class.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know in general if this software design is good to solve my problem or if I am missing a very basic and easy concept.  \r\n\r\nIf you have a another/better solution please tell me and it would be good, if you provide the advantages/disadvantages. Also could you tell me advantages/disadvantages of my solution, which I didn&#39;t think of?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58302001/selecting-executed-method-of-class-at-runtime-in-python","title":"Selecting executed method of class at runtime in

„behind the scenes“: please correct me if I am wrong:\r\n\r\n - CALL_FUNCTION creates a new Frame on top of the stack: most of the time a function call is followed by a POP_TOP (e.g.: print()). \r\n    - But actually I wonder why the range() CALL_FUNCTION is not followed by a POP_TOP.\r\n - creating and popping frames is “expensive”\r\n    - Acording to:“ list is created in C, iteration performs at C lever, etc. This is one of the most pervasive, utterly false myths about Python. The list comprehension is faster because suspending and resuming a function&#39;s frame is slow, not because there&#39;s anything particularly special about list comprehensions. –@Kasramvd (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30245397/why-is-a-list-comprehension-so-much-faster-than-appending-to-a-list/30245465#30245465)\r\nBut in my Example-for-loop is no CALL_FUNCTION, therefore there are no frame mechanisms.\r\n\r\nNow back to my question, if we ignore the bytecode 16-18 we have just two instructions. \r\n\r\n - Are those the reason for the “slow” looping? Obviously, python is a very high-level language compared to c or c++ and the loop can’t be optimized by an compiler.\r\n - Or is the reason usually found in the instructions within the loop.\r\n - I would also appreciate good literature (books, articles, videos) about the mechanisms behind the python high-level API\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nnotable difference\r\n\r\n - dis.dis(range) -&gt; no Output, no error\r\n - dis.dis(print) .&gt; TypeError: don&#39;t know how to disassemble builtin_function_or_method objects","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301994/q-are-frames-the-reason-for-slow-python-loops","title":"Q: Are frames the reason for „slow“ python loops?"},{"tags":["android","onbackpressed"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4425,"user_id":3548046,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oyTAQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Umair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3548046/umair"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570616520,"post_id":58301990,"comment_id":102966440,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301990/how-do-i-go-back-to-the-previous-activity#comment102966440_58301990"},{"owner":{"reputation":347,"user_id":4457630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9KTaN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yamashiro Rion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4457630/yamashiro-rion"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570617595,"post_id":58301990,"comment_id":102966994,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301990/how-do-i-go-back-to-the-previous-activity#comment102966994_58301990"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":8211715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aa72735f17980033338cb01ff8153374?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jimit patel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8211715/jimit-patel"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570616940,"creation_date":1570616940,"answer_id":58302136,"question_id":58301990,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58302136","body_markdown":"try to call `finish()` on click of button.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301990/how-do-i-go-back-to-the-previous-activity/58302136#58302136","title":"How do I go back to the previous activity?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12078296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDqZs_OybyXTerjZRGh_GkuKLs8Mh-jusQ7JS-5iA=k-s128","display_name":"Paul Serwanga Lwanga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078296/paul-serwanga-lwanga"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2397,"user_id":5082285,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6346341a24fb90f9ac3fb4ef1136d564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Markus Kauppinen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5082285/markus-kauppinen"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":5,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-5,"last_activity_date":1570616994,"creation_date":1570616442,"last_edit_date":1570616994,"question_id":58301990,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301990","body_markdown":"I have three activities, A, B, C.

Should I just create a JSInterop method to return the input values?  \r\n\r\n    domInput.attr(&quot;@ref&quot;, function (d3) {return d3.key});\r\n\r\nI tried creating &quot;@ref&quot; attributes so I could use the **ElementReference**  but D3 errors when I try to append an attribute that begins with &#39;@&#39;  \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301986/blazor-get-input-value-from-javascript-created-dom-element","title":"Blazor, get Input value from Javascript created DOM Element"},{"tags":["azure","kubernetes","permissions","chmod"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10270,"user_id":9773937,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUlzf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Charles Xu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9773937/charles-xu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570759138,"post_id":58301985,"comment_id":103023959,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301985/permissions-on-azure-file#comment103023959_58301985"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11632119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25efd8ecaa8c1023687e75a1896dcea9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hajjim_0081","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11632119/hajjim-0081"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10270,"user_id":9773937,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUlzf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Charles Xu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9773937/charles-xu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570789864,"post_id":58301985,"comment_id":103034187,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301985/permissions-on-azure-file#comment103034187_58301985"},{"owner":{"reputation":10270,"user_id":9773937,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUlzf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Charles Xu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9773937/charles-xu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571016769,"post_id":58301985,"comment_id":103088299,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301985/permissions-on-azure-file#comment103088299_58301985"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10270,"user_id":9773937,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUlzf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Charles Xu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9773937/charles-xu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570696423,"creation_date":1570696423,"answer_id":58318657,"question_id":58301985,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58318657","body_markdown":"First of all, you only can control the permission of the whole Azure file share when you mount it as the persistent volume on the pods. It does not support to change the permission of a special file inside the share.\r\n\r\nWhat I recommend is that you can filter the files into the different directories and the files in the same directory have the same permission. Then you can mount the directories of the Azure file share as the different persistent volumes to the pods and set the persistent volumes with different permissions as you need.\r\n\r\nFor example, you need a directory with permission 0644 and the files in it with permission 0664. Then you can create a persistent volume like this:\r\n\r\n    apiVersion: v1\r\n    kind: PersistentVolume\r\n    metadata:\r\n      name: azurefile\r\n    spec:\r\n      capacity:\r\n        storage: 5Gi\r\n      accessModes:\r\n        - ReadWriteMany\r\n      storageClassName: azurefile\r\n      azureFile:\r\n        secretName: azure-secret\r\n        shareName: aksshare/subfolder1\r\n        readOnly: false\r\n      mountOptions:\r\n      - dir_mode=0644\r\n      - file_mode=0664\r\n      - uid=1000\r\n      - gid=1000\r\n      - mfsymlinks\r\n      - nobrl\r\n\r\nAnd create a PersistentVolumeClaim which will use the PersistentVolume that you created above:\r\n\r\n    apiVersion: v1\r\n    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim\r\n    metadata:\r\n      name: azurefile\r\n    spec:\r\n      accessModes:\r\n        - ReadWriteMany\r\n      storageClassName: azurefile\r\n      resources:\r\n        requests:\r\n          storage: 5Gi\r\n\r\nFinally, create the pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim with the `volumes` like this:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n      volumes:\r\n      - name: azure\r\n        persistentVolumeClaim:\r\n          claimName: azurefile\r\n\r\nWhen it&#39;s OK, you can see things like you set below:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLGeL.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301985/permissions-on-azure-file/58318657#58318657","title":"Permissions on Azure File"}],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11632119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25efd8ecaa8c1023687e75a1896dcea9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hajjim_0081","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11632119/hajjim-0081"},"last_editor":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11632119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25efd8ecaa8c1023687e75a1896dcea9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hajjim_0081","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11632119/hajjim-0081"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58318657,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570717914,"creation_date":1570616424,"last_edit_date":1570717914,"question_id":58301985,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301985","body_markdown":"i&#39;m using azure files as a volume for kubernetes, but i&#39;m facing a problem with it.\r\n\r\ni&#39;m able to set permissions on the whole share but i can’t change permissions on a specific file/directory.\r\n\r\nIf i set the default permissions to the whole share (example 644 (rw/r/r)) and try to change this permissions on specific file (example Chmod 0644 file) chmod doesn’t take any effect it always the default permissions.\r\n\r\nEven if i didn’t mention the default permission it will take 0777 and yet i can’t change permissions of file/directory inside the share.\r\n\r\ni’ve done some research and i found that this feature is not yet implemented the source is from 2016 I hope this feature is enabled now?\r\n\r\nOtherwise is there any other solution to propose ?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n======\r\n\r\nMany thanks **@Charles Xu** for your suggestion it&#39;s very useful.

anyone who encounters this issue. Here are a few hints. This is what solved the issue in my case. Humble mention to Jeff Scott Brown, whose suggestions pushed me in the right direction.\r\n\r\n1. Please check the micronaut version,  \r\n I had micronaut `1.0.2` version installed through which I generated the app. But the documentation I was following was of latest version which is `1.2.3`\r\n\r\n2. Please check which junit version you have in your pom or build file.

Coming from springboot I was expecting that micronaut has some runner class like `SpringRunner`, I could not find any. **Is there a runner class in micronaut for running tests?**  \r\n\r\nFrom the documentation [here][1] I see that I can test my rest endpoints using HTTPClient. I tried both the  \r\n   \r\n 1. Low level HttpClient  \r\n 2. CompileTime HttpClient\r\n\r\nHere is a snippet of the test classes I have  \r\n\r\n    @MicronautTest\r\n    class HelloControllerSpec {\r\n        @Inject\r\n        EmbeddedServer server; \r\n    \r\n        @Inject\r\n        @Client(&quot;/&quot;)\r\n        HttpClient client; \r\n    \r\n        @Test\r\n        void testHelloWorldResponse() {\r\n              //client and server are null\r\n               .........\r\n        }\r\n    }  \r\nAnd  \r\n\r\n    @MicronautTest \r\n    public class HelloClientSpec  {\r\n    \r\n        @Inject\r\n        HelloClient client; \r\n    \r\n        @Test\r\n        public void testHelloWorldResponse(){\r\n            //client is null\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n From what I observed, the annotation `@MicronautTest` doesn&#39;t seem to do anything. Its the same case with `@Inject` and `@Client`, all the fields are null when I run the test.  So I am wondering **what exactly does `@MicronautTest` do?**\r\n\r\nThe only way I could get it work is to start the server explicitly(`@Inject` on `EmbeddedServer` doesn&#39;t do anything) like this  \r\n\r\n    server = ApplicationContext.run(EmbeddedServer.class);\r\n    helloClient = server.getApplicationContext().getBean(HelloClient.class);\r\n\r\nEven with this, it starts a server instance. Which in not what I wanted. Because I do not want to start server for unit tests. Also I do not want to get the beans this way from application Contexts. **Whay doesn&#39;t `@Inject`, `@Client`, `@EmbeddedServer` work in my case, am I missing something here?**\r\n\r\n In case of springboot, I could test only the weblayer separately(using mockmvc and springboottest), not starting the whole application context. **is there an equivalent in micronaut?**  \r\n\r\nI am using micronaut 1.0.2\r\n  \r\n  [1]: https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/index.html#creatingClient","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301944/micronaut-unit-testing-need-clarification-on-micronauttest","title":"Micronaut unit testing : need clarification on @MicronautTest"},{"tags":["python","pandas","html-table"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9373,"user_id":7131757,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JhDlG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Giorgos Myrianthous","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7131757/giorgos-myrianthous"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570616740,"post_id":58301942,"comment_id":102966555,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301942/how-to-save-html-table-into-pandas-dataframe-properly#comment102966555_58301942"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11693768,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/692ebec00b99a45dff3ea0d2542615fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anarchy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11693768/anarchy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9373,"user_id":7131757,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JhDlG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Giorgos Myrianthous","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7131757/giorgos-myrianthous"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570616840,"post_id":58301942,"comment_id":102966615,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301942/how-to-save-html-table-into-pandas-dataframe-properly#comment102966615_58301942"},{"owner":{"reputation":9373,"user_id":7131757,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JhDlG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Giorgos Myrianthous","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7131757/giorgos-myrianthous"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570616877,"post_id":58301942,"comment_id":102966634,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301942/how-to-save-html-table-into-pandas-dataframe-properly#comment102966634_58301942"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11693768,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/692ebec00b99a45dff3ea0d2542615fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anarchy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11693768/anarchy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9373,"user_id":7131757,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JhDlG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Giorgos Myrianthous","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7131757/giorgos-myrianthous"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570617346,"post_id":58301942,"comment_id":102966876,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301942/how-to-save-html-table-into-pandas-dataframe-properly#comment102966876_58301942"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11693768,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/692ebec00b99a45dff3ea0d2542615fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anarchy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11693768/anarchy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11693768,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/692ebec00b99a45dff3ea0d2542615fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anarchy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11693768/anarchy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570617291,"creation_date":1570616283,"last_edit_date":1570617291,"question_id":58301942,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301942","body_markdown":"I am trying to save the table on this website https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar.php \r\n\r\n```\r\nreq = requests.post(&#39;https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar.php&#39;)\r\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(req.content, &quot;lxml&quot;)\r\ntable = soup.find(&#39;table&#39;, {&quot;class&quot;: &quot;calendar__table&quot;})\r\ndf = pd.read_html(table.prettify(),header=0)\r\ndf = df[0]\r\n\r\n```\r\nbut the format comes out weird because the first column (date), and the second column which is the time are grouped/merged cells. in the html code they look like blank cells or blank table data tags like this.\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;td class=&quot;calendar__cell calendar__date date&quot;&gt;

MainAct is the launcher activity. \r\nActivity2 contains a default navhost fragment having a navgraph with two fragments, fragment1(start-destination), fragment2.\r\n\r\nWhen starting MainActivity I create a notification having a content intent created with NavDeepLinkBuilder that navigates to Activity2.fragment2.\r\nThe problem appears if MainActivity is running and active in the foreground and Activity2.fragment2 is navigated then after I press back it does not navigate back to MainActivity as it should but instead it takes me to launcher home screen. \r\n\r\nI also tested this behaviour with implicit deep links:\r\nadb shell am start -a &quot;android.intent.action.VIEW&quot; -d http://fragment2/\r\nHaving MainActivity open  Activity2 gets on top and on back press it navigates to
