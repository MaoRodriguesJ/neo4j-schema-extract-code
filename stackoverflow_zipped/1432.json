Delegate types can be called directly by doing `itemBuilder(rib)`, this executes the Action (Method) `itemBuilder` with the parameter `rib`.\r\n\r\nWhat it does is this:\r\n\r\nFirst we declare the method with the Action parameter\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic ReceiptBuilder WithItem(string text, Action&lt;ReceiptItemBuilder&gt; itemBuilder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Action&lt;ReceiptItemBuilder&gt;` Limits our parameter to methods that return a `void` and take one parameter of type `ReceiptItemBuilder`.\r\n\r\nSo we can now declare a method that fits these criteria. Here&#39;s mine:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic void ItemWithIngredient(ReceiptItemBuilder itemBuilder)\r\n{\r\n    itemBuilder.WithIngredients(&quot;Ingredients1&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd pass to `WithItem` like so:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nWithItem(&quot;Item1&quot;, ItemWithIngredient);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this isn&#39;t of much use as we can&#39;t change the Ingredients, as we hardcoded it. So instead we us something called a anonymous method, and we define it with a lambda expression like so:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nWithItem(&quot;Item1&quot;, i =&gt; i.WithIngredients(&quot;Ingredients1&quot;));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `i =&gt; ...` part basically declares a method and uses it. `i` here is the parameter and is of type `ReceiptItemBuilder`.\r\n\r\nThis Answer is kinda rambly and I&#39;m bad at explaining things. I highly suggest you check out the Links posted in the comments by Olivier Rogier but here&#39;s a quick overview over the three standard delegate types:\r\n\r\nAction: `Action` is a method that returns a void and takes no parameters. It has some Overloads like `Action&lt;T&gt;` which represents a method with one parameter of type `T` (replace `T` with any type you want). There are more overloads for more parameters (`Action&lt;T1, T2&gt;`, `Action&lt;T1, T2, T3&gt;` ...)\r\n\r\nFunc: `Func&lt;T&gt;` is a method that returns `T` and takes no parameters (there is no `Func` as Func always returns something). There are overloads for this as well, these take parameters (`Func&lt;TInput, TOutput&gt;`, `Func&lt;TInput1, TInput2, TOutput&gt;` ...)\r\n\r\nPredicate: A `Predicate&lt;T&gt;` always takes one parameter and returns a `bool`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201517/builder-with-support-for-nested-objects/58201966#58201966","title":"Builder with support for nested objects"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10451213,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDNNy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"7oy8oy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10451213/7oy8oy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10451213,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDNNy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"7oy8oy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10451213/7oy8oy"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58201966,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570020916,"creation_date":1570019278,"last_edit_date":1570019702,"question_id":58201517,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201517","body_markdown":"I am new to C# and programming in general and was trying to find out how to implement a builder that can support nested objects when I found the following question:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38480410/builder-pattern-with-nested-objects#\r\n\r\nThe accepted solutions work but I realize I don&#39;t fully understand what is going on in the code.\r\n\r\nEspecially this part that is defining the Action:\r\n\r\n    public ReceiptBuilder WithItem(string text, Action&lt;ReceiptItemBuilder&gt; itemBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        var rib = new ReceiptItemBuilder(text);\r\n        itemBuilder(rib);\r\n        r.AddItem(rib.Build());\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWould be nice if someone could explain what happens during this call?\r\n\r\n    itemBuilder(rib);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201517/builder-with-support-for-nested-objects","title":"Builder with support for nested objects"},{"tags":["python","xgboost"],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":9816164,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d01f63fa58fab25d4476f77064f457f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Metod Jazbec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9816164/metod-jazbec"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570019276,"creation_date":1570019276,"question_id":58201516,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201516","body_markdown":"I am using `xgboost` library to train a binary classifier.

want to get data from Google Cloud through API request basically to a spreadsheet. \r\n\r\nI am not really a coder, just an analyst who is trying to automate everything. Sorry if this is a stupid question or not the best idea to be doing in the first place. Anyways, here is the issue. \r\n\r\nI use the https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ to have a look what can I get out of the google cloud files as I have just read-only access to the files there. There are Google Play data that I want to get to an automatic report somehow. \r\n\r\nI authorize API with &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only&quot; scope, then go through the &#39;Exchange authorization code for tokens&#39; and then I can have a look both at the metadata and at the file itself:\r\nThis gives me meta data:  \r\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/pubsite_prod_rev_0000000000000000/o/reviews%2Freviews_com.appid_201909.csv\r\n\r\nAdding &quot;?generation=1569963312859248&amp;alt=media&quot; shows me the contents of the csv. \r\n\r\nI wanted to make this to automatically get the data to somewhere easiest seemed to get it to a spreadsheet. So I made some code in Google App script. Code is below. I added the scope in manifest file too. \r\n  \r\n\r\n    var token = ScriptApp.getOAuthToken();\r\n    var options = {};\r\n      options.headers = {&quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer &quot;+token};\r\n      var links = UrlFetchApp.fetch(&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/pubsite_prod_rev_0000000000000000/o/reviews%2Freviews_com.appid_201909.csv?generation=1569963312859248&amp;alt=media&quot; , options);\r\n      var data =  links.getBlob().getDataAsString(&#39;utf-16le&#39;);\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weird part is that I can get the metadata completely ok, but when I try getting the data itself I get error \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Request failed for https://www.googleapis.com returned code 403.\r\n&gt; Truncated server response: &quot;Project 10000000000000 is not found and\r\n&gt; cannot be used for API calls. If it is recently created, enable Cloud\r\n&gt; Storage JSON API by visiting https://c...&quot;\r\n\r\nBut how can I look at the meta data with my API call then?\r\n\r\nAnother thing I tested - I took the access token from playground and not the function and all worked then. But I really want to make this automatic. Is it something about scopes? But I do not know what.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201468/http-request-works-on-playground-doesnt-in-google-app-scripts","title":"HTTP request works on playground doesn&#39;t in Google App scripts"},{"tags":["c#",".net","visual-studio",".net-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019176,"post_id":58201461,"comment_id":102780868,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201461/is-it-possible-to-do-a-net-core-dll-containing-net-core-framework#comment102780868_58201461"},{"owner":{"reputation":3953,"user_id":1351167,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e637a93ccd9be7552b775a07bb746494?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jAC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1351167/jac"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019197,"post_id":58201461,"comment_id":102780887,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201461/is-it-possible-to-do-a-net-core-dll-containing-net-core-framework#comment102780887_58201461"},{"owner":{"reputation":17391,"user_id":542251,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XTGKg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Liam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/542251/liam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019297,"post_id":58201461,"comment_id":102780938,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201461/is-it-possible-to-do-a-net-core-dll-containing-net-core-framework#comment102780938_58201461"},{"owner":{"reputation":10775,"user_id":463623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/36fb4daf9dbfc9dd3c3bd665fd345839?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Euphoric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/463623/euphoric"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570019377,"post_id":58201461,"comment_id":102780975,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201461/is-it-possible-to-do-a-net-core-dll-containing-net-core-framework#comment102780975_58201461"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10775,"user_id":463623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/36fb4daf9dbfc9dd3c3bd665fd345839?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Euphoric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/463623/euphoric"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570019196,"creation_date":1570019196,"answer_id":58201495,"question_id":58201461,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58201495","body_markdown":"Yes.

Within Docker http://keycloak is used as URL\r\n* Another container uses the Java Admin Client (which uses the REST API) to request data and perform changes. The URL used is the internal URL and this works fine.\r\n* Only when requesting an e-mail to be sent, the link ALWAYS displays the url which has been used by the API client even though it cannot be accessed by a normal user.\r\n\r\nWhat I want:\r\n\r\n* The url should be changed to the external url, which has been configured as root url for the client in Keycloak.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried:\r\n\r\n* Providing the client ID to the call, which did not help at all.\r\n* Modifying the email template (keycloak/themes/base/email/text/executeActions.ftl), but it generates the message and I can&#39;t do much with that.\r\n* Set up a custom RestEasyClient which set the headers (does not help)\r\n```java\r\nrequestContext.getHeaders().add(&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;, &quot;http://test.test.test&quot;);\r\nrequestContext.getHeaders().add(&quot;X-Forwarded-Host&quot;, &quot;http://test.test.test&quot;);\r\nrequestContext.getHeaders().add(&quot;Host&quot;, &quot;http://test.test.test&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo matter what, the url the users receive in their email is *http://keycloak*. If I change the url which the Java Admin Client uses to contact the rest API, the url in the email changes too. This works on my local environment but the policy on the production environment does not allow that for security reasons. I have no power to change that policy.\r\n\r\nI read that I can create a custom endpoint for the Admin REST API. I&#39;d rather avoid that if possible, because this will mean I have to reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\nI hope any of you can help.

would like to calculate an angle between two accelerometers (handled by the Linux [kxcjk-1013][1] kernel module) from a [2-in-1][2] laptop, one is located into the touchscreen and another into the

Due to the lack of ACPI event, the goal is to develop a kernel module which detects when the laptop is in tablet mode. \r\n\r\nThese are output data from the two accelerators:\r\n\r\n - touchscreen accelerometer&#39;s data: Ax1, Ay1, Az1 \r\n - keyboard accelerometer&#39;s data: Ax2, Ay2, Az2\r\n\r\nRegarding [this documentation][3] (images below extracted from page 8), the output datas are used to calculate the Roll, Pitch and Yaw rotations respectively around the x , y and z axis : \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\nBefore implementing anything, I have written a proof-of-concept in Python to calculate the rotation angles (c.f image above) of the two accelerometers and applied them respectively to two 3D vectors (one per accelerometer) then finally calculated the angle between the two vectors.\r\n\r\nI have read various documentations (focused on Euler rotation matrix and axis system rotation) but nothing has given relevant results.\r\nI am clearly novice in this field so I do no know if I need others variables to resolve it or how to use the rotation angles properly.\r\n\r\n**Question:**\r\n\r\nRegarding the rotation angles, how to calculate the angle the two accelerometers ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/iio/accel/kxcjk-1013.c#L1005\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC\r\n  [3]: https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/AN-1057.pdf\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Ca2L.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/js6aM.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201382/calculate-angle-between-two-accelerometers-in-the-same-system","title":"Calculate angle between two accelerometers in the same system"},{"tags":["linux","bash"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":57804,"user_id":2088135,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YB10Q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom Fenech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2088135/tom-fenech"},"last_editor":{"reputation":57804,"user_id":2088135,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YB10Q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom Fenech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2088135/tom-fenech"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1570019437,"last_edit_date":1570019437,"creation_date":1570018926,"answer_id":58201438,"question_id":58201378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58201438","body_markdown":"The `/` makes it look slightly more confusing than it is, but this is just an example of `${foo+bar}`, which expands to `bar` if `$foo` is set.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the variable is `$1`, the first positional parameter passed to the script or function.\r\n\r\n    example () {\r\n      echo &quot;${1+/$1}&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    example     # outputs nothing\r\n    example &#39;&#39;  # outputs &quot;/&quot;\r\n    example foo # outputs &quot;/foo&quot;\r\n\r\nThere is a table that summarises these [parameter expansions][1] in the spec.

first error as I said in comment, difference between your `Future` method and `FutureBuilder` Generics. They must be same type.\r\n\r\nAnother one is as I realize with additional error log, you are not returning any `Widget` inside some cases and default.\r\n\r\nSo do like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch (snapshot.connectionState) {\r\n                  case ConnectionState.none:\r\n                    return _defaultImage();\r\n                  case ConnectionState.waiting:\r\n                    return _connectingImage();\r\n                  case ConnectionState.done:\r\n                    if (snapshot.hasError) {\r\n                      return Text(&#39;Error:${snapshot.error}&#39;);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                      return Text(&#39;Result:${snapshot.data}&#39;);\r\n                    }\r\n                    break;\r\n                  default:\r\n                    return Card(\r\n                      child: Center(\r\n                        child: Text(&#39;No Images to Display&#39;),\r\n                      ),\r\n                    );\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: Another problem is with your edited code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase ConnectionState.done:\r\n                if (snapshot.hasError) {\r\n                  return Text(&#39;Error:${snapshot.error}&#39;);\r\n                } else {\r\n                  return Image.network( // =&gt; Change this into .network\r\n

have recently started working with MySQL as the database for my Angular/NodeJS project (I have been using MongoDB all along). Nonetheless, I&#39;m encountering issues when handling HTTP Requests. I have experimented with GET and POST requests as of now, and GET is forever pending, until failure and POST doesn&#39;t post to backend and to the database, likewise. I really hadn&#39;t changed the backend configuration from the one I used with MongoDB database, except for the queries, of course.\r\n\r\nI have tried debugging the backend to check whether the server is actually running and everything was okay. It just came to requests reaching the specified endpoints that they&#39;re always pending. I also tried to log to console if a request gets at a certain endpoint, but nothing was being logged, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nserver.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst app = require(&quot;./backend/app&quot;);\r\nconst debug = require(&quot;debug&quot;)(&quot;node-angular&quot;);\r\nconst http = require(&quot;http&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst normalisePort = setPort =&gt; {\r\n  const port = parseInt(setPort, 10);\r\n  if (isNaN(port)) return setPort;\r\n  if (port &gt;= 0) return port;\r\n  return false;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst port = normalisePort(process.env.PORT || &quot;8000&quot;);\r\nconst server = http.createServer(app);\r\n\r\nconst error = error =&gt; {\r\n  if (error.syscall !== &quot;listen&quot;) {\r\n    throw error;\r\n  }\r\n  const bind = typeof port === &quot;string&quot; ? &quot;pipe &quot; + port : &quot;port &quot; + port;\r\n  switch (error.code) {\r\n    case &quot;EACCES&quot;:\r\n      console.error(bind + &quot; requires elevated privileges&quot;);\r\n      process.exit(1);\r\n      break;\r\n    case &quot;EADDRINUSE&quot;:\r\n      console.error(bind + &quot; is already in use&quot;);\r\n      process.exit(1);\r\n      break;\r\n    default:\r\n      throw error;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst listening = () =&gt; {\r\n  const address = server.address();\r\n  const bind = typeof port === &quot;string&quot; ? &quot;pipe &quot; + address : &quot;port &quot; + port;\r\n  debug.enabled = true;\r\n  debug(&quot;Listening on &quot; + bind);\r\n};\r\n\r\napp.set(&quot;port&quot;, port);\r\nserver.on(&quot;error&quot;, error);\r\nserver.on(&quot;listening&quot;, listening);\r\nserver.listen(port, &quot;localhost&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\napp.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst express = require(&quot;express&quot;);\r\nconst bodyParser = require(&quot;body-parser&quot;);\r\nconst cors = require(&quot;cors&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst users = require(&quot;./routes/users&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\napp.use(cors);\r\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\r\napp.use(\r\n  bodyParser.urlencoded({\r\n    extended: false\r\n  })\r\n);\r\n\r\napp.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n  res.setHeader(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);\r\n  res.setHeader(\r\n    &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot;,\r\n    &quot;Origin, X-Requested-With, Authorization, Content-Type, Accept&quot;\r\n  );\r\n  res.setHeader(\r\n    &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot;,\r\n    &quot;GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS&quot;\r\n  );\r\n  next();\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get(&quot;/api/users&quot;, users);\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = app;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nusers.js\r\n```javascript\r\nconst express = require(&quot;express&quot;);\r\nconst router = express.Router();\r\nconst db = require(&quot;../sql-connection&quot;);\r\n\r\nrouter.get(&quot;&quot;, (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n  db.query(&quot;select * from users;&quot;, (error, results, fields) =&gt; {\r\n    if (results.length &gt; 0) {\r\n      return res.status(200).send(results);\r\n    } else {\r\n      return res.status(404).send();\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = router;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nsql-connection.js\r\n```javascript\r\nconst mysql = require(&quot;mysql&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst sqlConnection = mysql.createConnection({\r\n  host: &quot;localhost&quot;,\r\n  user: &quot;root&quot;,\r\n  password: &quot;&quot;,\r\n  database: &quot;payroll&quot;\r\n});\r\n\r\nsqlConnection.connect(error =&gt; {\r\n  if (error) throw error;\r\n  console.log(&quot;connected to database&quot;);\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = sqlConnection;\r\n```\r\n\r\nauth.service.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class AuthService {\r\n  private _BASE_URL: string = &quot;http://localhost:8000/api&quot;;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n  public get users(): Observable&lt;any&gt; {\r\n    return this.http.get(this._BASE_URL + &quot;/users&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nsignup.component.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class SignUpComponent {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private _authService: AuthService) {}\r\n\r\n  public onSignUp(): void {\r\n      this._authService\r\n        .users()\r\n        .subscribe(data =&gt; (data ? console.log(data) : console.log(&quot;no data&quot;)));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen subscribed to the users observable data from backend should logged to console if present, otherwise, &#39;no data&#39; is logged on the console.

have a DataGridView filled from a DataSet with one blank row at the end (because of CanUserAddRows = true by default). When I fill-in some data in that row and close the DataGridView, I check HasChanges which turns out to be false and it prevents me from updating the DataSet correctly (changing data in the existing records works as expected). Debugging it showed that that DataSet has one table with only the pre-existing (non-blank) rows, so that probably is the reason it does not detect any changes (since that blank row is/was not part of the DataSet). How to solve this problem? Maybe I have to detect somehow that the focus is in a cell from that blank row and add a new record to the DataSet. Is there an automatic way to deal with it?

I have also tried it with just the path as text without `alias`, with the same results. What other kind of location specifier could there be? Or is there some strange rule that you have to create the file in the Finder first before calling TexShop&#39;s `make new document` command?\r\n\r\n    tell application &quot;TeXShop&quot;\r\n\t\r\n\tmake new document at alias &quot;Users:jukhamil:Desktop:apples.tex&quot;\r\n\t\r\n    end tell\r\n\r\nError message:\r\n\r\n    File alias Users:jukhamil:Desktop:apples.tex wasn’t found.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201350/how-to-create-a-new-document-in-texshop","title":"How to create a new document in TexShop?"},{"tags":["flutter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2897,"user_id":2179571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fcad62ab1dbdbe21b0956c80fdffa2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chunhunghan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2179571/chunhunghan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570066485,"post_id":58201345,"comment_id":102799835,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201345/problem-when-fetching-json-data-from-internet-in-flutter#comment102799835_58201345"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":5666202,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208639209801706/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fernando Rocha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5666202/fernando-rocha"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570021829,"creation_date":1570021829,"answer_id":58202238,"question_id":58201345,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58202238","body_markdown":"What&#39;s going on is that ```data[&quot;data&quot;]``` is a Map and not a List.\r\nTry changing the type to Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt; as said on your error log.\r\n\r\nCan your please try the following?\r\n\r\n```import &#39;package:flutter/material.dart&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;dart:async&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;package:http/http.dart&#39; as http;\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Message extends StatefulWidget {\r\n  @override\r\n  _MessageState createState() =&gt; _MessageState();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass _MessageState extends State&lt;Message&gt; {\r\n  Map data;\r\n  Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt; userData;\r\n  Future getData() async\r\n  {\r\n    http.Response response = await http.get(&#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users&#39;);\r\n\r\n    data = json.decode(response.body);\r\n\r\n    setState(() {\r\n     userData = data[&quot;data&quot;];\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @override\r\n  void initState(){\r\n    super.initState();\r\n    getData();\r\n  }\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return Container(\r\n          child:ListView.builder\r\n          (\r\n            shrinkWrap: true,\r\n            itemCount: userData == null ? 0 : userData.length,\r\n              itemBuilder:(BuildContext context, int index){\r\n                return Row(\r\n                  children:&lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                    Text(&#39;${userData[userData.keys.toList()[index]][&quot;username&quot;]}&#39;, style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600, fontSize: 20),),\r\n                    Text(&#39;${userData[userData.keys.toList()[index]][&quot;catchPhrase&quot;]}&#39;,style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w500, fontSize: 17),),\r\n                    Icon(Icons.navigate_next)\r\n                  ]);\r\n              }\r\n\r\n          )\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201345/problem-when-fetching-json-data-from-internet-in-flutter/58202238#58202238","title":"Problem when fetching json data from internet in flutter"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2516,"user_id":1367159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0948486caa48785f80dfd5c673de6d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sukhi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1367159/sukhi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570022432,"creation_date":1570022432,"answer_id":58202419,"question_id":58201345,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58202419","body_markdown":"This is how you do it :\r\n\r\n1.

I&#39;ve written the SQL query so that when a new entry is inserted, the ID value will be autogenerated as: the maximum existing value in the database + 1. See code below:\r\n\r\n     using (var con = _connFactory())\r\n                {\r\n                    con.Open();\r\n                    con.Execute(@&quot;INSERT INTO dbo.Recipe (Id, Name, RecipeLink, Category1Id ,Category2Id, Category3Id, Category4Id, RecipeById,\r\n                                TotalTime, TotalTimeUnitId, ActiveTime, ActivetimeUnitId, Instructions, SourceKey, RecipeBy, InsertedAtUtc, IsVerified, NumPersons, ServingsUnitId, ServingsUnitOrig) \r\n                                VALUES ((SELECT MAX(ID) + 1 FROM dbo.Recipe), @name, @recipeLink, @category1Id, @category2Id, @category3Id, @category4Id, @recipeById,\r\n                                @totalTime, @totalTimeUnitId, @activeTime, @activeTimeUnitId, @instructions, @sourceKey, @recipeBy, getutcdate(), @isVerified, @numPersons, @servingsUnitId, @servingsUnitOrig)&quot;,\r\n                                new\r\n                                {\r\n                                    ...\r\n                                    ...\r\n                                });\r\n                }\r\n\r\nWhen I send the request to the API using Postman, the returned result will be the newly created object that has been passed to the database. However, though, because of the way that my ID is created, the returned JSON looks like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n    &quot;id&quot;: 0,\r\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test Recipe2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;recipeLink&quot;: &quot;testlink&quot;,\r\n    &quot;category1Id&quot;: 7757,\r\n    ...\r\n    &quot;servingsUnitId&quot;: 3,\r\n    &quot;servingsUnitOrig&quot;: null\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the ID is 0. But if I try to get the object after this, the ID will be set to the proper one, the one generated from `(SELECT MAX(ID) + 1 FROM dbo.Recipe)`. \r\n\r\nIs there any way in which I can make the API return the correct ID after the execution of the `INSERT INTO`? Or how should I change the logic behind the auto generation in order to achieve this? \r\n\r\nIt will come quite in handy if I was able to get the ID&#39;s value directly as now I&#39;ve made a method that returns the ID of the latest Recipe created. But that might be a problem in case that there are 2 recipes created in a short period of time.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201328/id-variable-not-shown-after-creating-object-and-passing-it-to-database","title":"ID variable not shown after creating object and passing it to database"},{"tags":["php","mysql","laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570018757,"post_id":58201326,"comment_id":102780640,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201326/how-to-filter-by-min-max-values-from-comma-separated-field-in-mysql-laravel-with#comment102780640_58201326"},{"owner":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570018774,"post_id":58201326,"comment_id":102780647,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201326/how-to-filter-by-min-max-values-from-comma-separated-field-in-mysql-laravel-with#comment102780647_58201326"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12153614,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdbd395d224e73307a24c944b1e00f94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tamil Jackson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12153614/tamil-jackson"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019258,"post_id":58201326,"comment_id":102780912,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201326/how-to-filter-by-min-max-values-from-comma-separated-field-in-mysql-laravel-with#comment102780912_58201326"},{"owner":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019510,"post_id":58201326,"comment_id":102781036,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201326/how-to-filter-by-min-max-values-from-comma-separated-field-in-mysql-laravel-with#comment102781036_58201326"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12153614,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdbd395d224e73307a24c944b1e00f94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tamil Jackson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12153614/tamil-jackson"},"last_editor":{"reputation":768,"user_id":7166136,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyCwL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shaheryar.Akram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7166136/shaheryar-akram"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570019113,"creation_date":1570018517,"last_edit_date":1570019113,"question_id":58201326,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201326","body_markdown":"I want to filter product table having min and max limit with price.

This row is visible only for the transaction that performed this operation, and not visible to other transactions (if they use the default “read committed” isolation level). After implicit (due to auto-commit) or explicit manual commit the inserted row becomes visible for all transactions. If you rollback the transaction instead of commit, the row disappears.\r\n\r\nOther data modification operations work in the same way. Uncommitted changes are visible only to the transaction that performed them, committed changes are visible for everyone.\r\n\r\nThere are different isolation levels for transactions, but the default storage engine of H2 doesn&#39;t support them yet in 1.4.199 (such support is included in 1.4.200).\r\n\r\nEach JDBC connection has own session and this session has own transaction.

Then, you can return `Observables` from your Retrofit Client, which makes your life way easier when it comes to chaining different calls (using `flatMap` operator for example).\r\n\r\nFor handling the token authentication logic that you mention, I would do it using a custom [OkHttp3 Authenticator][2]. That way, you can place all the authentication logic (that will probably be used in almost all your API calls) in one single place and OkHttp will call the logic defined to renew your tokens every time it gets a 401 response. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CustomOkHttpAuthenticator implements Authenticator {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Request authenticate(@NonNull Route route, @NonNull okhttp3.Response response) throws IOException {\r\n        if (response.code() == 401) {\r\n          // Call your refresh token endpoint, wait for the new token, and build\r\n          // again the original request using the new token you received.\r\n        }\r\n        return null;\r\n    }`\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, when creating your OkHttp client, that Retrofit will use to perform the HTTP calls, make sure to add your custom `Authenticator`\r\n\r\n```java\r\nOkHttpClient.Builder client = new OkHttpClient.Builder();\r\n        client.connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n        client.readTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n        client.writeTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n        ...\r\n        client.authenticator(new CustomOkHttpAuthenticator());\r\n        OkHttpClient okHttpClient = client.build();\r\n        okHttpClientHolder.setOkHttpClient(okHttpClient);\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can check a complete code example in [this repository][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-adapters/rxjava2\r\n  [2]: https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-authenticator/\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/dglozano/escale-mobile/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/dglozano/escale/web/CustomOkHttpAuthenticator.java","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201302/how-to-conditionally-chain-several-retrofit-calls/58201718#58201718","title":"How to conditionally chain several Retrofit calls?"}],"owner":{"reputation":225,"user_id":700998,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11aa7bccdf5452bee9c3836bcc4b0917?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nicks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/700998/nicks"},"last_editor":{"reputation":413,"user_id":10584549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nieo1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jawad Malik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10584549/jawad-malik"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570025324,"creation_date":1570018448,"last_edit_date":1570019021,"question_id":58201302,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201302","body_markdown":"I have an api at `http:/some.api` and a `GET` endpoint `data` which requires authentication through bearer token received through `POST` `auth` endpoint. The given security token is expired every 1 hour so I need to make a `POST http:/some.api/auth` request in case I receive 401 on `GET http:/some.api/data`, renew access token and make the same call to `data` with the new access token without my client knowing anything about it. Current examples provide the `Call` type which I can `enqueue` (call) from the UI thread without it stopping, something analogous to `.net`&#39;s `async/await` feature. Now, if I were using `.net`, I would wrap up the the whole logic and it would look like this:\r\n\r\n    async Task&lt;DataModel&gt; GetDataAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            return await GetDataInternalAsync();\r\n        }\r\n        catch(InvalidTokenException)\r\n        {\r\n            await ReAuthenticateAsync();\r\n            return await GetDataInternalAsync();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand call `await GetDataAsync()` from the UI thread without worries. However, current examples only show how to make a call and handle results &quot;on spot&quot; from the calling method, for example:\r\n\r\n    Call&lt;DataModel&gt; call = apiService.getData();  \r\n    call.enqueue(new Callback&lt;DataModel&gt;() {  \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onResponse(Call&lt;DataModel&gt; call, Response&lt;DataModel&gt; response) {\r\n            // todo deal with returned data. what if it is 401 and i need to make the same request after making the request to auth?\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void onFailure(Call&lt;DataModel&gt; call, Throwable t) {\r\n            // todo deal with the failed network request\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nWhat would be the way to organize calls architecture for my needs using Retrofit?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201302/how-to-conditionally-chain-several-retrofit-calls","title":"How to conditionally chain several Retrofit calls?"},{"tags":["linux","systemd","systemctl"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12153631,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b4f5ea5e1c41401539dc10b88b2049a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Febi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12153631/febi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2447,"user_id":2343305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kNEA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IlGala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2343305/ilgala"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570026214,"creation_date":1570018438,"last_edit_date":1570026214,"question_id":58201300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201300","body_markdown":"I am migrating http service from Centos 6 to Centos 7, I have the following config in my sysconfig file and based on service httpd `start/restart/condrestart` I will do certain actions.

have a problem and very strange behavior with autofill in Chrome. When I login and then logout from app, input fields (email, password) were autocompleted but fields looks like they are frozen and not clickable.\r\n\r\nThis bug is not every time reproduced, it happens in 1/10 cases.\r\nI noticed on logout when fields get autocompleted, after 1 seconds font gets smaller in inputs and after that if you click on input there it seems like you are not clicking , nothing happens, but if you type some text (numbers not work, stays like frozen) input field goes as normal.\r\n\r\nHere is gif with strange behavior: \r\nhttps://gifyu.com/image/kTkX\r\n\r\nI tried to set `autocomplete=&quot;off&quot;` , but not working.\r\n\r\nAlso I matched all css clases in input fields to see is there some overriding css, but everything looks good. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;form [formGroup]=&quot;loginForm&quot;&gt;\r\n                   \r\n&lt;input id=&quot;emailHeader&quot;

(f2 ...)) ;; &lt;-- test\r\n           ... ;; &lt;-- code\r\n          ) ;; end of first clause\r\n        ) ;; end of cond\r\n\r\n    But note that you do not need to put comments for closing delimiters, the indentation and the automatic highlighting of parentheses should help you avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s try a rewrite.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you can write a function that just compares numbers, not thinking about lists or formatting; here is a very straightforward `max-of-3` implementation (without cheating and calling the built-in `max` function):\r\n\r\n    (defun max-of-3 (x y z)\r\n      (if (&gt; x y)\r\n          (if (&gt; x z) x z)\r\n          (if (&gt; y z) y z)))\r\n\r\nEvaluate the function, and test it on multiple inputs, for example in the REPL:\r\n\r\n    CL-USER&gt; (max-of-3 0 2 1)\r\n    2\r\n    ....\r\n\r\nThen, you can build up the other function, for your list:\r\n\r\n    (defun test (list)\r\n       (format t \r\n               &quot;numero maximo ~d&quot;\r\n               (max-of-3 (first list)\r\n                         (second list)\r\n                         (third list))))\r\n\r\nIf you need to do more error checking ahead of time, like checking that the lists is well-formed, you should probably define other auxiliary functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201271/get-the-maximum-value-of-a-list-with-three-numbers/58201683#58201683","title":"Get the maximum value of a list with three numbers"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":5306906,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6faf090959206b4edb97b00470d0d7ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"R&#250;ben Dias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5306906/r%c3%baben-dias"},"last_editor":{"reputation":116825,"user_id":69545,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXXbv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rainer Joswig","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/69545/rainer-joswig"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58201683,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570072190,"creation_date":1570018332,"last_edit_date":1570072190,"question_id":58201271,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201271","body_markdown":"I&#39;m learning Lisp now, and I&#39;m trying to do an exercise that asks me to get the maximum value of a list, the syntax is totally different from most programming languages I&#39;ve learned, so I&#39;m having some difficulties.\r\n\r\nMy code:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n     (defun test(y)\r\n         (cond\r\n              ((and (first y) (&gt; (second y)) (&gt; (third y))) \r\n        \t(format t &quot;numero maximo ~d&quot; (first y))\r\n              ((and (second y) (&gt; (first y)) (&gt; (third y))) \r\n        \t(t (format t &quot;numero maximo ~d&quot; (second y))\r\n              ((and (third y) (&gt; (second y)) (&gt; (first y))) \r\n        \t(t (format t &quot;numero maximo ~d&quot; (third y))\r\n        ))\r\n\r\nI&#39;m receiving this error: `incomplete s-expression in region`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201271/get-the-maximum-value-of-a-list-with-three-numbers","title":"Get the maximum value of a list with three numbers"},{"tags":["mnist","autoencoder","deconvolution","matconvnet"],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":5414880,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153600596904641/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ahmet G&#246;khan Poyraz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5414880/ahmet-g%c3%b6khan-poyraz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570018327,"creation_date":1570018327,"question_id":58201269,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201269","body_markdown":"\r\nI am trying to train mnist for convolutional autoencoder(CAE) using matconvnet.
