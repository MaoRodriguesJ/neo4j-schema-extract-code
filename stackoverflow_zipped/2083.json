The main issue: To grant access rights to any other APIs than basic Google data I can either set up an internal project (already tried, either I did something wrong or it just doesn&#39;t work the way I want to use it) or a public project wich require a few things like terms of use, privacy policy, project page and such.\r\nAs I already tried to set up an organization I got into trouble to migrate my project to the organization. And when try to use the organization account I get an error message when access YouTube state that YouTube can&#39;t be used with an organization account.\r\n\r\nA bit more background about my project:\r\nI planed to develope a small live stream encoder using YouTube API to automatic set up a new live event and to also get into the live chat (as I&#39;m not that popular the usage constraint is way more than enough for my use). As I didn&#39;t managed to get an encoder to work, I scraped this idea.\r\nAt that time, I got it only to work by I guess accident or delay or something as I just set up a login with access to YouTube API without provide the required things like project page, tos, privacy, etc. I got a token and could login using Java client (as I didn&#39;t setup a relay on my server I used to auth method where a token is displayed by Google wich one enter in the client wich then creates the auth token - pretty straight forward and documented).\r\nAs for obvious reasons, Google didn&#39;t allowed using thier API this way and quickly took down the project. As I asked how to do it the right way I got pointed to use an internal project. So, I tried to follow the documented way to set up an organization account, somehow managed to link both accounts (only once, as I retried it I didn&#39;t got it to work again) and had set the project set to internal. But as I then tried to use it I couldn&#39;t log in with my private account as I got the error message that, although both accounts where at least somewhat linked so I could transfer the project, my private account wasn&#39;t part of the organization and hence I couldn&#39;t access the internal project. When I tried to login with the organization account I got the error that I can&#39;t use YouTube with that type of corporate account.\r\nSo, either usage isn&#39;t possible that way or I did some obvious wrong.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, yes, I may could set up the required information, but I don&#39;t know what&#39;s needed to convince Google to accept a public project wich states is for internal use only. I could add some information right at the begin that, if someone isn&#39;t part of my non existing internal developer team one shouldn&#39;t use it (although noone should get access anyway as the code and references will only be used by myself and I won&#39;t spread it around).\r\nDoes anyone have experience with using a public project in a private account to access YouTube API?\r\nAs I tried to contact Google support directly once I only got redirected to corporate support as I asked with the organization account - I don&#39;t know if I didn&#39;t expressed myself understandably or if the supporter got my question wrong.\r\n\r\nIf any more information needed just ask - btw: that&#39;s my first time using SO - so appologies if this should be asked in any other way. Sadly Google only redirects here instead of some community forum of some sort.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n//edit\r\nIn addition: I tried to use an api-key, but I get 401 errors state not properly authorized for most requests. So I guess using OAuth is needed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045836/can-i-create-an-internal-project-for-private-youtube-account-without-set-up-an-o","title":"Can I create an internal project for private YouTube account without set up an organization?"},{"tags":["opencv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569147092,"post_id":58045834,"comment_id":102495032,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045834/how-to-detect-black-color-percentage-from-the-image-in-every-rectangle-section-u#comment102495032_58045834"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7759946,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2hMWYXiGkzE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI8/0irLYtEudCw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lim Weihan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7759946/lim-weihan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569159117,"post_id":58045834,"comment_id":102497774,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045834/how-to-detect-black-color-percentage-from-the-image-in-every-rectangle-section-u#comment102497774_58045834"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7759946,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2hMWYXiGkzE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI8/0irLYtEudCw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lim Weihan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7759946/lim-weihan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7759946,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2hMWYXiGkzE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI8/0irLYtEudCw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lim Weihan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7759946/lim-weihan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569124026,"creation_date":1569123635,"last_edit_date":1569124026,"question_id":58045834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045834","body_markdown":"[Image][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/74uIJ.png\r\n\r\n(Newbie Post) I am new in opencv and i wanna to ask a question, how can i detect the black color percentage from the image in every rectangle section, my final goal is i want to show their own black color percentage in the rectangle section respectively.

But why does the whole program crash instead of that single thread?\r\n\r\nthis is by design. if nobody (debugger if attached and process itself) can not handle user mode exception - system terminate process. and this is logical - all resources was per process, not per thread. after unhandled exception happens - process probably in unstable/corrupted state. and new exceptions will be or hang - thread can for example own some critical section or another resource at exception time - if simply terminate thread in this point - resource will be always busy by died thread. and when another thread try enter to this &quot;critical section&quot; (in wide sense) - they hang forever. (say heap critical section). so better just terminate process instead got new exceptions and undefined behavior in process. \r\n\r\nby same reason - if unhandled exception was in kernel mode - system terminate self and try create BSOD. because after unhandled exception in kernel - all system in unstable state. and simply terminate buggy thread - not a solution.\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there any way to make only the current thread exit, not the whole\r\n&gt; program (on windows using winapi)?\r\n\r\n\r\nformally yes. and easy - you can set [`UnhandledExceptionFilter`][1]  by [`SetUnhandledExceptionFilter`][2] function and inside [`UnhandledExceptionFilter`][1] simply call [`TerminateThread`][3] for current thread ( [`GetCurrentThread()`][4] ) because\r\n\r\n&gt; The exception handler specified by lpTopLevelExceptionFilter is\r\n&gt; executed in the context of the thread that caused the fault.\r\n\r\nalso note that this callback called only if process is not being debugged. \r\n\r\nhowever - this is not solution - terminate thread. solution - must not be exceptions in your process or you need handle it. if you can not - process must died.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-unhandledexceptionfilter\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-setunhandledexceptionfilter\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-terminatethread\r\n  [4]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getcurrentthread","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045829/why-does-a-single-thread-exception-crash-entire-program-how-to-prevent-this/58052632#58052632","title":"Why does a single thread exception crash entire program (how to prevent this?)"}],"owner":{"reputation":151,"user_id":10504230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f182ffcbc650ac1cad7fb749069e030e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arush Agarampur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10504230/arush-agarampur"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58052632,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569179757,"creation_date":1569123495,"question_id":58045829,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045829","body_markdown":"If I run, for example,\r\n\r\n    int x = *(0x00000);\r\n\r\nThe program crashes.

With jlink 11.0.4, which comes with open-jdk-11 on Ubuntu, the image built with this custom JRE is actually larger than what it would be with a default JRE. I think this is due to a very large size of cutom_jre/lib/server/libjvm.so\r\n\r\nI am following Kubernetes for Java Developers from Arun Gupta on Linkedin Learning. At some point, I have noticed a strange behaviour on my Ubuntu instance. Along with this course, I needed to provide a custom JRE to a minimal Spring Boot application, in order to use it for a slim Docker image.\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\njlink \\\r\n--output myjre \\\r\n--add-modules $(jdeps --print-module-deps target/greeting.jar),\\\r\njava.xml,jdk.unsupported,java.sql,java.naming,java.desktop,\\\r\njava.management,java.security.jgss,java.instrument \\\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach worked fine in the course and the size of `my_jre` was fit to build a minimal Docker image for the application. The problem is that in my setup I have used openjdk-11, rather than openjdk-9.\r\n\r\nWith my setup, the resulting size of `my_jre` would be very large(~380mb). After some investigation, I found out that this was mainly and possibly only due to the large size of `my_jre/lib/server/libjvm.so`.\r\n\r\nI have not had any prior experience with `jlink` before this attempt. After some trial and error, and browsing through similar issues on github, I have found a workaround which comes outside of the jlink functionality.\r\n\r\nThis workaround comes from the [binutils](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/) package and the [strip](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/strip.html) utility.\r\n\r\nRunning the `strip` utility with the `--strip-unneeded` flag would slim down the libjvm.so size and make possible the achievement of the primary goal: providing a minimal JRE(~113mb) for a slim Docker image.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nstrip -p --strip-unneeded myjre/lib/server/libjvm.so\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would appreciate a deeper explanation about the background of this flair from someone who has the knowledge. Also what did change from jdk9 to jdk11 in terms of this behavior?

am trying to write a React Native version of this module https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Cordova-Plugin\r\n\r\nIt is deprecated, but until we can transition to Braintree, we need the functionality for an existing app.\r\n\r\nIt has a dependency:\r\n\r\n    repositories{\r\n      mavenCentral()\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    dependencies {\r\n

for the React Native app, but when I go there, I see this:\r\n\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        classpath(&quot;com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.1&quot;)\r\n    \r\n        // NOTE: Do not place

which I do - the same as the one above (com.paypal.sdk...)\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn&#39;t seem to be registering.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to indicate to download this dependency?

So in addition to clobbering your intended logic, they also always evaluate to `true`. You should instead be using a comparison operator, something like `i &gt;= 30` and `j &gt;= 30`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, **you shouldn&#39;t call API methods such as `getRange()`, `getValue()`, `setValue()` within for loops**. These operations are slow and will cause the script to take a long time to complete.\r\n\r\nYou should [use batch operations](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/best-practices#use_batch_operations) to get/set the entire range of cells you&#39;d like to update in as few API calls as possible.\r\n\r\nIn your case, since you&#39;re not processing the data, **you have no need to actually loop through the data**.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an implementation that performs the move you described:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction moveCells() {\r\n  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();\r\n\r\n  var startingColumn = 5;  // Column E\r\n  var startingRow = 2;  // Row 2\r\n  var numColumns = 17;  // to Column U\r\n  var numRows = 29;  // to Row 30\r\n\r\n  // Get the source range which contains the data.\r\n  var sourceRange = sheet.getRange(startingRow, startingColumn, numRows, numColumns);\r\n\r\n  // Get the target range (i.e. same size as sourceRange, but starting one column\r\n  // to the left).\r\n  var targetRange = sheet.getRange(startingRow, startingColumn - 1, numRows, numColumns);\r\n\r\n  // Get all of the values from sourceRange into a 2-dimensional array.\r\n  var values = sourceRange.getValues();\r\n\r\n  // Clear all of the cells in sourceRange.\r\n  sourceRange.clearContent();\r\n\r\n  // Set the cell values targetRange, using the values extracted from sourceRange.\r\n  targetRange.setValues(values);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I&#39;m using the [4 argument version of `getRange()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet.html#getRange(Integer,Integer,Integer,Integer)), which allows you to work with a grid of cells. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, I&#39;m using [`getValues()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range.html#getvalues) and [`setValues()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range.html#setValues(Object)), which allows you to get and set the entire grid of cells in one operation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045783/updating-a-range-of-cells-in-google-sheets-when-one-cell-is-changed-using/58046132#58046132","title":"Updating a range of cells in google sheets when one cell is changed using"}],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":11610467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05f58eb2f696765c2d32a05daca97d14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jlmscad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11610467/jlmscad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3187,"user_id":373815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vBPZK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chuckx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/373815/chuckx"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569128658,"creation_date":1569122766,"last_edit_date":1569126210,"question_id":58045783,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045783","body_markdown":"Using JavaScript, I want to update a range of cells in Google Sheets.\r\nThe code doesn&#39;t throw any error, but doesn&#39;t work either.\r\n\r\n    function OnEditDate(e){    \r\n        var app = SpreadsheetApp;

Ideally, the cacheable responses should be picked based on the status code. I just created a [feature improvement request][1].\r\n\r\nHowever, this is already supported by the runtime, only the UI is missing it. \r\n\r\nSo you can make this working by changing a configuration file. \r\n\r\nFor that, open `repository/resources/api_templates/velocity_template.xml` and search for `&lt;cache scope=&quot;per-host&quot; collector=&quot;false&quot;`. (Note `collector=false`) \r\n\r\nThen, add the `&lt;protocol&gt;` tag just above the `&lt;implementation&gt;` tag like this.\r\n\r\n    &lt;cache scope=&quot;per-host&quot; collector=&quot;false&quot; hashGenerator=&quot;org.wso2.carbon.mediator.cache.digest.REQUESTHASHGenerator&quot; timeout=&quot;$!responseCacheTimeOut&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;protocol type=&quot;HTTP&quot;&gt;\r\n           &lt;methods&gt;*&lt;/methods&gt;\r\n           &lt;headersToExcludeInHash/&gt;\r\n           &lt;responseCodes&gt;2[0-9][0-0]&lt;/responseCodes&gt;\r\n           &lt;enableCacheControl&gt;false&lt;/enableCacheControl&gt;\r\n           &lt;includeAgeHeader&gt;false&lt;/includeAgeHeader&gt;\r\n           &lt;hashGenerator&gt;org.wso2.carbon.mediator.cache.digest.REQUESTHASHGenerator&lt;/hashGenerator&gt;\r\n        &lt;/protocol&gt;\r\n        &lt;implementation type=&quot;memory&quot; maxSize=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/cache&gt;\r\n\r\nNote the regex for 2xx responses in `responseCodes`. I hope this answers your 1st question.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRegarding the key caches, yes, there are caches at both gateway and keymanager.

I have started with WSO2. Now I learned that WSO2 has a caching feature at different places. Two of them is at Key Manager caches Keys and Response Caching.\r\n\r\nMy question is very simple (naive), that if we are caching wrong Response, we will get the response again.\r\nFor example: \r\nI hit this dummy API request `http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees` which supposed to give a list of employees, but it gives me null or something else. Now, this response is cached in response cache, which means I will keep on getting null. Which is wrong. Caching makes sense, but it is caching all responses, wrong and right.

inherited a Laravel 5.4 project. Upgrading isn&#39;t an option and neither is a large scale rewrite so I&#39;m stuck with what I&#39;ve got. I have an eloquent collection that looks as follows when fetched from the database and simplified:\r\n\r\n**`$orders`**\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    &quot;item&quot;: Item 1,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: 3,\r\n    &quot;qty&quot;: 2,\r\n    &quot;hotlist&quot;: null\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    &quot;item&quot;: Item 1,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: 4,\r\n    &quot;qty&quot;: 5,\r\n    &quot;hotlist&quot;: null\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    &quot;item&quot;: Item 1,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: 3,\r\n    &quot;qty&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;hotlist&quot;: true\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    &quot;item&quot;: Item 1,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: 3,\r\n    &quot;qty&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;hotlist&quot;: null\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```\r\nThere are obviously more than 1 item but this will show what I&#39;m more or less working with and what I need to accomplish. I&#39;m attempting to give a report of items. If they are the same item, in the same status, and not on the hotlist they should be 1 line item with the total quantity. Using the above example I need an output like this example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    &quot;item&quot;: Item 1,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: 3,\r\n    &quot;qty&quot;: 3,\r\n    &quot;hotlist&quot;: null\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    &quot;item&quot;: Item 1,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: 4,\r\n    &quot;qty&quot;: 5,\r\n    &quot;hotlist&quot;: null\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    &quot;item&quot;: Item 1,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: 3,\r\n    &quot;qty&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;hotlist&quot;: true\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only change is is the quantity of the first and last item have been summed and the duplicate item removed. I&#39;ve come close using the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$orders-&gt;groupBy(&#39;item&#39;)-&gt;flatMap(function ($items) {\r\n  $quantity = $items-&gt;sum(&#39;qty&#39;);\r\n  return $items-&gt;map(function ($item) use ($quantity) {\r\n\t $item-&gt;qty = $quantity;\r\n\t return $item;\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously however it only takes into account the item name is the same then sums it, but I also need to verify the list and status. I&#39;ve been banging my head against the wall with this one so I feel like it&#39;s got to be something simple I&#39;m overlooking. Hopefully somebody can see what I&#39;m missing.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045717/merging-duplicates-and-summing-field-in-a-multidimensional-collection-in-laravel","title":"Merging duplicates and summing field in a multidimensional collection in Laravel 5.4"},{"tags":["c","pointers","void"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2025,"user_id":11498773,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJFL4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mihir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11498773/mihir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569121884,"post_id":58045716,"comment_id":102491100,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045716/printing-variable-type-struct-elements#comment102491100_58045716"},{"owner":{"reputation":80461,"user_id":775806,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XNd2C.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"n.m.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/775806/n-m"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569122438,"post_id":58045716,"comment_id":102491177,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045716/printing-variable-type-struct-elements#comment102491177_58045716"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569248894,"post_id":58045716,"comment_id":102525625,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045716/printing-variable-type-struct-elements#comment102525625_58045716"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569249063,"post_id":58045716,"comment_id":102525704,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045716/printing-variable-type-struct-elements#comment102525704_58045716"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2025,"user_id":11498773,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJFL4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mihir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11498773/mihir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2025,"user_id":11498773,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJFL4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mihir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11498773/mihir"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569123346,"last_edit_date":1569123346,"creation_date":1569122716,"answer_id":58045778,"question_id":58045716,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58045778","body_markdown":"````\r\nprintf(&quot;Struct2: {value: %d | type: %d}\\n&quot;, *((int *) val3.value), val3.type);\r\n````\r\nThis should do the job.\r\n\r\nA `void *` holds an address of any type.

But you&#39;ll have to access it from the [`Scheduler`](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#schedule.Scheduler) *instance object* that&#39;s running your job. What you did was access it from the `Scheduler` *class* itself.\r\n\r\nRather than track down the `Scheduler` instance, just use the available API:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nschedule.every(1).minutes.do(Job)\r\n\r\nwhile True:\r\n    schedule.run_pending()\r\n    time.sleep(1)\r\n    time_of_next_run = schedule.next_run()\r\n    print(type(time_of_next_run))  # &lt;class &#39;datetime.datetime&#39;&gt;\r\n    print(time_of_next_run)        # 2019-09-22 13:48:06.566073\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNow to get the remaining time, you just need to get the difference between the date/time now and date/time when the next job will be run. Python&#39;s [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module supports simple subtraction and returns a [`timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects) object:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwhile True:\r\n    schedule.run_pending()\r\n    time.sleep(1)\r\n    time_of_next_run = schedule.next_run()\r\n    time_now = datetime.now()\r\n    time_remaining = time_of_next_run - time_now\r\n    print(time_remaining)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will print something like:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n0:00:58.994702\r\n0:00:57.994054\r\n0:00:56.989839\r\n0:00:55.987161\r\n0:00:54.982645\r\n0:00:53.980167\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake a look at the `datetime` and `timedelta` for more formatting options.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(f&quot;{time_remaining.seconds} seconds left..&quot;)  # 58 seconds left..\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045668/getting-the-remaining-time-for-the-next-job-to-be-executed-in-schedule-package/58046162#58046162","title":"Getting the remaining time for the next job to be executed in schedule package?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11489010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fbe475a062d1843d43f426ec2e97896?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mfjones","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11489010/mfjones"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3992,"user_id":2745495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bbcd267235bab78ec6710ef6654ba87?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gino Mempin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2745495/gino-mempin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569128395,"creation_date":1569120947,"last_edit_date":1569128395,"question_id":58045668,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045668","body_markdown":"I am trying to print the remaining time for the next job.

requirement to check for an exception requires the caller to trap and handle the exception, cluttering their code and also imposing a processing overhead to handling the exception.\r\n\r\nThere are some other ways you can return without raising an exception.\r\n\r\n - The factorial of a number can&#39;t be zero or negative, so you can return 0 or a negative integer (i.e. a &quot;magic number&quot;) to indicate that the factorial does not exist or could not be found. Similarly, if the input is too large to calculate a factorial within the range of an `int`, you can return this invalid value as well, or set the specific value to something that indicates the failure mode (e.g. 0 means input negative, -1 means input too large, -2 means any other exception).\r\n - You can change your method signature to return a *pointer* to an `int`, and set the logic to return `NULL` to indicate no result (C code was classically filled with &quot;check for null after the call to make sure it succeeded&quot; logic). If you find the factorial, return a pointer to an `int` holding that value, created on the heap using `new`.\r\n - You can accept a `short int` as the input parameter, eliminating many (but not all) input values whose factorial is too large to fit the return value. This won&#39;t fix things completely, but every bit helps. Combined with another method, you can reduce potential failure modes even further.\r\n\r\nThe first option above can be graceful, since it allows the caller to *consume* the value in many ways (e.g. printing it, using it in a further math operation) without feeding in something that is non-numeric or failing to have a number to deal with. The downside is that you can end up with a meaningless number. It&#39;s better in some contexts to output &quot;Number of floors in building: -1, Cost: $-1&quot; than to crash right in the middle of an important demo! A similar situation (invalid in terms of business rules but able to be processed data, in that case a pointer) produced the famous Minus World bug in Super Mario Bros.!\r\n\r\nThe last value is even more graceful, since it helps prevent invalid data from even *getting* to the function. As they say, Garbage In, Garbage Out.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045653/what-are-the-alternatives-to-throwing-an-exception-in-c/58045679#58045679","title":"What are the alternatives to throwing an exception in C++"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":4031302,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wBIf1x_T5xo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/XDSw4PKf9-k/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MSS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4031302/mss"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58045679,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569124301,"creation_date":1569120831,"question_id":58045653,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045653","body_markdown":"I recently interviewed with a company for an internship.

Now brad pitt himself would have a number 0 so \r\nthe case statement, `CASE when pa.name = &#39;Brad Pitt&#39; then 0` would create another column and assign 0 whenever brad pitt comes up, but I&#39;m not really how to come up with the logic to assign 1  and 2 to actors who have acted directly with brad and acted with actors who&#39;ve worked with him respectively.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate your insights on this question ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045639/imdb-dataset-find-the-brad-pitt-number-of-an-actor","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"IMDB dataset : Find the Brad pitt number of an actor"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13818,"user_id":494134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ca0f8158fe405abdbf211622853bb3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gordon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/494134/john-gordon"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569120973,"post_id":58045638,"comment_id":102490987,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045638/why-are-elements-in-my-list-being-turned-into-none#comment102490987_58045638"},{"owner":{"reputation":18631,"user_id":8472377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7BpS7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Austin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8472377/austin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569120975,"post_id":58045638,"comment_id":102490989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045638/why-are-elements-in-my-list-being-turned-into-none#comment102490989_58045638"},{"owner":{"reputation":13818,"user_id":494134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ca0f8158fe405abdbf211622853bb3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gordon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/494134/john-gordon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569121179,"post_id":58045638,"comment_id":102491011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045638/why-are-elements-in-my-list-being-turned-into-none#comment102491011_58045638"},{"owner":{"reputation":2150,"user_id":212514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4ea69157590ddaa2363dd9ad4d7c7d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user212514","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/212514/user212514"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13818,"user_id":494134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ca0f8158fe405abdbf211622853bb3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gordon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/494134/john-gordon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569121328,"post_id":58045638,"comment_id":102491031,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045638/why-are-elements-in-my-list-being-turned-into-none#comment102491031_58045638"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4571,"user_id":5770501,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FUVQn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arkistarvh Kltzuonstev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5770501/arkistarvh-kltzuonstev"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569121522,"creation_date":1569121522,"answer_id":58045714,"question_id":58045638,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58045714","body_markdown":"Try this :\r\n\r\n    l = [1,3,5,7,9]\r\n    m = [l[:],l[:]]\r\n    for i in range(len(l)):\r\n        for j in range(len(l)):\r\n            if i != j:\r\n                summ = l[i] + l[j]\r\n                m[0][i] = summ\r\n                m[1][j] = summ\r\n    print(m)\r\n    #

Well you can but its messy.\n\nYou have two types of custom error and the client will want to be able to parse both, plus the non errored response.\n\nObviously you could simply fall through when you deserialise on the client side.\n\nNormally you check the httpcode and if its not 200 you know to deserialse an error object. You can try the first style and then the second if that throws. But its not a great approach.\n\nBetter to get rid of one of your custom error formats.\n\nYour controller error handling is the worst of the two. It wont pass through error codes such as 401 if you have a dependency which uses the same auth.\n\nBut more seriously the wrapper simply confuses what the client has to check to see if the response is good or not. have the client throw an exception when the server returns an exception. Dont wrap it all up in a custom object and have the calling code have  `if(response.IsError) { throw..} ` littered everywhere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045619/asp-net-core-web-api-exception-handling-with-request-response-pattern/58045723#58045723","title":"ASP.NET Core Web API exception handling with Request/Response Pattern"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12093268"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58045723,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569122191,"creation_date":1569120095,"last_edit_date":1569121424,"question_id":58045619,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045619","body_markdown":"We want to apply global error handling with a Request/Response pattern.\r\nCurrent code looks as below.

Just as with function parameters, Terraform Input Variables have two parts: the declaration and the definition.\r\n\r\nThe declaration says that the variable exists, sets a type for it, and sets optionally sets default value for it (which, if set, makes the variable optional):\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;cidr_block&quot; {\r\n  type    = string\r\n  default = &quot;10.0.0.0/16&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe definition assigns it a specific value. In Terraform&#39;s case, for the root module it is `-var` command line arguments and `.tfvars` files that define the variables. For a child module it&#39;s the key/value pairs inside the `module` block that called the module.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn example of a general-purpose programming language that has a concept of default values for parameters is Python, so a Python example might be a helpful analogy for those who are familiar with it:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef example(cidr_block=&quot;10.0.0.0/16&quot;):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly to Terraform, we can choose to call this function as `example()` and let the default value apply. We could also call `example(&quot;11.0.0.0/16&quot;)` to override that default. The third possibility is that we call `example(&quot;10.0.0.0/16&quot;)` and override the default to the _same value_.\r\n\r\nFrom Python&#39;s perspective, there is no _functional_ difference between calling `example()` and calling `example(&quot;10.0.0.0/16&quot;)` here, but as authors of the caller we can use this to express subtle intent: if we leave it unset then we&#39;re saying &quot;I&#39;m happy with whatever the function chooses; the exact value is irrelevant&quot;, while if we set the argument explicitly to the same value as the default we&#39;re saying &quot;It&#39;s important for this caller that we _always_ select `&quot;10.0.0.0/16&quot;` here, regardless of what the default might be&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe decision-making process for whether to explicitly define a Terraform Input Variable is similar: if the specific chosen value is not crucial for the calling module then we might as well just let the default be selected. But if having the explicit definition will help a future reader understand the intent better, we might choose to explicitly define it.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045616/difference-between-tfvars-file-and-passing-values-in-main-tf-in-terraform/58066537#58066537","title":"Difference between *.tfvars file and passing values in main.tf in terraform"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11136355,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-keV4MyhdvMM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASM/7TiY7vv30W8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jags","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11136355/jags"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4205,"user_id":3682162,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100004313019228/picture?type=large","display_name":"Vikrant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3682162/vikrant"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569255914,"creation_date":1569120066,"last_edit_date":1569215988,"question_id":58045616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045616","body_markdown":"why some values are passed in main.tf file instead of *.tfvars files while calling a module.

How to make a correct mask?\r\n2. How can I make allow zero month in the mask? So, basically, it would be optional for the range, if I want I would just put 0 into month, check that on server, and create a range only from days and hours.\r\n  [1]: https://plugins.jquery.com/jquery.inputmask/\r\n  [2]: https://jsfiddle.net/qahxvspb/2/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045588/jquery-input-mask-to-input-date-range","title":"Jquery input mask to input date range"},{"tags":["php","mysql","sql","sql-injection"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":81528,"user_id":1415724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zErhj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Funk Forty Niner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415724/funk-forty-niner"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569120250,"post_id":58045577,"comment_id":102490912,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045577/can-this-be-eventually-used-for-sql-injection#comment102490912_58045577"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12101278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be5c15d71add63dc518831505e66c197?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Johnwick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12101278/johnwick"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":81528,"user_id":1415724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zErhj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Funk Forty Niner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415724/funk-forty-niner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569120300,"post_id":58045577,"comment_id":102490918,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045577/can-this-be-eventually-used-for-sql-injection#comment102490918_58045577"},{"owner":{"reputation":81528,"user_id":1415724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zErhj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Funk Forty Niner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415724/funk-forty-niner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569120334,"post_id":58045577,"comment_id":102490922,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045577/can-this-be-eventually-used-for-sql-injection#comment102490922_58045577"},{"owner":{"reputation":81528,"user_id":1415724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zErhj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Funk Forty Niner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415724/funk-forty-niner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569120808,"post_id":58045577,"comment_id":102490967,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045577/can-this-be-eventually-used-for-sql-injection#comment102490967_58045577"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12101278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be5c15d71add63dc518831505e66c197?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Johnwick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12101278/johnwick"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":81528,"user_id":1415724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zErhj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Funk Forty Niner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415724/funk-forty-niner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569120889,"post_id":58045577,"comment_id":102490979,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045577/can-this-be-eventually-used-for-sql-injection#comment102490979_58045577"},{"owner":{"reputation":81528,"user_id":1415724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zErhj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Funk Forty Niner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415724/funk-forty-niner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569120929,"post_id":58045577,"comment_id":102490982,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045577/can-this-be-eventually-used-for-sql-injection#comment102490982_58045577"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12101278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be5c15d71add63dc518831505e66c197?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Johnwick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12101278/johnwick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1578,"user_id":9647147,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4531e3ec760e4b31b7085c06e377dd8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mateus Junges","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9647147/mateus-junges"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569137497,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569163745,"creation_date":1569119610,"last_edit_date":1569122282,"question_id":58045577,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58045577","body_markdown":"I&#39;m pretty new to php but I noticed to some code, can this be used to perform sql injection?\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$id = $_POST[&#39;id&#39;];\r\n\r\n$UpdateDB = $odb -&gt;

I&#39;m doing this by way of an automapper type converter.\r\n\r\nThe objects being mapped are part of 2 inheritance hierarchies and my goal is to reduce the repeated number of mapping configurations that I currently need to explicitly specify.\r\n\r\nThe following is a condensed code example. I&#39;ve simplified the list projection condition for brevity.\r\n\r\n**The inheritance hierarchies:**\r\n\r\n    public class BaseA {\r\n    \tpublic Guid Id1 { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class BaseB {\r\n    \tpublic Guid Id2 { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class DerivedA : BaseA {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class DerivedB : BaseB {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**The type converter:**\r\n\r\n    public class BaseAToBaseBConverter&lt;TBaseA, TBaseB&gt; : ITypeConverter&lt;TBaseA, List&lt;TBaseB&gt;&gt;\r\n    \twhere TBaseA : BaseA\r\n    \twhere TBaseB : BaseB\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic List&lt;TBaseB&gt; Convert(TBaseA source, List&lt;TBaseB&gt; destination, ResolutionContext context) {\r\n    \t\tif (destination == null) {\r\n    \t\t\tdestination = new List&lt;TBaseB&gt;();\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\tfor (var i = 0; i &lt; (int) context.Items[&quot;InstancesToCreate&quot;]; i++) {\r\n    \t\t\tdestination.Add(context.Mapper.Map&lt;TBaseA, TBaseB&gt;(source));\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\treturn destination;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**The mapping profile:**\r\n\r\n    public class MappingProfile : Profile {\r\n    \tpublic MappingProfile() {\r\n    \t\tCreateMap&lt;BaseA, BaseB&gt;()\r\n    \t\t\t.ForMember(destination =&gt; destination.Id2, o =&gt; o.MapFrom(source =&gt; source.Id1))\r\n    \t\t\t.IncludeAllDerived();\r\n    \t\tCreateMap&lt;BaseA, List&lt;BaseB&gt;&gt;().ConvertUsing&lt;BaseAToBaseBConverter&lt;BaseA, BaseB&gt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    \t\tCreateMap&lt;DerivedA, DerivedB&gt;();\r\n    \t\tCreateMap&lt;DerivedA, List&lt;DerivedB&gt;&gt;().ConvertUsing&lt;BaseAToBaseBConverter&lt;DerivedA, DerivedB&gt;&gt;();\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**The tests:**\r\n\r\n    private IMapper _mapper;\r\n    \r\n    [SetUp]\r\n    public void SetUp() {\r\n    \t_mapper = new MapperConfiguration(mc =&gt; {\r\n    \t\tmc.AddProfile&lt;MappingProfile&gt;();\r\n    \t}).CreateMapper();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    [Test]\r\n    public void Map_SingleBaseAToList_ReturnsList() {\r\n    \tvar baseA = new BaseA();\r\n    \tvar baseB = _mapper.Map&lt;BaseA, List&lt;BaseB&gt;&gt;(baseA, options =&gt; options.Items[&quot;InstancesToCreate&quot;] = 2);\r\n    \r\n    \tAssert.Multiple(() =&gt;\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tAssert.That(baseB.Count, Is.EqualTo(2));\r\n    \t\tAssert.That(baseB.Select(x =&gt; x.Id2).Distinct().Single(), Is.EqualTo(baseA.Id1));\r\n    \t});\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    [Test]\r\n    public void Map_SingleDerivedBaseAToList_ReturnsList() {\r\n    \tvar derivedA = new DerivedA();\r\n    \tvar derivedB = _mapper.Map&lt;DerivedA, List&lt;DerivedB&gt;&gt;(derivedA, options =&gt; options.Items[&quot;InstancesToCreate&quot;] = 2);\r\n    \r\n    \tAssert.Multiple(() =&gt; {\r\n    \t\tAssert.That(derivedB.Count, Is.EqualTo(2));\r\n    \t\tAssert.That(derivedB.Select(x =&gt; x.Id2).Distinct().Single(), Is.EqualTo(derivedA.Id1));\r\n    \t});\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe above works fine. However in reality BaseA and BaseB are abstract classes with heaps of derived objects hanging off of them. This means I end up with a mapping profile that is quite long and highly repetitive. What I would like to know is if there is some way to specify a single `ConvertUsing` for the single to list on the base types and have the derived types use that definition, like we can for the type to type mapping. Something like the following:\r\n\r\n    CreateMap&lt;BaseA, BaseB&gt;()\r\n    \t.ForMember(destination =&gt; destination.Id2, o =&gt; o.MapFrom(source =&gt; source.Id1))\r\n    \t.IncludeAllDerived();\r\n    CreateMap&lt;BaseA, List&lt;BaseB&gt;&gt;()\t\t\t\r\n    \t.ConvertUsing&lt;BaseAToBaseBConverter&lt;BaseA, BaseB&gt;&gt;()\r\n    \t.IncludeAllDerived();\r\n    \r\n    CreateMap&lt;DerivedA, DerivedB&gt;();\r\n    CreateMap&lt;DerivedA, List&lt;DerivedB&gt;&gt;();\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t permitted as there is no direct conversion between a `List&lt;BaseB&gt;` and a `List&lt;DerivedB&gt;`. Is there another way to get the mappings to work like this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58045566/automapper-mapping-single-object-to-list-of-objects-using-a-converter-and-deriv","title":"Automapper: Mapping single object to list of
