You should not forget that in DICOM you have the **PixelSpacing**, which you do not have in &quot;normal images&quot;.\r\n\r\na typical image must always have a equidistant grid to be displayed correctly on screen. But in dicom you can have a image with 100x100 pixels and pixelspacing 1.0\\1.0, and you can have a image with 100x200 pixels and pixelspacing 1.0\\0.5. A valid DICOM-Viewer would display both images the same way. the second image has more pixels, but they are smaller. resulting in the same display as the first image.\r\n\r\nSo its obvious, that the height of the stack of images is 518*0,625 = 323,75 mm. So you have many possibilities:\r\n\r\n* you could create a **512x324** image, set pixelspacing to **0.845703\\1.0** and calculate (interpolate) the z-values.\r\n* The best solution would be, to take the pixel data as they are, without any interpolation, so without any loss of data. Then you have a grid of **512x518** pixels. the pixelspacing would be **0.845703\\0.625**. Thats because the spacing in x-direction comes from the spacing of pixels in the original data and the spacing in y-direction is the distance between the slices. \r\n* But: there are some DICOM-Viewers out there who do not deal correctly with not-equidistant pixels. of if you export the image into jpegs and let window/browser display the image then you need equidistant pixels. Therefore you have to choose a number of pixels, so that in sum the heigh is 323,75mm when you have a pixel spacing of 0.845703mm. This are 323,75 / 0.845703 = 382,817 ~ 383 pixels. So if you generate a **512x383** pixel image, where you have to do interpolation of the slices, you can create a image with equidistant pixelspacing of **0.845703\\0.845703**.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412358/dicom-multiplanar-image-reconstruction/58500465#58500465","title":"DICOM multiplanar image reconstruction"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12118704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63ff27fb1d515e9dea6949240267c209?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rkristof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12118704/rkristof"},"last_editor":{"reputation":35766,"user_id":873165,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zjzso.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kevin Workman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/873165/kevin-workman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58420355,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571734315,"creation_date":1571225807,"last_edit_date":1571259460,"question_id":58412358,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412358","body_markdown":"My problem is, that I have to develop a program, that can open DICOM CT images in C# (without any library) and I should process the axial, coronal and sagittal images as well.

Meanwhile I&#39;ll try to figure out myself.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412358/dicom-multiplanar-image-reconstruction","title":"DICOM multiplanar image reconstruction"},{"tags":["pdf-generation","media","hybris","bytearrayinputstream"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":10663685,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eiFxM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nexussim Lements","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10663685/nexussim-lements"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571231187,"post_id":58412699,"comment_id":103170977,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412355/hybris-mediamodel-how-to-get-bytes/58412699#comment103170977_58412699"},{"owner":{"reputation":3599,"user_id":2478134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qD7Cq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HybrisHelp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2478134/hybrishelp"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":113,"user_id":10663685,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eiFxM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nexussim Lements","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10663685/nexussim-lements"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571231360,"post_id":58412699,"comment_id":103171067,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412355/hybris-mediamodel-how-to-get-bytes/58412699#comment103171067_58412699"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3599,"user_id":2478134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qD7Cq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HybrisHelp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2478134/hybrishelp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3599,"user_id":2478134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qD7Cq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HybrisHelp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2478134/hybrishelp"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571227666,"last_edit_date":1571227666,"creation_date":1571226930,"answer_id":58412699,"question_id":58412355,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412699","body_markdown":"You can use MediaService\r\n\r\n\r\n\t@Resource\r\n\tprivate MediaService mediaService;\r\n\t//...\r\n\tfinal MediaModel mediaModel= mediaService.getMedia(&quot;mediaName&quot;);\r\n\tfinal InputStream inputStream = mediaService.getStreamFromMedia(mediaModel);\r\n\r\nThen you can pass InputStream or converting it to the format you want like [ByteArrayInputStream][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also convert it byte Array like [this][2]\r\n\r\n    byte[] bytes = IOUtils.toByteArray(is);\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3496025/2478134\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/1264709/2478134","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412355/hybris-mediamodel-how-to-get-bytes/58412699#58412699","title":"Hybris MediaModel how to get Bytes"}],"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":10663685,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eiFxM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nexussim Lements","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10663685/nexussim-lements"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58412699,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571227666,"creation_date":1571225798,"question_id":58412355,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412355","body_markdown":"Is there any way in Hybris to obtain all the bytes from a MediaModel ?

Has the disadvantage of making the use of implicitly declared copy constructor and assignment operator deprecated. This means it should not be relied on, and may potentially stop working in future. Both 1. and 2. have the disadvantage of preventing implicit move constructor and assignment operator generation. So, if you use either, then you should also declare the copy and move constructors and assignment operators (as defaulted if possible).\r\n\r\n- 3. Has the advantage of being least amount to write and least amount to read, especially considering the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\nAs a rough rule of thumb, use 3. if possible.

S[x] = minimum of S[x-1] + A, or any S[x-k] + B if substring(x-k, x) can be found in substring(0, x-k)\r\n\r\nSo we need to calculate the S[x] values incrementally, based on the previous values in the array. Calculating S[x-1]+A is simple, but calculating the minimum value for S[x-k]+B is quite expensive, because we need to find all occurrences of all possible substrings.\r\n\r\nIn theory it&#39;s possible that S[x]&gt;S[x+k] (in certain A, B and str values)\r\n\r\nSo the question is how can we optimise calculating the substrings.\r\n\r\nI think some kind of unique &#39;longest common substring&#39; graph could help somehow, however I haven&#39;t found the solution yet.\r\nAnother optimisation if we maintain an ordered list of costs for each position and start looking up the possible substrings from the cheapest position instead of starting from the longest possible substring. (the cost of adding a substring is independent from the length of the substring)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412332/algorithm-for-building-a-string-by-appending-and-cloning-substrings/58434779#58434779","title":"Algorithm for building a string by appending and cloning substrings"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":10693483,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e263919afeb8ebe036369f2dcd1d760?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"esperski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10693483/esperski"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571321871,"creation_date":1571225713,"question_id":58412332,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412332","body_markdown":"I have a problem where I need to construct a given string from scratch for a minimum cost by either:\r\n\r\nAppending a new character for a cost A\r\n\r\nAppending a substring of my existing string for a cost B\r\n\r\nE.g. for a string &quot;abcabc&quot; with a cost of A = 10, B = 11\r\n\r\na 10\r\nab 20\r\nabc 30\r\nabcabc 41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst I tried a greedy algorithm but it didn&#39;t give the optimal answer for this problem. I had the idea to use the dijkstra algorithm and a priority queue, so for each popped node I calculated the possibilities for A and B and pushed the new nodes back onto the queue. Since you can&#39;t change keys on the priority queue I use an int array (&quot;visited&quot;) to keep track of the visited nodes.\r\n\r\nHowever my solution isn&#39;t fast enough to finish 30000 char strings in 2 seconds so I wanted to ask for some pointers on how I could optimise/change my approach.\r\n```\r\ntypedef pair&lt;int, int&gt; iPair;\r\nint solve(string &amp;s, int a, int b) {\r\n    priority_queue&lt;iPair, iPair&lt;Node&gt;, greater&lt;iPair&gt;&gt; pq;\r\n    int visited[s.size()];\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.size(); ++i)\r\n        visited[i] = -1;\r\n    pq.push(make_pair(a, 0));\r\n    iPair p;\r\n    while (!pq.empty()) {\r\n        p = pq.top();\r\n        pq.pop();\r\n        if (visited[p.second] == -1)\r\n            visited[p.second] = 1;\r\n        else\r\n            continue;\r\n        if (p.second == s.size() - 1)\r\n            break;\r\n\r\n        // Handle append costs\r\n        pq.push(make_pair(p.first + a, p.second + 1));\r\n\r\n        // Handle clone costs\r\n        int j;\r\n        int i = p.second;\r\n\r\n        if (s.size()  &gt; 2*i + 2)\r\n            j = 2*i + 1;\r\n        else\r\n            j = s.size() - 1;\r\n\r\n        for (; j &gt; i + 1; --j) {\r\n            if(s.substr(0, i+1).find(s.substr(i+1, j-i)) != string::npos) {\r\n        pq.push(make_pair(p.first + b, j));               \r\n                break;\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return p.current_cost;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I say I&#39;m looking for how I&#39;m out of ideas how how to optimise this code and I&#39;m not sure Dijkstra is even the right approach.

So far so good, but after performing an update on a table row with the asynchronous request the row leaves the table or returns with the updated data. \r\nBut then if I do a table search for search or pagination with the datatable function the rows come back or not the updated information according to the update made and should not.\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n    &lt;table class=&quot;table table-responsive&quot; id=&quot;employee_table1&quot;&gt; \r\n    &lt;thead&gt;  \r\n    &lt;tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Pedido&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Data&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Val&#234;ncia&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;A&#231;&#227;o&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;/tr&gt; \r\n    &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n    &lt;tbody&gt;     \r\n    &lt;?php  do{ ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;tr id=&quot;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Id&quot;]; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;view_data1&quot; &gt;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Id&quot;]; ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; \r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;DataRegisto&quot;]; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; \r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Destino&quot;]; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; data-id=&quot;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Id&quot;]; ?&gt;&quot;  data-target=&quot;#add_data_Modal4&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-warning btn-sm edit_data1&quot; &gt;&lt;span class=&quot;glyphicon glyphicon-pencil&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt; \r\n    &lt;/tr&gt;     \r\n    &lt;?php } while($produto1 = $result1-&gt;fetch_assoc()); ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;    \r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nWith the edit button I call the modal to edit.

updated with the update.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412319/problem-with-asynchronous-and-datatable-request","title":"Problem with asynchronous and datatable

simplify it a bit:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        Todo todo = await _context.Todos.FindAsync(id);\r\n        return todo ?? NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that `todo` and `NotFound()` have very different types. `todo` is a `Todo`, but `NotFound()` returns a `NotFoundResult`. These two are inherently incompatible, and the compiler doesn&#39;t know that it should convert both of them to an `ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep the method&#39;s return type as `ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;`, the best I can come up with is a helper method:\r\n\r\n    public static ActionResult&lt;T&gt; ResultOrNotFound&lt;T&gt;(T item) where T : class\r\n    {\r\n        return item != null ? new ActionResult&lt;T&gt;(item) : new ActionResult&lt;T&gt;(NotFound());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can write:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        return ResultOrNotFound(await _context.Todos.FindAsync(id));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you&#39;re OK with returning an `IActionResult` instead, then you can do:\r\n\r\n    public static IActionResult OkOrNull(object item)\r\n    {\r\n        return item != null ? Ok(item) : null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can write:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        return OkOrNull(await _context.Todos.FindAsync(id)) ?? NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can make this look a bit nicer if you want, with another overload:\r\n\r\n    public static async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OkOrNull&lt;T&gt;(Task&lt;T&gt; task) where T : class\r\n    {\r\n        T item = await task;\r\n        return item != null ? Ok(item) : null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMeaning you can write:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        return await OkOrNull(_context.Todos.FindAsync(id)) ?? NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412314/how-to-use-with-return/58412356#58412356","title":"How to use ?? with

However, that obviously doesn&#39;t give me distinct values as I just want a single record for each expiration group.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb.getCollection(&quot;stocks&quot;).find(\r\n    { \r\n        &quot;Symbol&quot; : &quot;AAPL&quot;\r\n    }\r\n).sort(\r\n    { \r\n        &quot;Expiration&quot; : 1.0, \r\n        &quot;flatreturn&quot; : -1.0\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output I&#39;m desiring is for a specific stock, find the highest return within each group of dates. So for the above dataset, the desired return data would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n    &quot;Symbol&quot; : &quot;AAPL&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Expiration&quot; : &quot;2019-10-18T04:00:00.000+0000&quot;, \r\n    &quot;flatreturn&quot; : 1.82, \r\n \r\n}\r\n\r\n{ \r\n    &quot;Symbol&quot; : &quot;AAPL&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Expiration&quot; : &quot;2019-10-22T04:00:00.000+0000&quot;, \r\n    &quot;flatreturn&quot; : 6.92, \r\n \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that desired return dataset, I get the highest return in the 2019-10-18 group and similarly for the 2019-10-22 group. \r\n\r\nAppreciate any guidance on structuring a query. By way of more information, if this isn&#39;t possible in Mongo, I guess the argument can be made to do it in JS (Node) but given my dataset for a particular stock will return about 1000 records, I wasn&#39;t sure about the efficiency of doing the distinct query in JS (or, indeed, how to do that in JS).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412310/how-to-do-a-sorted-distinct-query-for-a-specific-set-of-records-on-mongo","title":"How to do a sorted distinct query for a specific set of records on Mongo?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":7211815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qt3B.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codrelphi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7211815/codrelphi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226499,"post_id":58412320,"comment_id":103168180,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412309/how-can-i-split-the-second-line-when-the-keyword-match-two-lines-by-python/58412320#comment103168180_58412320"},{"owner":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":499,"user_id":7211815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qt3B.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codrelphi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7211815/codrelphi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226841,"post_id":58412320,"comment_id":103168361,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412309/how-can-i-split-the-second-line-when-the-keyword-match-two-lines-by-python/58412320#comment103168361_58412320"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571226834,"last_edit_date":1571226834,"creation_date":1571225695,"answer_id":58412320,"question_id":58412309,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412320","body_markdown":"you can split each line by `&#39;19:07:57.166 [INFO]keyword = 3&#39;.split(&#39;[INFO]&#39;)`\r\n\r\nor you can do it with regex\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\nline = &#39;19:07:57.166 [INFO]keyword = 3&#39;\r\nresult = re.match(&#39;(.*)\\[INFO\\](.*)&#39;, line)\r\nresult.group(1) #

I eventually wanna call the URL with JavaScript so I need it to work with a link (and in the future query parameters too, but that&#39;s the next step).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412300/accessing-python-file-deployed-to-heroku-via-url-app-crashed","title":"Accessing python file deployed to Heroku via URL: App crashed"},{"tags":["android","ionic-framework","in-app-purchase","cordova-plugins","ionic4"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":441,"user_id":9328846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3faa5d96d89e17c614d6e1fc3f5d67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"edn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9328846/edn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571308811,"post_id":58416231,"comment_id":103201963,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412298/how-to-remember-the-purchased-credit-in-the-ionic-app-implementation/58416231#comment103201963_58416231"},{"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":4278381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001329722579/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shailesh Bhokare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4278381/shailesh-bhokare"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":441,"user_id":9328846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3faa5d96d89e17c614d6e1fc3f5d67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"edn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9328846/edn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571410840,"post_id":58416231,"comment_id":103244476,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412298/how-to-remember-the-purchased-credit-in-the-ionic-app-implementation/58416231#comment103244476_58416231"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":4278381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001329722579/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shailesh Bhokare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4278381/shailesh-bhokare"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571237661,"creation_date":1571237661,"answer_id":58416231,"question_id":58412298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416231","body_markdown":"yes you can store user&#39;s credit information in users mobiles using **Ionic Offline Storage**.

I am intending to implement an application in which I will have a **table** where each row includes some unique data (independent from other rows).\r\n\r\nI would like to implement a credit mechanism where a user - e.g. - purchases 100 credits (via in-app purchases); and whenever s/he wants to see the content of a particular row in the **table**, s/he will need to spend - e.g. - 10 credits.\r\n\r\n**Example:** In the beginning, the user has 0 credit. Then s/he buys 100 credits and then chooses to see the content of 3 rows in the table (each row costing 10 credits). And at the end, s/he still has 70 credits.\r\n\r\n**Targets I have:**\r\n\r\n - I would like to implement this procedure without forcing the user to create a membership account. With other words, installing the app shall be enough to start buying credits without further registration.\r\n - I do not want to save the user credit information in a database to later be able to remember how many credits the user still has.\r\n - I want the mobile app to remember the amount of credit it has even if the user does not use the application for a while or restarts the mobile phone, etc.\r\n\r\nI am implementing this app by using Ionic (Angular). Can this implementation be done as explained above (without a database for remembering the user credit info)? If no, why..? If yes, how can it be done?\r\n\r\n**Addendum:** \r\nIf you have experience/knowledge in developing such a functionality in a different way than how I described it above, you are welcome to share it as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412298/how-to-remember-the-purchased-credit-in-the-ionic-app-implementation","title":"How to remember the purchased credit in the ionic app implementation"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2017"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571225608,"post_id":58412296,"comment_id":103167679,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017#comment103167679_58412296"},{"owner":{"reputation":19805,"user_id":4137916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bab91fda70af7e9beb8934d323540e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeroen Mostert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4137916/jeroen-mostert"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571226034,"post_id":58412296,"comment_id":103167889,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017#comment103167889_58412296"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":2180079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H8v0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reza Yousefi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2180079/reza-yousefi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571231024,"post_id":58413079,"comment_id":103170881,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017/58413079#comment103170881_58413079"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":2180079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H8v0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reza Yousefi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2180079/reza-yousefi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571228073,"creation_date":1571228073,"answer_id":58413079,"question_id":58412296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58413079","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\nUse this\r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n        d.value(&#39;GroupUserName[1]&#39;, &#39;nvarchar(100)&#39;)  AS GroupUserName\r\n        ,(SELECT \r\n            f.value(&#39;Name[1]&#39;, &#39;varchar(50)&#39;) AS &#39;Name&#39;\r\n    \t\t,f.value(&#39;Description[1]&#39;, &#39;varchar(50)&#39;) AS &#39;Description&#39;\r\n            FROM c.d.nodes(&#39;Roles/Role&#39;) AS e(f)            \r\n            FOR JSON PATH) &#39;Roles&#39;\r\n    FROM @xml.nodes(&#39;/Policies/Policy&#39;) AS c(d)\r\n    FOR JSON PATH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017/58413079#58413079","title":"How to Convert XML to JSON in SQL Server 2017?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5566400,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0hdCMYGOeqI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB2o/FfRvtMs0xYE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alireza Mokhtari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5566400/alireza-mokhtari"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571238160,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571228073,"creation_date":1571225566,"last_edit_date":1571225754,"question_id":58412296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412296","body_markdown":"I would like to convert an XML column into a JSON string.\r\n\r\nXML:\r\n    \r\n    &lt;Policies&gt;\r\n      &lt;Policy&gt;\r\n        &lt;GroupUserName&gt;testX&lt;/GroupUserName&gt;\r\n        &lt;Roles&gt;\r\n          &lt;Role&gt;\r\n            &lt;Name&gt;Browser&lt;/Name&gt;\r\n            &lt;Description&gt;May view folders, reports and subscribe to reports.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Role&gt;\r\n          &lt;Role&gt;\r\n            &lt;Name&gt;Content Manager&lt;/Name&gt;\r\n            &lt;Description&gt;May manage content in the Report Server.

My question in my mind is why aren&#39;t they moving to other top modern browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera or any listed from [here][1]. Since IE support with older version ended 1/12/16, [see reference here][2]. And also, using up-to-date software is the best way to avoid the attackers [Here][3] is the link why up-to-date software is important even though it talks about in general.\r\n\r\nBtw, I can&#39;t ask the client why because they don&#39;t have technical knowledge.

two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Why can I see the `depth` and `blendedColor` in my viewer, if my render target is texture?\r\n2. How can I inspect, what is being rendered in the textures `depthTexture` and `imageTexture`?\r\n   - Is there some way to save these textures as images, for example?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412253/how-to-properly-define-two-qrendertargets-in-qt3d-for-depth-and-color-informatio","title":"How to properly define two QRenderTargets in

Retrieve information in the bullet list at the bottom of the tooltip.\r\n 4. Write a textMateRules which scope matches the tooltip scope.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Doxygen, the following Textmate rule in the `settings.json` file do recolor the Doxygen keywords with a custom color :\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;editor.tokenColorCustomizations&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;textMateRules&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;scope&quot;:&quot;storage.type.class.doxygen&quot;,\r\n      &quot;settings&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;foreground&quot;: &quot;#6272A4&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this only recolor the `@param` tag.

of `break` from inner `while` you should `return` otherwise, the code is evaluating all combination via outer `while` loop. \r\n\r\nAlso, you can follow the below optimal approach which uses dictionary based approach to evaluate the sum in one pass (in one while loop).\r\n\r\nDetails about code:\r\n\r\n- The below program supports fast look up by using `Dictionary`.\r\n- The list is iterated and inserts elements into the Dictionary, It also look back to check if current element&#39;s complement already exists in the Dictionary. I\r\n- The program checks if each element&#39;s complement (target - nums[i]) exists in the `Dictionary`.

Is there any API in MapR which gives me provision to do so. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/mapr-setup.sh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412198/how-to-generate-mapr-ticket-in-python-code","title":"How to generate MapR ticket in Python Code"},{"tags":["python","pandas","csv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571225986,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103167865,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103167865_58412196"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226299,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103168064,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103168064_58412196"},{"owner":{"reputation":1365,"user_id":6789321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-B5oSDMyNAyc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAT6s/i6ZRf_boOu4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"accdias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6789321/accdias"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226666,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103168267,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103168267_58412196"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571227379,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103168691,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103168691_58412196"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571228085,"post_id":58412845,"comment_id":103169109,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan/58412845#comment103169109_58412845"},{"owner":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571228721,"post_id":58412845,"comment_id":103169500,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan/58412845#comment103169500_58412845"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571227347,"creation_date":1571227347,"answer_id":58412845,"question_id":58412196,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412845","body_markdown":"I think the easiest and fastest what you can do here is to `merge` (read: `join`) both dataframes on the deperature postcal code and arrival postal code.

Unfortunately, in this case they have to be separate.\r\n\r\nEverything else works if they&#39;re separate (and has for years), it&#39;s just SignalR that&#39;s not.\r\n\r\nEdit : Answers to questions\r\n\r\n**sideshowbarker  : What’s the HTTP status code of the response?

If it&#39;s on the same server as you state here then the URL for the SignalR hub would surely be our.test.server.com:89/Test**\r\n\r\nSorry, I wasn&#39;t very clear there.\r\n\r\nBoth are on the same server (our test server), so both can indeed by accessed by http://our.test.server.com...\r\n\r\nHowever, I specifically need to test when the Web Front End and the RestAPI are on different servers (which they are when Live on our clients&#39; systems).\r\n\r\nSo, in the config file, I specified the URL for the RestAPI as &#39;http://localhost:89/Test&#39; rather than &#39;http://our.test.server.com:89/Test&#39;\r\n\r\nAaaand typing up this reply has just made me realise what the problem is, THANK YOU! :)\r\n\r\nUp until now, the WFE has only ever spoken to the RestAPI directly, and so &#39;http://localhost:89/Test&#39; refers to the local host for our test server that the WFE is on, and so that works.\r\n\r\nBut of course like an idiot I&#39;m passing the same value to the browser now for the SignalR connection to use, so it&#39;s looking at **my** localhost.\r\n\r\nChanged the value in the config file to &#39;http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test&#39;, different URL pointing to the same place, and now it all works!\r\n\r\nBig thanks, **strickt01** ! :)\r\n\r\nEdit #2 : Another question\r\n\r\n**fran : but you are still going to have a problem in your production environment because you will have 2 different origins. are you using some sort of authentication in your wfe? I suspect you don&#39;t have any problem making calls currently because you wfe is calling into controllers running under the same origin, then your wfe controllers are the ones that are making the calls to the web service. In this case you don&#39;t have a CORS issue because it&#39;s server to server communication**\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using two different origins now.\r\n\r\nThe WFE is on http://our.test.server.com/Test\r\n\r\nThe RestAPI is on http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test\r\n\r\nDifferent URLs and different ports, both of which should throw a CORS error.\r\n\r\nInternally within the test server, the WFE is calling the RestAPI from http://our.test.server.com/Test to http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test. They are on the same server, but they don&#39;t actually know that.\r\n\r\nFrom the User perspective, in my browser I log on to http://our.test.server.com/Test. That&#39;s the origin as far as the browser is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen I make a SignalR call, that connects to http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test because that&#39;s the URL in the config file, which is passed as the URL to connect to.\r\n\r\nSignalR does treat this as a cross domain connection, I get the following in the Console output:-\r\n\r\n    SignalR: Auto detected cross domain url.\r\n    SignalR: Negotiating with &#39;http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/negotiate?clientProtocol=2.1&amp;t&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&#39;.\r\n    SignalR: webSockets transport starting.\r\n    SignalR: Connecting to websocket endpoint &#39;ws://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/connect?transport=webSockets&amp;clientProtocol=2.1&amp;t&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&amp;connectionToken=&lt;token&gt;&amp;tid=0&#39;.\r\n    SignalR: Websocket opened.\r\n    SignalR: webSockets transport connected. Initiating start request.\r\n    SignalR: The start request succeeded. Transitioning to the connected state.\r\n    SignalR: Now monitoring keep alive with a warning timeout of 13333.333333333332, keep alive timeout of 20000 and disconnecting timeout of 30000.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure, I removed the line **app.UseCors(CorsOptions.AllowAll);** from the Startup class and tried again.\r\n\r\nThis time it failed with a CORS error:-\r\n\r\n    SignalR: Auto detected cross domain url.\r\n    SignalR: Negotiating with &#39;http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/negotiate?clientProtocol=2.1&amp;&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&#39;.\r\n    Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/negotiate?clientProtocol=2.1&amp;&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&amp;_=1571242017811. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).\r\n    SignalR: Stopping connection.\r\n\r\nSo, definitely testing with cross origin, and definitely working!\r\n\r\nThanks for making me double-check though, always worth doing! :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412185/c-signalr-on-webapi-rejecting-cors","title":"C# SignalR on WebAPI rejecting CORS"},{"tags":["c#","task-parallel-library"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":19805,"user_id":4137916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bab91fda70af7e9beb8934d323540e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeroen Mostert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4137916/jeroen-mostert"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571225570,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167649,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167649_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571225745,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167750,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167750_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571225957,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167848,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167848_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":5758,"user_id":759558,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kz2la.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/759558/neil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226053,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167899,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167899_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571226145,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167952,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167952_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":126223,"user_id":2319407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/98O16.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitry Bychenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2319407/dmitry-bychenko"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571226302,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103168068,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103168068_58412183"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":196,"user_id":10791800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/329a89acfcae9d7739e524b0ca6ebaa8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chill94","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10791800/chill94"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571226028,"creation_date":1571226028,"answer_id":58412437,"question_id":58412183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412437","body_markdown":"I believe the confusion is that Task.WaitAll is the synchronous version of the (better) Task.WhenAll method.

I want you remember that there are more instances of each classes behind the scene. (Slider, Gallery, etc)\r\n\r\nThis is the code:\r\n\r\n    // button.js\r\n    import Terminal from &#39;./widget.mjs&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    class Button {\r\n        constructor(type, color, bus) {\r\n            this.type = document.querySelector(type);\r\n            this.color = color;\r\n            /* #1 Pass the parameters by using this keyword */\r\n            this.bus = Terminal.init(this);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    let userButton = new Button(&#39;.button&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;);\r\n\r\n    // Terminal.js\r\n    export default class Terminal {\r\n         static init(obj) {\r\n            /* #2 Define Variable */\r\n            this.obj= obj;\r\n    \r\n            /* #3 Singleton */\r\n            if (!Terminal.ins) {\r\n                Terminal.ins = new Terminal(this.obj);\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            /* #4 Define the cache (Originally from Terminal.ins) */\r\n            this.cache = Terminal.ins.cache;\r\n    \r\n            /* #5 Push the parameter &amp; Log it */\r\n            this.cache.push(this.obj);\r\n            console.log(this.cache);\r\n        }\r\n        constructor(data) {\r\n            /* #3-1 Define an array */\r\n            this.cache = [];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can check full code including the rest of instances in &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/@sniffingdoggo/Q-StackOverFlow&quot;&gt;myRepl&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n\r\nWhen the code is running, pass the 2 parameters `type, color` as an single `object` to the static method of `Terminal`. Then, create a `new Terminal` instance if there&#39;s no instance.

What do I miss? How could I avoid the evaluation of the `Map` content before the matching? Is it possible to use lists in a `match case` statement? Or is there an easier way to achieve that? (I would like to avoid having an `if` statement inside the `match case`.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412376/using-scala-match-case-with-lists","title":"Using Scala match case with lists"},{"tags":["dvd-burning"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":7162924,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81af7ab01dc110f86205f305670ff23e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cuong Hoang Van","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7162924/cuong-hoang-van"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571291918,"creation_date":1571291918,"answer_id":58425828,"question_id":58412375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58425828","body_markdown":"I resolved my problem by KernSafe TotalMounter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412375/how-to-make-virtual-optical-disk-on-windows10/58425828#58425828","title":"How to make virtual optical disk on Windows10"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":7162924,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81af7ab01dc110f86205f305670ff23e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cuong Hoang Van","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7162924/cuong-hoang-van"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58425828,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571291918,"creation_date":1571225875,"question_id":58412375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412375","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing a application to write data to DVD.

You should not forget that in DICOM you have the **PixelSpacing**, which you do not have in &quot;normal images&quot;.\r\n\r\na typical image must always have a equidistant grid to be displayed correctly on screen. But in dicom you can have a image with 100x100 pixels and pixelspacing 1.0\\1.0, and you can have a image with 100x200 pixels and pixelspacing 1.0\\0.5. A valid DICOM-Viewer would display both images the same way. the second image has more pixels, but they are smaller. resulting in the same display as the first image.\r\n\r\nSo its obvious, that the height of the stack of images is 518*0,625 = 323,75 mm. So you have many possibilities:\r\n\r\n* you could create a **512x324** image, set pixelspacing to **0.845703\\1.0** and calculate (interpolate) the z-values.\r\n* The best solution would be, to take the pixel data as they are, without any interpolation, so without any loss of data. Then you have a grid of **512x518** pixels. the pixelspacing would be **0.845703\\0.625**. Thats because the spacing in x-direction comes from the spacing of pixels in the original data and the spacing in y-direction is the distance between the slices. \r\n* But: there are some DICOM-Viewers out there who do not deal correctly with not-equidistant pixels. of if you export the image into jpegs and let window/browser display the image then you need equidistant pixels. Therefore you have to choose a number of pixels, so that in sum the heigh is 323,75mm when you have a pixel spacing of 0.845703mm. This are 323,75 / 0.845703 = 382,817 ~ 383 pixels. So if you generate a **512x383** pixel image, where you have to do interpolation of the slices, you can create a image with equidistant pixelspacing of **0.845703\\0.845703**.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412358/dicom-multiplanar-image-reconstruction/58500465#58500465","title":"DICOM multiplanar image reconstruction"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12118704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63ff27fb1d515e9dea6949240267c209?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rkristof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12118704/rkristof"},"last_editor":{"reputation":35766,"user_id":873165,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zjzso.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kevin Workman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/873165/kevin-workman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58420355,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571734315,"creation_date":1571225807,"last_edit_date":1571259460,"question_id":58412358,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412358","body_markdown":"My problem is, that I have to develop a program, that can open DICOM CT images in C# (without any library) and I should process the axial, coronal and sagittal images as well.

Has the disadvantage of making the use of implicitly declared copy constructor and assignment operator deprecated. This means it should not be relied on, and may potentially stop working in future. Both 1. and 2. have the disadvantage of preventing implicit move constructor and assignment operator generation. So, if you use either, then you should also declare the copy and move constructors and assignment operators (as defaulted if possible).\r\n\r\n- 3. Has the advantage of being least amount to write and least amount to read, especially considering the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\nAs a rough rule of thumb, use 3. if possible.

is not a solution, but a first few steps to a possible solution.\r\n \r\nThe theoretical solution is the following:\r\n\r\n1. Let S[i] the cost of the substring to the i. char.\r\n2. S[0] = 0, S[1] = A\r\n3. S[x] = minimum of S[x-1] + A, or any S[x-k] + B if substring(x-k, x) can be found in substring(0, x-k)\r\n\r\nSo we need to calculate the S[x] values incrementally, based on the previous values in the array. Calculating S[x-1]+A is simple, but calculating the minimum value for S[x-k]+B is quite expensive, because we need to find all occurrences of all possible substrings.\r\n\r\nIn theory it&#39;s possible that S[x]&gt;S[x+k] (in certain A, B and str values)\r\n\r\nSo the question is how can we optimise calculating the substrings.\r\n\r\nI think some kind of unique &#39;longest common substring&#39; graph could help somehow, however I haven&#39;t found the solution yet.\r\nAnother optimisation if we maintain an ordered list of costs for each position and start looking up the possible substrings from the cheapest position instead of starting from the longest possible substring. (the cost of adding a substring is independent from the length of the substring)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412332/algorithm-for-building-a-string-by-appending-and-cloning-substrings/58434779#58434779","title":"Algorithm for building a string by appending and cloning substrings"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":10693483,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e263919afeb8ebe036369f2dcd1d760?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"esperski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10693483/esperski"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571321871,"creation_date":1571225713,"question_id":58412332,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412332","body_markdown":"I have a problem where I need to construct a given string from scratch for a minimum cost by either:\r\n\r\nAppending a new character for a cost A\r\n\r\nAppending a substring of my existing string for a cost B\r\n\r\nE.g. for a string &quot;abcabc&quot; with a cost of A = 10, B = 11\r\n\r\na 10\r\nab 20\r\nabc 30\r\nabcabc 41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst I tried a greedy algorithm but it didn&#39;t give the optimal answer for this problem.

So far so good, but after performing an update on a table row with the asynchronous request the row leaves the table or returns with the updated data. \r\nBut then if I do a table search for search or pagination with the datatable function the rows come back or not the updated information according to the update made and should not.\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n    &lt;table class=&quot;table table-responsive&quot; id=&quot;employee_table1&quot;&gt; \r\n    &lt;thead&gt;  \r\n    &lt;tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Pedido&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Data&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Val&#234;ncia&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;A&#231;&#227;o&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;/tr&gt; \r\n    &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n    &lt;tbody&gt;     \r\n    &lt;?php  do{ ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;tr id=&quot;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Id&quot;]; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;view_data1&quot; &gt;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Id&quot;]; ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; \r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;DataRegisto&quot;]; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; \r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Destino&quot;]; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; data-id=&quot;&lt;?php echo $produto1[&quot;Id&quot;]; ?&gt;&quot;  data-target=&quot;#add_data_Modal4&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-warning btn-sm edit_data1&quot; &gt;&lt;span class=&quot;glyphicon glyphicon-pencil&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt; \r\n    &lt;/tr&gt;     \r\n    &lt;?php } while($produto1 = $result1-&gt;fetch_assoc()); ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;    \r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nWith the edit button I call the modal to edit.

updated with the update.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412319/problem-with-asynchronous-and-datatable-request","title":"Problem with asynchronous and datatable

simplify it a bit:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        Todo todo = await _context.Todos.FindAsync(id);\r\n        return todo ?? NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that `todo` and `NotFound()` have very different types. `todo` is a `Todo`, but `NotFound()` returns a `NotFoundResult`. These two are inherently incompatible, and the compiler doesn&#39;t know that it should convert both of them to an `ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep the method&#39;s return type as `ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;`, the best I can come up with is a helper method:\r\n\r\n    public static ActionResult&lt;T&gt; ResultOrNotFound&lt;T&gt;(T item) where T : class\r\n    {\r\n        return item != null ? new ActionResult&lt;T&gt;(item) : new ActionResult&lt;T&gt;(NotFound());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can write:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        return ResultOrNotFound(await _context.Todos.FindAsync(id));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you&#39;re OK with returning an `IActionResult` instead, then you can do:\r\n\r\n    public static IActionResult OkOrNull(object item)\r\n    {\r\n        return item != null ? Ok(item) : null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can write:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        return OkOrNull(await _context.Todos.FindAsync(id)) ?? NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can make this look a bit nicer if you want, with another overload:\r\n\r\n    public static async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OkOrNull&lt;T&gt;(Task&lt;T&gt; task) where T : class\r\n    {\r\n        T item = await task;\r\n        return item != null ? Ok(item) : null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMeaning you can write:\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&lt;Todo&gt;&gt; GetTodo(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        return await OkOrNull(_context.Todos.FindAsync(id)) ?? NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412314/how-to-use-with-return/58412356#58412356","title":"How to use ?? with

However, that obviously doesn&#39;t give me distinct values as I just want a single record for each expiration group.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb.getCollection(&quot;stocks&quot;).find(\r\n    { \r\n        &quot;Symbol&quot; : &quot;AAPL&quot;\r\n    }\r\n).sort(\r\n    { \r\n        &quot;Expiration&quot; : 1.0, \r\n        &quot;flatreturn&quot; : -1.0\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output I&#39;m desiring is for a specific stock, find the highest return within each group of dates. So for the above dataset, the desired return data would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n    &quot;Symbol&quot; : &quot;AAPL&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Expiration&quot; : &quot;2019-10-18T04:00:00.000+0000&quot;, \r\n    &quot;flatreturn&quot; : 1.82, \r\n \r\n}\r\n\r\n{ \r\n    &quot;Symbol&quot; : &quot;AAPL&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Expiration&quot; : &quot;2019-10-22T04:00:00.000+0000&quot;, \r\n    &quot;flatreturn&quot; : 6.92, \r\n \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that desired return dataset, I get the highest return in the 2019-10-18 group and similarly for the 2019-10-22 group. \r\n\r\nAppreciate any guidance on structuring a query. By way of more information, if this isn&#39;t possible in Mongo, I guess the argument can be made to do it in JS (Node) but given my dataset for a particular stock will return about 1000 records, I wasn&#39;t sure about the efficiency of doing the distinct query in JS (or, indeed, how to do that in JS).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412310/how-to-do-a-sorted-distinct-query-for-a-specific-set-of-records-on-mongo","title":"How to do a sorted distinct query for a specific set of records on Mongo?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":7211815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qt3B.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codrelphi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7211815/codrelphi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226499,"post_id":58412320,"comment_id":103168180,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412309/how-can-i-split-the-second-line-when-the-keyword-match-two-lines-by-python/58412320#comment103168180_58412320"},{"owner":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":499,"user_id":7211815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qt3B.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codrelphi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7211815/codrelphi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226841,"post_id":58412320,"comment_id":103168361,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412309/how-can-i-split-the-second-line-when-the-keyword-match-two-lines-by-python/58412320#comment103168361_58412320"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571226834,"last_edit_date":1571226834,"creation_date":1571225695,"answer_id":58412320,"question_id":58412309,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412320","body_markdown":"you can split each line by `&#39;19:07:57.166 [INFO]keyword = 3&#39;.split(&#39;[INFO]&#39;)`\r\n\r\nor you can do it with regex\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\nline = &#39;19:07:57.166 [INFO]keyword = 3&#39;\r\nresult = re.match(&#39;(.*)\\[INFO\\](.*)&#39;, line)\r\nresult.group(1) #

I eventually wanna call the URL with JavaScript so I need it to work with a link (and in the future query parameters too, but that&#39;s the next step).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412300/accessing-python-file-deployed-to-heroku-via-url-app-crashed","title":"Accessing python file deployed to Heroku via URL: App crashed"},{"tags":["android","ionic-framework","in-app-purchase","cordova-plugins","ionic4"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":441,"user_id":9328846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3faa5d96d89e17c614d6e1fc3f5d67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"edn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9328846/edn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571308811,"post_id":58416231,"comment_id":103201963,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412298/how-to-remember-the-purchased-credit-in-the-ionic-app-implementation/58416231#comment103201963_58416231"},{"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":4278381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001329722579/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shailesh Bhokare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4278381/shailesh-bhokare"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":441,"user_id":9328846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3faa5d96d89e17c614d6e1fc3f5d67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"edn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9328846/edn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571410840,"post_id":58416231,"comment_id":103244476,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412298/how-to-remember-the-purchased-credit-in-the-ionic-app-implementation/58416231#comment103244476_58416231"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":4278381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001329722579/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shailesh Bhokare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4278381/shailesh-bhokare"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571237661,"creation_date":1571237661,"answer_id":58416231,"question_id":58412298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416231","body_markdown":"yes you can store user&#39;s credit information in users mobiles using **Ionic Offline Storage**.

I am intending to implement an application in which I will have a **table** where each row includes some unique data (independent from other rows).\r\n\r\nI would like to implement a credit mechanism where a user - e.g. - purchases 100 credits (via in-app purchases); and whenever s/he wants to see the content of a particular row in the **table**, s/he will need to spend - e.g. - 10 credits.\r\n\r\n**Example:** In the beginning, the user has 0 credit. Then s/he buys 100 credits and then chooses to see the content of 3 rows in the table (each row costing 10 credits). And at the end, s/he still has 70 credits.\r\n\r\n**Targets I have:**\r\n\r\n - I would like to implement this procedure without forcing the user to create a membership account. With other words, installing the app shall be enough to start buying credits without further registration.\r\n - I do not want to save the user credit information in a database to later be able to remember how many credits the user still has.\r\n - I want the mobile app to remember the amount of credit it has even if the user does not use the application for a while or restarts the mobile phone, etc.\r\n\r\nI am implementing this app by using Ionic (Angular). Can this implementation be done as explained above (without a database for remembering the user credit info)? If no, why..? If yes, how can it be done?\r\n\r\n**Addendum:** \r\nIf you have experience/knowledge in developing such a functionality in a different way than how I described it above, you are welcome to share it as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412298/how-to-remember-the-purchased-credit-in-the-ionic-app-implementation","title":"How to remember the purchased credit in the ionic app implementation"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2017"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571225608,"post_id":58412296,"comment_id":103167679,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017#comment103167679_58412296"},{"owner":{"reputation":19805,"user_id":4137916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bab91fda70af7e9beb8934d323540e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeroen Mostert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4137916/jeroen-mostert"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571226034,"post_id":58412296,"comment_id":103167889,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017#comment103167889_58412296"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":2180079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H8v0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reza Yousefi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2180079/reza-yousefi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571231024,"post_id":58413079,"comment_id":103170881,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017/58413079#comment103170881_58413079"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":2180079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H8v0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reza Yousefi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2180079/reza-yousefi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571228073,"creation_date":1571228073,"answer_id":58413079,"question_id":58412296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58413079","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\nUse this\r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n        d.value(&#39;GroupUserName[1]&#39;, &#39;nvarchar(100)&#39;)  AS GroupUserName\r\n        ,(SELECT \r\n            f.value(&#39;Name[1]&#39;, &#39;varchar(50)&#39;) AS &#39;Name&#39;\r\n    \t\t,f.value(&#39;Description[1]&#39;, &#39;varchar(50)&#39;) AS &#39;Description&#39;\r\n            FROM c.d.nodes(&#39;Roles/Role&#39;) AS e(f)            \r\n            FOR JSON PATH) &#39;Roles&#39;\r\n    FROM @xml.nodes(&#39;/Policies/Policy&#39;) AS c(d)\r\n    FOR JSON PATH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412296/how-to-convert-xml-to-json-in-sql-server-2017/58413079#58413079","title":"How to Convert XML to JSON in SQL Server 2017?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5566400,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0hdCMYGOeqI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB2o/FfRvtMs0xYE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alireza Mokhtari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5566400/alireza-mokhtari"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571238160,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571228073,"creation_date":1571225566,"last_edit_date":1571225754,"question_id":58412296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58412296","body_markdown":"I would like to convert an XML column into a JSON string.\r\n\r\nXML:\r\n    \r\n    &lt;Policies&gt;\r\n      &lt;Policy&gt;\r\n        &lt;GroupUserName&gt;testX&lt;/GroupUserName&gt;\r\n        &lt;Roles&gt;\r\n          &lt;Role&gt;\r\n            &lt;Name&gt;Browser&lt;/Name&gt;\r\n            &lt;Description&gt;May view folders, reports and subscribe to reports.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Role&gt;\r\n          &lt;Role&gt;\r\n            &lt;Name&gt;Content Manager&lt;/Name&gt;\r\n            &lt;Description&gt;May manage content in the Report Server.

My question in my mind is why aren&#39;t they moving to other top modern browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera or any listed from [here][1]. Since IE support with older version ended 1/12/16, [see reference here][2]. And also, using up-to-date software is the best way to avoid the attackers [Here][3] is the link why up-to-date software is important even though it talks about in general.\r\n\r\nBtw, I can&#39;t ask the client why because they don&#39;t have technical knowledge.

two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Why can I see the `depth` and `blendedColor` in my viewer, if my render target is texture?\r\n2. How can I inspect, what is being rendered in the textures `depthTexture` and `imageTexture`?\r\n   - Is there some way to save these textures as images, for example?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412253/how-to-properly-define-two-qrendertargets-in-qt3d-for-depth-and-color-informatio","title":"How to properly define two QRenderTargets in

Retrieve information in the bullet list at the bottom of the tooltip.\r\n 4. Write a textMateRules which scope matches the tooltip scope.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Doxygen, the following Textmate rule in the `settings.json` file do recolor the Doxygen keywords with a custom color :\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;editor.tokenColorCustomizations&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;textMateRules&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;scope&quot;:&quot;storage.type.class.doxygen&quot;,\r\n      &quot;settings&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;foreground&quot;: &quot;#6272A4&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this only recolor the `@param` tag.

of `break` from inner `while` you should `return` otherwise, the code is evaluating all combination via outer `while` loop. \r\n\r\nAlso, you can follow the below optimal approach which uses dictionary based approach to evaluate the sum in one pass (in one while loop).\r\n\r\nDetails about code:\r\n\r\n- The below program supports fast look up by using `Dictionary`.\r\n- The list is iterated and inserts elements into the Dictionary, It also look back to check if current element&#39;s complement already exists in the Dictionary. I\r\n- The program checks if each element&#39;s complement (target - nums[i]) exists in the `Dictionary`.

Is there any API in MapR which gives me provision to do so. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/mapr-setup.sh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412198/how-to-generate-mapr-ticket-in-python-code","title":"How to generate MapR ticket in Python Code"},{"tags":["python","pandas","csv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571225986,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103167865,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103167865_58412196"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226299,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103168064,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103168064_58412196"},{"owner":{"reputation":1365,"user_id":6789321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-B5oSDMyNAyc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAT6s/i6ZRf_boOu4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"accdias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6789321/accdias"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226666,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103168267,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103168267_58412196"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571227379,"post_id":58412196,"comment_id":103168691,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan#comment103168691_58412196"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571228085,"post_id":58412845,"comment_id":103169109,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan/58412845#comment103169109_58412845"},{"owner":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8893284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f888a2a5a936a4d6847467365f7d870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert Zandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893284/robert-zandberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571228721,"post_id":58412845,"comment_id":103169500,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412196/fill-a-new-column-by-a-function-that-uses-2-existing-columns-with-python-and-pan/58412845#comment103169500_58412845"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13527,"user_id":9081267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZooO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erfan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9081267/erfan"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571227347,"creation_date":1571227347,"answer_id":58412845,"question_id":58412196,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412845","body_markdown":"I think the easiest and fastest what you can do here is to `merge` (read: `join`) both dataframes on the deperature postcal code and arrival postal code.

Unfortunately, in this case they have to be separate.\r\n\r\nEverything else works if they&#39;re separate (and has for years), it&#39;s just SignalR that&#39;s not.\r\n\r\nEdit : Answers to questions\r\n\r\n**sideshowbarker  : What’s the HTTP status code of the response?

If it&#39;s on the same server as you state here then the URL for the SignalR hub would surely be our.test.server.com:89/Test**\r\n\r\nSorry, I wasn&#39;t very clear there.\r\n\r\nBoth are on the same server (our test server), so both can indeed by accessed by http://our.test.server.com...\r\n\r\nHowever, I specifically need to test when the Web Front End and the RestAPI are on different servers (which they are when Live on our clients&#39; systems).\r\n\r\nSo, in the config file, I specified the URL for the RestAPI as &#39;http://localhost:89/Test&#39; rather than &#39;http://our.test.server.com:89/Test&#39;\r\n\r\nAaaand typing up this reply has just made me realise what the problem is, THANK YOU! :)\r\n\r\nUp until now, the WFE has only ever spoken to the RestAPI directly, and so &#39;http://localhost:89/Test&#39; refers to the local host for our test server that the WFE is on, and so that works.\r\n\r\nBut of course like an idiot I&#39;m passing the same value to the browser now for the SignalR connection to use, so it&#39;s looking at **my** localhost.\r\n\r\nChanged the value in the config file to &#39;http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test&#39;, different URL pointing to the same place, and now it all works!\r\n\r\nBig thanks, **strickt01** ! :)\r\n\r\nEdit #2 : Another question\r\n\r\n**fran : but you are still going to have a problem in your production environment because you will have 2 different origins. are you using some sort of authentication in your wfe? I suspect you don&#39;t have any problem making calls currently because you wfe is calling into controllers running under the same origin, then your wfe controllers are the ones that are making the calls to the web service. In this case you don&#39;t have a CORS issue because it&#39;s server to server communication**\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using two different origins now.\r\n\r\nThe WFE is on http://our.test.server.com/Test\r\n\r\nThe RestAPI is on http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test\r\n\r\nDifferent URLs and different ports, both of which should throw a CORS error.\r\n\r\nInternally within the test server, the WFE is calling the RestAPI from http://our.test.server.com/Test to http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test. They are on the same server, but they don&#39;t actually know that.\r\n\r\nFrom the User perspective, in my browser I log on to http://our.test.server.com/Test. That&#39;s the origin as far as the browser is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen I make a SignalR call, that connects to http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test because that&#39;s the URL in the config file, which is passed as the URL to connect to.\r\n\r\nSignalR does treat this as a cross domain connection, I get the following in the Console output:-\r\n\r\n    SignalR: Auto detected cross domain url.\r\n    SignalR: Negotiating with &#39;http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/negotiate?clientProtocol=2.1&amp;t&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&#39;.\r\n    SignalR: webSockets transport starting.\r\n    SignalR: Connecting to websocket endpoint &#39;ws://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/connect?transport=webSockets&amp;clientProtocol=2.1&amp;t&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&amp;connectionToken=&lt;token&gt;&amp;tid=0&#39;.\r\n    SignalR: Websocket opened.\r\n    SignalR: webSockets transport connected. Initiating start request.\r\n    SignalR: The start request succeeded. Transitioning to the connected state.\r\n    SignalR: Now monitoring keep alive with a warning timeout of 13333.333333333332, keep alive timeout of 20000 and disconnecting timeout of 30000.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure, I removed the line **app.UseCors(CorsOptions.AllowAll);** from the Startup class and tried again.\r\n\r\nThis time it failed with a CORS error:-\r\n\r\n    SignalR: Auto detected cross domain url.\r\n    SignalR: Negotiating with &#39;http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/negotiate?clientProtocol=2.1&amp;&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&#39;.\r\n    Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://our.test.server.othername.com:89/Test/socket/negotiate?clientProtocol=2.1&amp;&lt;my passed parameters&gt;&amp;_=1571242017811. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).\r\n    SignalR: Stopping connection.\r\n\r\nSo, definitely testing with cross origin, and definitely working!\r\n\r\nThanks for making me double-check though, always worth doing! :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412185/c-signalr-on-webapi-rejecting-cors","title":"C# SignalR on WebAPI rejecting CORS"},{"tags":["c#","task-parallel-library"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":19805,"user_id":4137916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bab91fda70af7e9beb8934d323540e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeroen Mostert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4137916/jeroen-mostert"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571225570,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167649,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167649_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571225745,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167750,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167750_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571225957,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167848,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167848_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":5758,"user_id":759558,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kz2la.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/759558/neil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226053,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167899,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167899_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571226145,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103167952,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103167952_58412183"},{"owner":{"reputation":126223,"user_id":2319407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/98O16.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitry Bychenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2319407/dmitry-bychenko"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571226302,"post_id":58412183,"comment_id":103168068,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412183/possible-deadlock-when-awaiting-multiple-tasks#comment103168068_58412183"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":196,"user_id":10791800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/329a89acfcae9d7739e524b0ca6ebaa8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chill94","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10791800/chill94"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571226028,"creation_date":1571226028,"answer_id":58412437,"question_id":58412183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412437","body_markdown":"I believe the confusion is that Task.WaitAll is the synchronous version of the (better) Task.WhenAll method.
