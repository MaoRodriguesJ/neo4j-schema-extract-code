made an attempt at this and am not altogether happy with the results but thought I would share my ideas and some code and anyone else is welcome to take, borrow, steal or develop any ideas further.\r\n\r\nI think some of the issues stem from the choice of Canny as the edge detection because it results in two edges, so my first plan of attack was to replace that with a skeletonisaton from scikit-image. That gives this as the `edge` image:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThen I decided to use HoughLinesP rather than HoughLines, but it didn&#39;t seem to find much. I tried increasing and decreasing the resolution parameters but it didn&#39;t help. So, I decided to dilate (fatten) the skeleton a bit and then it seems to start detecting the shapes better, and I get this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI am not sure why it is so sensitive to line thickness and, as I said, if anyone else want to take it and experiment, here&#39;s where I got to with the code:\r\n\r\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n    \r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import cv2\r\n    from skimage.morphology import medial_axis, dilation, disk\r\n    \r\n    def loadImageGray(path):\r\n        img=cv2.imread(path,0)\r\n        return img\r\n    \r\n    def LineTransform(img): \r\n        # Try skeletonising image rather than Canny edge - only one line instead of both sides of line\r\n        skeleton = (medial_axis(255-img)*255).astype(np.uint8)\r\n        cv2.imwrite(&#39;skeleton.png&#39;,skeleton)\r\n    \r\n        # Try dilating skeleton to make it fatter and more detectable\r\n        selem = disk(2)\r\n        fatskel = dilation(skeleton,selem)\r\n        cv2.imwrite(&#39;fatskeleton.png&#39;,fatskel)\r\n    \r\n        minLineLength = 10\r\n        maxLineGap = 20\r\n        lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(fatskel,1,np.pi/180,100,minLineLength,maxLineGap)\r\n        return lines\r\n    \r\n    def saveLines(liness):\r\n        img=np.zeros((2000,2000,3), np.uint8)\r\n        for lines in liness:\r\n            for x1,y1,x2,y2 in lines:\r\n                print(x1,y1,x2,y2)\r\n                img=cv2.line(img,(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(0,255,0),3)\r\n

code above and ignore the skeletonisation and fattening, and just use the inverse of the original image for HoughLinesP, the results are pretty similar:\r\n\r\n    def LineTransform(img): \r\n        minLineLength = 10\r\n        maxLineGap = 20\r\n        lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(255-img,1,np.pi/180,100,minLineLength,maxLineGap)\r\n        return lines\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

In other words I&#39;m trying to vectorize the image to a set of lines. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have already looked at the [HoughLinesTransform][1], however this does not cover every part of the image and is more about finding the lines in the image rather than fully converting the image to a line representation. In addition the line transform does not encode the actual width of the lines leaving me guessing at how to reconstruct the images back (which I need to do as this is a preproccesing step towards training a machine learning algorithm). \r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I tried the following code using the houghLineTransform: \r\n\r\n \r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport cv2\r\n\r\nMetersPerPixel=0.1\r\n\r\ndef loadImageGray(path):\r\n    img=(cv2.imread(path,0))\r\n    return img\r\n\r\ndef LineTransform(img):\r\n    edges = cv2.Canny(img,50,150,apertureSize = 3)\r\n    minLineLength = 10\r\n    maxLineGap = 20\r\n    lines = cv2.HoughLines(edges,1,np.pi/180,100,minLineLength,maxLineGap)\r\n    return lines;\r\n\r\ndef saveLines(liness):\r\n    img=np.zeros((2000,2000,3), np.uint8)\r\n    for lines in liness:\r\n        for x1,y1,x2,y2 in lines:\r\n    \t    print(x1,y1,x2,y2)\r\n    \t    img=cv2.line(img,(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(0,255,0),3)\r\n    cv2.imwrite(&#39;houghlines5.jpg&#39;,img)\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    img=loadImageGray(&quot;loadtest.png&quot;)\r\n    lines=LineTransform(img)\r\n    saveLines(lines)\r\n\r\nmain()\r\n```       \r\n    \r\n\r\nHowever when tested using the following ![image][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nI got this image: \r\n[![output][3]][3]\r\n\r\nAs you can see it is missing lines that are not axis aligned and if you look closely even the detected lines have been split into 2 lines with some space between them. I also had to draw these images with a preset width while the real width isn&#39;t known. \r\n\r\nEdit: on the suggestion of @MarkSetchell I tried the pypotrace by using the following code, currently it largely ignored bezier curves and just tries to act like they are straight lines, I will focus on that problem later, however right now the results aren&#39;t optimal either: \r\n    \r\n```python\r\ndef TraceLines(img):\r\n    bmp = potrace.Bitmap(bitmap(img))\r\n    path=bmp.trace()\r\n    lines=[]\r\n    i=0\r\n    for curve in path:\r\n        for segment in curve:\r\n            print(repr(segment))\r\n            if segment.is_corner:\r\n                c_x, c_y = segment.c\r\n                c2_x ,c2_y= segment.end_point\r\n                            lines.append([[int(c_x), int(c_y),int(c2_x) ,int(c2_y)]])\r\n\r\n            else:\r\n                c_x, c_y = segment.c1\r\n                c2_x ,c2_y= segment.end_point\r\n            i=i+1\r\n    return lines\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthis results in this image [![image][4]][4], which is an improvement, however while the problem with the circle can be addressed at a later point the missing parts of the square and the weird artefacts on the other straight lines are more problematic. Anyone know how to fix them? Any tips on how to get the line widths? \r\n\r\nAnybody got any suggestions on how to better approach this problem? \r\n\r\nedit edit: here is another test image : [![variable wall width][5]][5], it includes multiple line widths I would like to capture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.opencv.org2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/feature_detection.html?highlight=houghlines#houghlines\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9CELS.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/00Di8.jpg\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMWVr.jpg\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WWh2v.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340068/fully-convert-a-black-and-white-image-to-a-set-of-lines-aka-vectorize-using-onl","title":"Fully convert a black and white image to a set of lines (aka vectorize using only lines)"},{"tags":["java","spring","hibernate","spring-boot","hibernate-mapping"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":5482189,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jv5rV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"P&#233;ter Bencze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5482189/p%c3%a9ter-bencze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570793299,"post_id":58340266,"comment_id":103035843,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340066/how-to-fix-a-different-object-with-the-same-identifier-value-was-already-associ/58340266#comment103035843_58340266"},{"owner":{"reputation":554,"user_id":4239364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6GtGW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ioannis Barakos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4239364/ioannis-barakos"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":31,"user_id":5482189,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jv5rV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"P&#233;ter Bencze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5482189/p%c3%a9ter-bencze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570793631,"post_id":58340266,"comment_id":103035985,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340066/how-to-fix-a-different-object-with-the-same-identifier-value-was-already-associ/58340266#comment103035985_58340266"},{"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":5482189,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jv5rV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"P&#233;ter Bencze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5482189/p%c3%a9ter-bencze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570794525,"post_id":58340266,"comment_id":103036489,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340066/how-to-fix-a-different-object-with-the-same-identifier-value-was-already-associ/58340266#comment103036489_58340266"},{"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":5482189,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jv5rV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"P&#233;ter Bencze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5482189/p%c3%a9ter-bencze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570796465,"post_id":58340266,"comment_id":103037492,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340066/how-to-fix-a-different-object-with-the-same-identifier-value-was-already-associ/58340266#comment103037492_58340266"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":554,"user_id":4239364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6GtGW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ioannis Barakos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4239364/ioannis-barakos"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570793064,"creation_date":1570793064,"answer_id":58340266,"question_id":58340066,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340266","body_markdown":"Try this\r\n\r\n     @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n     @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn\r\n     private Project project;\r\n\r\nIn your CrawlerConfiguration entity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340066/how-to-fix-a-different-object-with-the-same-identifier-value-was-already-associ/58340266#58340266","title":"How to fix &quot;A different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session&quot;

If you take a look at the MailActionExecuter class you&#39;ll see that it has several parameters defined:\r\n\r\n    public static final String NAME = &quot;mail&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_LOCALE = &quot;locale&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_TO = &quot;to&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_CC = &quot;cc&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_BCC = &quot;bcc&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_TO_MANY = &quot;to_many&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_SUBJECT = &quot;subject&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_SUBJECT_PARAMS = &quot;subjectParams&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_TEXT = &quot;text&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_HTML = &quot;html&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_FROM = &quot;from&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_FROM_PERSONAL_NAME = &quot;fromPersonalName&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_TEMPLATE = &quot;template&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_TEMPLATE_MODEL = &quot;template_model&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_IGNORE_SEND_FAILURE = &quot;ignore_send_failure&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PARAM_SEND_AFTER_COMMIT = &quot;send_after_commit&quot;;\r\n\r\n\r\n One of those is PARAM_TEMPLATE_MODEL which you would set by using &quot;template_model&quot;. The &quot;model&quot; in that parameter is what should be catching your eye. It means you can pass in a set of keys and values by using that parameter.\r\n\r\nLater, in the source for that class we see where the parameter is read and then used to build the full model that is then passed in to the Freemarker template:\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; suppliedModel = null;\r\n    if(ruleAction.getParameterValue(PARAM_TEMPLATE_MODEL) != null)\r\n    {\r\n        Object m = ruleAction.getParameterValue(PARAM_TEMPLATE_MODEL);\r\n        if(m instanceof Map)\r\n        {\r\n            suppliedModel = (Map&lt;String, Object&gt;)m;\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            logger.warn(&quot;Skipping unsupported email template model parameters of type &quot; + m.getClass().getName() + &quot; : &quot; + m.toString());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n                        \r\n    // build the email template model\r\n    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; model = createEmailTemplateModel(actionedUponNodeRef, suppliedModel, fromPerson, toRecipients);\r\n\r\nSo, if you comment in the reference to the template and you pass in an additional parameter to the action, assuming your template makes use of the items you add to the model, you should see those in the resulting email.\r\n\r\nYour code would look something like:\r\n\r\n    var templateModel = {};\r\n    templateModel[&quot;fullName&quot;] = fullName;\r\n    templateModel[&quot;manager&quot;] =

It&#39;s impossible to see just one row. \n\nI don&#39;t have exact implemenation details but the main idea is every record has associated last modified transaction number. When other transaction reads data it checks the status of the last modified record transaction (and their own isolation level) and fetches only allowed records. (This is a pretty common for any MVCC databases)\n\nMoreover even when fetching transaction has RC isolation level each query before execution makes a snapshot of currently active transaction statuses and uses it to perform check above. It actually means that every query runs in SNAPSHOT isolation level.

Or is there some other locking mechanism?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340005/is-oracle-db-truly-isolated-during-execution-of-commit","title":"Is Oracle DB truly isolated during execution of COMMIT?"},{"tags":["android","unity3d"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1073,"user_id":3999808,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVpV8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3999808/zun"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570792994,"post_id":58340004,"comment_id":103035711,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340004/reducing-unity-android-build-size#comment103035711_58340004"},{"owner":{"reputation":3726,"user_id":34170,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIF3m.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Philipp Lenssen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34170/philipp-lenssen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1073,"user_id":3999808,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVpV8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3999808/zun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570794253,"post_id":58340004,"comment_id":103036329,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340004/reducing-unity-android-build-size#comment103036329_58340004"}],"owner":{"reputation":3726,"user_id":34170,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIF3m.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Philipp Lenssen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34170/philipp-lenssen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3726,"user_id":34170,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIF3m.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Philipp Lenssen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34170/philipp-lenssen"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570795100,"creation_date":1570792169,"last_edit_date":1570795100,"question_id":58340004,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340004","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get the Unity mobile Android APK build size to below 150mb, but it&#39;s currently at 170mb. I&#39;m reading through many online docs, but can&#39;t find anything that so far reduced my build size. (For reference, I&#39;m creating a &quot;Virtual OS&quot; where many virtual apps are bundled into one, and can be experienced in many different environments, so that increases size.)\r\n\r\nMy main question is, **how can I find the biggest file size &quot;offenders&quot; in my project**? Unity&#39;s doc tells me to look into the Editor Log&#39;s Build Report list, but the files mentioned in the top there (as &quot;uncompressed&quot;, e.g. my 20k something PNG becomes a 1+mb file in that list), mainly textures, do not actually help when I next time remove them in another test build. Neither does it relevantly help when I change the Android texture setting to something more highly compressed (e.g. 1024 max Mitchell, which I had for most of my files anyway).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried both APK building, as well as ABB, but both results are quite big. (Switching the API Compatibility Level from .NET 4x to 2 doesn&#39;t help either.) I&#39;m compiling to 64bit architecture.\r\n\r\nEdit: A first big improvement became removing an (unneeded for Android) Oculus directory (and accompanying Package Manager packages).

**does** create **unique** hashes for every commit. (theoretically there is a very small chance for collision, but that is very improbable).\r\n\r\nAs explained in [this][1] answer, `git` uses the following information to generate the hash:\r\n\r\n - The source tree of the commit (which unravels to all the subtrees and\r\n   blobs) \r\n - The parent commit sha1 \r\n - The author info (with timestamp)\r\n - The committer info (right, those are different, also with timestamp)\r\n - The commit message\r\n\r\nsince the timestamp is integrated, you will never just have two same hashes for the same &quot;content&quot;.\r\n\r\nYou can however have multiple **references** pointing to the same commit hash: **tags**, **branches**.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\nDepending on what you want you can:\r\n\r\n - just use the git commit hashes, since they are **unique** for each commit. If two branches point to the same commit, you will analyze only once, but depending on your need that might not be necessary since it really is the exact same commit.\r\n - you can combine the git commit hash with the branch name if you really want an analysis for each branch, even if they point to the exact same code.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34764195/how-does-git-create-unique-commit-hashes-mainly-the-first-few-characters/34764586#34764586","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339984/does-bitbucket-git-provide-unique-identifiers-for-branches-and-commits/58340430#58340430","title":"Does bitbucket/git provide unique identifiers for branches and commits?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12200166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DAlki0vmf_0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re961AF14qekB87DG5WnGfZZkhsnQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"wvoq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12200166/wvoq"},"last_editor":{"reputation":17828,"user_id":2082964,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iybex.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chris Maes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2082964/chris-maes"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570793706,"creation_date":1570792118,"last_edit_date":1570793706,"question_id":58339984,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58339984","body_markdown":"We are trying to build a analytics dataset for our bitbucket repositories.

need to find all value that are present in all sublist of a larger list (they are all ids).\r\n\r\nIf we make those sublists into a single list, our &quot;values that are present in all sublists&quot; will be there exactly `len(LL)` times (In this case: 3). ;)\r\n\r\nThis can be done in a single line using Counter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom collections import Counter\r\n\r\nresult = [key for key, value in Counter(elem for sub_list in LL for elem in set(sub_list)).items() if value == len(LL)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- `set(sub_list)` - we get rid of unexpected duplicates in sublists to not mess up our count\r\n- `(elem for sub_list in LL for elem in set(sub_list))` - flattening it into a single iterable\r\n- `Counter` - returns the dictionary with how many times each element was present in the iterable\r\n- `dict.items()` gets keys and values as pairs\r\n- `if value == len(LL)` - filter the keys that are present in every sublist\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Edit: For more readability what is

It does the work but it is not optimized : I concatenate multiples float values into a giant string that I will immediately de-concatenate and convert back to float. That seem necessary and costly.\r\n\r\n2) Removing the group by entirely and do the count and standard deviation though **partitioning**. But that seems even worse to me. I don&#39;t know if PLSQL/oracle optimizes this, it could be calculating the same count and standard deviation for every line (I don&#39;t know how to check this). The query result also becomes messy: since there is no &#39;group by&#39; anymore, I have to do add multiple checks in my python file in order to differentiate every test data (specific id, name and temperature). \r\n\r\nI think that my first solution can be improved but I don&#39;t know how. How can I use a group by but still access every number values **cleverly** ? \r\n\r\nA function similar to list_agg but with a collection/array output type instead of a string output type could maybe do the trick (a sort of &#39;array_agg&#39; compatible with oracle), but I don&#39;t know any.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nThe sample data is complex and probably restricted to the company viewing, but I can show you my simplified query for my 1) :\r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n        rav.rav_testid as test_id, \r\n        tte.tte_testname as test_name,\r\n        tsc.tsc_temperature as temperature,\r\n        listagg(rav.rav_value, &#39; &#39;)WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rav.rav_value) as all_specific_test_values,\r\n        COUNT(rav.rav_value) as n, \r\n        STDDEV(rav.rav_value) as sigma,\r\n        \r\n    FROM\r\n        ...\r\n        (8 inner joins)\r\n    \r\n\r\n    GROUP BY\r\n        rav.rqv_testid, tte.tte_testname,tsc.tsc_temperature\r\n        \r\n    ORDER BY\r\n        rav.RAV_testid, tte.tte_testname, spd.SPD_SPLITNAMEINTERNAL,tsc.tsc_temperature\r\n\r\nThe result looks like :\r\n\r\n    test_id | test_name  | temperature | all_specific_test_values | n | sigma\r\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    6001    |VADC_A(...) | -40         | ,8094034194946289 ,8(...)| 58 | 0,54\r\n    6001    |VADC_A(...) |  25         | ,5054857852946545 ,6(...)| 56 | 0,24\r\n    6001    |VADC_A(...) |  150        | ,8625754277452524 ,4(...)| 56 | 0,26\r\n    6002    |VADC_B(...) | -40         | ,9874514651548454 ,5(...)| 57 | 0,44\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339942/how-to-use-a-group-by-but-still-access-every-number-values-cleverly","title":"How to use a group by but still access every number values cleverly"},{"tags":["javascript","design-patterns","rxjs"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12111,"user_id":1675492,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsMph.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ingo B&#252;rk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1675492/ingo-b%c3%bcrk"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570793520,"post_id":58340288,"comment_id":103035940,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339932/rxjs-nested-subscribe-with-multiple-inner-subscriptions/58340288#comment103035940_58340288"},{"owner":{"reputation":1534,"user_id":7493840,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/227486944377608/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sereja Bogolubov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7493840/sereja-bogolubov"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12111,"user_id":1675492,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsMph.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ingo B&#252;rk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1675492/ingo-b%c3%bcrk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570793632,"post_id":58340288,"comment_id":103035986,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339932/rxjs-nested-subscribe-with-multiple-inner-subscriptions/58340288#comment103035986_58340288"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1534,"user_id":7493840,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/227486944377608/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sereja Bogolubov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7493840/sereja-bogolubov"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570793140,"creation_date":1570793140,"answer_id":58340288,"question_id":58339932,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340288","body_markdown":"That seems pretty strange to me.

The dataframe looks like:\r\n\r\n![screenshot datatable][1]\r\n\r\nIn the first column, &quot;Company ID&quot; there is the company ID: a unique identifier for each company. While on column &quot;Tags&quot; there are the tags associated with each company. For instance, the company with ID 1 has the following tags: opf, oxidation, resource efficiency, textiles. bAsically the tags describe the company&#39;s technology and its applications.\r\n\r\nAs of today, the dataframe counts 1.000 companies and 15.000 tags.\r\n\r\nI have populated this dataframe manually. Basically, for each company, I have browsed its website and looked for keywords to use as tags and added them to my dataframe. Despite this approach is pretty accurate, it is super time-consuming. I need to repeat this procedure to add new companies to my dataframe. I want to automatize it.\r\n\r\nMy idea is the following:\r\n\r\n1. Open the website of a new company - not within the 1.000 in my original dataframe - with selenium webdriver (through Python);\r\n\r\n2. Take all the available text on the home page and the other website pages and concatenate all the gathered text in a string (from now on we will call this string: string_).\r\n\r\n3. Then I will loop each of the 15.000 tags already in my dataframe in string_. If the tag is in there I will save and keep it else, I will discard it.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a major drawback: How can I train and teach to my code to find new keywords not already among the existing 15.000 tags in my dataframe? At the same time, how can I teach the code to choose only pertinent keywords which describes the technology and its applications?\r\n\r\nI will lose all the keywords on the website that are not in my current dataframe with 15.000 tags. A minor solution for this is to include all the synonyms of my tags (something like [this][2]). For me, this is not enough.\r\n\r\nPlus, I know that there are some Python libraries that extract keywords from a text, but string_ is not a structured text, but just some chunk of text concatenated together. I tried [this][3], but the code was extracting random words like &quot;About&quot;, &quot;Facebook&quot;, &quot;Contact Us&quot; etc..\r\n\r\nCan you please advise which approach would you adopt in order to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I want to write a code which able to extract tags from the 15.000 keywords I have already in my dataframe and new ones that are not included.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://res.cloudinary.com/eutop/image/upload/v1570743879/samples/Picture1_u76vn4.png\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19258652/how-to-get-synonyms-from-nltk-wordnet-python\r\n  [3]: https://towardsdatascience.com/textrank-for-keyword-extraction-by-python-c0bae21bcec0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339917/extract-keywords-from-websites-with-python","title":"Extract keywords from websites with python"},{"tags":["php","laravel","laravel-5","eloquent"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":825,"user_id":4339402,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6553ccd6ea5acd32f07c532971e9a32a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"IGP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4339402/igp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570795400,"post_id":58339916,"comment_id":103036939,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339916/is-there-an-easier-way-to-code-laravel-eloquent-models-besides-what-i-have-here#comment103036939_58339916"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12200435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gA0C0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Siembab","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12200435/david-siembab"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":825,"user_id":4339402,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6553ccd6ea5acd32f07c532971e9a32a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"IGP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4339402/igp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570838299,"post_id":58339916,"comment_id":103054300,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339916/is-there-an-easier-way-to-code-laravel-eloquent-models-besides-what-i-have-here#comment103054300_58339916"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12200435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gA0C0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Siembab","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12200435/david-siembab"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570793626,"post_id":58340293,"comment_id":103035980,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339916/is-there-an-easier-way-to-code-laravel-eloquent-models-besides-what-i-have-here/58340293#comment103035980_58340293"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":12162884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d84a89f849434f0b49a1056245fa5571?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Johannn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12162884/johannn"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570793164,"creation_date":1570793164,"answer_id":58340293,"question_id":58339916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340293","body_markdown":"What you&#39;re probably looking for is [firstOrCreate][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; There are two other methods you may use to create models by mass\r\n&gt; assigning attributes: firstOrCreate and firstOrNew.

But for typecasting you again need to have a switch case.\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided in two ways.\r\n\r\n1. Store the type along with the data. i.e, store `(tag, type, time, value)`. Then you can have a limited no of conditions for the types.\r\n\r\n        void *ptr[11] = {&amp;profiles.param1, &amp;profiles.param2,  &amp;profiles.param3,,,,,, &amp;profiles.param11};\r\n        \r\n        switch (type)\r\n        {\r\n            case 0:\r\n                *(char*)ptr[tag-1] = value;\r\n                break;\r\n            case 1:\r\n                *(int*)ptr[tag-1] = value;\r\n                break;\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n\r\n2.

The format we are using is the following:\r\nTag + Time + value.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to take a logged message and send it to a server using Protocol Buffers to serialize the data.\r\n\r\nThe protocol buffer .proto file, provides a struct with all the fields each corresponding to a tag in the original logging system.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes when I need to efficiently read the tag and assign the value to a field in the protocol buffer struct. In essence I would for example like to take in tag 5 and be able to find the field 5 in the struct and write the value.\r\n\r\nI know this could be done with switch cases, but we are using around 50 tags so I would like to avoid this solution if possible. I attach an example struct to illustrate the problem.\r\n\r\n    /* Struct definitions */\r\n    typedef struct _Profiles {\r\n        int32_t param1;\r\n        int32_t param2;\r\n        int32_t param3;\r\n        int32_t param4;\r\n        int32_t param5;\r\n        int16_t param6;\r\n        int32_t param7;\r\n        uint32_t param8;\r\n        int32_t param9;\r\n        int32_t param10;\r\n        uint32_t param11;\r\n        int32_t time;\r\n    /* @@protoc_insertion_point(struct:Profiles) */\r\n    } Profiles;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected result would be that I can store a logged line like the following:\r\n5 1345643 1500 (tag, time, value)\r\n\r\nto a protocol buffer struct:\r\n\r\n    profiles.param5 = 1500\r\n    profiles.time  = 1345643 \r\n\r\nwithout the need of 12 switch cases (in this example). Basically, how can I access the 5th declared field of a struct using an integer/enum.\r\n\r\nBare in mind that each field of the struct could potentially have a different

task can be accomplished by implementing two main steps:\r\n\r\n**1**) Parse given input and build an [Abstract Syntax Tree][1] (AST).\r\n\r\n**2**) Traverse the tree and validate each function, each argument, one after another, using a Listener or a Visitor patterns.\r\n\r\nFortunately, ANTLR provides tools for implementing both steps.&lt;br&gt;\r\nHere&#39;s a simple grammar I wrote based on your example. It does recursive parsing and builds the AST. You may want to extend its functionality to meet your needs. \r\n\r\n**Lexer**:\r\n\r\n    lexer grammar MyFunctionsLexer;\r\n    \r\n    FUNCTION: &#39;FUNCTION&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    NAME: [A-Z]+;\r\n    \r\n    DOT: &#39;.&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    COMMA: &#39;,&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    L_BRACKET: &#39;(&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    R_BRACKET: &#39;)&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    WS : [ \\t\\r\\n]+ -&gt; skip;\r\n\r\n**Parser**:\r\n\r\n    parser grammar MyFunctionsParser;\r\n    \r\n    options {\r\n    \ttokenVocab=MyFunctionsLexer;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function : FUNCTION &#39;.&#39; NAME &#39;(&#39;(function | argument (&#39;,&#39; argument)*)&#39;)&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    argument: (NAME | function);\r\n\r\nImportant thing to notice here: the parser does not make distinction between a *valid* (from your point of view) and *invalid* functions, arguments, number of arguments, etc.\r\nSo the function like `Function.whatever(InvalidArg)` is also a *valid* construction from *parser&#39;s* point of view. To further validate the input and test whether it meets *your* requirements (which is a predefined list of functions and their arguments), you have to traverse the tree using a Listener or a Visitor (I think Visitor fits here perfectly). \r\n\r\nTo get a better understanding of what it is I&#39;d recommend reading [this][2] and [this][3]. But if you want to get deeper into the subject, you should definitely look at &quot;[The Dragons Book][4]&quot;, which covers the topic exhaustively.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\r\n  [2]: https://tomassetti.me/antlr-mega-tutorial/\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15050137/once-grammar-is-complete-whats-the-best-way-to-walk-an-antlr-v4-tree\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339878/in-antlr-how-to-parse-the-nested-function-using-java/58390324#58390324","title":"In ANTLR how to parse the nested function using java"}],"owner":{"reputation":387,"user_id":9814870,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ec5bbfc7c9957ff91d3890255729c04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vikram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9814870/vikram"},"last_editor":{"reputation":387,"user_id":9814870,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ec5bbfc7c9957ff91d3890255729c04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vikram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9814870/vikram"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":136,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571374763,"creation_date":1570791771,"last_edit_date":1571374763,"question_id":58339878,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58339878","body_markdown":"I am new to ANTLR, I have a list of functions which are mostly of nested types.\r\n\r\nBelow are the examples for functions:\r\n\r\n    1.

method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;dp-add-document&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;\r\n\t&lt;!-- ... --&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-12&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;input id=&quot;file-upload-file&quot;

+ nameof(AddDocument))]\r\nasync public Task&lt;object&gt; AddDocument([FromForm] AddDocumentDto data)\r\n{\r\n\tbyte[] buff = new byte[40];\r\n\tdata.File.OpenReadStream().Read(buff, 0, 40);\r\n\r\n\tvar ids = String.Join(&quot;, &quot;, buff.Select(x =&gt; x.ToString()).ToArray());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ids string contains the following:\r\n37, 80, 68, 70, 45, 49, 46, 52, 13, 37, **239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189**, 13, 10, 53, 48, 32, 48, 32, 111, 98, 106, 13, 60, 60, 47, 76, 105, 110, 101\r\n\r\nAs you can see every byte above 128 is transformed to 239, 191, 189.\r\n\r\nAfter some fun with google without a result I tryed to upload the file with javascript:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$(&#39;#file-upload-file&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, function (event) {\r\n\t_fileToUpload = event.target.files[0];\r\n\r\n\t$.ajax({\r\n\t\turl: &#39;../upload/&#39;,\r\n\t\ttype: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n\t\tdata: _fileToUpload,\r\n\t\tprocessData: false,\r\n\t\tcontentType: &#39;application/octet-stream&#39;,  /* charset=ISO-8859-1 */\r\n\t\tsuccess: function () {\r\n\t\t\talert(&#39;upload ok&#39;);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\terror: function () {\r\n\t\t\talert(&#39;upload error&#39;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this javascript-way I wrote a new action inside my controller:\r\n```c#\r\n[HttpPost(&quot;upload&quot;, Name = nameof(DocumentController) + &quot;.&quot; + nameof(UploadDocument))]\r\nasync public Task&lt;object&gt; UploadDocument()\r\n{\r\n\tvar stream = Request.Body;\r\n\r\n\tbyte[] buff = new byte[40];\r\n\tstream.Read(buff, 0, 40);\r\n\r\n\tvar ids = String.Join(&quot;, &quot;, buff.Select(x =&gt; x.ToString()).ToArray());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s the same. The backend receives the wrong values and the PDF file is not a valid pdf-document:\r\n37, 80, 68, 70, 45, 49, 46, 52, 13, 37, **239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189**, 13, 10, 53, 48, 32, 48, 32, 111, 98, 106, 13, 60, 60, 47, 76, 105, 110, 101\r\n\r\nAs you can see I tryed with the encoding while uploading but it do not fix my problem. I think it&#39;s only little problem with encoding but I&#39;m not albe to fix it.\r\nIs anybody out there can help me?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339876/characters-are-transformed-during-upload-of-a-file","title":"Characters are transformed during upload of a

[EnableCors(&quot;SiteCorsPolicy&quot;)]\r\n    public class CustomerDemandController : ControllerBase\r\n    {\r\n    \tprivate const string GetByIdOperation = &quot;GetById&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    \t[Get(&quot;{id}&quot;, Name = GetByIdOperation)]\r\n    \t\tpublic async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;CustomerDemandResponse&gt;&gt; GetAsync([FromRoute] string id)\r\n    \t\t\t=&gt; await this.GetAsync(() =&gt; Service.GetByIdAsync(id),\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   ConversionHelper.Convert);\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r\n    \t...\r\n    \r\n(same method in the other controller with ManagerDemandResponse as response).\r\nNow that I have added the new controller, I want to test if the old one still works and this is not the case anymore due to the same route name &quot;GetById&quot; in both controllers.\r\n\r\n&gt;System.InvalidOperationException : The following errors occurred with attribute routing information:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Error 1: Attribute routes with

completing an assignment for university as part of a group. We have encountered an issue with a certain event not triggering when using JavaScript to change css properties on button click. We are not looking for anyone to write/re-write our code to be industry standard, but we are looking to work out (with a little help from you) where we have gone wrong. \r\n\r\nWe are tasked with writing a report and presenting it in webpage format. \r\nWe are writing the page using HTML/CSS and a small amount of JavaScript for things like drop-down menus and displaying sections of the page on button click.\r\n\r\nThe particular issue we can&#39;t work out (code below) is when a menu button is clicked, the JS should populate the heading of the page and display a `div` in the body.\r\n\r\nI can either get it to work as intended, though only 3 `div` are referenced (the code seems to ignore the array elements after the 3rd), or get it to work with all headings but no `div` are referenced (per below).\r\n\r\nCMVE as follows (full code below):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let sections = [&quot;Cooper&quot;, &quot;Jenna&quot;, &quot;Lyly&quot;, &quot;Mick&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Stanton&quot;, &quot;Welcome&quot;];\r\n    var visSection = null;\r\n\r\n    /*\tvar i;\r\n    \tfor (i=0;

you sure your command object is validateable, i.e. is it either in the same file as the controller, or if not, is it annotated with `@Validateable`?\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re sure it&#39;s validateable, can you execute `JSON.stringify(user)` in the browser console (dev tools), so we can see the structure of the data you&#39;re sending?\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n-----\r\nIt seems this is the structure of the data you&#39;re sending:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      user: {\r\n        userName:  &quot;New_user5&quot;\r\n        email:     &quot;myemail@myuser.com&quot;\r\n        firstName: &quot;New&quot;\r\n        lastName:  &quot;User&quot;\r\n        title:     &quot;User Admin&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd you&#39;re trying to bind it to:\r\n\r\n    class SaveUserCommand {\r\n        String userName\r\n        String firstName\r\n        String lastName\r\n        String title\r\n        String email\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBinding is failing because the objects don&#39;t have the same properties, so you have two choices:\r\n\r\nOption 1: Change the request data\r\n---------------------------------\r\nSend this instead:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      userName:  &quot;New_user5&quot;\r\n

the easier of the 2 options, you probably just need to replace:\r\n\r\n    {data: user}\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n    {data: this.form.user}\r\n\r\nOption 2: Change the command object\r\n---------------------------------\r\nBind the request data to this instead\r\n\r\n    @Validateable\r\n    class SaveUserCommand {\r\n        UserData user\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n
