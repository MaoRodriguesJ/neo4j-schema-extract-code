At the same time, in the application I want to use an object Truck.Body. For flatten I override `fun serialize(encoder: Encoder, obj : T)` and `fun deserialize(decoder: Decoder): T` in Serializator using JsonOutput and JsonInput according to the documentation in these classes.\r\n```kotlin\r\nobject TruckKSerializer : KSerializer&lt;Truck&gt; {\r\n    override val descriptor: SerialDescriptor = SerialClassDescImpl(&quot;Truck&quot;)\r\n\r\n    override fun serialize(encoder: Encoder, obj: Truck) {\r\n        val output = encoder as?

JsonInput\r\n            ?: throw SerializationException(&quot;This class can be loaded only by Json&quot;)\r\n        val tree = input.decodeJson() as? JsonObject\r\n            ?: throw SerializationException(&quot;Expected JsonObject&quot;)\r\n        return Truck(\r\n            tree.getPrimitive(&quot;owner&quot;).content,\r\n            VehicleJson.fromJson&lt;Truck.Body&gt;(tree)\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd finally, I use `stringify(serializer: SerializationStrategy&lt;T&gt;, obj: T)`\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nVehicleJson.stringify(\r\n    PolymorphicSerializer(Vehicle::class),\r\n    Truck(\r\n        owner = &quot;Ivan&quot;,\r\n        body = Truck.Body(\r\n            bodyType = &quot;cistern&quot;,\r\n            carryingCapacityInTons = 5,\r\n            detachable = false\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\nI end up with `{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;kotlin.collections.LinkedHashMap&quot;, ...}`, but I need `{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;veh_t&quot;, ...}`\r\nHow do I get the right type? I want using polymorphism for `Vehicle` and encode Body object with Truck.Body.serializer() to flatten.\r\n\r\nWith this serialization, the PassengerCar class runs fine.\r\n```kotlin\r\nVehicleJson.stringify(\r\n    PolymorphicSerializer(Vehicle::class),\r\n    PassengerCar(\r\n        owner = &quot;Oleg&quot;,\r\n        numberOfSeats = 4\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\nResult is correct: \r\n```json\r\n{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;veh_p&quot;,&quot;owner&quot;:&quot;Oleg&quot;,&quot;numberOfSeats&quot;:4}\r\n```\r\nI think the problem is the custom serializer `TruckKSerializer`.\r\nAnd I noticed if I use in my overridden `fun serialize(encoder: Encoder, obj : T)` next code \r\n```kotlin\r\nencoder\r\n            .beginStructure(descriptor)\r\n            .apply { \r\n                //...\r\n            }\r\n            .endStructure(descriptor)\r\n```\r\nI get the correct type but cannot flatten the object Truck.Body using its serializer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452736/custom-serializer-with-polymorphic-kotlinx-serialization","title":"Custom serializer with polymorphic kotlinx serialization"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":145233,"user_id":5459839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iehrR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"trincot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5459839/trincot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571408546,"post_id":58452735,"comment_id":103243221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452735/passing-array-to-fill-an-array#comment103243221_58452735"},{"owner":{"reputation":745014,"user_id":157247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca3e484c121268e4c8302616b2395eb9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"T.J.

Evidence: 5 out of 5 Java Style Guides sampled do NOT say anything about whether you should or should relying on default values:\r\n\r\n  - [Google Java Style Guide][1]  \r\n  - [Twitter Java Style Guide][2]\r\n  - [Java Programming Style Guide - JavaRanch][3] (dubious)\r\n  - [Java Code Style Guidelines][4] - Cornell University CS.\r\n  - [The OpenJDK Draft Java Style Guide][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;(Note, my methodology for sampling was to look at the first 5 distinct Google search hits for &quot;java style guide&quot;.  Then I searched each document for &quot;default&quot;. This is not a thorough analysis, but it serves to make my point.)&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nOK.  So does it really aid readability of Java code?\r\n\r\nThis is debatable.  \r\n\r\nOn one hand, a novice Java programmer who hasn&#39;t learned about default initialization may be baffled about where the zeros or nulls are coming from.   But if they bother to look for an explicit initialization and find there isn&#39;t one, that should be sufficient to cause them to read a tutorial or book to find out about default initialization.  (You would hope!)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we don&#39;t normally expect novice Java programmers to be maintaining production code-bases.  For an experienced Java programmer a *redundant* initialization does not improve readability.  It is (at best) noise.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, the only thing that is achieved by a redundant initialization of a field is to signal to a future reader of your code that you have *thought* about the the initial value.  (As @GhostCat expressed it, default initialization does not communicate intent.)\r\n\r\nBut conversely if I was that reader, I would not necessarily trust the thinking of the code author.  So the value of this &quot;signal&quot; is also questionable.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWhat about reliability?\r\n\r\nIn Java it makes no difference.  The JLS *specifies* that default initialization *does* occur for fields.  And conversely, for local variables it is a compilation error to try to use a variable that has not been definitely initialized.  \r\n\r\nIn short, the runtime behavior of a variable that is not explicitly initialized is entirely predictable.\r\n\r\nBy contrast in languages like C or C++ where variables may not be initialized, the behavior is *unspecified*, and can lead to crashes, and differences in behavior on different platforms.  The case for always explicitly initializing variables is much stronger here.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nWhat about performance?\r\n\r\nIt should make no difference.  The JIT compiler should be able to treat a redundant initialization and default initialization as the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md\r\n  [3]: https://coderanch.com/wiki/718799/Style\r\n  [4]: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/JavaStyle.html\r\n  [5]: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~alundblad/styleguide/index-v6.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452730/relying-on-default-field-initialisation-is-bad-programming-style/58460198#58460198","title":"Relying on default field initialisation - is bad programming style?"}],"owner":{"reputation":23149,"user_id":1479414,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c286de045787a6dc24c3afb97ec23ce1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andremoniy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1479414/andremoniy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":704,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":19,"closed_date":1571497036,"accepted_answer_id":58460198,"answer_count":3,"score":16,"last_activity_date":1571496619,"creation_date":1571408316,"last_edit_date":1571449001,"question_id":58452730,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58452730","body_markdown":"I was given a link to the official oracle documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html\r\n\r\nwhere it is said:\r\n\r\n&gt; Default Values \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; It&#39;s not always necessary to assign a value when a\r\n&gt; field is declared.

to SO. for responsiveness, ive been using this library [RN-responsive][1] , which is very easy .SUppose youhave a component with `height:100 and width:200 ,` and your screen size is 360*640. so you need to replace height and width by \r\n\r\n    height:hp(&quot;15.6%&quot;) // 100/640 = 15.6\r\n    width:wp(&quot;55.5%&quot;) //200/360 = 55.5\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-responsive-screen\r\n\r\nOtherwise if you dont want to use any library you can use the Dimensions of React native. \r\n\r\n    import {DImensions} from react native;\r\n    const deviceWidth = Dimensions.get(&quot;window&quot;).width;\r\n    const deviceHeight = Dimensions.get(&quot;window&quot;).height;\r\n\r\nand after that use height like \r\n\r\n    height:0.156*deviceHeight \r\n    width:0.55*deviceWidth\r\n\r\n\r\nhope it helps\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452721/responsive-behaviour-in-react-native-with-styled-components/58452843#58452843","title":"Responsive behaviour in react native with

Of course it&#39;s just an example -- any values can change in both sets with time. So is there a better way to map the values something like `5:dogs`, `7:cats` and `1:cats`? In this way if numbers of dogs changes to 4 I can easily find what to change.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452675/how-to-iterate-over-two-arguments-in-the-sh-linux-shell","title":"How to iterate over two arguments in the sh linux shell"},{"tags":["node.js","angular"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6459,"user_id":1842294,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d25f036774c988f92c5acc6a629fbf9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Seth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1842294/seth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571408272,"post_id":58452674,"comment_id":103243085,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452674/the-easiest-way-to-serve-an-existing-and-working-staticfile-angular-app-to-nod#comment103243085_58452674"},{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":4353013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/444c01bf22d63dccccd873de052d0aad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BuzzBenny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4353013/buzzbenny"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6459,"user_id":1842294,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d25f036774c988f92c5acc6a629fbf9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Seth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1842294/seth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571408491,"post_id":58452674,"comment_id":103243195,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452674/the-easiest-way-to-serve-an-existing-and-working-staticfile-angular-app-to-nod#comment103243195_58452674"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":4353013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/444c01bf22d63dccccd873de052d0aad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BuzzBenny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4353013/buzzbenny"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571408094,"creation_date":1571408094,"question_id":58452674,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58452674","body_markdown":"I have an Angular App running on CloudFoundry.

Also `std::string` has its own `replace` method as noted in comments.\r\n\r\nUse `CComSafeArray&lt;double&gt;` to reduce chances of programming error.\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can copy the result to `std::vector` to reduces chances of error. Then copy the vector to `pSafeArray`. This will ensure you have the correct array size.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;atlsafe.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    void PopulateListFromString(long countOfDoublesinString, \r\n        CString cstringofDoublesSperatedByCommas)\r\n    {\r\n    \tcstringofDoublesSperatedByCommas.Replace(&#39;,&#39;, &#39; &#39;);\r\n    \r\n    \tstd::stringstream ss;\r\n    \tss &lt;&lt; cstringofDoublesSperatedByCommas;\r\n    \tdouble temp;\r\n    \tstd::vector&lt;double&gt; vec;\r\n    \twhile(ss &gt;&gt; temp)\r\n    \t\tvec.push_back(temp);\r\n    \r\n    \tif(countOfDoublesinString != (long)vec.size())\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tTRACE(&quot;error!\\n&quot;);\r\n    \t\tAfxDebugBreak();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tCComSafeArray&lt;double&gt; arr(vec.size());\r\n    \tfor(int i = 0; i &lt; (int)vec.size(); i++)\r\n    \t\tarr[i] = vec[i];\r\n    \r\n    \tVariantInit(&amp;m_varDouble);\r\n    \tm_varDouble.vt = VT_ARRAY | VT_R8;\r\n    \tm_varDouble.parray = arr;\r\n\r\n    \tarr.Detach();\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452669/heap-corruption-on-exit-of-method-while-using-safearray/58455436#58455436","title":"Heap Corruption on exit of Method while using SAFEARRAY"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7593599,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2015fff3daa1e683953547fa004593f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joel Ebenezer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7593599/joel-ebenezer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7593599,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2015fff3daa1e683953547fa004593f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joel Ebenezer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7593599/joel-ebenezer"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571421209,"creation_date":1571408085,"last_edit_date":1571411820,"question_id":58452669,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58452669","body_markdown":"I have a method which is trying to convert a string of doubles separated with Commas like(&quot;12345.0, 12345.0, 123123.0&quot;) to a variant List.

For instance, I can enter some numbers in referenced cells and the formula-containing cell will show the calculated number, but those numbers will not change when changing the data in the references. Manually typed formulas in the same workbook show the same behavior regardless of being in or outside range objects or in non-macro generated worksheets within this workbook. It doesn&#39;t seem to be specific to any particular formula.\r\n\r\nI checked that the cells are formatted as numbers and that the formulas are valid. Formulas still appear in the cells after computing values.\r\n\r\nReloading the same workbook without macro-enabling shows the formulas working correctly.\r\n\r\nIn another macro-enabled workbook no problem is observed.\r\n\r\nI checked property settings in the VBA editor and found no differences between them.\r\n\r\nIt seems like something is going on related to macro-enabling and not any particular code that is causing formulas to become unresponsive, but I am stumped as to what that could be.\r\n\r\nHere is the formula in which I noticed the problem:\r\n\r\n in &quot;=d4:d21&quot; the array formula &quot;{=IF(ISNUMBER(C4:C21), C4:C21/C3, &quot;0&quot;)}&quot;\r\n\r\nEven with a simple formula placed anywhere on the sheet like &quot;=average(f4:f6)&quot;, this problem occurs.\r\n\r\nI think creating the macro containing these lines of code is when the issue started, but they are not specific to it:\r\n\r\n    Sub CreateDataSheet()\r\n\r\n    Sheets.Add After:=ActiveSheet\r\n    Range(&quot;d4:d21&quot;).Select\r\n    Selection.FormulaArray = _\r\n    &quot;=IF(ISNUMBER(RC[-1]:R[17]C[-1], RC[-1]:R[17]C[-1]/R[-1]C[-1], &quot;&quot;0&quot;&quot;)&quot;\r\n\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I get these formulas to work again?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452658/formulas-become-unresponsive-to-changed-value-inputs-to-referenced-cells","title":"Formulas become unresponsive to changed value inputs

Any hint would be appreciated.\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452654/how-can-i-replace-a-parameter-by-looping-parameters-in-ruby","title":"How can i replace a parameter by looping parameters in ruby?"},{"tags":["flask"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1553,"user_id":833300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4412dcb48f59881af2f24d3656770906?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/833300/jma"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571597887,"post_id":58455706,"comment_id":103285282,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452653/flask-route-with-default-argument-at-beginning-of-path/58455706#comment103285282_58455706"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6426,"user_id":1164104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4584a376a0c422377280586120494bbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Doobeh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1164104/doobeh"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571420180,"creation_date":1571420180,"answer_id":58455706,"question_id":58452653,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455706","body_markdown":"I must be missing something, can you expand on what you mean by a reverse path, because just using defaults seems to achieve what you want in your last example.\r\n   \r\n    from flask import Flask\r\n    from random import choice\r\n\r\n    app = Flask(__name__)\r\n    choices = [&#39;fox&#39;, &#39;cat&#39;, &#39;eel&#39;, &#39;cow&#39;]\r\n\r\n\r\n    def compute_thing():\r\n        return choice(choices)\r\n\r\n\r\n    @app.route(&quot;/user&quot;, defaults={&#39;thing&#39;: None})\r\n    @app.route(&quot;/&lt;thing&gt;/user/&quot;)\r\n    def user(thing):\r\n        if thing is None:\r\n            thing = compute_thing()\r\n\r\n        return f&quot;`thing` set as {thing}&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n    if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n        tc = app.test_client()\r\n\r\n        ru = tc.get(&#39;/user&#39;)\r\n        print(ru.data)  # `thing` set as cow&#39;\r\n\r\n        rd = tc.get(&#39;/dog/user/&#39;)\r\n        print(rd.data)  # `thing` set as dog&#39;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452653/flask-route-with-default-argument-at-beginning-of-path/58455706#58455706","title":"flask route with default argument at beginning of path"}],"owner":{"reputation":1553,"user_id":833300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4412dcb48f59881af2f24d3656770906?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/833300/jma"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58455706,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571420180,"creation_date":1571408030,"question_id":58452653,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58452653","body_markdown":"In flask, I can specify a default argument to a route thus:\r\n\r\n    @app.route(&quot;/user&quot;, defaults={&#39;uid&#39;: 3})\r\n    @user.route(&#39;/user/&lt;uid&gt;&#39;)\r\n    def user(uid):\r\n        # If /user or /user/ is requested, I&#39;ll see uid=3.\r\n        # If /user/4 is requested, I&#39;ll see uid=4.\r\n\r\nBut I have a reverse path:\r\n\r\n    @app.route(&quot;/user&quot;, defaults={&#39;thing&#39;: None})\r\n    @user.route(&#39;/&lt;thing&gt;/user/&#39;)\r\n    def user(thing):\r\n        # If /user or /user/ is requested, I want to see thing == None.\r\n        # If /dog/user/ is requested, I&#39;ll see thing == &#39;dog&#39;.\r\n\r\nBasically, if `thing` isn&#39;t provided, I&#39;ll do something a bit complex to compute it.

If you want to use &lt;code&gt;[datasets.ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder)&lt;/code&gt;, you have to accept its limited flexibility. In fact, `ImageFolder` is simply a subclass of `DatasetFolder`, which is pretty much what a custom dataset is. You can see in its [source code](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torchvision/datasets/folder.html#ImageFolder) the following section of `__getItem__`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif self.transform is not None:\r\n    sample = self.transform(sample)\r\nif self.target_transform is not None:\r\n    target = self.target_transform(target)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes what you want impossible since your expected transform should modify both the image and the target at the same time, which is done independently here.\r\n\r\nSo, start by making your subclass of `Dataset` similar to `DatasetFolder`, and simply implement your own transform which takes in an image and a target at the same time and returns their transformed values. This is just an example of a transform class you could have, which would then need to be composed into a single function call:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass RotateTransform(object):\r\n    def __call__(self, image, target):\r\n        # Rotate the image randomly and adjust the target accordingly\r\n        #...\r\n\r\n        return image, target\r\n```\r\n\r\n___\r\nIf that&#39;s too much trouble for your case, then the best option you have is what @jchaykow mentionned, which is to simply modify your files prior to running your code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452637/pytorch-torchvision-modify-images-and-labels-of-a-dataset-object/58530384#58530384","title":"pytorch/torchvision - modify images and labels of a Dataset object"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":6199298,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a6a898f976b970eec01d8fdaa0749e98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mirko Marchiori","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6199298/mirko-marchiori"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571861698,"creation_date":1571407989,"question_id":58452637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58452637","body_markdown":"So I have this line of code to load a dataset of images from two classes called &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; for simplicity:\r\n\r\n    train_data = torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder(os.path.join(TRAIN_DATA_DIR), train_transform)\r\n\r\nand then I prepare the loader to be used with my model in this way:\r\n\r\n    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True)\r\n\r\nSo for now each image is associated to a class, what I want to do is take each image and apply a transformation to it between those two line of code, let&#39;s say a rotation of one of four degrees: 0, 90, 180, 270, and add that info as an additional label of four classes: 0, 1, 2, 3.

Note the &quot;copy settings&quot; button:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\nIf you press the button it copies a JSON of the config, which you can then put back into the charting function so that it runs your configured chart:\r\n```\r\npivot_cht_html(d1,json_kwargs=&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n{\r\n  &quot;derivedAttributes&quot;: {},\r\n  &quot;hiddenAttributes&quot;: [\r\n    &quot;&quot;\r\n  ],\r\n  &quot;hiddenFromAggregators&quot;: [],\r\n  &quot;hiddenFromDragDrop&quot;: [],\r\n  &quot;menuLimit&quot;: 500,\r\n  &quot;cols&quot;: [\r\n    &quot;weeks&quot;\r\n  ],\r\n  &quot;rows&quot;: [],\r\n  &quot;vals&quot;: [\r\n    &quot;resurrected_90d&quot;\r\n  ],\r\n  &quot;rowOrder&quot;: &quot;key_a_to_z&quot;,\r\n  &quot;colOrder&quot;: &quot;key_a_to_z&quot;,\r\n  &quot;exclusions&quot;: {},\r\n  &quot;inclusions&quot;: {},\r\n  &quot;unusedAttrsVertical&quot;: 85,\r\n  &quot;autoSortUnusedAttrs&quot;: false,\r\n  &quot;sorters&quot;: {},\r\n  &quot;inclusionsInfo&quot;: {},\r\n  &quot;aggregatorName&quot;: &quot;Average&quot;,\r\n  &quot;rendererName&quot;: &quot;Line Chart&quot;\r\n}\r\n&quot;&quot;&quot;)\r\n```\r\nThis is far from ideal... Ideally this should be added to the pivottablejs package as a PR.

Recall that a `data.frame` is a `list` with an observation count enforcement. In addition, we can modify the `Rcpp::List` object attributes -- unlike a `std` data structure -- to include the `AsIs` flag.\r\n\r\nIn short, this looks like:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include &lt;Rcpp.h&gt;\r\n\r\n// [[Rcpp::export]]\r\nSEXP makeListColumn() {\r\n// ^ Changed from Rcpp::DataFrame to a general SEXP object. \r\n\r\n  // Store inside of an Rcpp List\r\n  Rcpp::List the_future_list(3);\r\n  the_future_list[0] = Rcpp::RawVector::create(0, 1, 2);\r\n  the_future_list[1] = Rcpp::RawVector::create(3, 4);\r\n  the_future_list[2] = Rcpp::RawVector::create(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);\r\n  \r\n  // Mark with AsIs\r\n  the_future_list.attr(&quot;class&quot;) = &quot;AsIs&quot;;\r\n\r\n  // Store inside of a regular vector\r\n  std::vector&lt;int&gt; another_regular_column;\r\n  another_regular_column.push_back(42);\r\n  another_regular_column.push_back(24);\r\n  another_regular_column.push_back(4242);\r\n\r\n  // Construct a list \r\n  Rcpp::List ret = Rcpp::List::create(\r\n      Rcpp::Named(&quot;another_regular_column&quot;) = another_regular_column,\r\n      Rcpp::Named(&quot;thelistcol&quot;) = the_future_list);\r\n  \r\n  // Coerce to a data.frame\r\n  ret.attr(&quot;class&quot;) = &quot;data.frame&quot;;\r\n  ret.attr(&quot;row.names&quot;) = Rcpp::seq(1, another_regular_column.size());\r\n  \r\n  // Return the data.frame\r\n  return ret;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost importantly, note we forgo the `Rcpp::DataFrame` class and return a `SEXP` object. Moreover, we coerce an `Rcpp::List` to an `Rcpp::DataFrame` by changing its `class` and assigning `row.names` to the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn practice, the code returns: \r\n\r\n```r\r\na = makeListColumn()\r\nstr(a)\r\n# &#39;data.frame&#39;:\t3 obs. of  2 variables:\r\n# $ another_regular_column: int  42 24 4242\r\n# $ thelistcol            :List of 3\r\n#  ..$ : raw  00 01 02\r\n#  ..$ : raw  03 04\r\n#  ..$ : raw  05 06 07 08 ...\r\n#  ..- attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;AsIs&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompared to the desired result:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nwhat_i_wanted = data.frame(\r\n    another_regular_column = c(42, 24, 4242),  \r\n    thelistcol = I(list(as.raw(c(0,1,2)), as.raw(c(3, 4)), as.raw(c(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10))))\r\n)\r\n\r\nstr(what_i_wanted)\r\n# &#39;data.frame&#39;:\t3 obs. of  2 variables:\r\n# $ another_regular_column: num  42 24 4242\r\n# $ thelistcol            :List of 3\r\n#  ..$ : raw  00 01 02\r\n#  ..$ : raw  03 04\r\n#  ..$ : raw  05 06 07 08 ...\r\n#  ..- attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;AsIs&quot;\r\n\r\nall.equal(a, what_i_wanted)\r\n# [1] TRUE\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452631/rcpp-data-frame-return-with-a-list-column-where-is-the-asis/58453549#58453549","title":"Rcpp Data Frame Return with a List Column (Where is the AsIs?)"}],"owner":{"reputation":877,"user_id":2852788,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f5053520d3df4a36f27b21ffc816fb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Justace Clutter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852788/justace-clutter"},"last_editor":{"reputation":877,"user_id":2852788,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f5053520d3df4a36f27b21ffc816fb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Justace Clutter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852788/justace-clutter"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58453549,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571411146,"creation_date":1571407968,"last_edit_date":1571409248,"question_id":58452631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58452631","body_markdown":"I would like to generate a data frame in an Rcpp function which contains a list column.

I did some looking in the Rcpp  documentation and did some google searches, but have come up empty handed.  \r\n\r\nCan somebody help me understand what I need to do in Rcpp to get this to work?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI did try to do something like:\r\n\r\n    List the_list = List::create(the_future_list);\r\n    the_list.attr(&quot;class&quot;) = CharacterVector::create(&quot;AsIs&quot;);\r\n\r\nThis unfortunately resulted in the following error:\r\n\r\n&gt;Error in makeListColumn() : \r\n  Could not convert using R function: as.data.frame.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452631/rcpp-data-frame-return-with-a-list-column-where-is-the-asis","title":"Rcpp Data Frame Return with a List Column (Where is the AsIs?)"},{"tags":["java","undefined-behavior"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4659,"user_id":1173638,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mq0Io.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1173638/adder"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571408090,"post_id":58452626,"comment_id":103242989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452626/post-increment-behavior-when-throwing-an-exception#comment103242989_58452626"},{"owner":{"reputation":35568,"user_id":3890632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNkgF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"khelwood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3890632/khelwood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571408148,"post_id":58452626,"comment_id":103243020,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452626/post-increment-behavior-when-throwing-an-exception#comment103243020_58452626"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":2462529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/471ae7f79a43e8158f6bca81df83cd42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jan De Kock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2462529/jan-de-kock"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571409778,"post_id":58452665,"comment_id":103243889,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452626/post-increment-behavior-when-throwing-an-exception/58452665#comment103243889_58452665"},{"owner":{"reputation":1232,"user_id":1506009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf295ab5042565521094d35032be4685?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rozart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1506009/rozart"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":41,"user_id":2462529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/471ae7f79a43e8158f6bca81df83cd42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jan De Kock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2462529/jan-de-kock"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571410031,"post_id":58452665,"comment_id":103243997,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452626/post-increment-behavior-when-throwing-an-exception/58452665#comment103243997_58452665"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1232,"user_id":1506009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf295ab5042565521094d35032be4685?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rozart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1506009/rozart"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571408079,"creation_date":1571408079,"answer_id":58452665,"question_id":58452626,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452665","body_markdown":"The `i++` operation is invoked, before the method `bork()` is invoked.\r\nThat&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s still incremented.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n 1. `i++` is invoked.\r\n 2.

do you get Torch to recognize CUDA on your video card?\r\n\r\nI have a Nvidia GeForce GT 1030 running under Ubuntu 18.04, and it claims to [support CUDA](https://videocardz.com/69486/nvidia-geforce-gt-1030-features-384-cuda-cores), yet when I first tested Torch with it by running:\r\n\r\n    virtualenv -p python3.7 .env\r\n    . .env/bin/activate\r\n    pip install torch\r\n    python -c &quot;import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())&quot;\r\n\r\nit returned False, along with the warning:\r\n\r\n        The NVIDIA driver on your system is too old (found version 9010).\r\n    Please update your GPU driver by downloading and installing a new\r\n    version from the URL: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx\r\n    Alternatively, go to: https://pytorch.org to install\r\n    a PyTorch version that has been compiled with your version\r\n    of the CUDA driver.\r\n\r\nSo I ran all system updates and used Ubuntu&#39;s proprietary driver installer to install the most recent Nvidia-435 driver for my card.\r\n\r\nHowever, `torch.cuda.is_available()` still returns false, but now it doesn&#39;t give me any warning.\r\n\r\nHave I mis-configured Torch or does my GPU just not support CUDA?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452620/getting-torch-to-recognize-gpu","title":"Getting Torch to recognize

struggeling with the combination of Typescript and Jest, and hopefully someone can help me out:\r\n\r\nI have the following scenario:\r\n \r\nI want to test a function that uses a class. I want to mock the class.\r\n\r\nMy setup looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    src\r\n    - __mocks__\r\n    -- myClass.ts\r\n    - myClass.ts\r\n    - myFunc.ts\r\n    - myFunc.test.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function I want to test\r\n```\r\n\r\n    //myFunc.ts\r\n    import MyClass from &#39;./myClass&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    export const myFunc = () =&gt; {\r\n      const c = new MyClass();\r\n      return c.doSomething();\r\n    };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n//the legacy class I want to mock\r\n```\r\n\r\n    //MyClass.ts\r\n    const MyClass = function() {};\r\n    \r\n    MyClass.prototype.doSomething = function() {\r\n      return &#39;something&#39;;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    export default MyClass;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test. Most of the content here is inspired by [this Jest example][1]. I&#39;ve just adapted it to TypeScript (mostly the @ts-ignore)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    //myFunc.test.ts\r\n    import {myFunc} from &#39;./myFunc&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    //@ts-ignore\r\n    import {mockDoSomething} from &#39;./myClass&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    jest.mock(&#39;./myClass&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    mockDoSomething.mockReturnValueOnce(&#39;something from mock&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    it(&#39;does something mocked&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n      expect(myFunc()).toEqual(&#39;something from mock&#39;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this fails\r\n```\r\n\r\n     FAIL  src/myFunc.test.ts\r\n      ✕ does something mocked (1ms)\r\n    \r\n      ● does something mocked\r\n    \r\n        TypeError: myClass_1.default is not a constructor\r\n    \r\n          2 |\r\n          3 | export const myFunc = () =&gt; {\r\n        &gt; 4 |   const c = new MyClass();\r\n            |             ^\r\n          5 |   return c.doSomething();\r\n          6 | };\r\n          7 |\r\n    \r\n          at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt;.exports.myFunc (src/myFunc.ts:4:13)\r\n          at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (src/myFunc.test.ts:13:10)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I delete __mocks__/myClass.ts and change myFunc.test.ts to\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    import {myFunc} from &#39;./myFunc&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    const mockDoSomething = jest.fn();\r\n    \r\n    jest.mock(&#39;./myClass&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n      return {\r\n        default: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() =&gt; {\r\n          return {\r\n            doSomething: mockDoSomething\r\n          };\r\n        })\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    mockDoSomething.mockReturnValueOnce(&#39;something from mock&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    it(&#39;does something mocked&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n      expect(myFunc()).toEqual(&#39;something from mock&#39;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything works as expected. This is also suggested [here][2]\r\n\r\nHowever, MyClass contains a lot of methods I want to mock, so using a separate file in __mocks__ seems like a much better solution, and I really want this to work.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I suspect that one of the reasons for this failing is the fact that MyClass.ts uses old syntax. This is true, as this is legacy code (a fork of [ADAL.js][3] to be specific). I really don&#39;t want to have to rewrite this code. And no, MSAL is not an option either. \r\n\r\nThe test setup I want worked fine before I converted everyting to typescript.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    //depencencies\r\n    &quot;ts-jest&quot;: &quot;^24.1.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;typescript&quot;: &quot;^3.6.4&quot;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    //tsconfig.json\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;outDir&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,\r\n        &quot;module&quot;: &quot;esnext&quot;,\r\n        &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,\r\n        &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;es6&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;, &quot;es2016&quot;, &quot;es2017&quot;],\r\n        &quot;sourceMap&quot;: false,\r\n        &quot;moduleResolution&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,\r\n        &quot;declaration&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;forceConsistentCasingInFileNames&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;noImplicitReturns&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;noImplicitThis&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;noImplicitAny&quot;: false,\r\n        &quot;strictNullChecks&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;noUnusedLocals&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;noUnusedParameters&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;allowSyntheticDefaultImports&quot;: true\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;include&quot;: [&quot;src&quot;],\r\n      &quot;exclude&quot;: [&quot;node_modules&quot;, &quot;build&quot;, &quot;**/__mocks__&quot;, &quot;**/*.test.ts&quot;]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/es6-class-mocks#manual-mock\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56677742/when-mocking-a-class-in-typescript-using-jest-ts-jest-i-am-getting-typeerror\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/adal.js\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452603/manual-mock-in-typescript-typeerror-myclass-1-default-is-not-a-constructor","title":"Manual mock in Typescript: TypeError: myClass_1.default is not a constructor"},{"tags":["swift","function","uiviewcontroller","didselectrowatindexpath"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":279,"user_id":9269689,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99df47fdd36c79c8a8b4144ea8c5f71e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Don","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9269689/don"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571409711,"post_id":58452600,"comment_id":103243858,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452600/how-to-call-a-function-from-another-controller-in-swift#comment103243858_58452600"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":585,"user_id":8272698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DuuIt8xKCLw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAL8/rQ67Bbi8SKY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Julian Silvestri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8272698/julian-silvestri"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571408450,"creation_date":1571408450,"answer_id":58452769,"question_id":58452600,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452769","body_markdown":"if you want to call a function on viewControllerB that you declare from viewController A. \r\n\r\njust create the object of the class file you want to use the function from\r\n\r\n    var obj mainVC = MainViewController()\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    class MainViewController: UIViewController {\r\n        override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n            super.viewDidLoad()\r\n            // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.\r\n        }\r\n    \tfunc commonMethod() {\r\n            print(&quot;From the main class&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUsing that object, call the function in another file where you mean to use it\r\n\r\n    class OtherViewController: UIViewController {\r\n    \toverride func viewDidLoad() {\r\n            super.viewDidLoad()\r\n    \t\tmainVC.commonMethod()\r\n            // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAdditionally, You can also create a new swift file, name it Global.swift, create all your functions that you want to use throughout the application here.

However, *n* is a variable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452584/declaring-a-string-of-a-specific-length","title":"Declaring a string of a specific length"},{"tags":["javascript","html","bootstrap-4"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":315,"user_id":8098134,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6kJIS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JakeofSpades","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8098134/jakeofspades"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571408028,"post_id":58452582,"comment_id":103242958,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452582/javascript-check-that-select-option-was-chosen#comment103242958_58452582"},{"owner":{"reputation":3024,"user_id":10669010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LsWex.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mister Jojo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10669010/mister-jojo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571408035,"post_id":58452582,"comment_id":103242961,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452582/javascript-check-that-select-option-was-chosen#comment103242961_58452582"},{"owner":{"reputation":174348,"user_id":616443,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/907798bf02efdaf6f9d07d3c0552868f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"j08691","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/616443/j08691"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571408395,"post_id":58452582,"comment_id":103243154,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452582/javascript-check-that-select-option-was-chosen#comment103243154_58452582"},{"owner":{"reputation":162,"user_id":6352735,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f86af23beeb0b4bcb98dc138f03a461e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6352735/michael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571408729,"post_id":58452582,"comment_id":103243334,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452582/javascript-check-that-select-option-was-chosen#comment103243334_58452582"},{"owner":{"reputation":162,"user_id":6352735,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f86af23beeb0b4bcb98dc138f03a461e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6352735/michael"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":315,"user_id":8098134,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6kJIS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JakeofSpades","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8098134/jakeofspades"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571412775,"post_id":58452582,"comment_id":103245394,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452582/javascript-check-that-select-option-was-chosen#comment103245394_58452582"},{"owner":{"reputation":162,"user_id":6352735,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f86af23beeb0b4bcb98dc138f03a461e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6352735/michael"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":174348,"user_id":616443,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/907798bf02efdaf6f9d07d3c0552868f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"j08691","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/616443/j08691"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571412797,"post_id":58452582,"comment_id":103245404,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58452582/javascript-check-that-select-option-was-chosen#comment103245404_58452582"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":12176705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2fcb933314ca1d5216157e31fde33a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Albjon ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176705/albjon"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571408159,"creation_date":1571408159,"answer_id":58452690,"question_id":58452582,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452690","body_markdown":"You also need a value inside &lt;option&gt;
