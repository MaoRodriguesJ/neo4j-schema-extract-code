You need to listen to objectWillChange notification, the closure has one argument which is the new value that is being set on ObservableObject.\r\n\r\nI have changed your Compass a bit:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    struct Compass: View {\r\n    \r\n      @ObservedObject var headingProvider = HeadingProvider()\r\n      @State private var angle: CGFloat = 0\r\n    \r\n      var body: some

 .modifier(RotationEffect(angle: angle))\r\n            .onReceive(self.headingProvider.objectWillChange) { newHeading in\r\n                withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 1.0)) {\r\n                    self.angle = newHeading\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n          Text(String(&quot;\\(angle)&quot;))\r\n            .font(.system(size: 20))\r\n            .fontWeight(.light)\r\n            .padding(.top, 15)\r\n        }   .onAppear(perform: {\r\n                self.headingProvider.updateHeading()\r\n            })\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have written an example HeadingProvider:\r\n\r\n    public class HeadingProvider: NSObject, ObservableObject {\r\n        \r\n        public let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject&lt;CGFloat,Never&gt;()\r\n        \r\n        public private(set) var heading: CGFloat = 0 {\r\n            willSet {\r\n                objectWillChange.send(newValue)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        private let locationManager: CLLocationManager\r\n        \r\n        public override init(){\r\n            self.locationManager = CLLocationManager()\r\n            super.init()\r\n            self.locationManager.delegate = self\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public func updateHeading() {\r\n            locationManager.startUpdatingHeading()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    extension HeadingProvider: CLLocationManagerDelegate {\r\n        \r\n        public func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateHeading newHeading: CLHeading) {\r\n            DispatchQueue.main.async {\r\n                self.heading = CGFloat(newHeading.trueHeading)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nRemember you need to handle asking for permission to read user&#39;s location and you need to call stopUpdatingHeading() at some point.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103186/how-can-i-get-data-from-observedobject-with-onreceive-in-swiftui/58104451#58104451","title":"How can I get data from ObservedObject with

can do as @LuLuGaGa suggests but it&#39;s a bit of a kludge. objectWillChange is defined as an `ObservableObjectPublisher` and while defining it as a `PassthroughSubject&lt;CGFloat,Never&gt;` is going to work today there is no guarantee that it will work in the future.\r\n\r\nAn object is not restricted to having a single publisher so you can define a second or a third for other purposes than SwiftUI. e.g.:\r\n\r\n``` swift\r\nclass Observable&lt;T&gt;: ObservableObject, Identifiable {\r\n    let id = UUID()\r\n    let publisher = PassthroughSubject&lt;T, Never&gt;()\r\n    var value: T {\r\n        willSet { objectWillChange.send() }\r\n        didSet { publisher.send(value) }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    init(_ initValue: T) { self.value = initValue }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubclassing ObservableObject will correctly define objectWillChange for you so you don&#39;t have to do it yourself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103186/how-can-i-get-data-from-observedobject-with-onreceive-in-swiftui/58165617#58165617","title":"How can I get data from ObservedObject with

This doesn&#39;t happen when I use the &quot;burger&quot; button to open the sidebar.\r\n\r\nHowever this doesn&#39;t seem to be only on angular/hammerjs (as i initially thought). Seems to also happen on Ionic default sidebar (both angular and react), and only on google chrome (works as intended in firefox).\r\n\r\nI thought this had to do something with the 300ms delay on chrome and saw that\r\n\r\n    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nwould solve it, but doesn&#39;t, and at this point im not sure what is causing this.\r\nHere is a video demonstrating the bug https://imgur.com/a/gWxLZI1\r\nAs seen, tapping/clicking immediately after swiping doesnt trigger the page change.

That&#39;s a decision that can only be made by someone who has a good understanding of the objective and the dataset. ϕ(x) —your feature vector— is always very specific to your data.\r\n\r\nFor example if you had DNA you might have features for whether a certain codon is present, or bins for the quantity of Adenine etc., this is highly subjective and even with a good understanding tuning is a non-trivial task.\r\n\r\nYou have to be very careful because you might create biases in your data for certain classes to be of a certain length, quantity of certain amino acids etc. that are not truly representative of what you are classifying for if you generate the feature vector incorrectly. This could lead to testing and training error rates that are deceptive and produce incorrect conclusions. \r\n\r\nHonesty, if you are in university, I would recommend soliciting someone in a computer science department or other analog to help contribute to your project. While it might seem tempting to use the pre-baked sklearn encoding it is not a good solution for your case. It is very likely you will have outlier cases in terms of sequence length due to limited quantity of data, and attempting to turn each character into it&#39;s own feature will cause poor performance with regards to fitting. \r\n\r\nAs for actually reading your data into python, it&#39;s a csv so you could parse it by hand with an open() and a split(&#39;,&#39;) or you could use some of the popular libraries for parsing csv formats.

The Yarn utilities for listing dependencies will understand this, so as long as you&#39;re going through Yarn you don&#39;t have to worry about it.\r\n\r\nNote that JupyterLab ships with many dependencies that might normally be considered dev dependencies- this is because it needs to include Webpack and related tooling on end user machines to support extensions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103140/how-can-i-get-a-definitive-list-of-the-javascript-dependencies-for-jupyterlab/58104732#58104732","title":"How can I get a definitive list of the javascript dependencies for jupyterlab"}],"owner":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58104732,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569436964,"creation_date":1569430191,"question_id":58103140,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103140","body_markdown":"I am trying to get a list of all the dependencies that get packaged up with jupyterlab v1.1.4. I think that I can get the python dependencies by\r\n\r\n    python3 -m venv .env\r\n    pip install jupyterlab==1.1.4\r\n    pip freeze\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t know how to do this for the javascript dependencies. I don&#39;t know much about js.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this information might be in one of the yarn.lock files. But I&#39;m not sure if I want the yarn.lock file in the home directory or the one in /jupyterlab/staging/. The reason I thought it might be the staging one, which is much shorter, is because the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#notes) says:\r\n\r\n&gt; By default, the application will load from the JupyterLab staging directory (default is `&lt;sys-prefix&gt;/share/jupyter/lab/build`. If you wish to run the core application in `&lt;git root&gt;/jupyterlab/build`, run `jupyter lab --core-mode`. This is the core application that will be shipped.\r\n\r\nBut then the problem is, once I&#39;ve identified the correct yarn.lock file, how do I remove the dev dependencies? I see that inside [/jupyterlab/staging/package.json](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/v1.1.4/jupyterlab/staging/package.json#L59) there is a section for dev dependencies and that these seem to be included in the yarn.lock file. Everything in the dependencies section of the package.json is prefixed with `@jupyterlab`. Does that mean I can filter the yarn.lock to only keep the blocks that are in this section? So I would keep all of these dependencies\r\n\r\n    &quot;@jupyterlab/coreutils@^3.1.0&quot;, &quot;@jupyterlab/coreutils@~3.1.0&quot;:\r\n      version &quot;3.1.0&quot;\r\n      resolved &quot;https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@jupyterlab/coreutils/-/coreutils-3.1.0.tgz#b307569462c468d6a09dfa06f32fed03e55dd811&quot;\r\n      integrity sha512-ZqgzDUyanyvc86gtCrIbc1M6iniKHYmWNWHvWOcnq3KIP3wk3grchsTYPTfQDxcUS6F04baPGp/KohEU2ml40Q==\r\n      dependencies:\r\n        &quot;@phosphor/commands&quot; &quot;^1.6.3&quot;\r\n        &quot;@phosphor/coreutils&quot; &quot;^1.3.1&quot;\r\n        &quot;@phosphor/disposable&quot; &quot;^1.2.0&quot;\r\n        &quot;@phosphor/properties&quot; &quot;^1.1.3&quot;\r\n        &quot;@phosphor/signaling&quot; &quot;^1.2.3&quot;\r\n        ajv &quot;^6.5.5&quot;\r\n        json5 &quot;^2.1.0&quot;\r\n        minimist &quot;~1.2.0&quot;\r\n        moment &quot;^2.24.0&quot;\r\n        path-posix &quot;~1.0.0&quot;\r\n        url-parse &quot;~1.4.3&quot;\r\n\r\nbecause (@jupyterlab/coreutils)[https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/v1.1.4/jupyterlab/staging/package.json#L24] is in the dependencies section, but I can exclude\r\n\r\n    glob@^7.1.3, glob@^7.1.4, glob@~7.1.2:\r\n      version &quot;7.1.4&quot;\r\n      resolved &quot;https://registry.yarnpkg.com/glob/-/glob-7.1.4.tgz#aa608a2f6c577ad357e1ae5a5c26d9a8d1969255&quot;\r\n      integrity sha512-hkLPepehmnKk41pUGm3sYxoFs/umurYfYJCerbXEyFIWcAzvpipAgVkBqqT9RBKMGjnq6kMuyYwha6csxbiM1A==\r\n      dependencies:\r\n        fs.realpath &quot;^1.0.0&quot;\r\n        inflight &quot;^1.0.4&quot;\r\n        inherits &quot;2&quot;\r\n        minimatch &quot;^3.0.4&quot;\r\n        once &quot;^1.3.0&quot;\r\n        path-is-absolute &quot;^1.0.0&quot;\r\n\r\nbecause glob is only in the dev dependencies?

A `Shift` can have multiple `Operators` and each operators can have multi `Entries`. Each entry is like a state of operator&#39;s activity in the shift, like `(Added, Started, On-Break, Joined, Ended)` the shift. In the end `Duration` is time (In Sec) that particular Entry has lasted. I.E difference between an Entry_Time and next Entry_Time. As you can see the Entries are grouped buy Operator and ordered with the time of their occurrence.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nExpecting the chart to show Time on ValueAxis(Y-axis), Operator-Code on Category(X-axis) and Entry types as a (Series) stacked along the bars with different &#39;Assigned Colors&#39; that should represent the &#39;Duration&#39; of respective entry. Entry Type can be repetitive e.g &#39;CUTTER-1&#39; went On-Break Twice and Joined again. So ideally, chart should represent both of them entries in separate Bars on a BarStack on those times against CUTTER-1.\r\n\r\n**Attempt #1**\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nWith the above settings, I got this chart. It&#39;s showing the operators correctly but has Two Problems **Prob#1** the StackedBars aren&#39;t correct (i.e there should be multiple entries of OnBreak &amp; Joined for operator CUTTER-1). **Prob#2** Also, on the top ValueAxis I want to show Entry Times.\r\n\r\nFor brevity purposes, I didn&#39;t added two columns `CREATED_DELPHI` &amp; `ENDED_DELPHI` in the above result set screenshot. That basically shows the START and END time of shift and remain same throughout. Note that time is being stored as a double value in DB (Please! don&#39;t ask why? and lets continue...), Like shown in column &#39;ENTRY_TIME_DELPHI&#39;.\r\n\r\n**Attempt #2**\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nTo address 2nd problem I&#39;ve added Max &amp; Min `Range Axis Values` that are CREATED_DELPHI &amp; ENDED_DELPHI respectively. Added a reference to a `Customizer Class` i.e ChartHHmmCustomizer and changed the double values to their timestamp representation like shown below. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ChartHHmmCustomizer implements JRChartCustomizer {\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void customize(JFreeChart jfchart, JRChart jasperChart) {\r\n\r\n        //Get the category plot\r\n        CategoryPlot plot = (CategoryPlot) jfchart.getPlot();\r\n        double rangeMinValue = plot.getRangeAxis().getRange().getLowerBound();\r\n        double rangeMaxValue = plot.getRangeAxis().getRange().getUpperBound();\r\n        \r\n        //Create a date axis\r\n        DateAxis yAxis = new DateAxis();\r\n        yAxis.setMinimumDate(HibernateUtil.convertDelphiToDate(rangeMinValue));\r\n        yAxis.setMaximumDate(HibernateUtil.convertDelphiToDate(rangeMaxValue));\r\n        //Override the date format\r\n        yAxis.setDateFormatOverride(new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;dd/HH:mm&quot;));\r\n        //Customise tick unit\r\n        yAxis.setTickUnit(new DateTickUnit(DateTickUnitType.MINUTE, 30));\r\n        //Set it to the range axis\r\n        plot.setRangeAxis(yAxis);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve fixed all the axis by this point but as expected the bars won&#39;t show up as the values(DURATION) are way behind the MAX &amp; MIN Range values defined.\r\n\r\nIs there a preferred way to go about from here? To use the durations to plot the bars against each operator in a correct order and width. I know Shift&#39;s start time and the interval for each entry.\r\n\r\nIf I try updating the durations in `plot.getDataset();` create newCategoryDataSet add the ShiftStartTime into it then `plot.setDataset(newCategoryDataSet);`.

Now, i want to capture some events from both and redirect them to the same instance of AI.\r\n\r\nMy eventFlowConfig.json looks like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;inputs&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;EventSource&quot;,\r\n                &quot;sources&quot;: [\r\n                    {\r\n                        &quot;providerName&quot;: &quot;My-Provider-Name&quot;\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        &quot;outputs&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ApplicationInsights&quot;,\r\n                &quot;instrumentationKey&quot;: &quot;AI_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        &quot;schemaVersion&quot;: &quot;2016-08-11&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works just fine. One problem though: in AI I cannot tell if a particular trace item came from service A or service B. So, i need a way to add some custom property to AI items coming from a particular app (service). Like, &quot;Service A&quot; or &quot;Service B&quot;. Ideally, i should also be able to add PartiotionId &amp; ReplicaOrInstanceId of that service instance, but that is a bonus without which i can live.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nAs @cijothomas [suggested][1], we can use an ITelemetryInitializer. This works because EventFlow uses TelemetryConfiguration.Active. We can do this in the constructor of our service:\r\n\r\n    TelemetryConfiguration.Active.TelemetryInitializers.Add(new TelemetryInitializer(&quot;Service A&quot;, context.TraceId));\r\n\r\nAnd here is the definition for the TelemetryInitializer class:\r\n\r\n    class TelemetryInitializer : ITelemetryInitializer\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly string _roleName;\r\n        private readonly string _roleInstance;\r\n    \r\n        public TelemetryInitializer(string roleName, string roleInstance)\r\n        {\r\n            _roleName = roleName;\r\n            _roleInstance = roleInstance;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void Initialize(ITelemetry telemetry)\r\n        {\r\n            telemetry.Context.Cloud.RoleName = _roleName;\r\n            telemetry.Context.Cloud.RoleInstance = _roleInstance;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58103256/7232025","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103115/distinguish-applications-emitting-events-to-ai-using-microsoft-diagnostics-event","title":"Distinguish applications emitting events to AI using Microsoft.Diagnostics.EventFlow"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","electron","yarnpkg"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":845,"user_id":284199,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8939f42cb6c31e31e570ea8f07fe9757?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sundowatch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284199/sundowatch"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569441701,"creation_date":1569441701,"answer_id":58105810,"question_id":58103113,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58105810","body_markdown":"Maybe someone needs that, I found the solution:\r\n\r\nYou should set your additional folders/files to `package.json` as `extraResources` under the `build` object:\r\n\r\n    &quot;extraResources&quot;: [\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;from&quot;: &quot;node_modules/regedit/vbs&quot;,\r\n            &quot;to&quot;: &quot;regedit/vbs&quot;,\r\n            &quot;filter&quot;: [\r\n              &quot;**/*&quot;\r\n            ]\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;from&quot;: &quot;app/assets&quot;,\r\n            &quot;to&quot;: &quot;../app/assets&quot;,\r\n            &quot;filter&quot;: [\r\n              &quot;**/*&quot;\r\n            ]\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;from&quot;: &quot;app/temps&quot;,\r\n            &quot;to&quot;: &quot;../app/temps&quot;,\r\n            &quot;filter&quot;: [\r\n              &quot;**/*&quot;\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        ]","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103113/yarn-packager-include-folders-and-files/58105810#58105810","title":"Yarn Packager Include Folders and Files"}],"owner":{"reputation":845,"user_id":284199,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8939f42cb6c31e31e570ea8f07fe9757?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sundowatch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284199/sundowatch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4834,"user_id":7852833,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1333bac6d21a493f46946a5850895d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tk421","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7852833/tk421"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58105810,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569602499,"creation_date":1569430087,"last_edit_date":1569602499,"question_id":58103113,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103113","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a desktop application with JavaScript, [Nodejs][1] and [Electron][2].

Initially x threads are processing the first x elements (where x in the number of the available cores), and progressively more threads may be added depending on internal heuristics. Throttling IO operations is a good thing because it protects the network and the server that handles the requests from becoming overburdened. Your alternative improvised method of throttling, by making requests in batches of 100, is far from ideal for many reasons, one of them being that 100 concurrent requests are a lot of requests! Another one is that a single long running operation may delay the completion of the batch until long after the completion of the other 99 operations.\r\n\r\nNote that `Parallel.ForEach` is also not ideal for parallelizing IO operations. It just happened to perform better than the alternative, wasting memory all along.

That solution makes sense to me because making web requests is I/O bound work, and the use of async/await along with Task.WhenAll or Task.WaitAll means that you can submit 100 requests all at once and then wait for them all to finish before submitting the next 100 requests so that you don&#39;t bog down the web server. I was surprised to see that this version completed all of the work in ~12 minutes - way slower than I expected.\r\n\r\n**The second version** submits all 3000 HTTP GET requests inside a Parallel.ForEach loop. I use .Result to wait for each request to finish before the rest of the logic within that iteration of the loop can execute. I thought that this would be a far less efficient solution, since using threads to perform tasks in parallel is usually better suited for performing CPU bound work, but I was surprised to see that the this version completed all of the work within ~3 minutes!\r\n\r\nMy question is why is the Parallel.ForEach version faster? This came as an extra surprise because when I applied the same two techniques against a **different** API/web server, **version 1** of my code was actually faster than version 2 by about 6 minutes - which is what I expected. Could performance of the two different versions have something to do with how the web server handles the traffic? \r\n\r\nYou can see a simplified version of my code below:\r\n\r\n    private async Task&lt;ObjectDetails&gt; TryDeserializeResponse(HttpResponseMessage response)\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            using (Stream stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync())\r\n            using (StreamReader readStream = new StreamReader(stream, Encoding.UTF8))\r\n            using (JsonTextReader jsonTextReader = new JsonTextReader(readStream))\r\n            {\r\n                JsonSerializer serializer = new JsonSerializer();\r\n                ObjectDetails objectDetails = serializer.Deserialize&lt;ObjectDetails&gt;(\r\n                    jsonTextReader);\r\n                return objectDetails;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        catch (Exception e)\r\n        {\r\n            // Log exception\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; TryGetResponse(string urlStr)\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync(urlStr)\r\n                .ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n            if (response.StatusCode != HttpStatusCode.OK)\r\n            {\r\n                throw new WebException(&quot;Response code is &quot;\r\n                    + response.StatusCode.ToString() + &quot;... not 200 OK.&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            return response;\r\n        }\r\n        catch (Exception e)\r\n        {\r\n            // Log exception\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private async Task&lt;ListOfObjects&gt; GetObjectDetailsAsync(string baseUrl, int id)\r\n    {\r\n        string urlStr = baseUrl + @&quot;objects/id/&quot; + id + &quot;/details&quot;;\r\n\r\n        HttpResponseMessage response = await TryGetResponse(urlStr);\r\n\r\n        ObjectDetails objectDetails = await TryDeserializeResponse(response);\r\n\r\n        return objectDetails;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // With ~3000 objects to retrieve, this code will create 100 API calls\r\n    // in parallel, wait for all 100 to finish, and then repeat that process\r\n    // ~30 times.

  \tstd::cout &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    \treturn 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand got an error message that an appropriate function `begin` for `v3` used implicitly in this statement\r\n \r\n    \tfor ( const auto &amp;item : v3 ) std::cout &lt;&lt; item &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39;;\r\n\r\ncan not be found.\r\n\r\nSo I tried the following code\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;valarray&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;type_traits&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main( void ) \r\n    {\r\n    \tstd::valarray&lt;int&gt; v1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\r\n    \tstd::valarray&lt;int&gt; v2 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\r\n    \r\n    \tauto v3 = v1 * v2;\r\n    \t\r\n    \tstd::cout &lt;&lt; std::is_same&lt;std::valarray&lt;int&gt;, decltype( v3 )&gt;::value &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n    \treturn 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand got the result\r\n\r\n    0\r\n\r\nBut when this statement\r\n\r\n   \tauto v3 = v1 * v2;\r\n\r\nis changed to \r\n\r\n    std::valarray&lt;int&gt; v3 = v1 * v2;\r\n\r\nthen the output is \r\n\r\n    1\r\n\r\nThe `operator *` for `std::valarray&lt;int&gt;` is declared the following way\r\n\r\n    template&lt;class T&gt; valarray&lt;T&gt; operator* (const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp;, const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp;);\r\n\r\nSo is it a bug of the implementation of `std::valarray&lt;int&gt;`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103078/is-it-a-bug-of-the-implementation-of-stdvalarray-in-gcc","title":"Is it a bug of the implementation of std::valarray

However I only know about `scatter!` which will add more particles to the plot rather than showing the change of particle position.

practice, &#39;early stopping&#39; is largely done via: (1) train for X epochs, (2) _save_ the model each time it achieves a new best performance, (3) select the best model. &quot;Best performance&quot; defined as achieving the highest (e.g. accuracy) or lowest (e.g. loss) validation metric - example script below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbest_val_loss = 999 # arbitrary init - should be high if &#39;best&#39; is low, and vice versa\r\nnum_epochs = 5\r\nepoch = 0\r\n\r\nwhile epoch &lt; num_epochs:\r\n    model.train_on_batch(x_train, y_train)  # get x, y somewhere in the loop\r\n    val_loss = model.evaluate(x_val, y_val)\r\n\r\n    if val_loss &lt; best_val_loss:\r\n        model.save(best_model_path) # OR model.save_weights()\r\n        print(&quot;Best model w/ val loss {}

operating in excel 2010\r\n\r\nI am in the process of building a macro to format various reports so that the excel sheets can be input into an auto-load tool. This macro adds a unique number identifier to each case and then breaks cases into multiple lines depending on the amount of services being performed. So initially cases will be numbered in column A as 1,2,3,4,ect. Then the cases are split into multiple rows based on the number of services and the number in column A is used to group the services. So if case one has 3 services, case two has 1 service, and case three has 5 services, column A would look like 1,1,1,2,3,3,3,3,3 descending. \r\n\r\nThe auto-load tool only builds 15 lines per case. So I need to add code that will search column A and if a duplicate value exceeds 15 instances, add an &quot;a&quot; to the first 15 instances, a &quot;b&quot; to the second 15 instances, a &quot;c&quot; to the third 15 instances, and so on. \r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nIn column A desending: if identifier looks like 1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4\r\nThen macro would update column A to look like this: 1,2,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,3b,3b,4\r\n\r\nThanks for your time\r\n\r\nThis is the code I have worked out so far:\r\n\r\n    Sub Scrub_File()      \r\n    Dim ws As Worksheet\r\n    Set ws = Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;)\r\n        range(&quot;A2&quot;).Select\r\n        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = &quot;1&quot;\r\n           LastRow = range(&quot;K&quot; &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row\r\n            range(&quot;A2&quot;).AutoFill Destination:=range(&quot;A2:A&quot; &amp; LastRow),   Type:=xlFillSeries\r\n    Dim InxSplit As Long\r\n      Dim SplitCell() As String\r\n      Dim RowCrnt As Long\r\n      With Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;)\r\n        RowCrnt = 2         &#39; The first row containing data.\r\n        Do While True\r\n          If .Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;AI&quot;).Value = &quot;End&quot; Then\r\n            Exit Do\r\n          End If\r\n          SplitCell = Split(.Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;AI&quot;).Value, &quot;,&quot;)\r\n          If UBound(SplitCell) &gt; 0 Then\r\n            .Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;AI&quot;).Value = SplitCell(0)\r\n            For InxSplit = 1 To UBound(SplitCell)\r\n              RowCrnt = RowCrnt + 1\r\n              .Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;AI&quot;).Value = SplitCell(InxSplit)\r\n            .range(.Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;A&quot;), .Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;AH&quot;)).Value = .range(.Cells(RowCrnt - 1, &quot;A&quot;), .Cells(RowCrnt - 1, &quot;AH&quot;)).Value\r\n            .range(.Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;AL&quot;), .Cells(RowCrnt, &quot;AX&quot;)).Value = .range(.Cells(RowCrnt - 1, &quot;AL&quot;), .Cells(RowCrnt - 1, &quot;AX&quot;)).Value\r\n            Next\r\n            End If\r\n          RowCrnt = RowCrnt + 1\r\n        Loop\r\n      End With\r\n    End Sub\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103032/excel-macro-to-add-a-character-to-duplicate-values-after-the-value-exceeds-15-in","title":"Excel Macro to add a character to duplicate values after the value exceeds 15 instances"},{"tags":["sonarqube","sonarqube-scan","sonar-runner"],"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":804319,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f86bc2759961b8056e0294e0f38aa023?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Deepak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/804319/deepak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":185,"user_id":804319,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f86bc2759961b8056e0294e0f38aa023?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Deepak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/804319/deepak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569430098,"creation_date":1569429770,"last_edit_date":1569430098,"question_id":58103031,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103031","body_markdown":"I am using SonarQube version 6.7 with SonarJava 5.6 and configured leakPeriod as version i.e. BASELINE.\r\n\r\n1.

After the user took a picture, i want that the user is staying inside this camera control to take another picture until he exits it with the back button and he will be redirected to the previous screen with the button.\r\n\r\nInternally on button click following onClickPicture() method is invoked.\r\n\r\n    async onClickPicture() {\r\n        const options: CameraOptions = {\r\n            quality: 100,\r\n            destinationType: this.camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI,\r\n            encodingType: this.camera.EncodingType.JPEG,\r\n            allowEdit: false,\r\n            correctOrientation: true\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        const tempImage = await this.camera.getPicture(options);\r\n        const tempFilename = tempImage.substr(tempImage.lastIndexOf(&#39;/&#39;) + 1);     \r\n        const tempBaseFilesystemPath = tempImage.substr(0, tempImage.lastIndexOf(&#39;/&#39;) + 1);    \r\n        const newBaseFilesystemPath = this.baseDirectory + &#39;/&#39;;    const \r\n\r\n        newFileName = this.generateFileName(this.dataService.getCurrentFileCountInDirValue());    await this.fileCtrl.copyFile(tempBaseFilesystemPath, tempFilename, newBaseFilesystemPath, newFileName);    \r\n        \r\n        this.onClickPicture();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nJust note the last line, where i&#39;m calling the method itself to keep the user in the camera control.\r\n\r\nSo here is my problem. Everytime i use the approach above where the user gets redirected to the camera control again, all previous pictures are removed. So there isonly one last picture in the directory with the correct increased file numbering of course.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, if i remove the last line and let the user enter the camera manually it works. All images are still there and nothing gets deleted.\r\n\r\nDoes someone has a solution for this? Or is there another approach to stay in the camera control until the user exits manually? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58102987/ionic-cordova-camera-plugin-is-deleting-previous-images-after-taking-new-picture","title":"Ionic Cordova Camera Plugin is deleting previous images after taking new pictures"},{"tags":["ios","swift","iphone","qr-code"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569429708,"post_id":58102985,"comment_id":102597346,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58102985/using-ios-built-in-qrcode-scanner-with-custom-url-schemes#comment102597346_58102985"},{"owner":{"reputation":2617,"user_id":3241041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XgwSb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alxlives","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3241041/alxlives"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569432023,"post_id":58102985,"comment_id":102598386,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58102985/using-ios-built-in-qrcode-scanner-with-custom-url-schemes#comment102598386_58102985"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":1486752,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20aa6e774d291fc9cdfd4ef2009a7275?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"William R Hazlewood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1486752/william-r-hazlewood"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569435559,"post_id":58102985,"comment_id":102599832,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58102985/using-ios-built-in-qrcode-scanner-with-custom-url-schemes#comment102599832_58102985"},{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569435797,"post_id":58102985,"comment_id":102599935,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58102985/using-ios-built-in-qrcode-scanner-with-custom-url-schemes#comment102599935_58102985"},{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569435849,"post_id":58102985,"comment_id":102599965,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58102985/using-ios-built-in-qrcode-scanner-with-custom-url-schemes#comment102599965_58102985"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":1486752,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20aa6e774d291fc9cdfd4ef2009a7275?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"William R Hazlewood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1486752/william-r-hazlewood"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569429576,"creation_date":1569429576,"question_id":58102985,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58102985","body_markdown":"I am working on a prototype to test a concept for iOS using QRCodes.\r\n\r\niOS has integrated QRCode detection within their Camera.app. I have created an app with a custom URL scheme, and generated a url code with that scheme:\r\n\r\ne.g. myApp://some-message?someParam=1\r\n\r\nMy hope was that I could simply generate several QR codes with different parameters to trigger different parts of my app experience.\r\n\r\nI have things mostly working.

When the browser receives the content of the `index.html` matching the `id` param, it probably finds references expressed as _relative_ paths like `&lt;script src=&quot;js/three.js&quot;&gt;`. To build the _fully qualified_ address to this resource, it uses the location of the current file. Which, in the case of the `index.html` you show, seems to be `http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7`.\r\n\r\nA (quite) quick way of fixing this would be to:\r\n\r\n- expose your projects statically (with `express.static` on the common folder to all your uploads which apparently ends with `/vr/uploads` now)\r\n- then, instead of serving the `index.html` directly from `/api/:id`, use this route as a redirection to the proper static location\r\n\r\nSomething like that:\r\n```js\r\n// expose all uploads, under the URL http://localhost:3000/uploaded-projects/*\r\napp.use(\r\n  &#39;/uploaded-projects&#39;,\r\n  express.static(path.join(__dirname, &#39;../../vr/uploads&#39;))\r\n);\r\n// handler to match a Mongo project ID with a public path under /uploaded-projects\r\napp.get(`/api/:id`, (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  Upload.findById(req.params.id)\r\n  .populate(&#39;Upload&#39;)\r\n  .select(&#39;relPath&#39;)\r\n  .exec((err, data) =&gt; {\r\n    // ko: explicitly use an HTTP status otherwise it&#39;s 200\r\n    if (err) return res.status(500).send(err);\r\n    // ok: tell browser 302 + proper Location header\r\n    res.redirect(`/uploaded-projects/${data.relPath}/index.html`);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\nWith maybe a bit more effort, you could alter your front-end so that, instead of using the ID in your list of projects, you use `relPath` (which you can provide to the front-end, since you already provide IDs and this `relPath` is inside the Mongo document) and a hard-coded path to the static tree (in my sketch, `/uploaded-projects`).

I also wanted to make sure the file could be served dynamically (e.g. a user clicking on which VR scene to render with href leading to the url), so I executed the following code which also worked fine: \r\n```\r\nconst filepath = &#39;065fe1658b1374605f31d100eb1e7a1a1568654427336/Nancy_Collins_118226967_v2/&#39;\r\napp.use(&#39;/&#39;, express.static(`/Users/virtuload-beta/backend/uploads/${filepath}`))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am mostly finished the app now, except I have a huge issue, when I serve the VR folders with the index.html file specified (which you need to do with res.sendFile) the browser cannot read the files within the folders and I just get red errors. \r\n\r\nMy function doesn&#39;t serve it as a static file anymore, it gets the id from the url, find the file path from mongodb, as follows: \r\n```\r\nconst servepath = (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n    let id = req.params.id\r\n    Upload.findById(id)\r\n      .populate(&#39;Upload&#39;)\r\n      .select(&#39;relPath&#39;) //relPath = /folder/subfolder\r\n      .exec(function (err, upload) {\r\n        if (err) {\r\n          res.send(err)\r\n          console.log(err)\r\n        } else {\r\n          const dir = path.join(__dirname, &#39;..&#39;, &#39;../vr/uploads&#39;)\r\n          const filepath = `${upload.relPath}`\r\n          const fulldir = path.join(dir, filepath)\r\n          console.log(fulldir)\r\n              try {\r\n                    res.sendFile(&#39;index.html&#39;, {root: `${fulldir}`});\r\n\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n              catch (e) {\r\n                console.error(e)\r\n              }\r\n          // return next();\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe browser is finding the html file, but unable to parse the JS files with it: \r\n\r\nGET http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7/js/three.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\nvr:21 GET http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7/js/OrbitControls.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\nvr:22 GET http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7/js/GLTFLoader.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\nvr:23 GET http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7/js/FBXLoader.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\nvr:24 GET http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7/js/inflate.min.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\nvr:25 GET http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7/js/WebGL.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\nvr:118 GET http://localhost:3000/api/5d8b74be2af25086ab77fef7/MainScene.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\n\r\nWhen I hard code the file path into the first line of code I specified here (express.static), the vr renders perfectly...
