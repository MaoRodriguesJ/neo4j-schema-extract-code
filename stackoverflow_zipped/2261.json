depends on which debugger you are using.\r\n\r\n&gt; Note that the attributes available in launch configurations vary from\r\n&gt; debugger to debugger. You can use IntelliSense suggestions\r\n&gt; (Ctrl+Space) to find out which attributes exist for a specific\r\n&gt; debugger. Hover help is also available for all attributes.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Do not assume that an attribute that is available for one debugger\r\n&gt; automatically works for other debuggers too. If you see green\r\n&gt; squiggles in your launch configuration, hover over them to learn what\r\n&gt; the problem is and try to fix them before launching a debug session.\r\n\r\n- from [launch conifgurations][1].\r\n\r\nThe dubugger for Java that you are using should provide information about its specific options.  For example, [java debugger][2] lists many options.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are a few launch attributes, like `preLaunchTask` that are provided by vscode and either mandatory or available in all launch configs.  For their descriptions, see [launch.json attributes][3]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Here are some optional attributes available to all launch\r\n&gt; configurations:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; preLaunchTask - to launch a task before the start of a debug session,\r\n&gt; set this attribute to the name of a task specified in tasks.json (in\r\n&gt; the workspace&#39;s .vscode folder).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; postDebugTask - to launch a task at the very end of a debug session,\r\n&gt; set this attribute to the name of a task specified in tasks.json (in\r\n&gt; the workspace&#39;s .vscode folder).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; internalConsoleOptions - this attribute controls the visibility of the\r\n&gt; Debug Console panel during a debugging session.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; debugServer - for debug extension authors only: this attribute allows\r\n&gt; you to connect to a specified port instead of launching the debug\r\n&gt; adapter.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; serverReadyAction - if you want to open a URL in a web browser\r\n&gt; whenever the program under debugging outputs a specific message to the\r\n&gt; debug console or integrated terminal.

am working on achieving a reproducible build for a Spring Boot-based (v2.1.3) project for which I am using gradle (v5.3) as my build tool.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when I build the project - using the *bootJar* task - on two different build servers, the MD5s of the resulting executable JAR files do not match.\r\n\r\nNote that I am using version locking and including the following clause in my build.gradle file:\r\n\r\n    tasks.withType(AbstractArchiveTask) {\r\n        preserveFileTimestamps = false\r\n        reproducibleFileOrder = true\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I execute &#39;*jar tvf myjarfile.jar*&#39; on the JAR file produced on build server A and on the JAR file produced on build server B, the results match.\r\n\r\nFurther, if I unzip the two jar files and compare the MD5 values for each of the corresponding files in those archives, those values match as well.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is creating the mismatch and how might I prevent or otherwise work around it?\r\n\r\nIf I compare hexdumps of the two JAR files, I notice that all of the diffs occur in the last portion of the files.

I&#39;m using Polka for my server (it was included with the [`sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup`][1] template so I went with it), and `cookie-session` for my session middleware.\r\n\r\nHere is my Polka configuration, where I [seed session data][2] also:\r\n\r\n    polka()\r\n      .use(\r\n        compression({ threshold: 0 }),\r\n        sirv(&#39;static&#39;, { dev }),\r\n        cookieSession({ \r\n          name: &#39;session&#39;, \r\n          keys: [\r\n            &#39;6e818055-d346-4fcb-bf56-4c7d54cb04ab&#39;, \r\n            &#39;60f3e980-6e9c-460d-8ea7-af1fffbdb92f&#39;\r\n          ]\r\n        }),\r\n        sapper.middleware({\r\n          session: (req, res) =&gt; ({\r\n            user: req.session.user\r\n          })\r\n        })\r\n      )\r\n      .listen(PORT, err =&gt; {\r\n        if (err) console.log(&#39;error&#39;, err);\r\n      });\r\n\r\nWhen a user logs in, it&#39;s handled in `routes/login.js` essentially some profile info and tokens get set on `session.user` and the request is redirected back to the root path. I&#39;m using `@polka/send-type` to respond. See below:\r\n\r\n    req.session.user = { \r\n      accessToken: access_token,\r\n      name: first_name,\r\n      pic: picture.data.url\r\n    };\r\n    send(res, 302, &#39;&#39;, {\r\n      Location: appUrl\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThere, I have a  preload module for `routes/index.svelte` checks if `session.user` exists, and if so redirects to dashboard:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script context=&quot;module&quot;&gt;\r\n      export async function preload(page, session) {\r\n        const { user } = session;\r\n\r\n        if (user) {\r\n          return this.redirect(302, &quot;dashboard&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n       }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis all works fine in dev, but when I `npm run build` and build for production it doesn&#39;t so well. It seems like the `session.user` isn&#39;t getting populated after the redirect in `login.js`. \r\n\r\nThe `session` object that I get in `preload` doesn&#39;t have `session.user` set after login, and vice versa on logout where `session.user` is simply set to null and the client is redirected to the root, `session.user` is still populated.\r\n\r\nIf I refresh the browser, `session.user` is in the correct state. Without a refresh – if I just logged out I can click around as if I were logged in, and if I had just logged in nothing happens as `session.user` is `undefined`.\r\n\r\nJust not sure why it&#39;d work on the dev build but not in production. Given that the `session.user` state is correct on browser refresh, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not an issue with the cookie middleware configuration. Seems like I&#39;m missing something else. Any help would be hugely appreciated!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template\r\n  [2]: https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Seeding_session_data","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002360/sapper-session-not-setting-properly-in-production-build-without-page-reload","title":"Sapper session not setting properly in production build without page reload"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1348,"user_id":10818128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YiTeo4kuZiQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYYf6McGCeXvwrDf9sDgLHNO5VGKQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Derek Eden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10818128/derek-eden"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568856634,"post_id":58002359,"comment_id":102410610,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002359/how-do-i-make-the-path-to-a-binary-file-consistent-across-python-virtual-environ#comment102410610_58002359"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9918345,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0v-l8TVTNF8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq0gray9wId73IZU34FcbmlLoKcKsg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Steele Farnsworth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9918345/steele-farnsworth"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1348,"user_id":10818128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YiTeo4kuZiQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYYf6McGCeXvwrDf9sDgLHNO5VGKQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Derek Eden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10818128/derek-eden"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568856724,"post_id":58002359,"comment_id":102410627,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002359/how-do-i-make-the-path-to-a-binary-file-consistent-across-python-virtual-environ#comment102410627_58002359"},{"owner":{"reputation":796,"user_id":11138259,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2faec9f4f30093c8b0f5d47a69e551f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sinoroc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11138259/sinoroc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568884966,"post_id":58002359,"comment_id":102419985,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002359/how-do-i-make-the-path-to-a-binary-file-consistent-across-python-virtual-environ#comment102419985_58002359"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1348,"user_id":10818128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YiTeo4kuZiQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYYf6McGCeXvwrDf9sDgLHNO5VGKQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Derek Eden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10818128/derek-eden"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568857034,"creation_date":1568857034,"answer_id":58002591,"question_id":58002359,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002591","body_markdown":"if the file can be anywhere you could search for it, though this could potentially take a while...\r\n\r\n    def find(name, path):\r\n        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):\r\n            if name in files:\r\n                return os.path.join(root, name)\r\n\r\nyou&#39;d have to set path as something like the root folder on linux for it to look everywhere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002359/how-do-i-make-the-path-to-a-binary-file-consistent-across-python-virtual-environ/58002591#58002591","title":"How do I make the path to a binary file consistent across Python virtual environments?"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9918345,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0v-l8TVTNF8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq0gray9wId73IZU34FcbmlLoKcKsg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Steele Farnsworth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9918345/steele-farnsworth"},"last_editor":{"reputation":796,"user_id":11138259,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2faec9f4f30093c8b0f5d47a69e551f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sinoroc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11138259/sinoroc"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568887556,"creation_date":1568854526,"last_edit_date":1568887556,"question_id":58002359,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002359","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a Python library that requires a certain binary file for some features, which it uses via the subprocess package.

Even assuming the props were passed correctly, the view would not have updated when the state changed because React only compares props and state so far.  Following the recommendation made in &quot;The Power Of Not Mutating Data&quot; (Facebook, 2019), I avoided these issues with shallow comparison by making the text-input a full React component.  I also applied React Redux to manage the state in a central store instead of passing props back and forth, which I never could get to work even after abstracting the text-input.\r\n\r\nThe code is now spread out between too many different files to post here, but anyone interested can view it on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelgill1969/react-native-dynamic-text-input) or [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@git/github.com/michaelgill1969/react-native-dynamic-text-input).\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\nFacebook.

am not sure *what* you&#39;d like to plot. But I can show you how to calculate prediction confidence intervals for your zero-inflated negative-binomial model.\r\n\r\nNote that I cannot comment on the quality of the fit, or whether fitting such a model to your data makes sense. To answer these kind of questions requires domain-specific knowledge that I don&#39;t have.\r\n\r\n1. Let&#39;s start by fitting the model to your data.\r\n\r\n        library(pscl)\r\n        model &lt;- formula(repro ~ fertilizer + level | fertilizer * level)\r\n        modelzinb &lt;- zeroinfl(model, dist = &quot;negbin&quot;, link = &quot;logit&quot;, data = df)\r\n\r\n2. We can use `predict` to get model estimates for the response. \r\n\r\n        resp &lt;- predict(modelzinb)\r\n\r\n   Note that in your zero-inflated NB model, `predict.zeroinfl` (by default) returns the estimated mean response on the scale of the observed counts `repro`.\r\n\r\n    Concerning confidence intervals (CIs), the &quot;issue&quot; here is that `precict.zeroinfl` does not have an `interval` argument that allows to calculate CIs directly. On a side note: It seems that `pscl::zeroinfl` *used* to include that functionality, see the [documentation for version 0.54](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pscl/versions/0.54/topics/predict.zeroinfl). Perhaps it would be worth contacting the package maintainer(s) about this. \r\n\r\n    The bottom line is, we have to find a different way to calculate prediction CIs. To do so, we use bootstrapping. The R library `boot` provides all the necessary functions &amp; tools to do that.\r\n\r\n3. To start, we can use the function `boot::boot` to generate bootstrap replicates of the predicted responses.`boot::boot` needs a function that generates the quantity of interest (here the predicted response) based on data. So we first define such a function `stat`. In this particular case `stat` must take two arguments: the first argument is the original data, the second argument is a vector of row indices (that define the random bootstrap sample of the data). The function will then use bootstrapped data to fit the model, and then use the model to predict the mean response based on the full data.\r\n\r\n        stat &lt;- function(df, inds) {\r\n            model &lt;- formula(repro ~ fertilizer + level | fertilizer * level)\r\n            predict(\r\n                zeroinfl(model, dist = &quot;negbin&quot;, link = &quot;logit&quot;, data = df[inds, ]),\r\n                newdata = df)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    In order to ensure reproducibility of results, we set a a fixed random seed and generate 100 bootstrap samples for the estimated mean response\r\n      \r\n        set.seed(2018)\r\n        library(boot)\r\n        res &lt;- boot(df, stat, R = 100)\r\n\r\n    The output object `res` is a `list` that contains the estimated mean response for the full data in element `t0` (verify with `all.equal(res$t0, predict(modelzinb))`) and the estimated mean response for the bootstrap samples in element `t` (which is a matrix of dimension `R x nrow(df)`, where `R` are the number of bootstrap samples).\r\n\r\n4. All that&#39;s left to do is to calculate a confidence interval from the estimated mean responses based on the models fitted to the bootstrap samples. To do so we can use the handy function `boot::boot.ci`. The function allows to calculate different types of CIs (basic, normal, BCa, etc.). Here we use `&quot;basic&quot;` for demonstration purposes. I do not claim that this is the best choice.\r\n\r\n    `boot::boot.ci` takes an `index` argument which corresponds to the entry of the estimated mean response vector. The actual intervals are stored in the last 2 columns (column 4 and 5) of the matrix stored as a `list` element of the `boot.ci` return object.\r\n\r\n        CI &lt;- setNames(as.data.frame(t(sapply(1:nrow(df), function(row)\r\n            boot.ci(res, conf = 0.95, type = &quot;basic&quot;, index = row)$basic[, 4:5]))),\r\n            c(&quot;lower&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;))\r\n\r\n5. Now we&#39;re done, and we can column-bind the CIs to the original data including predicted mean response values.\r\n\r\n        df_all &lt;- cbind.data.frame(df, response = predict(modelzinb),

So this may be a very basic question. But am unsure how to solve it. \r\n\r\n**The scenario :**\r\nI have 1 parent TileLayout.jsx control. This control will render child Tile controls.\r\nThe props passed to this TileLayout.jsx is an object called tilesMetaData.  This tilesMetaData is simply an object which is a list of tiles along with their titles and the webservice url from which to get the tile data :\r\n\r\n    tilesMetaData : {\r\n       key : &quot;some unique key&quot;,\r\n       tileMetaData : { title : &quot;string&quot; , webserviceURL : &quot;string&quot;},\r\n       tileData : { some data }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the componentWillMount() method, i am retreiving the data for the individual tiles by looping over the tilesMetaData object and getting the webservice url. Once the data is retreived, I am again filling the tilesMetaData object with tileData.\r\n\r\nSo initially empty tiles with only title is rendered. Once the data comes back the tiles are loaded with the data.\r\n\r\nIn the render method of the TileLayout.jsx\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        const { tilesMetaData } = this.props\r\n        \r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;div className=&quot;tileContainer&quot;&gt;\r\n            {\r\n              tilesMetaData.size !== 0\r\n              ?\r\n                Object.keys(tilesMetaData).map((key, index) =&gt; (\r\n                  &lt;Tile\r\n                    tileId={key}\r\n                    tileMetaData={tilesMetaData[key].tileMetaData} \r\n                    tileData={tilesMetaData[key].tileData ? tilesMetaData[key].tileData : null}\r\n                    \r\n                  /&gt;\r\n                ))\r\n              :\r\n                null\r\n              }\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The problem**\r\nEverytime the tilesMetaData is loaded with the actual tileData, the whole TileLayout control is rerendered. I do not want it to be re-rendered. I only want the respective Tile control whose data is retreived to be re-rendered. \r\n\r\nI have tried a couple of things but nothing seems to work.

It&#39;s working on my cluster exactly how you wanted it to work.\r\n\r\nNow a bit of explanations and examples.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created a cluster at [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) and enabled [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) using following command:\r\n\r\n`gcloud beta container clusters create test1 --enable-network-policy --zone us-cental1-a`\r\n\r\nThen copied your exact deployment yaml and Network Policy yaml with no changes and deployed them.\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl apply -f policy-test.yaml\r\nnamespace/net-policy-test created\r\nconfigmap/nginx1 created\r\nconfigmap/nginx2 created\r\nconfigmap/nginx-conf1 created\r\nconfigmap/nginx-conf2 created\r\ndeployment.apps/dual-nginx created\r\nservice/dual-nginx created\r\ndeployment.apps/console-full created\r\ndeployment.apps/console-partial created\r\ndeployment.apps/console-no-access created\r\n\r\n$ kubectl apply -f policy.yaml\r\nnetworkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/nginx-restrict80 configured\r\n```\r\nThe Network Policy that you wrote worked exactly as you wanted.\r\n\r\n*console-partial was only able to access nginx on port 80.\r\nconsole-no-access had no access to any nginx.*\r\n\r\nI think this is because GKE uses Calico as CNI\r\n&gt;Google Container Engine (GKE) also provides beta support for [Network Policies](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/network-policy) using the Calico networking plugin\r\n\r\nWhile you used `--network-policy azure`, which is [Azure-CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md).\r\nI&#39;m unable to test this on AKS but you might try changing that to calico. This is explained here, [Create an AKS cluster and enable network policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/azure/aks/use-network-policies#create-an-aks-cluster-and-enable-network-policy)\r\n&gt;- Creates an AKS cluster in the defined virtual network and enables network policy.\r\n&gt;   -   The  _azure_  network policy option is used. To use Calico as the network policy option instead, use the  `--network-policy calico`  parameter.\r\n\r\nAs for automating flags, maybe this would work for you.\r\n\r\nYou can see labels here:\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl describe pods console-partial | grep -A3 Labels\r\nLabels:             allow80=true\r\n                    app=console-partial\r\n                    name=console-partial\r\n                    pod-template-hash=6c6dc7d94f\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I&#39;ve started to edit  [`Labels`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/), using `kubectl labels`.\r\n\r\nRemoved a label `allow80=&quot;true&quot;`:\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl label pods console-partial-6c6dc7d94f-v8k5q allow80-\r\npod/console-partial-6c6dc7d94f-v8k5q labeled\r\n$ kubectl describe pods console-partial | grep -A3 Labels\r\nLabels:             app=console-partial\r\n                    name=console-partial\r\n                    pod-template-hash=6c6dc7d94f\r\n```\r\nand add a label `allow81= true`\r\n```\r\nkubectl label pods console-partial-6c6dc7d94f-v8k5q &quot;allow81=true&quot;\r\npod/console-partial-6c6dc7d94f-v8k5q labeled\r\n\r\n$ kubectl describe pods console-partial | grep -3 Labels\r\nLabels:             allow81=true\r\n                    app=console-partial\r\n                    name=console-partial\r\n                    pod-template-hash=6c6dc7d94f\r\n```\r\nYou can see from a test that the policy works as you wanted.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl exec -it console-partial-6c6dc7d94f-v8k5q curl http://dual-nginx:81\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;nginx, instance2&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n  &lt;h1&gt;nginx, instance 2, port 81&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n$ kubectl exec -it console-partial-6c6dc7d94f-v8k5q curl http://dual-nginx:80\r\n^Ccommand terminated with exit code 130\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this is remotely helpful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002324/combining-several-network-policies-for-fine-grained-flag-based-control/58027122#58027122","title":"Combining several network policies for fine-grained, flag-based control"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":105,"user_id":1672461,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f029619c4f701561c6c9416cb09d3407?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vetal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1672461/vetal"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569279216,"creation_date":1569279216,"answer_id":58071094,"question_id":58002324,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58071094","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve tried to recreate a cluster in Azure with Calico net policies and Azure CNI - it started to work properly for Linux -&gt; Linux communications\r\n\r\n```\r\nnetwork_plugin=&quot;azure&quot; &amp;&amp;\\\r\nnetwork_policy=&quot;calico&quot;\r\naz aks create ... \\\r\n--network-plugin ${network_plugin} \\\r\n--network-policy ${network_policy}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when Windows container is put to place on Client side.

So, at least one flag, &quot;allow80&quot; or &quot;allow81&quot; gives access to everything. How come?\r\n\r\nNow, questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is it expected behaviour?\r\n2. How to make simple flag based access control, for purpose automating it or passing to admins, who can easily produce these in large numbers?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002324/combining-several-network-policies-for-fine-grained-flag-based-control","title":"Combining several network policies for fine-grained, flag-based control"},{"tags":["json","mongodb","formatting"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be71b2ed99a9eca85ca6d1c6d1768a3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"knowledgy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087704/knowledgy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568854196,"post_id":58002322,"comment_id":102410196,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002322/can-this-json-with-timestamp-double-format-be-aggregated-for-sum-avg-in-mon#comment102410196_58002322"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be71b2ed99a9eca85ca6d1c6d1768a3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"knowledgy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087704/knowledgy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568857923,"post_id":58002322,"comment_id":102410849,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002322/can-this-json-with-timestamp-double-format-be-aggregated-for-sum-avg-in-mon#comment102410849_58002322"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be71b2ed99a9eca85ca6d1c6d1768a3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"knowledgy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087704/knowledgy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568936849,"post_id":58004211,"comment_id":102443511,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002322/can-this-json-with-timestamp-double-format-be-aggregated-for-sum-avg-in-mon/58004211#comment102443511_58004211"},{"owner":{"reputation":2621,"user_id":11857981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZpHg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mr.S.Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11857981/mr-s-sharma"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be71b2ed99a9eca85ca6d1c6d1768a3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"knowledgy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087704/knowledgy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569127190,"post_id":58004211,"comment_id":102491709,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002322/can-this-json-with-timestamp-double-format-be-aggregated-for-sum-avg-in-mon/58004211#comment102491709_58004211"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be71b2ed99a9eca85ca6d1c6d1768a3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"knowledgy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087704/knowledgy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569348188,"post_id":58004211,"comment_id":102565557,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002322/can-this-json-with-timestamp-double-format-be-aggregated-for-sum-avg-in-mon/58004211#comment102565557_58004211"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2621,"user_id":11857981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZpHg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mr.S.Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11857981/mr-s-sharma"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568870739,"creation_date":1568870739,"answer_id":58004211,"question_id":58002322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58004211","body_markdown":"We can convert the ```VFD.CurrentPV.Data``` into an array of key-value pairs using [$objectToArray][1] and then perform **SUM** and **AVG** on the values itself. \r\n\r\nThe following query can get us the expected output:\r\n```\r\ndb.collection.aggregate([\r\n    {\r\n        $addFields:{\r\n            &quot;data&quot;:{\r\n                $objectToArray: &quot;$VFD.CurrentPV.Data&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        $project:{\r\n            &quot;sum&quot;:{\r\n                $sum:&quot;$data.v&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;avg&quot;:{\r\n                $avg:&quot;$data.v&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n]).pretty()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Data set:**\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;_id&quot;

Would I be better off writing the alphabet as a string?\r\n\r\n*I have tried basic troubleshooting and forum searching.*\r\n\r\n    def encrypt(num, letters):\r\n     if 3 == len(letters):\r\n       if (num) &gt;= 1 and (num) &lt;=26:\r\n         alph = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot;,&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;l&quot;,&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;o&quot;,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;,&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;,&quot;w&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;]\r\n         letter1 = (letters[0])\r\n         letter2 = (letters[1])\r\n         letter3 = (letters[2])\r\n         indexAlph1 = alph.index(letter1)\r\n         indexAlph2 = alph.index(letter2)\r\n         indexAlph3 = alph.index(letter3)\r\n         indexEnc1 = ((indexAlph1) + (num))\r\n         indexEnc2 = ((indexAlph2) + (num))\r\n         indexEnc3 = ((indexAlph3) + (num))\r\n         letterEnc1 = (alph[(indexEnc1)])\r\n         letterEnc2 = (alph[(indexEnc2)])\r\n         letterEnc3 = (alph[(indexEnc3)])\r\n         result = ((letterEnc1) + (letterEnc2) + (letterEnc3))\r\n         return (result)\r\n       else:\r\n          print(&quot;The number must be between 1-26&quot;)\r\n     else:\r\n        print(&quot;It must be a three letter word.&quot;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002320/python-list-wraparound","title":"Python List Wraparound?"},{"tags":["python","oop"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568854954,"post_id":58002317,"comment_id":102410324,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002317/how-to-use-objects-in-python-effectively#comment102410324_58002317"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":388,"user_id":8456253,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/488d3a9f1863fb3afacbedecd42c25d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kuco 23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8456253/kuco-23"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568854986,"creation_date":1568854986,"answer_id":58002394,"question_id":58002317,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002394","body_markdown":"You define book1 if menu == 1, but if menu != 1, then book1 is undefined.\r\nNext You define a class Inventory, which has a class variable, \r\nthat uses book1, which if menu != 1 is undefined. \r\nKeep in mind that class variables get evaluated when class is defined,\r\nas you can see in this example.\r\n```python\r\nclass Obj:\r\n    var = print(&#39;var init&#39;)\r\n```\r\nwhich immediately prints &#39;var init&#39;.\r\nJust define book1, …, book5 in any scope you will need them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002317/how-to-use-objects-in-python-effectively/58002394#58002394","title":"How to use Objects in Python effectively"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11752124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c444edc7aa8023834f521ae153037ac6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Learningcoding13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11752124/learningcoding13"},"last_editor":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568854986,"creation_date":1568854102,"last_edit_date":1568854865,"question_id":58002317,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002317","body_markdown":"So I am trying to create a virtual book store and when I run my code I keep getting an error.\r\n\r\n    ask = True\r\n    def stop():\r\n    while ask:\r\n        stop_or_no()\r\n        \r\n    def stop_or_no():\r\n    menu = int(input(&quot;

For example, a `praw.ini` file may look like:\r\n\r\n    [bot1]\r\n    client_id=Y4PJOclpDQy3xZ\r\n    client_secret=UkGLTe6oqsMk5nHCJTHLrwgvHpr\r\n    password=pni9ubeht4wd50gk\r\n    username=fakebot1\r\n    \r\n    [bot2]\r\n    client_id=6abrJJdcIqbclb\r\n    client_secret=Kcn6Bj8CClyu4FjVO77MYlTynfj\r\n    password=mi1ky2qzpiq8s59j\r\n    username=fakebot2\r\n\r\nYou then use specific credentials in your code like so:\r\n\r\n    import praw\r\n\r\n    reddit = praw.Reddit(&#39;bot2&#39;, user_agent=&#39;myBot v0.1&#39;)\r\n    print(&#39;Logged in as&#39;, reddit.user.me())\r\n\r\nI think this is the best solution for working with PRAW credentials.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHowever, if you really want to do it with `python-decouple`, here&#39;s a working example:\r\n\r\n*Contents of file `.env`*:\r\n\r\n    username=k8IA\r\n    password=REDACTED\r\n    client_id=REDACTED\r\n    client_secret=REDACTED\r\n\r\n*Contents of file `connect.py`*:\r\n\r\n    import praw\r\n\r\n    from decouple import config\r\n\r\n    reddit = praw.Reddit(username=config(&#39;username&#39;),\r\n            password=config(&#39;password&#39;),\r\n            client_id=config(&#39;client_id&#39;),\r\n            client_secret=config(&#39;client_secret&#39;),\r\n            user_agent=&#39;myBot v0.1&#39;)\r\n\r\n    print(&#39;Logged in as&#39;, reddit.user.me())\r\n\r\n*Output when running `python3 connect.py`*:\r\n\r\n    Logged in as k8IA\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002311/integrating-python-decouple-with-praw/58070222#58070222","title":"Integrating python-decouple with PRAW?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pc6frIHHlm4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-gLp4ahRPsPA1JFOL0QcpuJlgRU6g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mat Stornel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087717/mat-stornel"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58070222,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569272842,"creation_date":1568854050,"question_id":58002311,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002311","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been trying to see if I can use python-decouple to place my bot credentials on a separate .env file.\r\n\r\nAuth method is basically right off the praw doc:\r\n```\r\n    reddit = praw.Reddit(\r\n        client_id=config(&#39;CLIENT_ID&#39;),\r\n        client_secret=config(&#39;CLIENT_SECRET&#39;),\r\n        password=config(&#39;PASSWORD&#39;),\r\n        user_agent=config(&#39;USER_AGENT&#39;),        \r\n        username=config(&#39;USERNAME&#39;)\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, whenever I try it, it seems to return an 403 auth error.

Both activities are declared in AndroidManifest as\r\n\r\nandroid:configChanges=&quot;keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout&quot;\r\n\r\n`android:screenOrientation` is omitted (tried `screenOrientaition=&quot;sensor&quot;`,  `screenOrientation=&quot;unspecified&quot;` etc - the same issue), `auto-rotate screen` is enabled in emulator settings.\r\n\r\nThere are different layouts for portrait and landscape orientation, specified in res/layout (tried `res/layout-port` - no changes in behaviour) and `res/layout-land`. To handle orientation change both activities override `onConfigurationChanged`.  \r\n\r\nAnything else that can trigger your instant comments?  If none, let&#39;s proceed :)\r\n\r\nOn phones and phone emulators both activities pick correct layout at start or  after orientation change. With TV emulators activities stay with landscape layout which is also correct.\r\n\r\nSomething weird happens with tablet emulators (Pixel C, Nexus 9, tried even 7&quot; WSVGA with older APIs). In landscape mode the start-up activity picks correct (landscape) orientation but uses layout for portrait, even though `orientation` field in configuration (`getResources().getConfiguration()`) has value 2 (`Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE`). This happens either when the app starts in lansdcape mode or when switches to landscape. For a clean experiment, I started the app with all activity code commented out, apart from `setContentView`  — same issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprisingly enough the second activity always gets correct layout.\r\n\r\nThere is an obvious work around by using different layout names and picking layout programmatically based on current orientation.

So you could:\r\n\r\n    (cd ci &amp;&amp; git checkout origin/master)\r\n\r\nfor instance to change the commit that is checked out in the Git repository in the `ci` directory.  You can repeat this for the `metadata` sub-directory that contains the `metadata` Git repository.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not change the commit hash IDs recorded in the *superproject* (the current Git repository).  That superproject lists which hash ID the superproject Git should use when the superproject Git runs:\r\n\r\n    (cd &lt;submodule&gt; &amp;&amp; git checkout &lt;hash-id&gt;)\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;ve changed the hash IDs you&#39;d like the superproject to check out—by entering the submodule Git repositories and checking out *other* commits, for instance—you should run `git add` in the superproject to record the new hash IDs into the index for the superproject repository:\r\n\r\n    git add ci metadata\r\n\r\nand then run `git commit` in the superproject repository, to make a new commit that records these new hash IDs.\r\n\r\nThe `git submodule` command can do some of this for you:\r\n\r\n    git submodule update\r\n\r\ntells your superproject Git to run:\r\n\r\n    (cd &lt;submodule&gt; &amp;&amp; git checkout &lt;hash-id&gt;)\r\n\r\nfor each submodule according to the hash ID currently stored in the index in the superproject.  On the other hand:\r\n\r\n    git submodule update --remote\r\n\r\ntells your superproject Git to run:\r\n\r\n    (cd &lt;submodule&gt; &amp;&amp; git fetch &amp;&amp; git checkout origin/master)\r\n\r\nin each submodule.  The name `origin/master` actually depends on configuration settings; that&#39;s just the default.

that `append()` is working correctly, you can just call it repeatedly in a loop for each item in `copy`.  \r\n\r\nThis approach, given how you implemented your linked list with a `tail` pointer, makes it an ideal solution.  You wrote the `append` function, so it&#39;s just a matter of using it in a strategic way.\r\n\r\nBe warned however, that if you had implemented your linked list without a tail pointer (where you had to traverse to the end of the list to `append`), this approach would still work, but would be highly inefficient and not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHere is an example (untested):\r\n\r\n    List(const List &amp; copy) : head(nullptr), tail(nullptr) \r\n    { \r\n         ListNode *copyNode = copy.head;\r\n         while (copyNode)\r\n         {\r\n             append(copyNode-&gt;item);\r\n             copyNode = copyNode-&gt;next;\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n   \r\nNote that this was not tested for boundary conditions, so you may need to check for `copy` being empty before having to go through the loop.  \r\n\r\n[Here is an example that works for a simple case][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/3db4a9b57e794c48","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002259/how-do-i-implement-a-deep-copy-constructor-into-a-linked-list/58002402#58002402","title":"How do I implement a deep copy constructor into a linked list?"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":10285887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-h-XNXmPvMhY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACUE/wqOLMgxQC8s/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John Harrison","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10285887/john-harrison"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568856098,"creation_date":1568853409,"question_id":58002259,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002259","body_markdown":"For this problem that I&#39;m currently working on, I&#39;m trying to create a method within this linked list that performs a deep copy from one item to another.

has this signature:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nrender?(createElement: CreateElement, hack: RenderContext&lt;Props&gt;): VNode;\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Notes for `render()` declaration:*\r\n\r\n * `hack` does not need to be declared in your code\r\n * argument declarations are unnecessary in a renderless function\r\n * return type is `VNode` (i.e., a single root node), but Vue actually accepts `VNode[]` as a return (which is what `this.$scopedSlots.default()` returns)\r\n\r\n**Solution 1:** Specify the return type as `VNode`, and return a single node that wraps `this.$scopedSlots.default()`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport Vue, { VNode, CreateElement } from &#39;vue&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default Vue.extend({\r\n  render(h: CreateElement): VNode {\r\n    return h(&#39;div&#39;, this.$scopedSlots.default!({}))\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution 2:** Use `any` type assertion on `this.$scopedSlots.default()` to workaround the type error:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport Vue from &#39;vue&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default Vue.extend({\r\n  render() {\r\n    // The container node is expected to provide a single root,\r\n    // so it&#39;s

times we&#39;re using R in contexts where we want to have reproducibility in the face of modifications and where we have complex code bases but outside of writing a package. It seems like testthat and the other testing packages are geared towards unit testing for package code, which makes sense since that&#39;s the most common case where you need a lot of testing where you&#39;re not in full control of all the data, but I was wondering if there was a good package or method for unit testing in R outside of the context of writing a package. \r\n\r\nFor example, a lot of times in a package context you&#39;re testing something of the form: \r\n```r\r\nfoo &lt;- function(bar){\r\n    # do something to bar\r\n    return(bar.outcome)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand so then you&#39;re testing for expected output from the function, that things are the right type, that there is proper error handling. The way you do this is that you create a directory in your package for tests and write them there and then devtools can use `load_all` and `testthat` to run them and produce results. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would like to be able to do is run these same sort of tests outside of the context of a package, such as in a script. This is important because a lot of R code that is written in academia doesn&#39;t generalize a whole lot to different contexts or data without considerable difficulty, so that having a package doesn&#39;t make much sense, but at the same time unit testing would make it easier to extend the code in future packages. That&#39;s the easy case.\r\n\r\nThe harder case is actually something you rarely do in packages, which is test things about the shape, kind, and state of the data. So, for example, I often read R code written in academia with comments like \r\n\r\n```r\r\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;% doSomething() #1023 rows \r\n\r\nparameter_df &lt;- // read file \r\nprint(parameter_df) # 5 columns \r\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;% doSomething(param = parameter_df)\r\n\r\nlapply(df, class) #should be char, char, char, numeric, Date\r\n\r\n```\r\nI like the idea that &quot;every time you want to write a print statement, write a test instead&quot;, but I actually don&#39;t have a good framework for how this should be done in R. Especially in this harder case where you&#39;re not testing a function, you&#39;re testing to make sure that the data flowing through your program is correct. \r\n\r\nThe context here is that R is used in a lot of contexts where the point of a script is replication in the scientific sense, but where there is possibly great gain from people being able to easily extend other&#39;s scripts which are released as part of replication materials for new projects, which is much harder to do, especially in complex code, whenever there are no tests and code can be very fragile and fail in nontrivial and *silent* ways. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002252/unit-testing-outside-of-a-package-in-r","title":"Unit testing outside of a package in R"},{"tags":["html","css","css-grid"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1791,"user_id":7644018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yE50W.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paul T.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7644018/paul-t"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568860776,"creation_date":1568860776,"answer_id":58002973,"question_id":58002249,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002973","body_markdown":"Obviously, I do not have your board image.\r\n\r\nThe `display: grid;` and the `grid-template-columns: auto ...` move into the board style to act as a container.\r\n\r\nThen style the `pit` to be &quot;cells&quot; within the grid.\r\n\r\nI changed your styles to:\r\n\r\n    &lt;style&gt;\r\n    .board {\r\n        display: grid;\r\n        grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto auto auto auto auto;\r\n        background-image: url(&quot;board.jpg&quot;);\r\n        border-style: solid;\r\n        width: auto;\r\n        height: auto;\r\n    }\r\n    .pit {\r\n      padding: 20px;\r\n      font-size: 20px;\r\n      text-align: center;\r\n    }\r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\nWhich made it look like this: (of course, this may need tweaking to match your needs)\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWhich was loosely based on an example of using grid [from here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_grid).\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YYOGp.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002249/why-is-the-grid-not-forming/58002973#58002973","title":"Why is the grid not forming?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3904,"user_id":818326,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ace3174f4519bdd2a622e1f14b2ebbae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"symlink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/818326/symlink"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568861131,"creation_date":1568861131,"answer_id":58003007,"question_id":58002249,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58003007","body_markdown":"Give your `.board` this rule `grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr)`.

As you can see, the window command gets the &quot;didnt get a response&quot; message BUT all the windows do indeed close in real life. Also I can individually control the windows.\r\n[![Google Assistant][1]][1]\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nOkay I changed my discovery from WINDOW to AWNING and that made it work. So it looks like there is something going on with the window device type? Again I&#39;ll attach the discovery response.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n    &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;5149816291025266974&quot;,\r\n    &quot;payload&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;agentUserId&quot;:

If you get an error after pressing the Alpha2 button, that means that the code tried successfully to execute whatever is in the if statement. \r\n\r\nThe problem lies in the fact that your Gameobject clone is unassigned. The variable is like an empty shell, or a husk that can contain and point to a gameobject you have inside the game. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a very simple piece of code to do the behavior you described:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n[SerializeField] Gameobject clonePrefab;

are three issues to consider.\r\n\r\nThe most significant is that `mysqldump` does not perform well when run at a distance from the database, due to limitations in the traditional MySQL client/server wire protocol, which makes no allowance for pipelining a series of commands.  \r\n\r\nThe `mysqldump` utility uses no magic to generate dump files -- it issues SQL statements to the server, and takes the results of those queries to generate its output.\r\n\r\nAs a result, every single object (schema, table, view, stored function/procedure, event) in the database requires at least one round trip and sometimes more than one.\r\n\r\nFor each table, `mysqldump` first issues `SHOW CREATE TABLE t1;` followed by `SELECT * FROM t1;` ... so a round trip time of 100 ms would mean that extracting a dump file of 150  tables would mean 150 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 0.100 = 30 seconds are simply wasted by the distance between the machine running `mysqldump` and the server -- and this is true even if the tables are completely empty.\r\n\r\nThis is **not** a recommendation, but you might take a look at [mydumper](https://github.com/maxbube/mydumper), which claims to have the ability of creating the backup using multiple database connections, in parallel, and this could help mediate the cycles wasted as commands pass to the server and return to the client, by parallelizing the dump process.  I don&#39;t know the quality of this code base, but something like this could help.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNext, you almost always want to use the `--compress` option for `mysqldump`.  Contrary to what you might assume, this **does not** compress the backup file.  The generated backup file is identical when this option is used, but when this feature is activated, the server compresses the data it sends to `mysqldump` on the wire, and `mysqldump` decompresses the data again before writing it out -- so this option will almost always make for a faster process unless the machine running `mysqldump` and the database server are connected by a low-latency, high-bandwidth network.  Because the generated file is identical, there are no compatibility concerns when using this option.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFinally, there&#39;s an issue with newly-created RDS servers that you need to be aware of, so that it doesn&#39;t skew your benchmarks.  When you create an RDS replica, it is originally seeded with data from a snapshot of the upstream master.  This is, behind the scenes, an EBS snapshot of the master&#39;s hard drive, and the new database instance is backed by an EBS volume restored from that snapshot.  EBS volumes are lazily-loaded from the snapshot, so they have a documented first-touch penalty.  This issue could have a substantial impact on the performance of the first complete backup, but should have no meaningful impact after that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002222/mysqldump-on-rds-read-replica-slave-is-50x-slower/58010744#58010744","title":"Mysqldump on RDS Read Replica Slave is 50x slower"}],"owner":{"reputation":6042,"user_id":210791,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a762671d1880f547cee648814621093a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"satnam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/210791/satnam"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568901422,"creation_date":1568853004,"question_id":58002222,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002222","body_markdown":"I created a read-replica of my MySQL database on amazon RDS.\r\n\r\nWhen executing the following command, it is super fast (half a second) on the master, but takes more like 30 seconds on the slave.

   getPlaylists(a[0:],b[0:],c[0:])\r\n\r\n`a[0:]` ([slice notation][1]) means &quot;return a sublist elements from list `a` from index `0` to the last item` - IOW, it returns a `list` (and in this case the whole list), not a single item. You want `a[0]` instead.\r\n\r\nThis being said, your data structure is wrong. Using &quot;parallel lists&quot; (2 or more lists where items are supposed to be matched by position) is brittle at best - reorder one of the list and the whole thing is broken... The proper structure here would be a list of tuples or dicts, ie:\r\n\r\n    clients = [\r\n       # (client_id, client_secret, what_is_c)\r\n       (&quot;7ce6355bc7a34c659b6ce0b6a0c53395&quot;, &quot;026081a8e1a544dbbcc2bf8a373f3088&quot;, &quot;121147088&quot;),\r\n       # etc\r\n       ]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich allow you to simply loop over it:\r\n\r\n    for a, b, c in clients:\r\n        getPlaylists(a, b, c)\r\n\r\nor using the the `*args` syntax:\r\n\r\n\r\n    for args in clients:\r\n        getPlaylists(*args)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, do yourself a favour: __use meaningfull names__. `a`, `b` and `c` means nothing, and you have to lookup how those variables are used to find out what they are.
