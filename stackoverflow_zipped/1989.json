should extend `webapp2.RequestHandler` and use the extension as the new base class for a `RESTfulHandler` and then maybe also for your specific purpose extend the `RESTfulHandler` to a

Part of building a modern web app requires a restful API. I know that I can do this with `Flask`, however I want to explore the possibility of building a REST API on `webapp2`.\r\n\r\nOn webapp2, requests are handled like this:\r\n\r\n    app = webapp2.WSGIApplication([\r\n        (&#39;/post/new&#39;, CreatePost),\r\n        (&#39;/post/([a-z0-9]+)&#39;, ViewPost),\r\n        (&#39;/post/([a-z0-9]+)/edit&#39;, EditPost),\r\n        (&#39;/post/([a-z0-9]+)/delete&#39;, DeletePost)\r\n    ])\r\n\r\nNote: `([a-z0-9]+)` is a regex that represents the `post_id`\r\n\r\nThe above request handlers do not adhere to a RESTful pattern since the request `methods` are specified in the path (/delete, /edit, /new) rather than in the request headers. \r\n\r\nIs the solution to create a single handler class that receives all request types? For example: \r\n\r\n    class PostHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):\r\n        def get(self):\r\n            # handle GET requests\r\n    \r\n        def post(self):\r\n            # handle POST requests\r\n    \r\n        def put(self):\r\n            # handle PUT requests\r\n    \r\n        def delete(self):\r\n            # handle DELETE requests\r\n\r\n\r\n    app = webapp2.WSGIApplication([\r\n        (&#39;/post/?&#39;, PostHandler)\r\n    ])\r\n\r\nIn this case, all `/post` paths are handled by PostHandler. The `post_id` is no longer used in this pattern since it would be submitted in the request body instead. \r\n\r\nIs this the correct approach to building a REST API with webapp2?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068747/webapp2-restful-api","title":"webapp2 + RESTful API"},{"tags":["php"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36861,"user_id":1011527,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/950d56c466691980bba71859798bfe65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jay Blanchard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011527/jay-blanchard"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569266309,"post_id":58068746,"comment_id":102533469,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068746/how-i-can-capital-the-first-letter-after-number#comment102533469_58068746"},{"owner":{"reputation":1603,"user_id":2500100,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z6rSM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"502_Geek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2500100/502-geek"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569305105,"post_id":58068746,"comment_id":102542990,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068746/how-i-can-capital-the-first-letter-after-number#comment102542990_58068746"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":33189,"user_id":1248114,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4XXrp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"arkascha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1248114/arkascha"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569267229,"creation_date":1569267229,"answer_id":58069062,"question_id":58068746,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58069062","body_markdown":"I&#39;d say you are looking for something like that: \r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    echo preg_replace_callback (\r\n        &#39;|\\d\\s+([a-z])|&#39;,\r\n        function ($matches) {\r\n            return strtoupper($matches[0]);\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;555 testing is going on 4 ever.&quot;\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThe regular expression matches any lowercase character following a digit followed by one or more white spaces.

stumbled upon this issue some time ago while running some code from a post. After looking into the source code of the matrix multiplication function `_eval_matrix_mul` on line 174 of [dense.py](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/7255c67ab7252d5843f1408ef0bebda47b7211aa/sympy/matrices/dense.py), it turns out that `sympy.Add` is used to perform addition during the computation process rather than the `+` operator. Therefore `Poly.add` is not invoked and a new expression is created for addition every time.\r\n\r\nFurther inspection into the source code reveals that there is a [`PolyMatrix`](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/c842c1aff9013ac0a9f1b249e8468021dd25c86c/sympy/polys/polymatrix.py) class that rewrites the matrix multiplication functions for polynominals. This class does work as expected as shown in the following. However, it does not show up anywhere in the documentation for unknown reasons so use it with caution.

By passing the null check to a static class when you see the eror in the console you can not like before directly see where it was thrown/logged from, directly go to the according code line by double clicking it and can&#39;t (that easy) highlight the according object &quot;context&quot; in the hierarchy. \r\n\r\nSo I would always keep the checks as close to the actual usage as possible and rather do it like\r\n\r\n    if(!offHandEquipLocation) Debug.LogError($&quot;{nameof(offHandEquipLocation)} is not referenced!&quot;, this);\r\n\r\nThe whole sense of `Debug.Log` is making your life easier when debugging ;) Using the above approach offers way more advantages than the fact that using your approach you don&#39;t have to type `Debug.LogError($&quot;{nameof(offHandEquipLocation)} is not referenced!&quot;, this);` multiple times.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs others and I already mentioned the reason why it doesn&#39;t work as you expect is Unity&#39;s [custom `== null`](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/05/16/custom-operator-should-we-keep-it/) behavior for the type [`Object`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.html) from which most built-in types in particular `GameObject`, `ScriptableObject` and `Component` inherit.\r\n\r\nEven though an [`Object`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.html) &quot;might appear to be&quot; or better said returns a value **equal to the value of** `null` Unity actually still stores some meta information in the reference in order to throw custom exceptions (`MissingReferenceException`, `MissingComponentException`, `UnassignedReferenceException`) which are more self explanatory then a simple `NullReferenceException` (as you can also see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58055025/unity-how-to-detect-sprite-mssing-or-null/58056372#58056372)). It therefore actually is not `null` in the underlying `object` type.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you convert it to `object` the custom `== null` behavior is gone but the underlying `object` still exists and therefoe you get `field == null` &amp;rightarrow; `false`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHowever a solution might be creating a simple overload using the [`bool` operator](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object-operator_Object.html) for [`Object`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.html). This replaces the `null` check and means something like `This object is referenced, exists, and was not destroyed yet.`. And keep using `== null` for anything else\r\n\r\n    public static void RequireField(string name, object field) \r\n    {\r\n        if (field == null) Debug.LogError($&quot;{name} field is unset&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void RequireField(string name, Object field) \r\n    {\r\n        if (!field) Debug.LogError($&quot;{name} field is unset&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nNow you can use both. As a little note: I wouldn&#39;t use a verbal `string` for the first parameter but instead always pass it inusing `nameof` to make it more secure for renamings\r\n\r\n    var GameObject someObject;\r\n    var string someString;\r\n\r\n    Validation.validate(nameof(someObject), someObject);\r\n    Validation.validate(nameof(someString), someString);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA little sidenote regarding your argument for using this on e.g. `string` in general:\r\n\r\nAs soon as this is a `public` or `[SerializedField]` field in the Inspector for any `Component` (`MonoBehaviour`) or `ScriptableObject` it is always initialized by the Unity Inspector itself with a default value. Therefore a null check for any of e.g.\r\n\r\n    public int intValue;\r\n    [SerializeField] private string stringValue;\r\n    public Vector3 someVector;\r\n    public int[] intArray;\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nis redundant since none of them will ever be `null`. This counts for any serializable type as well so even if you have a custom class\r\n\r\n    [Serializable]\r\n    public class Example\r\n    {\r\n        public string aField;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand then use a serialized field in your behaviour like e.g.\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;Example&gt; example;\r\n\r\nalso this one will never be `null`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBtw as also mentioned already `Validation` should not inherit from `MonoBehaviour` but rather be\r\n\r\n    public static class Validation\r\n    {\r\n        // only static members\r\n        ...\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068696/null-gameobject-becomes-non-null-when-i-convert-to-object/58069056#58069056","title":"null GameObject becomes non-null when I convert to object"}],"owner":{"reputation":16659,"user_id":2981429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZcCXx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"max pleaner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2981429/max-pleaner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16659,"user_id":2981429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZcCXx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"max pleaner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2981429/max-pleaner"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58069056,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569296890,"creation_date":1569265609,"last_edit_date":1569265857,"question_id":58068696,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068696","body_markdown":"I have a particular function which can take an `object` as an argument.

The only way I can seem to do this with conditional rendering but the first condition is wrapped in an accordion so it might be too caught up in-between tags for conditional rendering to work. The conditional rendering is resetting my component and hence the data fetched is lost. Wondering how to conditionally render something without losing its state. P.S. the element is a &lt;Route/&gt; from React-router so maybe that has something to do with it. Here&#39;s the code: \r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n     let Spreadsheet =\r\n                &lt;Route\r\n                    path=&quot;/spreadsheet&quot;\r\n                    render={(props) =&gt;\r\n                        &lt;Spreadsheet\r\n                            selectedStation={this.state.selectedStation}\r\n                            stationOptions={this.state.stationOptions}\r\n                            start={this.state.start}\r\n                            end={this.state.end}\r\n                            data={this.data}\r\n                            statusOptions={this.statusOptionsWithoutRaw}\r\n                            dataSegments={this.state.dataSegments}\r\n                            userSandboxes={this.state.userSandboxes}\r\n                            refreshUserSandboxes={this.getUserSandboxes}\r\n                            showSideNav={this.state.showSideNav}\r\n                            toggleSideNav={(showSideNav) =&gt; this.setState({ showSideNav })}\r\n                        /&gt;}\r\n                /&gt;\r\n    return(\r\n        &lt;Container fluid={true}&gt;\r\n                        {this.state.showSideNav ?\r\n                            &lt;Row className=&quot;row--margin&quot;&gt;\r\n                                &lt;Col md={2}&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;SideNav\r\n                                        stations={this.state.station}\r\n                                        setTab={this.setTab}\r\n                                        handleStation={this.handleStation}\r\n                                        stationOptions={this.state.stationOptions}\r\n                                        userSandboxes={this.state.userSandboxes}\r\n                                    /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;/Col&gt;\r\n                                &lt;Col md={10}&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;div className=&quot;accordion&quot; id=&quot;page&quot;&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;Card&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Card.Header className=&quot;accordionTitle&quot; as={Button} variant=&quot;link&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#station&quot;&gt;\r\n                                                Station: {this.state.selectedStation &amp;&amp; this.state.selectedStation.value}\r\n                                            &lt;/Card.Header&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Card.Body id=&quot;station&quot; className=&quot;collapse show card-body&quot; data-parent=&quot;#page&quot;&gt;\r\n                                                {Spreadsheet}\r\n                                            &lt;/Card.Body&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;/Card&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;Card&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Card.Header className=&quot;accordionTitle&quot; as={Button} variant=&quot;link&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#analysis&quot;&gt;\r\n                                                Analysis Package:\r\n                                            &lt;/Card.Header&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Card.Body id=&quot;analysis&quot; className=&quot;collapse card-body&quot; data-parent=&quot;#page&quot;&gt;\r\n                                                &lt;AnalysisPackage /&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;/Card.Body&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;/Card&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;Card&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Card.Header className=&quot;accordionTitle&quot; as={Button} variant=&quot;link&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#moreInfo&quot;&gt;\r\n                                                Click for More Station Information:\r\n                                            &lt;/Card.Header&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Card.Body id=&quot;moreInfo&quot; className=&quot;collapse card-body&quot; data-parent=&quot;#page&quot;&gt;\r\n                                                Hello!

For simplicity, the only valid passwords are lower-case letters with a maximum length specified in input.\r\n\r\nI.e, I&#39;ve got an int value and a goal. I&#39;m just trying to get it to work right now, efficiency can come later.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m thinking is that the brute-force solution is to put together a linked list with two values - the password before and after encryption - and just check input against that. I&#39;m just drawing a blank on how to make that happen; bear in mind, this solution means iterating through all possible lowercase-letter-only strings up to a variable maximum length as one gigantic linked list. Search, encrypt, and retrieval are all ready to go.\r\n\r\nIf there&#39;s anyone who&#39;s willing to lend a hand on this one - even if only on the theory side - I&#39;d really appreciate it.

Inspired by Spring&#39;s JdbcTemplate\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNow, if you had tried to inject the more common `org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate`, you wouldn&#39;t have needed to define any bean, since autoconfiguration - `JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration` - [would have created you][2] a `JdbcTemplate` based upon your `HikariDataSource`.\r\n\r\nSo you can either:\r\n\r\n* Declare a bean of type `org.flywaydb.core.internal.jdbc.JdbcTemplate` if that&#39;s what you really want. Probably not, since this is part of an &quot;internal&quot; package, and besides you really don&#39;t want your service layer knowing about your schema migration tool.\r\n* Or switch to Spring&#39;s `JdbcTemplate` and go with the flow of autoconfiguration - a good thing.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTaking the second option, and fixing the `JdbcTemplate` import in `UserDataAccessService` (also commenting out the implementation of `selectAllUsers` - which you will need to tweak - and adding a dummy `db/migration/V1_0__initial.sql`) is all I needed to do to get past your problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mvn clean spring-boot:run\r\n\r\n  .   ____          _            __ _ _\r\n /\\\\ / ___&#39;_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \\ \\ \\ \\\r\n( ( )\\___ | &#39;_ | &#39;_| | &#39;_ \\/ _` | \\ \\ \\ \\\r\n \\\\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )\r\n  &#39;  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\\__, | / / / /\r\n =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/\r\n :: Spring Boot ::        (v2.1.8.RELEASE)\r\n\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.033  INFO 18509 --- [main] com.example.demo.Main                    : Starting Main on ...\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.035  INFO 18509 --- [main] com.example.demo.Main                    : No active profile set, falling back to default profiles: default\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.692  INFO 18509 --- [main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat initialized with port(s): 8080 (http)\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.711  INFO 18509 --- [main] o.apache.catalina.core.StandardService   : Starting service [Tomcat]\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.712  INFO 18509 --- [main] org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine  : Starting Servlet engine: [Apache Tomcat/9.0.24]\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.769  INFO 18509 --- [main] o.a.c.c.C.[Tomcat].[localhost].[/]       : Initializing Spring embedded WebApplicationContext\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.769  INFO 18509 --- [main] o.s.web.context.ContextLoader            : Root WebApplicationContext: initialization completed in 711 ms\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.863  INFO 18509 --- [main] o.f.c.internal.license.VersionPrinter    : Flyway Community Edition 5.2.4 by Boxfuse\r\n2019-09-24 12:00:27.868  INFO 18509 --- [main] com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource       : HikariPool-1 - Starting...\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour project dependencies are fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/flyway/flyway/blob/master/flyway-core/src/main/java/org/flywaydb/core/internal/jdbc/JdbcTemplate.java#L32\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/2.1.x/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jdbc/JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration.java#L68","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068624/spring-config-for-connecting-to-postgres-need-bean-org-flywaydb-core-internal/58070468#58070468","title":"Spring config for connecting to Postgres.

Or can someone please explain to me how hex values is a QByteArray can be added up? This is a sample of the data : &quot;b56201241400009b4209d25e02009be0f8ffcc020407140d0000bd33&quot;. CK_A should be &quot;bd&quot; and CK_B shoud be &quot;33&quot;.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your patience.\r\nRegards","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068622/how-can-you-calculate-a-checksum-from-hex-values-stored-in-a-qbytearray","title":"How can you calculate a checksum from hex values stored in a QByteArray"},{"tags":["octobercms"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9583,"user_id":2427065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0RVn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sagar V","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2427065/sagar-v"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569265405,"post_id":58068617,"comment_id":102533080,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068617/why-does-october-cms-markdown-editor-add-an-image-in-this-odd-format-http#comment102533080_58068617"},{"owner":{"reputation":3649,"user_id":7496073,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ad17da5f307d0462eff39880d8f105b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"John Montgomery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7496073/john-montgomery"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569265425,"post_id":58068617,"comment_id":102533087,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068617/why-does-october-cms-markdown-editor-add-an-image-in-this-odd-format-http#comment102533087_58068617"},{"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":8144167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZ4kD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8144167/mart"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569298210,"post_id":58068617,"comment_id":102541061,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068617/why-does-october-cms-markdown-editor-add-an-image-in-this-odd-format-http#comment102541061_58068617"},{"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":8144167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZ4kD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8144167/mart"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569299836,"post_id":58068617,"comment_id":102541439,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068617/why-does-october-cms-markdown-editor-add-an-image-in-this-odd-format-http#comment102541439_58068617"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":8144167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZ4kD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8144167/mart"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569265251,"creation_date":1569265251,"question_id":58068617,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068617","body_markdown":"When I use the markdown editor to add an image it is in this format -\r\n\r\n    ![](http://)\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know why or how I can change this?\r\n\r\nI just manually edit it to be a regular \r\n\r\n    &lt;img&gt; \r\n\r\nelement to make it work but it would be a problem for a client to do this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068617/why-does-october-cms-markdown-editor-add-an-image-in-this-odd-format-http","title":"Why does October CMS Markdown editor add an image in this odd format? ![](http://)"},{"tags":["php","json","curl","webhooks"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1961,"user_id":7294145,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ea0785b877325d88e73471b9b191038?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S.

You&#39;ll have to create a proxy endpoint to call the script.  Depending on which server side Web API Framework you&#39;re using this would be done different ways. \r\n\r\nTo help you understand this further, if you were using express.js, you&#39;d need to have an endpoint to trigger the call (it should be a `POST` endpoint):\r\n```\r\n// POST method route\r\napp.post(&#39;/triggerKafka&#39;, function (req, res) {\r\n  const exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec, child;\r\n  const testscript = exec(&#39;bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic yourTopic --from-beginning&#39;);\r\n\r\n  testscript.stdout.on(&#39;data&#39;, function(data){\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n    // sendBackInfo();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  testscript.stderr.on(&#39;data&#39;, function(data){\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n    // triggerErrorStuff();\r\n  });\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I should say that this is probably not the way you want to do this.  For one thing, you don&#39;t want to give people outside your control the ability to start and stop Kafka listening.  \r\n\r\nYou should try to set up your Kafka consumer on the startup of your web application (server side); and provide a mechanism for connecting to it in a similar fashion as above -- proxying the calls through an API endpoint that you set up.\r\n\r\nTo start Kafka when your web application starts; you need to put the correct information in your node.js web application server startup. In your package.json if you have a &quot;scripts&quot; section you can add the following:\r\n```\r\n  &quot;scripts&quot; : { \r\n    &quot;start&quot; : &quot;&lt;whateveryouhavenow&gt;.sh &amp;&amp; npm filename.js&quot;\r\n  } \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe important part here is the `&amp;&amp; npmfile.js`; that says to run your command as well as the command that preceded it.  There are more options [here](https://itnext.io/4-solutions-to-run-multiple-node-js-or-npm-commands-simultaneously-9edaa6215a93), but I provided just one.\r\n\r\nDepending on what server side framework you&#39;re running and what task-running tool you&#39;re using, it would be different (whether it&#39;s npm, gulp, grunt, or something else).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068604/call-nodejs-kafka-script-inside-angular-8-application/58068805#58068805","title":"Call nodejs kafka script inside Angular 8

no direct way, but you can use [`openpyxl`](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) [version 2.5.5](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changes.html#id79) or later to read images and manually put them into the dataframe.   \r\n\r\nIn the following minimal example I use pandas `read_excel` to first get all the data, except the images. The crucial point is to import the image column as `object` type in order to be able to assign the images later. Otherwise this empty column will get all `NaN`s and a float data type.  \r\nThen we read the images from Excel using `openpyxl` and import them into the dataframe. The `ref` attribute of the image holds an `_io.BytesIO` stream. Its pointer points to the end (EOF) after loading the workbook, so we&#39;ll have to rewind it first (`img.ref.seek(0)`). (btw, there seems to be a bug in the `img.path` names in `openpyxl`: I get the same path `/xl/media/image1.png` for all three images whereas it is `image{1,2,3}.png` in the xlsx).  \r\nAnchor row/column values are zero based (`img.anchor.idx_base == 0`), so we have to account for the header row when computing the `iat` position in the dataframe (and possible index columns if any). Finally we export the dataframe to SQL using `to_sql`.\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import openpyxl\r\n    import sqlite3\r\n    \r\n    file_name = &#39;so58068593.xlsx&#39;\r\n    sheet_name = &#39;Tabelle1&#39;\r\n    \r\n    # read data into dataframe\r\n    df = pd.read_excel(file_name, sheet_name=sheet_name, dtype=object)\r\n    \r\n    # read images and add them to dataframe\r\n    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_name)\r\n    ws = wb[sheet_name]\r\n    for img in ws._images:\r\n        img.ref.seek(0)\r\n        df.iat[img.anchor.to.row-1, img.anchor.to.col] = img.ref.read()\r\n    \r\n    # export to sqlite\r\n    with sqlite3.connect(file_name + &quot;.db&quot;) as con:\r\n        df.to_sql(sheet_name, con=con)\r\n\r\n[Excel file](https://gofile.io/?c=Cywqr4) (images taken from [Wikipedia][1]):  \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nSQLite database viewed in DB Browser for SQLite:  \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nThis is just a minimal example. If you don&#39;t know in advance where the images are in your `xlsx` file, you could first iterate over the `images` collection of the worksheet and check which columns/rows you need for the images in your dataframe, then append them to the dataframe (if not already there) and only then assign the images. Please note, however, that in `xlsx` you can have data in a cell and at the same time an image achored to this cell, which of course can&#39;t be mapped to a database table or pandas dataframe. The reason is that images are not the content of a cell but just anchored to this cell (you could even have several images anchored to the same cell).\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Nationalflaggen\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DuTpC.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6vsz.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068593/importing-a-spreadsheet-with-cell-anchored-images-into-an-sqlite-database/58341140#58341140","title":"importing a spreadsheet with cell-anchored images into an SQLite database"}],"owner":{"reputation":42715,"user_id":997358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f849cfde4e526e22e916fa69103ef7e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"peak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/997358/peak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":42715,"user_id":997358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f849cfde4e526e22e916fa69103ef7e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"peak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/997358/peak"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":186,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58341140,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1570860644,"creation_date":1569265119,"last_edit_date":1570859587,"question_id":58068593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068593","body_markdown":"In brief: how can I export a Google Sheets spreadsheet to an SQLite database without losing the cell-anchored images?\r\n\r\nIn long:\r\n   Google Sheets, Excel, and SQLite all allow cell-anchored images.  Furthermore, Sheets supports exporting to Excel without loss of such images; and companion programs such as &quot;DB Browser for SQLite&quot;,\r\n   and LibreOffice also support cell-anchored images. However, I have not been able to export a Sheet (or an Excel spreadsheet)\r\n   to SQLite, though I have tried all the obvious possibilities, and some less obvious ones as well.  In the latter\r\n   category, two attempts are noteworthy:\r\n\r\n   a) The Python package openpyxl explicitly says\r\n      &quot;All other workbook / worksheet attributes are not copied - e.g. Images, Charts.&quot;\r\n\r\n   b) Python&#39;s `pandas` is more promising, because of the `dtype` parameter of `read_excel`.  Supposedly,\r\n      specifying this as `object` should allow preservation of objects such as cell-anchored images.\r\n\r\nHere then is one of my (failed) attempts to use pandas to achieve the desired result:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sqlite3\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nfilename=&quot;Test&quot;\r\ncon=sqlite3.connect(filename+&quot;.db&quot;)\r\n\r\nwb = pd.read_excel(&#39;Test.xlsx&#39;,sheet_name = None, header = None, dtype = object)\r\n\r\nfor sheet in wb:\r\n    print(sheet)  # Sheet1\r\n    # print( wb[sheet].columns )\r\n    wb[sheet].to_sql(sheet, con, index=False)\r\ncon.commit()\r\ncon.close()\r\n```\r\nAny solution, whether Python-based or not, would be gladly accepted.\r\n\r\n## Clarification\r\nI&#39;m aware of several techniques for extracting all the images into separate files but am looking for a fully automated technique (presumably some kind of script) for performing the conversion.  Whether or not such a technique extracts the images as an intermediate step is immaterial.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried adding `dtype` specifications in the call to `to_sql`, but to no avail.\r\n\r\n## Addendum\r\n\r\n@Stef&#39;s original program requires that the images to be copied are all in named columns, and that these names are either known or can be determined.  The first assumption is acceptable, and the second can be relaxed by simply writing:\r\n\r\n    dtype = object\r\n\r\nin the call to `read_excel`.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068593/importing-a-spreadsheet-with-cell-anchored-images-into-an-sqlite-database","title":"importing a spreadsheet with cell-anchored images into an SQLite database"},{"tags":["python","amazon-web-services","amazon-s3","aws-glue"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":100133,"user_id":174777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6PnNW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Rotenstein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/174777/john-rotenstein"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569282972,"creation_date":1569282972,"answer_id":58071457,"question_id":58068583,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58071457","body_markdown":"The samples show:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith fs.open(&#39;my-bucket/my-file.txt&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as f:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis suggests that the first parameter is `BUCKET-NAME/KEY`.\r\n\r\nHowever, your code sample shows a URL (`https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/`) instead of a bucket name.\r\n\r\nPerhaps try:\r\n\r\n    key = &#39;datalake-sbox-landing-55555-us-weast/cloudwatch_logs/prod-coarsair/dt%267D2019-09-11/144221-3837-462d-a2e6-ba300/coarsair-coarsair-144221-3837-462d-a2e6-ba300/000000.gz&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\n**Side-note:** It is recommended to use the official AWS SDK or the AWS CLI to access Amazon S3, rather than using `s3fs`.

When a notificaiton arrives the app navigated to the notification screen.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to track down the source of the problem.\r\n - tried to add more screens\r\n - added more providers and context\r\n - sent message from the app\r\n\r\nFinally, I found the source. It was how I used &#39;navigateRef.js&#39;\r\nOriginally I used it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// App.js\r\nimport { navigate, setNavigator } from &#39;./src/navigationRef&#39;;\r\n&lt;App ref={(navigator) =&gt; { setNavigator(navigator) }} /&gt; \r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// navigationRef.js\r\nimport { NavigationActions } from &#39;react-navigation&#39;;\r\n\r\nlet navigator;\r\n\r\n// nav is coming from react navigation\r\nexport const setNavigator = navRef =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(&#39;navigation ref&#39;, navRef);\r\n  // set navigator\r\n  navigator = navRef;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const navigate = (routeName, params) =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(&#39;[navigate dispatch] navigator&#39;, navigator);\r\n  navigator.dispatch(\r\n    NavigationActions.navigate({\r\n      routeName,\r\n      params\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI simply used the exact the code from react-navigation:\r\nhttps://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigating-without-navigation-prop.html\r\n\r\n```\r\n// App.js\r\nimport NavigationService from &#39;./src/NavigationService&#39;;\r\n&lt;App\r\n    ref={navigationRef =&gt; \r\n      {NavigationService.setTopLevelNavigator(navigationRef);}}\r\n/&gt;\r\n```\r\n```\r\n// NavigationService.js\r\nimport { NavigationActions } from &#39;react-navigation&#39;;\r\n\r\nlet _navigator;\r\n\r\nfunction setTopLevelNavigator(navigatorRef) {\r\n  _navigator = navigatorRef;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction navigate(routeName, params) {\r\n  _navigator.dispatch(\r\n    NavigationActions.navigate({\r\n      routeName,\r\n      params,\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n// add other navigation functions that you need and export them\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  navigate,\r\n  setTopLevelNavigator,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I worked! I do not know the difference of these two codes.\r\nThe first one worked perfectly in debug mode but not in release mode, especially the app is in foreground.\r\n\r\nCould anyone tell me the difference?

have a number of lines that i get from a command output. They follow this pattern:\r\n\r\n```constant value(u) constant(u)\r\npayload\r\nconstant value(u) constant(u)\r\npayload\r\nconstant value(u) constant(u)\r\npayload\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, (u) is an unknown character/characters.\r\n\r\nWhat i care about is &quot;payload&quot;, so i remove the &quot;constant value(u) constant(u)&quot; lines (by keeping every second line) using sed:\r\n\r\n``sed -n &#39;1~2!p&#39;``\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, there is a duplicate &quot;constant value(u) constant(u)&quot; line and that makes sed to return all the following &quot;constant value(u) constant(u)&quot; lines instead of the &quot;payload&quot; lines .\r\n\r\nI can use a regular expression to remove all &quot;constant value(u) constant(u)&quot; lines:\r\n\r\n``sed &#39;/^constant.*constant.*$/d&#39;``\r\n\r\nBut the problem is that i must have a notion that this line was there, even if it&#39;s not a &quot;payload&quot; line, so i want to replace the content of this problematic duplicate line with some string. I want to replace only the &quot;problematic&quot; duplicate lines.\r\n\r\nSo, here is an example input in normal sutiation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nafter 1 hour\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\r\nafter 2 hours\r\nCras id consequat nisl.\r\nafter 2 hours\r\nEtiam non metus eu velit maximus dapibus.\r\nafter 1 hour\r\nEtiam a mi quis ante congue posuere.\r\nafter 5 hours\r\nSuspendisse et venenatis ipsum, aliquet pharetra tortor.\r\n```\r\nThis is a &quot;problematic&quot; input:\r\n\r\n```\r\nafter 1 hour\r\nafter 6 hours\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\r\nafter 2 hours\r\nCras id consequat nisl.\r\nafter 2 hours\r\nEtiam non metus eu velit maximus dapibus.\r\nafter 1 hour\r\nEtiam a mi quis ante congue posuere.\r\nafter 5 hours\r\nSuspendisse et venenatis ipsum, aliquet pharetra tortor.\r\n```\r\nThe desired output (in case of the problematic input above) is:\r\n```\r\n(no information)\r\nafter 6 hours\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\r\nafter 2 hours\r\nCras id consequat nisl.\r\nafter 2 hours\r\nEtiam non metus eu velit maximus dapibus.\r\nafter 1 hour\r\nEtiam a mi quis ante congue posuere.\r\nafter 5 hours\r\nSuspendisse et venenatis ipsum, aliquet pharetra tortor.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to approach this in the most efficient way?

You can use this using the `Polygon` class for example. \r\n - Make a second PNG image in which you make all oceans purely transparent. Then, only spawn civilizations on the original image at locations where the image with transparency is non-transparent.\r\n\r\nJust a bunch of ideas.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068531/java-draw-only-in-certain-areas/58068868#58068868","title":"Java- Draw only in certain areas"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12001301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5b6c0331e370efe3e5252e1fddb7d0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tsall98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12001301/tsall98"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569266398,"creation_date":1569264829,"question_id":58068531,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068531","body_markdown":"I am trying to draw circles (representing people) on a PNG map of Earth.
