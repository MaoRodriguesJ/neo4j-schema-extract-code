The purpose of my program is to create a event management system where the user enters the name of the event along with the names and ID&#39;s of employees attending that event.

The attributes of my event object are name and an ArrayList of Employee objects that are attending that event. Now the problem is that in my main method, when I am asking the user to enter the name of the event, the number of employees in the event, then proceeding to ask the names and ID&#39;s of the employees attending the event, the problem is that after the information from the user is obtained, when I try to display the Employees (their names for example) that are attending an event, it just returns a null arraylist. \r\n\r\nThe problem I am having is from the line at the end of the code where is prints out the attendees for a particular event which I have identified with asterisk.\r\n\r\nHere is some code from the main class:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Main {\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic static void main (String[] args) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tArrayList&lt;Event&gt; events = new ArrayList&lt;Event&gt;();\r\n\t\tArrayList&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt;();\r\n\r\n\t\tEvent event = null;\r\n\t\tEmployee employee = null;\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\tScanner key = new Scanner (System.in);\t\t\r\n\t\tString name, employeeName, id = &quot;&quot;;\r\n\t\tint numOfEmployees, attendees = 0;\r\n\r\n\t\tSystem.out.print(&quot;How many events?

By this I mean there is the typical filter icon on the column of the pivot I desired.  Clicking on this header icon shows that a label filter has been applied and when I click to the filter itself: Filter in header --&gt; Label Filters --&gt; Not Between ......I see the -10 and 10 in the value fields.  The issue is that the actual data in the pivot table does not reflect the filter - it has not been applied (ie. Values between -10 and 10 are still visible).\r\n\r\nI tried macro recording and my syntax matches.  I also tried using `Worksheets(&quot;Summary&quot;).PivotTables(&quot;Pivot1&quot;).PivotCache.Refresh` after the filter is placed but this did not help.\r\n\r\nThe odd bit, is that if I apply the filter via VBA and then click through as described above, when I click &quot;Okay&quot; at the point I see the -10 and 10 on the Not Between filter, the filter then activates and the data in the pivot reflects the filter.\r\n\r\nIn essence, my filter is being placed onto the pivot table, but it is not &quot;actioning&quot; and the pivot table data does not reflect the filter that appears to be active on it.\r\n\r\nThanks all!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nI have created the code below:\r\n\r\n     With Worksheets(&quot;Summary&quot;).PivotTables(&quot;Pivot1&quot;).PivotFields(&quot;Sales&quot;)\r\n        For i = 1 To .PivotItems.count\r\n            If i &gt; -10 And i &lt; 10 Then\r\n                .PivotItems(i).Visible = False\r\n            Else\r\n                .PivotItems(i).Visible = True\r\n            End If\r\n        Next i\r\n    End With\r\n\r\nThis is not evaluating and filtering based on the values in the Sales Column of my pivot, but it does actually move / filter the data within the table.  Is there a way to perhaps adapt this methodology and loop or work through each pivot line and change the `.Visibility` based on the value in the Sales Column?\r\n\r\nThis would be a workaround to using filters entirely, but might achieve what I need.\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981409/pivot-table-label-filter-is-applied-but-data-does-not-actually-filter","title":"Pivot Table Label Filter Is Applied But Data Does Not Actually Filter"},{"tags":["c#","windows-10-iot-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2381,"user_id":5394572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H9Ql7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"madreflection","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394572/madreflection"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568751695,"post_id":57981405,"comment_id":102372212,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981405/how-to-reference-and-store-properties-of-a-class-in-another-class#comment102372212_57981405"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12081442,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d46ee9e7e898dbf266301e5d4e48a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"qnetjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081442/qnetjoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568753057,"post_id":57981555,"comment_id":102372745,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981405/how-to-reference-and-store-properties-of-a-class-in-another-class/57981555#comment102372745_57981555"},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11523568"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12081442,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d46ee9e7e898dbf266301e5d4e48a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"qnetjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081442/qnetjoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568753149,"post_id":57981555,"comment_id":102372796,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981405/how-to-reference-and-store-properties-of-a-class-in-another-class/57981555#comment102372796_57981555"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11523568"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568752151,"last_edit_date":1568752151,"creation_date":1568751654,"answer_id":57981555,"question_id":57981405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57981555","body_markdown":"A constructor can&#39;t take `ref` parameters.\r\n\r\n    public Sensor(double analogInput, GpioPin input1, GpioPin input2)\r\n    {\r\n        AnalogInput = analogInput;\r\n        Input1 = input1;\r\n        Input2 = input2;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can provide an instance of the complex object.\r\n\r\n    public Sensor(HWClass hw)\r\n        : this(hw.ADC1Value, hw.INPUT1, hw.INPUT2)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr just store that complex object internally if you would.\r\n\r\n    public class Sensor\r\n    {\r\n        private HWClass hw;\r\n    \r\n        public Sensor(HWClass hw)\r\n        {\r\n            this.hw = hw;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice that value types are copied into the other class while reference types point to the same reference.

I am following the tutorial [here](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/run_configurations.html).  The main difference is that I am building the plugin in Kotlin, not Java. There is something I don&#39;t get about the [UI Form/Settings editor](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/run_configurations.html#bind-the-ui-form). The panel returned by `createEditor()` is marked as `@NotNull` yet seems to always be null. \r\n\r\nHere is the full example:\r\n```\r\npublic class DemoSettingsEditor extends SettingsEditor&lt;DemoRunConfiguration&gt; {\r\n    private JPanel myPanel;\r\n    private LabeledComponent&lt;ComponentWithBrowseButton&gt; myMainClass;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void resetEditorFrom(DemoRunConfiguration demoRunConfiguration) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void applyEditorTo(DemoRunConfiguration demoRunConfiguration) throws ConfigurationException {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @NotNull\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected JComponent createEditor() {\r\n        return myPanel;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void createUIComponents() {\r\n        myMainClass = new LabeledComponent&lt;ComponentWithBrowseButton&gt;();\r\n        myMainClass.setComponent(new TextFieldWithBrowseButton());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitially, I assumed it to be an example and one should create their own panel and return it.  However, when I look at other [full examples in GitHub](https://github.com/rkhmelyuk/multirun/blob/idea16/src/main/java/com/khmelyuk/multirun/ui/MultirunRunConfigurationEditor.java#L107), I see the same thing.  Panel is always null. \r\n\r\nBecause of the mismatch between `@NotNull` and the return value, I can&#39;t seem to get Kotlin to return a null JPanel type.  My converted code (by intellij) looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass OpenHABSettingsEditor : SettingsEditor&lt;OpenHABRunConfiguration&gt;() {\r\n    private val myPanel: JPanel? = null\r\n    private var myMainClass: LabeledComponent&lt;ComponentWithBrowseButton&lt;*&gt;&gt;? = null\r\n\r\n    override fun resetEditorFrom(demoRunConfiguration: OpenHABRunConfiguration) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Throws(ConfigurationException::class)\r\n    override fun applyEditorTo(demoRunConfiguration: OpenHABRunConfiguration) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    override fun createEditor(): JComponent {\r\n        return myPanel\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private fun createUIComponents() {\r\n        myMainClass = LabeledComponent&lt;ComponentWithBrowseButton&lt;*&gt;&gt;()\r\n        myMainClass!!.component = TextFieldWithBrowseButton()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, it does not compile.  If I do a `return myPanel!!` I get an NPE (rightfully so). I can&#39;t change the return type to `JComponent?`.  \r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n  \r\n\r\n 1. Should the JPanel really be null despite the annotation?\r\n 2. If the answer to #1 is yes, how do I accomplish that in Kotlin?\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: I converted the above code to Java so I could return null.  I now get an error when I run it stating:\r\n```\r\n@NotNull method com/github/boctothefuture/openhab/plugin/OpenHABSettingsEditor.createEditor must not return null \r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: @NotNull method com/github/boctothefuture/openhab/plugin/OpenHABSettingsEditor.createEditor must not return null\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it appears the system isn&#39;t expecting it to be null.  But I never see it initialized in any of the official JetBrains plugins that I spot checked in the [plugin project on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981401/should-the-jpanel-in-run-configuration-settings-editor-be-null-and-how-to-manage","title":"Should

The code will act as a primitive server.  It needs to create a listening socket, and then each time it is contacted, it needs to **accept()** the incoming connection, then spin off a thread to handle some basic processing.  The threading and processing part I more-or-less have working, but the **accept()** part breaks down after the code successfully handles some initial connections..  This is a problem, because I anticipate that this program will need to run continuously and may have to process a lot of incoming requests.\r\n\r\nSome environmental stuff first:  I’m working on a Ubuntu box, and my code is compiled with GCC:\r\n\r\n    root@ubuntu:/home/me/socketProject# gcc -v\r\n    ...\r\n    gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4)\r\n    root@ubuntu:/home/me/socketProject#\r\n\r\nMy **main()** function sets up a listening socket, then starts an infinite loop.

I worked out all the logic and got everything working perfectly when there is only one incoming connection.\r\n\r\nBut then I started stress-testing, and immediately realized I had a problem.  I wrote a client program that send X number of test requests, all in a row.  The above server code works fine for a few initial requests, but then breaks down.

In the above example, something happens after about ten successful requests, then **accept()** starts complaining of **ERRNO 22**.  A quick Google search revealed that **ERRNO 22** is “***EINVAL: Invalid argument***”, which obviously isn’t good.\r\n\r\nI’ve done some simple socket programming from my student days, but I’ve never had a problem with **accept()** before.  I’m really puzzled.  It looks to me like N-1 requests arrive and are successfully processed by **accept()**.  But then the Nth appears, **accept()** doesn’t like it, and the socket gets corrupted.  How or why, I don’t know.\r\n\r\n**accept()** is complaining about &quot;invalid argument(s)&quot;.  But the client is literally sending the exact same test message over and over.  How can the N-1 connections present valid arguments, but the Nth, N+1th, N+2th... argument be invalid?  That blows my mind.\r\n\r\nSome observations:\r\n\r\n - This is a black-and-white phenomenon.  By that, I mean that the\r\n   socket works perfectly 100% of the time, but then something bad\r\n   happens with **accept()**, and then the socket never works again.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n - I’ve run a lot of tests, and there’s no telling how many successful\r\n   connections I’ll get when I start a new test.  I’ve had as many as 88\r\n   successful connections before the socket stops working.  In another\r\n   test, I only had 2 successful connections before the socket went\r\n   belly-up.  The average number of successful connections before the\r\n   socket breaks is about 17.\r\n   \r\n  \r\n - My client test program does not try to space out the requests it\r\n   sends; it simply opens a socket and starts bombarding my server\r\n   program at top speed.  I’m doing this because I want to stress-test. \r\n   But perhaps my client program is sending test requests too fast for\r\n   the server to keep up…?\r\n   \r\n   \r\n - It is also possible, I suppose, that the client program is causing\r\n   the problem.  I don’t think so, because it just sends the same test\r\n   message over and over and it never throws an error.\r\n\r\nHas anyone ever seen an issue like this?  I’ve been looking on SO for about an hour, but I can’t find another post where **accept()** works, and then doesn’t.\r\n\r\nAny help/advice is appreciated.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981377/c-programming-accept-works-and-then-doesnt-in-stress-testing","title":"C Programming :: accept() works and then doesn&#39;t, in stress-testing"},{"tags":["c#","linq","sharepoint","project-online"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11501306,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/659b7c6286a47d5a1d5c041791a228b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"USMC6072","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11501306/usmc6072"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11501306,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/659b7c6286a47d5a1d5c041791a228b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"USMC6072","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11501306/usmc6072"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568818850,"creation_date":1568750843,"last_edit_date":1568818850,"question_id":57981373,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57981373","body_markdown":"I am a new C# programmer and I am maintaining an app that updates the resource&#39;s base calendar based on their location in AD.  The original function grabs all project online resources and tests them for the default base calendar:\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;string&gt; GetUserNamesWithBaseCalendar()\r\n        {\r\n            List&lt;string&gt; names = new List&lt;string&gt;();\r\n            var resources = projectContext.EnterpriseResources;\r\n            projectContext.Load(resources, rs =&gt; rs.Include(r =&gt; r.BaseCalendar, r =&gt; r.Name));\r\n            projectContext.ExecuteQuery();\r\n            foreach (var resource in resources)\r\n            {\r\n                if (resource.BaseCalendar.Name == &quot;Standard&quot;)\r\n                {\r\n                    names.Add(resource.Name);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            return names;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI wanted to make this more efficient, and test for the base calendar and whether the resource is Active, in the query.

Your code is by far not enough to tell why it is not working but I&#39;ll try:\r\n\r\nIn case the `WanderingAI` is a `MonoBehaviour` component (which seems to be the case since you are trying access `transform`\r\n\r\n    WanderingAI w = new WanderingAI();\r\n\r\nis an absolute **no go**! This component should be attached to a `GameObject` and either set when instantiating or has to be found on runtime dynamically.\r\n\r\nI would guess the missing reference exception isn&#39;t thrown for `w` but rather for the line\r\n\r\n    transform.position\r\n\r\nin `getEnemyPos`.\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t see where or how you Instantiate this. So just as an example you **could** (see better way below) simply hand the instantiated fireball the `Transform` reference of who fired it:\r\n\r\nIn the fireball have a field\r\n\r\n    public Transform enemyTransform;\r\n\r\nand then set it together with the instantiation\r\n\r\n    public Fireball fireballPrefab;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    var fireball = Instantiate(fireballPrefab, transform.position, transform.rotation);\r\n    fireball.enemyTransform = transform;\r\n\r\nYour get position methods are quite redundant. `transform.position` is always public for any `GameObject` and `Componnet`(`MonoBehaviour`) reference so as soon as you have a reference to the enemy or your fireball (object or component doesn&#39;t matter) you can simply directly access e.g.\r\n\r\n    enemy.transform.position\r\n\r\nAnd just general notes: Method names in c# should start with a capital letter. And storing every single value in a local variable or class field is also quite unnecessary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## However\r\n\r\nInstead of using the responsible enemy transform **at all** you could simply store the fireballs **own start position**. Then you wouldn&#39;t have to care about the enemy anymore. Also taking the enemy&#39;s position into account in `Update` might not work correctly if the enemy moves meanwhile ;)\r\n\r\nSince you are only moving in the `z` direction you could simply check the so far traveled distance and wouldn&#39;t even need a reference to the enemy\r\n\r\n    // Adjust in the Inspector\r\n    [SerializeField] private float range = 10;\r\n\r\n    // Stores the initial position\r\n    private Vector3 startPosition;\r\n\r\n    private void Start()\r\n    {\r\n        // Store position before starting to move\r\n        startPosition = transform.position;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void Update ()\r\n    {\r\n        transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * speed * Time.deltaTime);\r\n\r\n        // Directly compare to the initial position\r\n        // Without having to care who fired this ball\r\n        if(Mathf.Abs(startPosition.z - transform.position.z) &gt;= range)\r\n        {\r\n            Destroy(gameObject);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Or simply\r\n        if(Vector3.Distance(startPosition, transform.position) &gt;= range)\r\n        {\r\n            Destroy(gameObject);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCurrently you are also only moving in **global** Z direction .. is this really what you wanted to do?

Put score/result fields in the games table and update them once the game has been played.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981316/trying-to-create-an-nfl-database-that-has-multiple-tables-but-cant-find-a-solut/57981439#57981439","title":"Trying to create an NFL database that has multiple tables but can&#39;t find a solution to creating an effective primary key"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12081621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCFL3RMbXGU5sbcXl1UiXSTmhkEH_JZvWHIzStM=k-s128","display_name":"Jay Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081621/jay-hogan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568844419,"post_id":57981625,"comment_id":102408289,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981316/trying-to-create-an-nfl-database-that-has-multiple-tables-but-cant-find-a-solut/57981625#comment102408289_57981625"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":40087,"user_id":3470178,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/655943089/picture?type=large","display_name":"Juan Carlos Oropeza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3470178/juan-carlos-oropeza"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568752040,"creation_date":1568752040,"answer_id":57981625,"question_id":57981316,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57981625","body_markdown":"Expanding Justsalt answer:\r\n\r\nYour table `games` need their own PK, I suggest `game_id` with auto numeric.

A *team* can have one-to-many *games*. Therefore, a unique set of teams (team ID as primary key) should be related to many games (team ID as foreign key, allowed to repeat for each unique game instance). And because there are and will only be two teams per game, you will maintain two foreign keys pointing to same primary key. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate with a [diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5d81496614d7fc1c039e1290):\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Table diagram][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you can think of it as parent-child relationship.

The teams table is exactly what you would think - a table full of all 32 teams with an id associated with them. The games table contains a games_id, which team was home and away, the week of the game and so on. The record table contains a record_id, the home and away team again, as well as a winner column.\r\n\r\nThe problem I keep running in to is finding a solution that would allow each team to be in the games table more than once and how to link that to the other tables. For example, the Patriots have an id of 21 in the teams table. if I put 27 as the id in the games table, I can only have the Patriots in their once, when they play 16 games...\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated and thank you in advance!

I also created measures to sum up the sales, GP, and qty also count the ticket_number&#39;s as times item was bought. \r\n\r\nI created the following code to rank those measures:\r\n\r\n    RANK STOCKCODE =\r\n    IF (\r\n        SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 1,\r\n        RANKX ( ALL ( Lines[stockcode] ), [ITEM TOTAL] ),\r\n        IF (\r\n            SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 2,\r\n            RANKX ( ALL ( Lines[stockcode] ), [ITEM GP $] ),\r\n            IF (\r\n                SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 4,\r\n                RANKX ( ALL ( Lines[stockcode] ), [QTY BOUGHT] ),\r\n                IF (\r\n                    SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 5,\r\n                    RANKX ( ALL ( Lines[stockcode] ), [TIMES ITEM WAS BOUGHT] ),\r\n                    RANKX ( ALLNOBLANKROW ( Lines[stockcode] ), [ITEM TOTAL] )\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThen I create my table with the stockcodes column and drop in the measures along with the ranking measure, and it works great...until I drop in the commodity and inhouse/non inhouse columns (which are unique to the stockcodes).  For some reason, and I can&#39;t understand the logic Power Bi is using to do this, the RANKX takes every variation of combination between commodity/noncommodity and inhouse/non inhouse into consideration when it creates ranks for the stockcodes and makes duplicates doing so.  \r\n\r\nI tried making a separate table of the stockcodes, removing duplicates and applying lookup columns to the stockcodes to ensure there were no duplicate combinations I wasn&#39;t aware of, but it still duplicates.  Dense rank doesn&#39;t work.  Skip doesn&#39;t work.  I cannot figure out how to fix this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTried excluding the commodity and inhouse column into consideration with filters, hasones value, all selected, reloving the all() and just referring to the Table.\r\n\r\nTried this but it just ranked every stockcode as rank = 1:\r\n\r\n    RANK STOCKCODE =\r\n    IF (\r\n        SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 1,\r\n        RANKX ( ALLEXCEPT ( Lines, Lines[ISCOMMODITY], Lines[ISTAMCO] ), [ITEM TOTAL] ),\r\n        IF (\r\n            SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 2,\r\n            RANKX ( ALLEXCEPT ( Lines, Lines[ISCOMMODITY], Lines[ISTAMCO] ), [ITEM GP $] ),\r\n            IF (\r\n                SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 4,\r\n                RANKX ( ALLEXCEPT ( Lines, Lines[ISCOMMODITY], Lines[ISTAMCO] ), [QTY BOUGHT] ),\r\n                IF (\r\n                    SELECTEDVALUE ( TOPNITEMS[TOPNVALUES] ) = 5,\r\n                    RANKX (\r\n                        ALLEXCEPT ( Lines, Lines[ISCOMMODITY], Lines[ISTAMCO] ),\r\n                        [TIMES ITEM WAS BOUGHT]\r\n                    ),\r\n                    RANKX ( ALLEXCEPT ( Lines, Lines[ISCOMMODITY], Lines[ISTAMCO] ), [ITEM TOTAL] )\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981295/how-to-prevent-rankx-from-duplicating-when-i-add-columns","title":"How to prevent RANKX from duplicating when I add columns"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","exception","redis","rescue"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":12081412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1A6S4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Omnivium","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081412/omnivium"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568778898,"post_id":57983353,"comment_id":102378137,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981292/in-rails-is-there-a-way-to-short-circuit-out-of-a-rescue-from/57983353#comment102378137_57983353"},{"owner":{"reputation":327,"user_id":8197386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3PsfAC8lxvE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJU/9gierdn8mII/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"sevensidedmarble","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8197386/sevensidedmarble"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":116,"user_id":12081412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1A6S4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Omnivium","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081412/omnivium"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568821711,"post_id":57983353,"comment_id":102399620,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981292/in-rails-is-there-a-way-to-short-circuit-out-of-a-rescue-from/57983353#comment102399620_57983353"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":327,"user_id":8197386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3PsfAC8lxvE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJU/9gierdn8mII/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"sevensidedmarble","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8197386/sevensidedmarble"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568764869,"creation_date":1568764869,"answer_id":57983353,"question_id":57981292,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57983353","body_markdown":"&gt;So my question is: is there any way to get the rescue_from block to just stop and not continue triggering anything else after a certain line is reached?\n\nYes, just call the ruby `break` keyword.\n\n`break` is for breaking out of a block entirely. `next` is for breaking out of a block and moving on to the next iteration (like in a while loop).

I&#39;m using the built in `redis_cache_store` and have `reconnect_attempts` set, but I would like to send the user to a custom error page in the event that Redis remains down, rather than have them be stuck on a nonresponsive page with no idea what is going on.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried was to monkey-patch the `failsafe` method in `RedisCacheStore` by re-raising a new type of error, `RedisUnavailableError`, which I then have my `application_controller` catch and `redirect_to` a static 500 page.\r\n\r\nWhere this breaks down is that I would like my application to just stop after the redirect.  In the `byebug` trace below, you can see that before the second-last block I&#39;ve included, the `redirect` line is reached.  \r\n\r\nBut it does not stop; I&#39;ve included just the first of a long sequence of further methods invoked that eventually results in another attempt to write to Redis, which is still down, which then re-raises the same sequence of exceptions, which Rails then will not catch a second time (indeed even if it did, that would be an infinite loop).\r\n\r\nSo my question is: is there any way to get the `rescue_from` block to just _stop_ and not continue triggering anything else after a certain line is reached?  \r\n\r\nAlternately, is there any way to on the fly &quot;disable&quot; Redis or change the cache store/settings to some nullary value in the `rescue_from` block so that anything further triggered won&#39;t try to talk to Redis?\r\n\r\n```\r\n    [40, 49] in (DELETED)/redis_failsafe.rb\r\n       40:   rescue ::Redis::BaseConnectionError =&gt; e\r\n       41:     byebug\r\n       42:     handle_exception(exception: e, method: method, returning: returning)\r\n       43:     returning\r\n       44:     byebug\r\n    =&gt; 45:     raise RedisUnavailableError\r\n       46:     # Re-raise the exception when reconnect attempt fails, so our application controller can handle it.\r\n       47:   end\r\n       48: end\r\n       49: \r\n    (byebug) c\r\n    \r\n    [INFO][15:50:51] [3cf7] [GET] [(DELETED):3000] [/suppliers] \r\n    ∙ Redirecting to 500 page due to: RedisUnavailableError\r\n    \r\n    [30, 39] in /(DELETED)/application_controller.rb\r\n       30:   authorize_resource class: false\r\n       31: \r\n       32:   rescue_from RedisUnavailableError do |exception|\r\n       33:     byebug\r\n       34:     Rails.logger.info &quot;Redirecting to 500 page due to: #{exception.message}&quot;\r\n    =&gt; 35:     redirect_to &#39;/500.html&#39;\r\n       36:     byebug\r\n       37:   end\r\n       38: \r\n       39:   rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound do\r\n    (byebug) n\r\n    ∙ Redirected to http://(DELETED)/500.html\r\n    Return value is: nil\r\n    \r\n    [32, 41] in /(DELETED)/application_controller.rb\r\n       32:   rescue_from RedisUnavailableError do |exception|\r\n       33:     byebug\r\n       34:     Rails.logger.info &quot;Redirecting to 500 page due to: #{exception.message}&quot;\r\n       35:     redirect_to &#39;/500.html&#39;\r\n       36:     byebug\r\n    =&gt; 37:   end\r\n       38: \r\n       39:   rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound do\r\n       40:     render status: :not_found, plain: &#39;Not found&#39;\r\n       41:   end\r\n    (byebug) n\r\n    \r\n    [51, 60] in /(DELETED)/rescuable.rb\r\n       51:   def rescue_with_handler(exception, object: self, visited_exceptions: [])\r\n       52:     visited_exceptions &lt;&lt; exception\r\n       53: \r\n       54:     if handler = handler_for_rescue(exception, object: object)\r\n       55:       handler.call exception\r\n    =&gt; 56:       exception\r\n       57:     elsif exception\r\n       58:       if visited_exceptions.include?(exception.cause)\r\n       59:         nil\r\n       60:       else\r\n    (byebug) \r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981292/in-rails-is-there-a-way-to-short-circuit-out-of-a-rescue-from","title":"In Rails, is there a way to &quot;short-circuit&quot; out of a rescue_from?"},{"tags":["python","postgresql"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8511641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2d6c150faecc9da8fa1f8d224474332?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mikey1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8511641/mikey1"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3194,"user_id":9374673,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zya5E.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mihai Chelaru","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9374673/mihai-chelaru"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568752535,"creation_date":1568750470,"last_edit_date":1568752535,"question_id":57981291,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57981291","body_markdown":"I have the following code, which is adding a record to a Postgres database using SQLAlchemy:  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nproc = record(pid=pid, jobid=jid, process_type=&#39;backtest&#39;)          \r\ndb.session.add(proc)\r\ndb.session.commit()\r\ndb.session.flush()\r\nreturn proc.id\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error I get is:\r\n\r\n    &#39;property&#39; object is not subscriptable \r\n\r\nwith `process_type=&#39;backtest&#39;`.\r\n\r\nReplacing `&#39;backtest&#39;` with any other string seems to work.

I cannot import it explicitly in my code, this library is provided by JavaScript engine at runtime. \r\nI want to make coding easier by extending VSCode Intellisense by this library on all my project. I have a JavaScript file with function signatures of this library.\r\nWhat are the ways to do this? I already tried:\r\n\r\n 1. write `/// &lt;reference path=&#39;&#39;&gt;` to file in project. It works but \r\n    it’s not very convenient to write it in all files. \r\n 2. use jsconfig.json file. This method did not work for me. Maybe I did   \r\n    something wrong. \r\n 3. create extension with `vscode.codeCompletionProvider`. It works but VSCode does not perceive the input code as an object, interpreting it like text.   \r\n    That&#39;s why after dot symbol VSCode offers other text that I entered \r\n    as part of the program and my completion item located below this   \r\n    text.\r\n\r\nI have the following directory structure\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── project1\r\n│   ├── ...\r\n│   └── modules\r\n├── project2/\r\n│   ├── ...\r\n│   └── modules\r\n├── projectN/\r\n│   ├── ...\r\n│   └── modules\r\n├── types\r\n│   └── lib.js (file that I want to add to Intellisense)\r\n├── .gitignore\r\n└── jsconfig.json\r\n```\r\nAnd I tried the following file contents of `jsconfig.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   &quot;include&quot;: [&quot;types/**/*&quot;] // (also tried [&quot;types/lib.js&quot;] and [&quot;types/**/*.js&quot;])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease help to deal with this issue.

The *string* `&quot;Positive integer&quot;` is the *argument* to `get_positive_int`.  `get_positive_int` passes that string (`prompt`) on to `get_int`, which does the actual work of writing the prompt string to standard output and reading the input you type in.  \r\n\r\n`get_int` obviously calls `vprintf`.  All the `*printf` functions require a *format string* to tell them how many additional arguments to expect, what their type is, and how their values should be formatted for output.  In this particular case, we&#39;re telling `vprintf` to expect a single argument of type `string` (`char *`).  \r\n\r\nYou can write more complex prompts for `get_int`, such as\r\n\r\n    i = get_int( &quot;Enter the %d&#39;th name: &quot;, count );\r\n\r\nIf count is `5`, then the prompt will be written as\r\n\r\n    Enter the 5&#39;th name:\r\n\r\n`get_int` then calls C&#39;s input functions (`fgets`, `fscanf`, whatever) to read and parse what you type in and make sure it&#39;s a valid integer.  \r\n\r\n&amp;lt;gratuitous rant&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nThe CS50 library abstracts away most of the gorier details of C I/O and string handling, which is nice, but in the process leaves you *absolutely unprepared* for the reality of text processing in C - it&#39;s a *lot* harder than CS50 makes it look.  \r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;re done with CS50, throw away *everything* it taught you about strings and I/O and find a decent C reference manual.

This depends on what you have configured inside **application.properties** file. This port is referred to as **ContainerPort** in below steps. \r\n\r\n 1. Execute `docker run &lt;image-name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;`. This will run the image and show container logs on the console. If there is something wrong with your spring-boot app, the logs will show that and the container will shutdown. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the container and return to shell.\r\n 2. If there is no error in step 1 run `docker run -d -p&lt;HostPort&gt;:&lt;ContainerPort&gt; &lt;image-name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;`. Here **HostPort** is any free port in your GCP host VM and **ContainerPort** is the port used by your spring boot application within the container. Option `d` starts your container in detached mode.\r\n 3. Run `docker ps` and make sure that the container started in step 2 is running. It may not run if there is an error - for example if the **HostPort** you specified is already in use.\r\n 4. If step 3 shows that the container is running, execute `curl http://localhost:&lt;HostPort&gt;/&lt;End-Point-Path&gt;`. Here **End-Point-Path** is a valid path to a working endpoint within the container. If the endpoint is correct you should see expected result from the spring-boot app in the console.\r\n 5. Navigate to **Google Cloud Console -&gt; VPC network -&gt; Firewall rules** and add a firewall rule to open **HostPort** on your GCP VM. \r\n 6. Access your endpoint via the VM&#39;s external IP with URL - `http://&lt;VM-External-IP&gt;:&lt;HostPort&gt;/&lt;End-Point-Path&gt;`\r\n\r\nUnless there is an application issue with your spring-boot app these steps should get you going.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981251/cannot-connect-to-container-optimized-os-running-a-spring-boot-application-usin/57989919#57989919","title":"Cannot connect to Container-optimized-os (running a spring-boot application using docker) using external ip"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":6060723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90540b0923c7bc4a5f1b90ea6f4b826a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nayan dhabarde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6060723/nayan-dhabarde"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568873252,"creation_date":1568873252,"answer_id":58004652,"question_id":57981251,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58004652","body_markdown":"I was able to build the correct solution by your help (John Hanley and Cyac). \r\nI am combining both solutions in order to help the next person facing this.\r\n\r\nAs told by John, by default Spring boot uses port 8080, not 80 and as specified by Cyac you need to specify the port as 80 explicitly in application.properties file using \r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nserver.port=80\r\n```\r\n\r\n 1.

am working on a project, where I basically do crud using material-table interface.

Please see the code below which is straight forward from https://material-ui.com/components/tables/ last example. Of course I have modified on my codebase for my personal use and everything works fine, but I am not sure how is it possible to make fields required if I want too? If yes, how would I do it?

&quot;shallow-immutable&quot; in that you can&#39;t change the fields themselves, but it&#39;s not *fully* immutable - which means you lose pretty much all the benefits associated with immutability.\r\n\r\nBasically to achieve immutability, all the constituent parts must either *be* naturally immutable, or *sometimes* you can get away with using something which is mutable but a) you constructed it, so nothing else has a reference to it; b) you never *expose* a reference to it; c) you never mutate it yourself.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can write an immutable type that uses `java.util.Date` (although I&#39;d strongly recommend using `java.time`) - you&#39;d just need to make sure that if you ever wanted to return a date from a method, you cloned it instead of returning the value of the field.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981224/can-i-have-stringbuilder-in-an-immutable-class/57981267#57981267","title":"Can I have StringBuilder in an immutable

Firestore is extremely fast but might as well make fewer calls when possible. The technique I&#39;ve adopted with Firestore is to store the data that I think I will need with the data I&#39;m pulling.\r\n\r\nSo if I were to pull `incidents` and I know I will need a `user`, their `username`, and their `profile picture`, then I will store a user field in each question document that has the user&#39;s ID, username, and profile picture.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n    Incidents:\r\n    ---&gt; Incident\r\n    ---&gt; Date\r\n    ---&gt; ReportedBy:\r\n    -------&gt; ID\r\n    -------&gt; Profile Picture\r\n    -------&gt; Username\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nThe thing that you will need to make a decision on is how much of the user&#39;s data can stay out-of-date and which bits of data need to remain updated. For anything that needs to remain updated, like usernames that may affect routing, you can listen for changes to your core user collection:\r\n\r\n    exports.updateUser = functions.firestore\r\n        .document(&#39;user/{userId}&#39;)\r\n        .onUpdate((change, context) =&gt; {\r\n          const newValue = change.after.data();\r\n          const previousValue = change.before.data();\r\n    \r\n          const newName = newValue.name;\r\n          const oldName = previousValue.name;\r\n    \r\n          if (newName !== oldName){\r\n              //update all incidents where userId matches.\r\n          }\r\n    \r\n          // perform other desired operations ...\r\n        });\r\n\r\nYou can see this part of the documentation for more information on Cloud Functions: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/firestore-events#trigger_a_function_when_a_document_is_updated\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57948591/problems-trying-to-fetch-cloud-firestore-data/57949620#57949620","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57981192/how-to-perform-nested-queries-in-cloud-firestore/57983561#57983561","title":"How to perform nested queries in Cloud Firestore?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":386,"user_id":11928130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JWC8N7XoTrA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACEo/D4eJI2sybss/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"tzovourn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11928130/tzovourn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":386,"user_id":11928130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JWC8N7XoTrA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACEo/D4eJI2sybss/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"tzovourn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11928130/tzovourn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569233589,"last_edit_date":1569233589,"creation_date":1568798488,"answer_id":57989322,"question_id":57981192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57989322","body_markdown":"Firestore now supports nested queries.

am sure I am missing something really simple, but I&#39;ve spent hours on it and I can&#39;t figure it out.\r\n\r\nIn my app-routing.module, I am lazy loading modules (Angular 8):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        path: &quot;console&quot;,\r\n        component: LayoutComponent,\r\n        canActivate: [AngularFireAuthGuard, ConsoleGuard],\r\n        data: { authGuardPipe: redirectUnauthorizedToLogin },\r\n        children: [\r\n          {\r\n            path: &quot;&quot;,\r\n            loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&quot;./dashboard/dashboard.module&quot;).then(mod =&gt; mod.DashboardModule),\r\n            pathMatch: &quot;full&quot;\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            path: &quot;apps/inbox&quot;,\r\n            loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&quot;./pages/apps/inbox/inbox.module&quot;).then(mod =&gt; mod.InboxModule),\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            path: &quot;contacts&quot;,\r\n            loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&quot;../app/contacts/contacts.module&quot;).then(mod =&gt; mod.ContactsModule)\r\n          },\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nEverything works.  \r\n\r\nNow I want to add a new module. So I add this :-\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      path: &quot;campaigns&quot;,\r\n      loadChildren: () =&gt;\r\n        import (&quot;../app/campaigns/new-campaign/new-campaign.module&quot;).then(mod =&gt; mod.NewCampaignModule)\r\n    },\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nNewCampaign is basically empty :-\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n// new-campaign.module.ts\r\n\r\n    import { CommonModule } from &#39;@angular/common&#39;;\r\n    import { NgModule } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n    import { NewCampaignComponent } from &#39;./new-campaign.component&#39;;\r\n\r\n    @NgModule({\r\n      imports: [\r\n        CommonModule,\r\n      ],\r\n      declarations: [NewCampaignComponent],\r\n      exports: [NewCampaignComponent]\r\n    })\r\n    export class NewCampaignModule {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    // new-campaign.component.ts\r\n\r\n    import { Component, OnInit } from &quot;@angular/core&quot;;\r\n\r\n    @Component({\r\n      selector: &quot;common-new-campaign&quot;,\r\n      templateUrl: &quot;./new-campaign.component.html&quot;,\r\n      styleUrls: [&quot;./new-campaign.component.scss&quot;],\r\n    })\r\n    export class NewCampaignComponent implements OnInit {\r\n      constructor() {}\r\n\r\n      ngOnInit() {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- new-campaign.component.html --&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\r\n      New Campaign\r\n    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis basically hangs the app (I think it&#39;s in an infinite loop), but there&#39;s nothing in the console. No error.  After a while Chrome says the application is not responding and I have to kill it. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve done this a dozen times before (for this very app) and it just works. I can&#39;t figure out what I screwed up. Any hint will be greatly appreciated.
