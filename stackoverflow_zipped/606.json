you find a robust way that will convert your duration into the total number of seconds. This is robust as it does not need to have all the quantities listed. I.e. the output can be any of the following:\r\n\r\n     System uptime: 16 minutes, 2 seconds\r\n     System uptime: 12 days, 3 seconds\r\n     System uptime: 15minutes,12hours\r\n\r\n1. Create a file `convert.awk` which contains\r\n\r\n        BEGIN { a[&quot;seconds&quot;]=1; a[&quot;minutes&quot;]=60\r\n                a[&quot;hours&quot;]=3600; a[&quot;days&quot;]=86400;\r\n                a[&quot;weeks&quot;]=7*86400 }\r\n        { tmp=tolower($0) }\r\n        { while (match(tmp,/[0-9]+[^a-z]*[a-z]+/)) {\r\n            u=substr(tmp,RSTART,RLENGTH); q=u+0; gsub(/[^a-z]/,&quot;&quot;,u)\r\n            t+=q*a[u]\r\n            tmp=substr(tmp,RSTART+RLENGTH)\r\n          }\r\n          print t\r\n        }\r\n\r\n2. Run the following command:\r\n\r\n        $ echo &quot;System uptime: 2 days, 9 hours, 16 minutes, 5 seconds&quot; | awk -f convert.awk\r\n        206165\r\n        $ echo &quot;System uptime: 2 weeks, 9 days, 16 minutes, 5 seconds&quot; | awk -f convert.awk\r\n        1988165\r\n\r\n**How does this work:**\r\n\r\nWhen we read a line, eg.\r\n\r\n    tmp=&quot;system uptime: 16 minutes, 2 seconds&quot;\r\n\r\nThe `match` command will search for any substring which starts with numbers and ends with a character string. `match` will automatically set the variables `RSTART` and `RLENGTH` to the position of the found substring and the length of it. This way, the command `u=substr(tmp,RSTART,RLENGTH)` will set \r\n\r\n    u=&quot;16 minutes&quot;\r\n\r\nYou can now just do an arhtmetic operation on this, to extract the first number. This works with awk as it will convert any string starting with numbers into a number by ignoring anything after it. So `q=u+0` creates\r\n\r\n    q=16\r\n\r\nFinally, we remove anything which is not a character from `u` leading to\r\n\r\n    u=&quot;minutes&quot;\r\n\r\nThe next step we redefine `tmp` by removing whatever we already processed.\r\n\r\n    tmp=&quot;, 2 seconds&quot;\r\n\r\nand start the process all over.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396989/convert-asterisk-uptime-string-to-date/58397774#58397774","title":"Convert asterisk uptime string to date"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":4985509,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a338f68e3b6f9d7e29cf77f438d05de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"calabash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4985509/calabash"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58397774,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571316948,"creation_date":1571149729,"question_id":58396989,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396989","body_markdown":"how can i convert &quot;System uptime: 2 days, 9 hours, 16 minutes, 5 seconds&quot; to a bash date?\r\n\r\nI want to compare this date with another one.\r\n\r\nThx in advance.

To fix your issue you could declare the variable inside your static method. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396986/correctly-declare-variables-in-javascript-classes/58397230#58397230","title":"Correctly declare variables in JavaScript classes"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":387,"user_id":10406502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8127fd3ae9b27b6badff76c416df79c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andr&#233; Reichelt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10406502/andr%c3%a9-reichelt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571150891,"post_id":58397308,"comment_id":103140193,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396986/correctly-declare-variables-in-javascript-classes/58397308#comment103140193_58397308"},{"owner":{"reputation":80908,"user_id":179125,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5594142dcc49a24b1902ec8059181f8d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jordan Running","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/179125/jordan-running"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":387,"user_id":10406502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8127fd3ae9b27b6badff76c416df79c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andr&#233; Reichelt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10406502/andr%c3%a9-reichelt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571151290,"post_id":58397308,"comment_id":103140438,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396986/correctly-declare-variables-in-javascript-classes/58397308#comment103140438_58397308"},{"owner":{"reputation":80908,"user_id":179125,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5594142dcc49a24b1902ec8059181f8d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jordan Running","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/179125/jordan-running"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":387,"user_id":10406502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8127fd3ae9b27b6badff76c416df79c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andr&#233; Reichelt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10406502/andr%c3%a9-reichelt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571152178,"post_id":58397308,"comment_id":103140953,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396986/correctly-declare-variables-in-javascript-classes/58397308#comment103140953_58397308"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":80908,"user_id":179125,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5594142dcc49a24b1902ec8059181f8d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jordan Running","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/179125/jordan-running"},"last_editor":{"reputation":80908,"user_id":179125,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5594142dcc49a24b1902ec8059181f8d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jordan Running","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/179125/jordan-running"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571152615,"last_edit_date":1571152615,"creation_date":1571150738,"answer_id":58397308,"question_id":58396986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58397308","body_markdown":"[Static class fields](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Class_fields#Public_static_fields) are a stage 3 proposal, meaning they&#39;re not yet an official part of the JavaScript language. (Stage 4 is the final stage.) You can read more about the proposal [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-static-class-features) and the proposal process [here](https://tc39.es/process-document/).\r\n\r\nCurrently, Chrome (as of version 72) is the only browser that [supports](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esnext/#test-static_class_fields) static class fields.\r\n\r\nTo use this feature in other browsers you would need to use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with [@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties) to transpile your code. If you&#39;re not already using Babel, however, this might be overkill.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can assign a property to the class after initializing it. This isn&#39;t semantically identical, but works for your (and, indeed, most) use cases.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass AddOrSelectAddress {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nAddOrSelectAddress.body = &#39;some initial value&#39;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see this working in the below snippet.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    class AddOrSelectAddress {\r\n      static changeBody(val) {\r\n        this.body = val;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      static someMethod() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;in someMethod body is&#39;, this.body);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      static someOtherMethod() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;in someOtherMethod body is&#39;, this.body);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    AddOrSelectAddress.body = &#39;some initial value&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    AddOrSelectAddress.someMethod();\r\n    AddOrSelectAddress.changeBody(&#39;some other value&#39;);\r\n    AddOrSelectAddress.someOtherMethod();\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want to set an initial value for `body` then you could just omit the line (since accessing a nonexistent property of an object returns `undefined`), or you could explicitly set it to `undefined`.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396986/correctly-declare-variables-in-javascript-classes/58397308#58397308","title":"Correctly declare variables in JavaScript classes"}],"owner":{"reputation":387,"user_id":10406502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8127fd3ae9b27b6badff76c416df79c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andr&#233; Reichelt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10406502/andr%c3%a9-reichelt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":387,"user_id":10406502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8127fd3ae9b27b6badff76c416df79c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andr&#233; Reichelt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10406502/andr%c3%a9-reichelt"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58397308,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571152615,"creation_date":1571149724,"last_edit_date":1571150228,"question_id":58396986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396986","body_markdown":"In my code, I do the following (very simplified):\r\n\r\n````\r\nclass AddOrSelectAddress {\r\n    static body; // &lt;-- Error\r\n\r\n    static async open() {\r\n        await $.get(basePath + &#39;Manage/AddOrSelectAddress&#39;, null, result =&gt; {\r\n            this.body = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n            this.body.innerHTML = result;\r\n        });\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static someOtherMethod() {\r\n        // do something with body\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nMy code works fine in Chrome.

What it does is to check which is the last cell that is populated **within the first row** (in case your first row is empty or can be empty, I recommend that you set it to another row that you know will be populated).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396966/how-to-permanently-1-a-variable-outside-of-a-for-loop/58398652#58398652","title":"How to permanently +1 a variable outside of a for loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11998330,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DpGyoDP2euc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcN17xgrUYKDNiscmJOX_RoK528Eg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jack Bird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11998330/jack-bird"},"last_editor":{"reputation":617,"user_id":12152337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0a63fcf6cc90b9937ef23d7dcc88829?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carlesgg97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152337/carlesgg97"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571163802,"creation_date":1571149660,"last_edit_date":1571163802,"question_id":58396966,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396966","body_markdown":"I have a Python script that pulls cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance. It scrapes this data and then inputs it into a Google Sheet. What I want is for this script to run once per day, which I will schedule through task scheduler, and each day pull the data from Yahoo Finance and then input into the sheet.\r\n\r\nI want this spreadsheet to store data historically. For example, first column = today&#39;s data, second column = tomorrow&#39;s data (which the script will collect when it runs tomorrow) which means the column value needs to +1 after the script runs every time. I&#39;ve put the column number into a variable, so what I&#39;m essentially trying to do is this;\r\n\r\ntoday, c \r\ntomorrow, c + 1\r\nday after, c + 2\r\n\r\nand so on, so that the sheet gets filled out and the data doesn&#39;t get overwritten. I doubt there&#39;s a way to permanently change the value of the variable other than going into the script and changing the value of c manually before it runs. Is there any other way to go about this?\r\n\r\nNot sure how to tackle this - c = c + 1 at the end of the function was my best guess but I know this won&#39;t work. The only other thing I can think of is to write out this function hundreds of times, first time c = 1, second time c = 2 and so on with &quot;time.sleep(86400)&quot; in between functions and have the script running constantly but as you can imagine I&#39;d rather not do that.\r\n```python\r\ndef google_sheet_import(var1):\r\n    r = 2\r\n    c = 3\r\n    for w in (var1):\r\n        cc_worksheet.update_cell(r, c, w.text)\r\n        r = r + 1\r\n    \r\n    google_sheet_import(intraday_price)\r\n```\r\nAll that happens is the script overwrites the data in c because I can&#39;t get it to permanently change the value of c after the script runs.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396966/how-to-permanently-1-a-variable-outside-of-a-for-loop","title":"How to permanently +1 a variable outside of a for loop"},{"tags":["spring","axis","webservicetemplate"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":565,"user_id":5558122,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbf61d1785bf699592ad2f8c81ad484e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vladimir Pligin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5558122/vladimir-pligin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571150669,"post_id":58396960,"comment_id":103140061,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396960/axis-client-to-spring-webservice-template#comment103140061_58396960"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12221137,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAlt0OOYd3A8iYNvZsmoDtQi4oAZaypJNoUJNFY4g=k-s128","display_name":"santosh sagar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12221137/santosh-sagar"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571149633,"creation_date":1571149633,"question_id":58396960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396960","body_markdown":"Due to security issues, i am replacing Axis client program code with  Spring webservice template, but for this operation i am unable to find an alternate solution in spring webservicetemplate.\r\n\r\ncall.setProperty(USERNAME_PROPERTY, value);\r\n\r\ni tried with UsernamePasswordCredentials but it didnt work.\r\nAny help is appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396960/axis-client-to-spring-webservice-template","title":"Axis client to Spring webservice template"},{"tags":["angular","angular-material","mat-table"],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":10334068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecab7f9150025236418d11fcf49515ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C Modi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10334068/c-modi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571149624,"creation_date":1571149624,"question_id":58396956,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396956","body_markdown":"table in group based on user selection from dropdown.\r\nAlso there is multiple filters which user can do.\r\n\r\nhere is [stackblitz][1] URL.\r\nThis URL is not showing any data, as all data is fetching from server.

a very weird problem in a Rails 4 application that session variables can be correctly set before sign in but can not after sign in\r\n\r\nIt is an old app with Rails 4.2.11 and Ruby 2.2.10, Devise 3.5.6 is used for user authentication. Recently need to add multi-tenant support by using apartment gem, due to some reasons, sub-domain approach is not used to determine tenant, but add tenant selection during login as well as tenant switch in UI. \r\nWould like to set the current tenant in session, so that it is available cross requests. But it is weird that the session variable value can not be updated.\r\n\r\nThe flow is \r\n\r\n 1. It works with omniauth, after login in the omniauth provider, the following callback method is called to set the current tenant and sign in to devise. \r\n 2. POST /users/switch_tenant to switch to another tenant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the piece of code to set the initial tenant during sign in, and it works.\r\n```ruby\r\n  # /app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb\r\n  # the callback entry of omniauth \r\n  def &lt;provider_name&gt;\r\n    # some code to check token, get user and default tenant etc.\r\n    session[:current_tenant] = user_org\r\n    sign_in_and_redirect @user\r\n  end\r\n```\r\nSign in works, and the session[:current_tenant] is correctly set and available in views and controllers. \r\n\r\nIn another method to switch tenant, the code is like\r\n```ruby\r\n  # /app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb\r\n  # POST /users/switch_tenant\r\n  def switch_tenant\r\n    tenant_id = params[:tenant_id]\r\n    session[:current_tenant] = tenant_id\r\n    Rails.logger.debug &quot;New tenant in session: #{session[:current_tenant]}&quot;\r\n    # check authorization etc...\r\n    redirect_to root_path\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithin this controller method, the session[:current_tenant] is updated to new value (according to the debug log). But after redirect, when opening the root path, the session[:current_tenant] is reset back to the original value during sign in. \r\nI also tried to set a temp session variable in controller like\r\n```ruby\r\n  # app/controllers/test_controller.rb\r\n  # GET /test/test\r\n  def test\r\n    Rails.logger.debug &quot;session value in request: #{session[:test_key]}&quot;\r\n    session[:test_key] = &quot;test value&quot;\r\n    Rails.logger.debug &quot;session value after set: #{session[:test_key]}&quot;\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n```\r\nThe output is always like\r\n```\r\n  session value in request:\r\n  session value after set: test value\r\n```\r\nSeems that can not set a new session variable, and can not update an existed session variable. But it can be set before the sign in...\r\n\r\nI did some search, and tried following, still not working:\r\n1) cache is disabled by setting response headers:\r\n```\r\n    response.headers[&#39;Cache-Control&#39;] = &#39;no-cache, no-store&#39;\r\n    response.headers[&#39;Pragma&#39;] = &#39;no-cache&#39;\r\n```\r\n2) temply remove CSRF by comment out \r\n```\r\n  #protect_from_forgery with: :exception\r\n```\r\n3) the cookie size is checked, around 1.2k, less than 4k limit\r\n\r\nHad spent a whole day but no clue...\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n[Update]\r\n\r\nCurrent work around is to change to use cache store instead of cookie store, but still dont know the root cause. I think it should be config issue somewhere...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396882/can-not-change-session-variable-value-after-login-in-rails-4","title":"Can not change session variable value after login in Rails 4"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","antd"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9405,"user_id":10106580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvGaY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dupocas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10106580/dupocas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571149589,"post_id":58396881,"comment_id":103139425,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396881/how-to-render-html-code-in-a-react-table-component#comment103139425_58396881"},{"owner":{"reputation":3556,"user_id":1689144,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c33331737d16ff09ad03fe5ff9914e40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kyle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1689144/kyle"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571151179,"post_id":58396881,"comment_id":103140369,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396881/how-to-render-html-code-in-a-react-table-component#comment103140369_58396881"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11006882,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ns96suHJ_M0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNM6R8RkxMGBiK97N9JETHlyfnl6w/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kirill Barsukov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11006882/kirill-barsukov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2052,"user_id":9036322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2029964853699364/picture?type=large","display_name":"mthrsj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9036322/mthrsj"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571149630,"creation_date":1571149328,"last_edit_date":1571149630,"question_id":58396881,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396881","body_markdown":"I stuck in a simple problem I believe.

have mounted my destination server on my windows machine on `Y:` drive. I created a folder on the destination folder and when I open cygwin and run my rsync command to move data from my machine to the mounted server I get this error `rsync failed: Permission denied (13)` and I find that destination folder which I created which had permissions set as it&#39;s parent&#39;s folder now changed permissions to the local machine. Not sure why? I want to use rsync to move the data from my machine to the mounted server and match the permissions of the destination&#39;s parent folder.

Any advice?\r\n\r\nThis is how my rsync command looks like:\r\n\r\n    rsync -0 --files-from=- -ptOW --info=progress2 --no-super --remove-source-files - /cygdrive/y/parent_folder/folder_to_be_copied","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396877/rsync-failed-permission-denied-13-cygwin","title":"rsync failed: Permission denied (13) cygwin"},{"tags":["scala","apache-spark","apache-spark-sql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":731,"user_id":9687910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tBvRY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chlebek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9687910/chlebek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571151535,"post_id":58396875,"comment_id":103140580,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396875/joining-of-tables-is-working-but-the-select-query-is-giving-issues-in-spark#comment103140580_58396875"},{"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":2495867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c503fbe6840159a9573f0cb219deb642?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vivek Cu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2495867/vivek-cu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":731,"user_id":9687910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tBvRY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chlebek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9687910/chlebek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571225016,"post_id":58396875,"comment_id":103167311,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396875/joining-of-tables-is-working-but-the-select-query-is-giving-issues-in-spark#comment103167311_58396875"},{"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":2495867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c503fbe6840159a9573f0cb219deb642?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vivek Cu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2495867/vivek-cu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":731,"user_id":9687910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tBvRY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chlebek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9687910/chlebek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571225100,"post_id":58396875,"comment_id":103167355,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396875/joining-of-tables-is-working-but-the-select-query-is-giving-issues-in-spark#comment103167355_58396875"},{"owner":{"reputation":731,"user_id":9687910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tBvRY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chlebek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9687910/chlebek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571225724,"post_id":58396875,"comment_id":103167741,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396875/joining-of-tables-is-working-but-the-select-query-is-giving-issues-in-spark#comment103167741_58396875"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":2495867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c503fbe6840159a9573f0cb219deb642?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vivek Cu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2495867/vivek-cu"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571149316,"creation_date":1571149316,"question_id":58396875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396875","body_markdown":"I have two tables which i have joined in spark.

have two methods that do the exact same thing, except one examines a range of indices going forward from Current, and the other examines a range going backward from Current. I have abstracted the functionality so that the common code is in one method and it just takes an IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; as a parameter to know the range of indices to iterate through. So now my two methods are simplified to:\r\n\r\n    private List&lt;Thingy&gt; GetForwardThingies()\r\n    {\r\n    \tvar indices = new List&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    \tfor (var i = _project.Current; i &lt; _project.GetLimit(); i++)\r\n    \t\tindices.Add(i);\r\n    \treturn GetThingiesByIteratingOverIndices(indices);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private List&lt;Thingy&gt; GetBackwardsThingies()\r\n    {\r\n    \tvar indices = new List&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    \tfor (var i = _project.Current; i &gt;= 0; i--)\r\n    \t\tindices.Add(i);\r\n    \treturn GetThingiesByIteratingOverIndices(indices);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs there a more elegant way (perhaps using LINQ) to encapsulate this abstraction? GetThingiesByIteratingOverIndices is pretty fast and not speed-critical, as it will be operating over no more than a few dozen indices, so efficiency is not a primary concern. I was thinking maybe the new System.Range thing in C# 8.0 would help, but alas it does not allow a way to express a backwards range.

The second solution work perfect for me but if there is any danger I would like to avoid it. \r\nIs anybody could give me solution which may work without eval() function. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396860/call-function-from-string-and-eval-function","title":"Call function from string and eval() function"},{"tags":["validation","google-sheets","filter","dropdown","google-sheets-formula"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10870316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MFK8Dck3hL4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbHmAJ2IOpw9BDOuwfOICfSsmN9_g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shaedo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10870316/shaedo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571157039,"post_id":58397620,"comment_id":103143570,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396857/dropdown-recursive-problem-dropdown-without-data-validation-possible/58397620#comment103143570_58397620"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":25645,"user_id":5632629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pfxka.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"player0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5632629/player0"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571151609,"creation_date":1571151609,"answer_id":58397620,"question_id":58396857,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58397620","body_markdown":"you could solve this with 2 side columns which you can then hide. column **E** will feed the dropdown of **A1** and **B1**. and then column **F** will feed **C1** where **F2** will contain:\r\n\r\n    =FILTER(E2:E, E2:E&lt;&gt;A1, E2:E&lt;&gt;B1)\r\n\r\n[![0][1]][1]\r\n\r\n[![0][2]][2]\r\n\r\n[![0][3]][3]\r\n\r\n##[spreadsheet demo][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/xBGAH.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9b8rl.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBPKQ.png\r\n  [4]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YM7Xa-YAnqeF954ueSEnphIZTBcyXjUaMaMq3rc8SeQ/copy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396857/dropdown-recursive-problem-dropdown-without-data-validation-possible/58397620#58397620","title":"Dropdown... recursive problem / dropdown without data validation possible?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10870316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MFK8Dck3hL4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbHmAJ2IOpw9BDOuwfOICfSsmN9_g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shaedo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10870316/shaedo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571166735,"creation_date":1571166735,"answer_id":58401247,"question_id":58396857,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58401247","body_markdown":"I found a solution.&lt;br&gt;\r\nI made a filter for every row with all remaining values (&quot;Column C - Column A - Column B&quot;) for that row by using the following formula and simply adding the value in Column B from that row again at the end to that filter.
