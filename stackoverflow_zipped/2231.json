I called `Comments:list` with the `parentId` set to one of the top-level comment, but the returned replies were sorted in reverse-chronological order. That is, the first element in the `items` array was the latest reply. This is not useful, because both the official Android app or the YouTube website shows comments in chronological order (older replies first).\r\n\r\nIf there aren&#39;t many replies, I could simply get all replies first, and then reverse the array&#39;s order. But there could be lots of replies and in that case the result will be divided by pages. I cannot pass the page number, but the `nextPageToken`, so requesting pages in the reverse order (requesting `n`th first, and then `n-1`th, etc) is not possible. \r\n\r\nThe only workaround I could think of is to get all replies at once and then reverse the order. This could be problematic if there are many replies.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug, or did I do something wrong? I could not find any &quot;order&quot; or &quot;sort&quot; parameters in the [`Comments:list`](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/comments/list) API.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPS: It seems I can get replies using `CommentThreads::list` with  `part = replies` the `id = top-level comment&#39;s ID`. This works (returns chronological order) when there aren&#39;t many replies, but for some reason, the API does not support paging or setting `maxResults` in this mode. The documentation says,\r\n\r\n&gt; Note: This parameter is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, I have tested getting replies of a top-level comment with 500 replies. This method returned only the latest 5 replies. \r\n\r\nSo far, the only workaround I could find is calling `Comments:list` multiple times with `parentId = top-level comment&#39;s ID` and `maxResults = 100`, get ALL replies, and reverse the order on the client. Not so scable way, but there aren&#39;t many comments with hundreds replies, so, it would work for the time being.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009876/youtube-data-api-for-getting-replies-to-a-comment-returns-replies-in-reverse-chr","title":"YouTube Data API for getting replies to a comment returns replies in reverse-chronological order"},{"tags":["angular"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1265,"user_id":6851836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db3d881c8af1ff5dafe72b5d2ca3f256?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hsuan Lee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6851836/hsuan-lee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568892377,"post_id":58009875,"comment_id":102424052,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009875/does-code-inside-isdev-if-blocks-gets-deleted-after-a-prod-build-tree-sha#comment102424052_58009875"},{"owner":{"reputation":1887,"user_id":1255819,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/623356084/picture?type=large","display_name":"distante","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255819/distante"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1265,"user_id":6851836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db3d881c8af1ff5dafe72b5d2ca3f256?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hsuan Lee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6851836/hsuan-lee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568899139,"post_id":58009875,"comment_id":102428088,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009875/does-code-inside-isdev-if-blocks-gets-deleted-after-a-prod-build-tree-sha#comment102428088_58009875"},{"owner":{"reputation":1265,"user_id":6851836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db3d881c8af1ff5dafe72b5d2ca3f256?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hsuan Lee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6851836/hsuan-lee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568943954,"post_id":58009875,"comment_id":102444726,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009875/does-code-inside-isdev-if-blocks-gets-deleted-after-a-prod-build-tree-sha#comment102444726_58009875"},{"owner":{"reputation":1887,"user_id":1255819,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/623356084/picture?type=large","display_name":"distante","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255819/distante"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1265,"user_id":6851836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db3d881c8af1ff5dafe72b5d2ca3f256?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hsuan Lee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6851836/hsuan-lee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569223400,"post_id":58009875,"comment_id":102512129,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009875/does-code-inside-isdev-if-blocks-gets-deleted-after-a-prod-build-tree-sha#comment102512129_58009875"}],"owner":{"reputation":1887,"user_id":1255819,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/623356084/picture?type=large","display_name":"distante","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255819/distante"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1887,"user_id":1255819,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/623356084/picture?type=large","display_name":"distante","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255819/distante"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568892630,"creation_date":1568892148,"last_edit_date":1568892630,"question_id":58009875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009875","body_markdown":"I want to put some big debugging code inside a `isDev()` if block like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(isDev()) {\r\n // create a log of debug stuff here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is, is that code shipped to the build production? and If yes.

times?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009872/saving-state-of-system-random","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Saving state of

could check if they are already in there\r\n\r\n    class AttrDict(dict):\r\n        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n            self.__dict__

it states the following:\r\n*dict(iterable) -&gt; new dictionary initialized as if via:\r\n            d = {}\r\n            for k, v in iterable:\r\n                d[k] = v*\r\n\r\nSo this does

am currently working on a kattis problem: Treasure Hunt, [Link](https://open.kattis.com/problems/treasure). The goal is to find the path which will cost the least amount of days to reach the treasure.  \r\n\r\nI currently use Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm with weighted vertexes to calculate the shortest route to the treasure. I have defined a class &#39;Node&#39; in which I define it&#39;s weight and the previous Node if assigned. I use a heapq and needed to override the __lt__ method in my Node class. \r\n\r\nWhen the shortest route is defined I try to calculate the number of days that it will take to complete this shortest route.\r\n\r\nI know it is not the fines code, I am sorry.\r\n\r\nDefining neighbor nodes and the pathfinding\r\n```python\r\n   def createNode(row):\r\n        rl = list()\r\n        for x in row:\r\n            rl.append(Node(x))\r\n        return rl\r\n\r\n    rows, columns, stamina = map(int, input().split(&#39; &#39;))\r\n    treasure_map = list()\r\n    for row in range(rows):\r\n        treasure_map.append(list(input()))\r\n    treasure_map = list(map(createNode, treasure_map))\r\n    for x in range(len(treasure_map)):\r\n        for y in range(len(treasure_map[x])):\r\n            tile = treasure_map[x][y]\r\n            # add tile to south link\r\n            if x - 1 &gt;= 0 and treasure_map[x - 1][y] is not None:\r\n                tile.add_neighbour(treasure_map[x - 1][y])\r\n            if y + 1 &lt; len(treasure_map[x]) and treasure_map[x][y + 1] is not None:\r\n                tile.add_neighbour(treasure_map[x][y + 1])\r\n            if x+1 &lt; len(treasure_map) and treasure_map[x + 1][y] is not None:\r\n                tile.add_neighbour(treasure_map[x + 1][y])\r\n            if y - 1 &gt;= 0 and treasure_map[x][y - 1] is not None:\r\n                tile.add_neighbour(treasure_map[x][y - 1])\r\n\r\n    visited = list()\r\n    nodes = list()\r\n    for x in treasure_map:\r\n        for y in x:\r\n            if y.name is not &#39;#&#39;:\r\n                nodes.append(y)\r\n    heapq.heapify(nodes)\r\n    endpoint = None\r\n\r\n    if len(nodes) &lt; 2:\r\n        print(-1)\r\n\r\n    # Search route with minimum load\r\n    while nodes:\r\n        curr = heapq.heappop(nodes)\r\n        if curr.name is &#39;G&#39;:\r\n            endpoint = curr\r\n            break\r\n        for node in curr.get_neighbours():\r\n            if node not in visited and not node.load &gt; stamina:\r\n                if curr.weight + curr.load &lt; node.weight:\r\n                    node.add_previous(curr)\r\n        visited.append(curr)\r\n        heapq.heapify(nodes)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code of calculating the days it will take to get from the start to end: (once again I know it can be better)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n   if endpoint is not None:\r\n        nexNode = endpoint.previous\r\n        found = False\r\n        stamina_to_use = list()\r\n        while nexNode:\r\n            if nexNode.name == &quot;S&quot;:\r\n                # Maybe count the day here\r\n                found = True\r\n            stamina_to_use.append(nexNode.load)\r\n            nexNode = nexNode.previous\r\n        days = 1\r\n        curr = stamina\r\n        counter = 0\r\n        stamina_to_use.reverse()\r\n        # Count the number of days needed for finishing\r\n        while stamina_to_use:\r\n            tocheck = stamina_to_use.pop()\r\n            # print(&quot;Current days: {}, current stamina: {},stamina to withdraw {}&quot;.format(\r\n            #    days, curr, tocheck))\r\n            if curr &gt; stamina:\r\n                print(-1)\r\n                break\r\n            if (curr - tocheck) &lt; 0:\r\n                days += 1\r\n                curr = stamina\r\n            curr -= tocheck\r\n        if found:\r\n            print(days)\r\n        else:\r\n            print(-1)\r\n\r\n    else:\r\n        print(-1)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results are actually as I expected, I get the shortest path and get the right number of days according to my own test cases and also to the ones on kattis. But for some reason when I submit the project to kattis the first 8 or so test cases pass and then I suddenly get: &quot;Wrong answer&quot;, I don&#39;t know where the mistake in my thinking or code is. Is my approach the right one or should I use a different one. Or is there just a simple mistake made in counting the days?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009822/calculate-shortest-path-in-graph-with-weighted-vertices","title":"Calculate shortest path in graph with weighted Vertices"},{"tags":["vuejs2","axios"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1369,"user_id":3096159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BVGK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mehari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3096159/mehari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568899280,"post_id":58009820,"comment_id":102428200,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009820/axios-get-request-not-accepting-as-param-value#comment102428200_58009820"},{"owner":{"reputation":1369,"user_id":3096159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BVGK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mehari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3096159/mehari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568899312,"post_id":58009820,"comment_id":102428222,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009820/axios-get-request-not-accepting-as-param-value#comment102428222_58009820"},{"owner":{"reputation":1369,"user_id":3096159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BVGK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mehari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3096159/mehari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568899334,"post_id":58009820,"comment_id":102428239,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009820/axios-get-request-not-accepting-as-param-value#comment102428239_58009820"},{"owner":{"reputation":133,"user_id":6127373,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d184405ff89f64d366d951f9b005b0d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kona Laxman Deepak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6127373/kona-laxman-deepak"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1369,"user_id":3096159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BVGK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mehari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3096159/mehari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568902713,"post_id":58009820,"comment_id":102430355,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009820/axios-get-request-not-accepting-as-param-value#comment102430355_58009820"},{"owner":{"reputation":1369,"user_id":3096159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BVGK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mehari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3096159/mehari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568910542,"post_id":58009820,"comment_id":102434545,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009820/axios-get-request-not-accepting-as-param-value#comment102434545_58009820"}],"owner":{"reputation":133,"user_id":6127373,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d184405ff89f64d366d951f9b005b0d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kona Laxman Deepak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6127373/kona-laxman-deepak"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568891943,"creation_date":1568891943,"question_id":58009820,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009820","body_markdown":"We are migrating existing jQuery Ajax calls to Vue Axios.

you need to show user roles besides its details, is that true?\r\n\r\nI think you are using `matTable` or at least `*ngFor`; so you need to add a function to get appropriate roles; like:\r\n\r\n    getRoles(user: Object) {\r\n        return user.roles.reduce((str, role) =&gt; {\r\n            // add role name if this is the first role; else add role to string then return it    \r\n            return str? str += &#39;, &#39; + role.name: role.name;\r\n        }, &#39;&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not necessary to use reduce function; you can use temporary variable with an ordinary loop; but this is cleaner way.\r\n\r\nThen from HTML you can call it in roles `td`; like:\r\n\r\n    &lt;tr *ngFor=&quot;let user of allUsers&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- previous details--&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;

It made no difference.\r\n\r\n    with Manager() as manager:\r\n        first_level_test_features=manager.list()\r\n        procs =[]\r\n        for id in range(4):\r\n            p = Process(target=predict, args=(id, (message, models, configs, vocabs, emoji_dict,first_level_test_features)))\r\n            procs.append(p)\r\n            p.start()\r\n\r\n        for p in procs:\r\n            p.join()\r\n\r\nI did not get any error message since it is just stuck there. I would expect the program can start multiple processes and each process uses the model pass to it to make the prediction.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009788/problem-when-predicting-via-multiprocess-with-tensorflow","title":"Problem when predicting via multiprocess with Tensorflow"},{"tags":["java","pagination","mybatis","spring-mybatis"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9713,"user_id":2231972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/448e80e6a88a682d7c2a3e13c6804903?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Roman Konoval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2231972/roman-konoval"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568899567,"post_id":58009786,"comment_id":102428399,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009786/pagination-in-mybatis-using-pagehelper-gives-no-improvement-in-time#comment102428399_58009786"},{"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":6370552,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b154e1854f3d7f9052226f291b5963c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Prachi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6370552/prachi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9713,"user_id":2231972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/448e80e6a88a682d7c2a3e13c6804903?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Roman Konoval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2231972/roman-konoval"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568908509,"post_id":58009786,"comment_id":102433617,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009786/pagination-in-mybatis-using-pagehelper-gives-no-improvement-in-time#comment102433617_58009786"},{"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":6370552,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b154e1854f3d7f9052226f291b5963c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Prachi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6370552/prachi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9713,"user_id":2231972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/448e80e6a88a682d7c2a3e13c6804903?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Roman Konoval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2231972/roman-konoval"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568910239,"post_id":58009786,"comment_id":102434395,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009786/pagination-in-mybatis-using-pagehelper-gives-no-improvement-in-time#comment102434395_58009786"}],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":6370552,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b154e1854f3d7f9052226f291b5963c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Prachi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6370552/prachi"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568891799,"creation_date":1568891799,"question_id":58009786,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009786","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use PageHelper plugin provided on [this repo][1] following the installation instructions provided [here][2], but my problem is that I am unable to achieve better timings as compared to what I was getting without the plugin. I downloaded jars for pagehelper and jsqparser, added them to the build path of my project as well as added pagehelper in dependencies list in build.gradle of my project as:\r\n\r\n     dependencies {\r\n\t     compile fileTree(dir: &#39;lib&#39;, include: [&#39;*.jar&#39;])\r\n         compile &#39;com.github.pagehelper:pagehelper:3.2.1&#39;\r\n         compile files(&quot;lib/jsqlparser-3.0.jar&quot;)\r\n    }\r\nand added them to my build path as well. Then for the second step, I edited config `org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean` as following:\r\n\r\n  \t&lt;bean id=&quot;sqlSessionFactory&quot; class=&quot;org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean&quot;&gt;\r\n  \t\t&lt;property name=&quot;dataSource&quot; ref=&quot;wrapperDataSource&quot; /&gt;\r\n  \t\t&lt;property name=&quot;configLocation&quot; value=&quot;/WEB-INF/MapConfig.xml&quot;/&gt;\r\n  \t\t&lt;property name=&quot;plugins&quot;&gt;\r\n\t    &lt;array&gt;\r\n\t      &lt;bean class=&quot;com.github.pagehelper.PageInterceptor&quot;&gt;\r\n\t        &lt;property name=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;\r\n\t          &lt;!-- config params as the following --&gt;\r\n\t          &lt;value&gt;\r\n\t            helperDialect=mysql\r\n                reasonable=true\r\n                supportMethodsArguments=true\r\n                params=count=countSql\r\n                autoRuntimeDialect=true\r\n\t          &lt;/value&gt;\r\n\t        &lt;/property&gt;\r\n\t      &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\t    &lt;/array&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;/property&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/bean&gt;\r\nwhere the first two properties were already present in this xml file. Now after making these changes, I build my project and run it using jetty by calling selectList in the following manner:\r\n\r\n    RowBounds rowBounds = new RowBounds(0, 100);\r\n\tList&lt;E&gt; pendingRequests = getSqlSession().&lt;E&gt;selectList(&quot;fetchAllPendingRequests&quot;,inputData,rowBounds); \r\nwhere E is the datatype of my results.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the time I get for this function to fetch all the results using the PageHelper plugin is almost the same as that I get without using the plugin. Although when I go into the debugging mode, I see that in both the cases, the query from database is happening in different ways through different methods. While without using the plugin, the final query call is made using `executor` object in SimpleExecutor class, using the plugin the call is made from PageInterceptor class of the PageHelper repo. So the only conclusion I draw is it is unable to perform physical pagination despite making use of the plugin, but I could not understand the reasons for it.\r\nAny help would be very much appreciated :)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/pagehelper/Mybatis-PageHelper\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/pagehelper/Mybatis-PageHelper/blob/master/wikis/en/HowToUse.md","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009786/pagination-in-mybatis-using-pagehelper-gives-no-improvement-in-time","title":"Pagination in MyBatis using PageHelper gives no improvement in time"},{"tags":["angular","mat-table"],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":4949327,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c400bdb90aaf43c0e9db57be24f8fa2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4949327/mack"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568891787,"creation_date":1568891787,"question_id":58009785,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009785","body_markdown":"The link to code:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-8xmujh\r\n\r\nThe expansion works on the first level but, when clicking on the expanded row, it doesn&#39;t show the rows related to expanded row, but goes back to the original state.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009785/new-to-angular-need-to-have-a-table-with-expanding-rows-i-am-using-mat-table-a","title":"New to Angular, Need to have a table with expanding rows.

routines in `numpy` seem to currently assume that the last dimension will always be the smallest.  When this is actually true `fftn` is faster, sometimes by a lot.\r\n\r\nThat said, I get a much smaller difference in performance between these two methods than you (with Python 3.7.4, numpy 1.17.2).  For your example, `iterate_fft` takes 46ms while `ffn` takes 50.  But if I flip the axes around, to `(256, 256, 32)`, I get 55ms and 40ms respectively.  Pushing even further with a shape of `(256, 256, 2)` I get 21ms and 4ms respectively.\r\n\r\nNote that if performance is really an issue, there are other FFT libraries available that [perform better](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6365623/1358308) in some situations.  Also the full fftpack in scipy can have very different performance than the more limited code in numpy.\r\n\r\nNote that [your usage of `fftn`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/d9b1e32cb8ef90d6b4a47853241db2a28146a57d/numpy/fft/pocketfft.py#L624-L631) basically does:\r\n```\r\nx = np.random.rand(32, 256, 256)\r\n\r\na = np.fft.fft(x, n=256, axis=2)\r\na = np.fft.fft(a, n=256, axis=1)\r\n\r\nnp.testing.assert_allclose(np.fft.fftn(x, axes=(1, 2)), a)\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009758/numpy-fftn-very-inefficient-for-2d-fft-of-several-images/58010962#58010962","title":"numpy fftn very inefficient for 2d fft of several images"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":630,"user_id":4332585,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lUSzh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zaccharie Ramzi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4332585/zaccharie-ramzi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569940062,"creation_date":1569940062,"answer_id":58186981,"question_id":58009758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58186981","body_markdown":"So a person involved in the `numpy` fft development [has answered][1] the deep question on GitHub and it turns out that the slowdown is most likely coming from some multi dimensional array rearrangement used by `pocketfft`.\r\n\r\nIt will all be a memory when `numpy` switches to the `scipy` 1.4 implementation which can be shown using my benchmark to not have these drawbacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14617#issuecomment-536996271","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009758/numpy-fftn-very-inefficient-for-2d-fft-of-several-images/58186981#58186981","title":"numpy fftn very inefficient for 2d fft of several images"}],"owner":{"reputation":630,"user_id":4332585,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lUSzh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zaccharie Ramzi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4332585/zaccharie-ramzi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58186981,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569940062,"creation_date":1568891689,"question_id":58009758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009758","body_markdown":"I wanted to compute the fourier transform of several images.\r\nI was therefore benchmarking `numpy`&#39;s `fft.fftn` against a brute force for loop.\r\n\r\nThis is the code I used to benchmark the 2 approaches (in a jupyter notebook):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = np.random.rand(32, 256, 256)\r\n\r\ndef iterate_fft(arr):\r\n    k = np.empty_like(arr, dtype=np.complex64)\r\n    for i, a in enumerate(arr):\r\n        k[i] = np.fft.fft2(a)\r\n    return k\r\n\r\nk_it = iterate_fft(x)\r\nk_np = np.fft.fftn(x, axes=(1, 2))\r\nnp.testing.assert_allclose(k_it.real, k_np.real)\r\nnp.testing.assert_allclose(k_it.imag, k_np.imag)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n%%timeit\r\nk_it = iterate_fft(x)\r\n```\r\nOutput: `63.6 ms &#177;

This copy has to run locally on a Windows 7 system, which has no network connection. Windows 7 has a path length limitation (255), which is reached in my case. How do I circumvent this?\r\n\r\nI create a static website copy on a Debian system with: ```wget --mirror --adjust-extension --convert-links --restrict-file-names=windows --page-requisites -e robots=off --no-clobber --no-parent --base=./ https://www.landesmuseum-mecklenburg.de/```.\r\n\r\nThis way I got nearly everything I need. Some special URLs / images are downloaded via a seperated URL-list via: ```wget -c -x -i imagelist.txt```\r\n\r\nAfter I create an archive out of this files and transfer them to my Windows 7 Test system and extract them to a local Webserver (called &quot;MiniWebserver&quot;) I can visit http://localhost/ and everything seems to work.\r\n\r\nBut some deep links, especially images have a path length in the windows NTFS filesystem of over 255 characters. All these images are not displayed in the local webpage.\r\n\r\nI tried the ```-nH --cut-dirs=5``` option of wget, but with no acceptable result (the index.html gets overwritten each time).\r\n\r\nAnother idea was to use the DOS path shorten compatbility feature, so that long directory names would be translated to 8 character names. E.g. ```longdirname``` translated to ```longdi~1```. But I have no idea how to automate this.\r\n\r\n**Update: Yet another idea**\r\n\r\nOne more thing, which came to my mind was to use hashes over the entire path (e.g. md5) and use this instead of the full path + filename. Additionally all URLs in the downloaded .html files must be substituted processed too. But again: I have no idea how to accomplish this using Debian command line tools.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009747/how-to-shorten-urls-of-static-website-copy-to-have-less-than-256-characters-cr","title":"How to shorten URLs of static website copy to have less than 256 characters?

Conda can serialize an environment&#39;s package information to a YAML (great for reproducibility), but it can&#39;t guarantee that it will be cross-platform. In fact, many packages, especially ones with non-Python code, require different underlying build tools as dependencies, so what you&#39;re asking for will never be satisfied.\r\n\r\n## Explicit Specs Only\r\nThe closest you can get these days is to limit your `environment.yaml` to only include explicit specs that have gone into creating your environment by using the `--from-history` flag.

the end, it depends on the actual compiler and the exact compilation settings.\r\n\r\nAs you noted, the JVM itself does not need any local variable names. (Strictly speaking, it doesn&#39;t really need method names either. It is even possible to have [two methods with the same name and arguments that only differ in the return type](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34617133/3182664), but I&#39;d have to look up some more details about this in the spec to say something more profoundly). But the class file can contain additional debug information that goes beyond the information that is required by the JVM.\r\n\r\nThe standard Java compiler is [javac](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html). And the documentation already contains some hints about the possible debug information:\r\n\r\n&gt; **-g**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;Generates all debugging information, including local variables. By default, only \r\nline number and source file information is generated.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; **-g:none**\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;    Does not generate any debugging information.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; **-g:[keyword list]**\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;    Generates only some kinds of debugging information, specified by a comma separated list of keywords. Valid keywords are:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;   - **source** : Source file debugging information.\r\n&gt;   - **lines**: Line number debugging information.\r\n&gt;   - **vars**: Local variable debugging information.\r\n\r\nOne can try this out with an example:\r\n\r\n\tpublic class ExampleClass {\r\n\t\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tExampleClass exampleClass = new ExampleClass();\r\n\t\t\texampleClass.exampleMethod();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void exampleMethod() {\r\n\t\t\tString string = &quot;This is an example&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tfor (int counter = 0; counter &lt; 10; counter++) {\r\n\t\t\t\tString localResult = string + counter;\r\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(localResult);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nCompiling this with \r\n\r\n    javac ExampleClass.java -g:none\r\n\r\nwill generate a class file. Printing information about this class file with\r\n\r\n    javap -c -v -l ExampleClass.class\r\n\r\n(where `-c` means to disassemble the output, `-v` means that the output should be verbose, and `-l` means that the line number information should be printed), the output is as follows:\r\n\r\n    public class ExampleClass\r\n      minor version: 0\r\n      major version: 52\r\n      flags:

&quot;ExampleClass.java&quot;\r\n\r\nThe main differences are\r\n\r\n- the class contains the source file name\r\n- the constant pool has *many* more entries\r\n- the methods contain a `LineNumberTable` and a `LocalVariableTable`. \r\n\r\nFor example, consider the `exampleMethod()`:\r\n\r\n    LineNumberTable:\r\n      line 9: 0\r\n      line 10: 3\r\n      line 11: 11\r\n      line 12: 30\r\n      line 10: 37\r\n      line 14: 43\r\n    LocalVariableTable:\r\n      Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature\r\n         30       7     3 localResult   Ljava/lang/String;\r\n          5      38     2 counter   I\r\n          0      44     0  this   LExampleClass;\r\n          3      41     1 string   Ljava/lang/String;\r\n\r\nThe details about the structure of these attributes are given in the documentation of the [`LineNumberTable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.12) and the [`LocalVariableTable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.13). \r\n\r\nFor the `LineNumberTable`, it says\r\n\r\n&gt; It may be used by debuggers to determine which part of the code array corresponds to a given line number in the original source file. \r\n\r\nFor the `LocalVariableTable`, it says\r\n\r\n&gt; It may be used by debuggers to determine the value of a given local variable during the execution of a method. \r\n\r\nIn the output of `javap`, the **names** of the local variables are already resolved. However, the actual information that is contained in the table itself is only an *index* into the constant pool (that&#39;s why it has more entries when debugging information is retained). For example, the entry for the `localResult` variable is shown as\r\n\r\n         30       7     3 localResult   Ljava/lang/String;\r\n\r\nalthough it actually only contains a reference to the entry\r\n\r\n      #27 = Utf8               localResult\r\n\r\nof the constant pool.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; So, are these information simply figured out by the de-compiler through some magic or dose the compiled class retain a lot of information and what for?\r\n\r\nAs shown above, the compiled class *can* retain a lot of information. After all, one of the main purposes of an IDE is to provide a nice, visual interface to a *debugger*. And therefore, most compilers that are in one way or the other triggered by an IDE will by default try to retain as much debug information as possible.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009717/how-much-information-of-the-source-code-does-the-compiled-class-file-keep-in-jav/58010618#58010618","title":"How much information of the source code does the compiled class file keep in Java?"}],"owner":{"reputation":330,"user_id":8200378,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/693c6ef933393eccaa32369e9739bea4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yulin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8200378/yulin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":30842,"user_id":453005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjx6y.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DwB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/453005/dwb"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58010618,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568897945,"creation_date":1568891580,"last_edit_date":1568897945,"question_id":58009717,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009717","body_markdown":"When a class file from another project of my own was decompiled by IntelliJ\r\n(by Fernflower de-compiler),\r\nI was marveled at the closeness of the decompiled code compared to\r\nthe source code,\r\neven the method local variable names are the same as the original source code.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know anything about how the Java compilation process works and\r\nhow the JVM works,\r\nmy naive understanding is that the names of the public stuff\r\nmay need to be kept after compilation,\r\nbut names of local variables,\r\nthey are simply mnemonics to facilitate human reading,\r\ntotally useless outside of their scope,\r\nand I don’t think the JVM needs this information.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\nis this information simply figured out by the de-compiler through some magic\r\nor does the compiled class retain a lot of information and what for?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009717/how-much-information-of-the-source-code-does-the-compiled-class-file-keep-in-jav","title":"How much information of the source code does the compiled class file keep in Java?"},{"tags":["d3.js","bar-chart","data-visualization"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5173476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3f9bddb735e8c006500d1044d403a16?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dushan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5173476/dushan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569690960,"creation_date":1569690960,"answer_id":58148628,"question_id":58009716,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58148628","body_markdown":"To answer my own question, I have found [observablehq][1] is the best place to get started and it uses D3 and also there are a lot of examples and it is highly customizable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://observablehq.com/ ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009716/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-create-a-bar-chart-race/58148628#58148628","title":"What is the easiest way to create a bar chart race"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5173476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3f9bddb735e8c006500d1044d403a16?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dushan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5173476/dushan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1569690960,"creation_date":1568891580,"question_id":58009716,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009716","body_markdown":"I know this can be achieved in different programming languages such as R, Python and D3js.

What am I missing here?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009709/aws-how-to-drop-tons-of-videos-in-the-input-bucket-and-have-the-output-bucket-p","title":"aws how to drop tons of videos in the input bucket, and have the output bucket populated with transcoded versions"},{"tags":["android","arraylist"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":304,"user_id":10123247,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w5_42oucsI0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB8/CLr0LYF96I4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rezaul Karim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10123247/rezaul-karim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568892674,"post_id":58009708,"comment_id":102424231,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009708/loop-through-arraylist-and-add-contact-to-arraylist#comment102424231_58009708"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":11766958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07f62769f2356de5aec0452653368dec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11766958","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11766958/user11766958"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568893474,"post_id":58009771,"comment_id":102424684,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009708/loop-through-arraylist-and-add-contact-to-arraylist/58009771#comment102424684_58009771"},{"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":2585865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b66dabd807f8cdd2528e5fe0ad5a5b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Romadro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2585865/romadro"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":99,"user_id":11766958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07f62769f2356de5aec0452653368dec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11766958","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11766958/user11766958"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568893682,"post_id":58009771,"comment_id":102424790,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009708/loop-through-arraylist-and-add-contact-to-arraylist/58009771#comment102424790_58009771"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":2585865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b66dabd807f8cdd2528e5fe0ad5a5b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Romadro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2585865/romadro"},"last_editor":{"reputation":506,"user_id":2585865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b66dabd807f8cdd2528e5fe0ad5a5b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Romadro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2585865/romadro"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568893672,"last_edit_date":1568893672,"creation_date":1568891740,"answer_id":58009771,"question_id":58009708,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58009771","body_markdown":"        EditText nameField = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.name);\r\n        Contact name = (Contact) nameField.getText();\r\n    \r\nfunction getText returns Editable and you are trying to cast it to Contact.

#9.\r\n\r\nYou can verify this code on a [dotnetfiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/HPYWcJ)\r\n\r\n#this part of the answer was for the following [edit](https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/58009694/3)\r\n\r\nThe code you supplied does mostly what you expect it to do, it will go through your indexes and it will replace the numbers `0` to `9` which are prepended with `#`, however nothing above `#9` will work, which is due to the replace method (see a more detailed work around below).\r\n\r\nWhat you are currently not getting, is that your expected result is incorrect based on the data given. Indexes are 0 based in arrays, and you want to get index 1, so the second item. But you are only supplying 1 value.\r\n\r\nTo make your test work, you have 2 options:\r\n\r\n - Change the path to: `string objectPath = &quot;ProdEffDates[#0]&quot;;`\r\n - Change your indexes to: `object[] indexes = new Object[] { 0, 8 };`\r\n\r\nIn both suggestions a correction is made that would handle the problem you have, at least, until you run up to having to replace and index at #10. That is because it will first replace `#1` before hitting `#10`, which would then be replaced with whatever value was at `#1`.\r\n\r\nTo handle those problems, you have again a few options :)\r\n\r\n - Replace based on a more predictable format, like \r\n \r\n        str = str.Replace( $&quot;[#{i}]&quot;, $&quot;{indexes[i]}&quot; )\r\n\r\n - Iterate from `indexes.length - 1` to `0`, thus ensuring you replace the bigger numbers before the smaller numbers ;)\r\n - Use regex replacements","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009694/indexing-is-not-working-in-object-array-in-c/58010496#58010496","title":"Indexing is not working in Object array in c#"}],"owner":{"reputation":368,"user_id":4197604,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/audLX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Meena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4197604/meena"},"last_editor":{"reputation":368,"user_id":4197604,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/audLX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Meena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4197604/meena"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":105,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58010496,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568894685,"creation_date":1568891507,"last_edit_date":1568893111,"question_id":58009694,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009694","body_markdown":"I have an `Object[]`, My goal is to achieve Indexing.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    string objectPath = &quot;RiskItems[#0].Coverages[#1].QuestionAnswer[#2]&quot;;\r\n    object[] indexes = new Object[] { 8 };\r\n    var expResult = &quot;RiskItems[8].Coverages[1].QuestionAnswer[2]&quot;;\r\n    var result = Tokenizer.Path(objectPath, indexes);\r\n\r\nThe Path Method is:\r\n\r\n    public static string Path(string objectPath, object[] indexes)\r\n        {\r\n            string str = objectPath;\r\n            if (indexes != null)\r\n            {\r\n                for (int i = 0; i &lt; indexes.Length; i++)\r\n                {\r\n                    string val = indexes[i] is int ?

The output after this merge should be something like this:\r\n\r\n    HFFP20190         *\r\n    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\n    YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                      YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\r\n    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQWERSTUVWXYZ                            ASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASD\r\n    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\n    YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                      YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\r\n    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQWERSTUVWXYZ                            ASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASD\r\n    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\n    YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                      YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\r\n    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQWERSTUVWXYZ                            ASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASDFASD\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    TFFP2019000163109 *","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009692/converting-output-from-string-to-integer","title":"converting output from string to integer"},{"tags":["c#","azure",".net-core","azure-webjobs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5230,"user_id":10383250,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/86977ed7f8c387560ffd1c75bc41bedc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"George Chen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10383250/george-chen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568900976,"post_id":58009689,"comment_id":102429230,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009689/microsoft-azure-webjobs-doesnt-work-on-macos#comment102429230_58009689"}],"owner":{"reputation":1320,"user_id":3406718,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001783543529/picture?type=large","display_name":"Taras Kovalenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3406718/taras-kovalenko"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568891490,"creation_date":1568891490,"question_id":58009689,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009689","body_markdown":"I have an app which uses `.net core 2.1` + `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`.

android:layout_marginBottom=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n      app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n      app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n      tools:text=&quot;ENDED&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nNote: This will constraint the TextView to parent on both edges.\r\nAlso, assign a top_to_bottom_of one of the view above the TextView in the hierarchy.

Each site has a varying number of assets within it, each with a unique identifier.\r\n\r\nI am trying to write a macro that will copy and paste the data for specific sites into their own individual worksheet within the file. The basic concept of this I am familiar with but I am struggling with the ranges I need to specify.\r\n\r\nSo basically, I need the macro to work its way down Column A of the sheet called Raw Data and identify any rows where the Site name (Value in column A) matches one of the Sheet names. It should then copy the Rows from A to H with that site name and paste into the respective site sheet in rows A to H. \r\n\r\nThe values in Column A will always match one of the other sheets in the workbook. \r\n\r\nExample image that might help explain a bit better:  \r\n[![Example image that might help explain a bit better][1]][1]\r\n\r\nApologies in advance if my explanation is not very clear.

It&#39;s a work in progress, and I know little HTML, but I&#39;m getting there.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m having an issue with my webpage with regards to how it scales with changes of the browser window size. On my (quite wide) screen at university, it looks fine. However, reducing the browser window size manually - or simply viewing it in a full size browser window on a smaller screen - appears to mess everything up - it doesn&#39;t look very nice. Text goes close to my pictures, and it all looks a bit tatty.\r\n\r\nI think this is probably because my design is quite poor. \r\n\r\n&gt; **1. Is it because my design is bad or is there something else I&#39;m doing blatantly wrong?**\r\n\r\nMy current idea for a solution is to resize things so that they would look more reasonable on a smaller screen (i.e. on a normal sized laptop). I&#39;m worried that this might end up making things look a bit odd on a bigger screen, though. \r\n\r\n&gt;  **2. Is it possible/within reason for a beginner to have two different designs, one for smaller screens and one for big screens, which could be detected and then utilised depending on what screen size viewer is using? Should my page be designed to simply work with whatever screen size?**\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n&gt; **3. If I do reorganize the page such that it works better with smaller\r\n&gt; screens, is there a way to &quot;lock&quot; this design in place, so that it\r\n&gt; doesn&#39;t get messed up if someone views my page in a wider window?\r\n&gt; Perhaps a way to ensure that only the boundaries of the page increase\r\n&gt; in width?**\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m essentially asking is how I should go about designing my page in order to resolve the evident issue - where the issue is that it looks rubbish when the browser window is any smaller than the max size of my screen at university. \r\n  [1]: http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~ms18g18/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009670/page-sizing-issues-html","title":"Page sizing issues HTML"},{"tags":["c#",".net","unicode","graphics","fonts"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":19906,"user_id":847269,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/564ffe2e3f1ffe82696cd1ac01ac035e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick87","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/847269/patrick87"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568891753,"post_id":58009665,"comment_id":102423686,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009665/how-to-fix-unicode-characters-not-rendering-in-net-graphics-drawstring#comment102423686_58009665"},{"owner":{"reputation":76930,"user_id":106159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qfp6z.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/106159/matthew-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568891950,"post_id":58009665,"comment_id":102423798,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009665/how-to-fix-unicode-characters-not-rendering-in-net-graphics-drawstring#comment102423798_58009665"},{"owner":{"reputation":19906,"user_id":847269,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/564ffe2e3f1ffe82696cd1ac01ac035e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick87","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/847269/patrick87"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":76930,"user_id":106159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qfp6z.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/106159/matthew-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568901855,"post_id":58009665,"comment_id":102429814,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009665/how-to-fix-unicode-characters-not-rendering-in-net-graphics-drawstring#comment102429814_58009665"},{"owner":{"reputation":19906,"user_id":847269,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/564ffe2e3f1ffe82696cd1ac01ac035e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick87","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/847269/patrick87"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":76930,"user_id":106159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qfp6z.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/106159/matthew-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568930437,"post_id":58009665,"comment_id":102442205,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58009665/how-to-fix-unicode-characters-not-rendering-in-net-graphics-drawstring#comment102442205_58009665"}],"owner":{"reputation":19906,"user_id":847269,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/564ffe2e3f1ffe82696cd1ac01ac035e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick87","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/847269/patrick87"},"last_editor":{"reputation":118516,"user_id":59303,"user_type":"moderator","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIt1g.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ChrisF","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/59303/chrisf"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568906333,"creation_date":1568891372,"last_edit_date":1568906333,"question_id":58009665,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58009665","body_markdown":"I am using Graphics.DrawString to render a string with some Unicode symbols in it (if it matters, the symbols are the MICR transit and on-us symbols, U+2446 and U+2448).
