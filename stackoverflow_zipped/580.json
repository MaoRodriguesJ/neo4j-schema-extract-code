can toggle depth testing on/off in OpenGL using `glEnable( GL_DEPTH_TEST );`\r\nBut this switches the test on/off for the entire draw call.\r\n\r\nI would like to control the test on a per-fragment basis.\r\n\r\nThis is to achieve the following effect: in a chess-board pattern, half the pixels of the primitive are potentially occluded, but the other half are always drawn, even if there is an occluding object in the frame-buffer that is nearer to the camera.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, see this example where only half the pixels of the pyramid are potentially occluded by the box in front of it.\r\n\r\nNote that the red box is drawn first, and is already in the frame-buffer when the green pyramid is drawn.\r\n\r\nAlso note: I will draw the object with the special depth test last, so the case where the red box is drawn first would not happen.\r\n\r\nFor my purposes, all objects drawn this way are convex and will never occlude itself.\r\n\r\n[![illustration of the effect][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI know how to get a chessboard pattern in my fragment shader:\r\n```\r\n                float xm2 = mod( gl_FragCoord.x, 2.0 );\r\n                float ym2 = mod( gl_FragCoord.y, 2.0 );\r\n                if ( int(xm2) != int(ym2) )\r\n                        discard;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in my case, I don&#39;t want to flat out discard on a per-fragment basis, I just want the depth test toggled on a per-fragment basis.\r\n\r\nI am targeting OpenGL-ES 3.0. \r\n\r\n  [1]:

A module (like a database layer) should not report its errors. This function has to be delegated to an application-wide handler. All we need is to raise an error (in the form of exception) - which we already did. That&#39;s all. Nor should you &quot;always wrap your PDO operations in a try/catch&quot; like the most popular tutorial from tutsplus recommends. Quite contrary, catching an exception should be rather an exceptional case (pun intended).\r\n\r\n&gt;In fact, there is nothing special in PDO exceptions - they are errors all the same. Thus, you have to treat them exactly the same way as other errors. If you had an error handler before, you shouldn&#39;t create a dedicated one for PDO. If you didn&#39;t care - it&#39;s all right too, as PHP is good with basic error handling and will conduct PDO exceptions all right.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402823/is-catching-all-php-exceptions-best-practice/58403487#58403487","title":"Is catching all PHP exceptions best practice?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":123395,"user_id":362536,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da5816365344305a614343a4065a2786?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Brad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/362536/brad"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571196820,"post_id":58404189,"comment_id":103155278,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402823/is-catching-all-php-exceptions-best-practice/58404189#comment103155278_58404189"},{"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":5033601,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VwLpT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tyler Miles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5033601/tyler-miles"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":123395,"user_id":362536,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da5816365344305a614343a4065a2786?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Brad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/362536/brad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571234686,"post_id":58404189,"comment_id":103173249,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402823/is-catching-all-php-exceptions-best-practice/58404189#comment103173249_58404189"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":5033601,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VwLpT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tyler Miles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5033601/tyler-miles"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571185719,"creation_date":1571185719,"answer_id":58404189,"question_id":58402823,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404189","body_markdown":"To highlight Ebski&#39;s comment above, you should attempt some form of global handling.

    bufferPos dw 0x7E0 \r\n\r\nWriting to the buffer overwrites the kernel!\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe bootloader that you use stores the kernel at linear address 0x00008000. For loading it sets `ES:BX == 0x0000:0x8000`. And you&#39;ve correctly placed an `ORG 0x8000` on top of the source for your kernel.\r\n\r\n**But** you&#39;ve defined your double buffer at linear address 0x00007E00 (`ES` * 16). You&#39;ve set `ES == 0x07E0`.\r\n\r\nA decent buffer for the 320x200x8 video mode should have 64000 bytes. Therefore setup your double buffer at e.g. linear address 0x00010000 which would require you to write:\r\n\r\n    bufferPos dw 0x1000\r\n\r\nThis leaves room for a 32KB kernel. Currently you&#39;re using only 8KB for the kernel.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe code that you use to check if the picture stays within the screen/buffer looks very bogus. I suggest you remove it for now.  \r\nThe inner loop that processes 1 horizontal line forgets to increment the `DI` register!\r\n\r\n    .forY:\r\n        PUSH DI              &lt;******************\r\n        xor bx, bx\r\n        .forX:\r\n            mov al, byte [si + bx]\r\n            test al, al           ; if al is 0x0 it is a &#39;transparant&#39; pixel\r\n            jz .skip\r\n            mov byte [es:di], al  ; move the pixel to the buffer\r\n          .skip:\r\n            INC DI           &lt;******************\r\n            inc bx                ; move to next pixel in image\r\n            cmp bx, cx            ; check if all pixels in row are done\r\n            jl .forX                 ; if not all images are done repeat forX\r\n        .skipX:\r\n        POP DI               &lt;******************\r\n        add di, 320             ; if forX is done move to next y position\r\n        add si, cx              ; moves to the next y row in image\r\n        dec dx                  ; decrements yloop counter\r\n        jnz .forY\r\n\r\nTry this simplified code, and once it works re-think how to check the limits.

idea behind kernel fusion is to take two (or more) discrete operations, that could be realized (and might already be realized) in separate kernels, and combine them so the operations all happen in a single kernel.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this may or may not seem obvious, so I refer you to [this writeup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53305830/cuda-how-does-kernel-fusion-improve-performance-on-memory-bound-applications-on/53311373#53311373).\r\n\r\nPersistent threads/Persistent kernel is a kernel design strategy that allows the kernel to continue execution indefinitely.  Typical &quot;ordinary&quot; kernel design focuses on solving a particular task, and when that task is done, the kernel exits (at the closing curly-brace of your kernel code).\r\n\r\nA persistent kernel however has a governing loop in it that only ends when signaled - otherwise it runs indefinitely.  People often connect this with the producer-consumer model of application design.  Something (host code) produces data, and your persistent kernel consumes that data and produces results.  This producer-consumer model can run indefinitely.  When there is no data to consume, the consumer (your persistent kernel) simply waits in a loop, for new data to be presented.\r\n\r\nPersistent kernel design has a number of important considerations, which I won&#39;t try to list here but instead refer you to [this longer writeup/example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33150040/doubling-buffering-in-cuda-so-the-cpu-can-operate-on-data-produced-by-a-persiste/33158954#33158954).\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n1. Kernel fusion may combine work into a single kernel so as to increase performance by reduction of unnecessary loads and stores - because the data being operated on can be preserved in-place in device registers or shared memory.\r\n\r\n2. Persistent kernels may have a variety of benefits.  They may possibly reduce the latency associated with processing data, because the CUDA kernel launch overhead is no longer necessary.  However another possible performance factor may be the ability to retain state (similar to kernel fusion) in device registers or shared memory. \r\n\r\nKernel fusion doesn&#39;t necessarily imply a persistent kernel.  You may simply be combining a set of tasks into a single kernel.  A persistent kernel doesn&#39;t necessarily imply fusion of separate computation tasks - there may be only 1 &quot;task&quot; that you are performing  in a governing &quot;consumer&quot; loop.\r\n\r\nBut there is obviously considerable conceptual overlap between the two ideas.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402802/whats-the-differences-between-the-kernel-fusion-and-persistent-thread/58403149#58403149","title":"What&#39;s the differences between the kernel fusion and persistent thread?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11611522,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cJUUSlIqbFo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf23Isl1H0s6a-66fbIX0q0AvITEQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"hash join","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11611522/hash-join"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571176549,"creation_date":1571174477,"question_id":58402802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402802","body_markdown":"In CUDA programming, I try to reduce the synchronization overhead between the off-chip memory and on-chip memory if there is data dependency between two kernels?

&#39;agent&#39; or the one in &#39;compare&#39; is already inside one of the lists of all possible names (the values of the dictionary `output_data`). \r\n\r\nIf one of them is already inside, it means that the name in the other column is another possible name.

Other imports\r\nimport { connectActionSheet } from &#39;@expo/react-native-action-sheet&#39;\r\n\r\nconst AuthStack = createStackNavigator({\r\n    Signup: SignupScreen,\r\n    Login: LoginScreen\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst navigator = createBottomTabNavigator({\r\n    Feed: {\r\n        screen: FeedScreen,\r\n        navigationOptions: {\r\n            tabBarIcon: tabBarIcon(&#39;home&#39;),\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    Profile: {\r\n        screen: ProfileScreen,\r\n        navigationOptions: {\r\n            tabBarIcon: tabBarIcon(&#39;home&#39;),\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst stackNavigator = createStackNavigator({\r\n    Main: {\r\n        screen: navigator,\r\n        // Set the title for our app when the tab bar screen is present\r\n        navigationOptions: { title: &#39;Test&#39; },\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    // This screen will not have a tab bar\r\n    NewPost: NewPostScreen,\r\n}, {\r\n    cardStyle: { backgroundColor: &#39;white&#39; },\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst appContianer = createAppContainer(\r\n    createSwitchNavigator({\r\n        AuthLoading: AuthLoadingScreen,\r\n        App: stackNavigator,\r\n        Auth: AuthStack,\r\n    }, {\r\n        initialRouteName: &#39;AuthLoading&#39;,\r\n    })\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst ConnectApp = connectActionSheet(appContianer);\r\n\r\nexport default ConnectApp;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow on any of your application screens (i.e. Feed, Profile, Main, etc.) you can access the action sheet as follows:\r\n\r\n## If Stateless Component ##\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// ... Other imports\r\nimport { useActionSheet } from &#39;@expo/react-native-action-sheet&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default function Profile () {\r\n  const { showActionSheetWithOptions } = useActionSheet();\r\n  /* ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## If Statefull Component ##\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// ... Other imports\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;\r\nimport { useActionSheet } from &#39;@expo/react-native-action-sheet&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default Profile extends React.Component {\r\n  const { showActionSheetWithOptions } = useActionSheet();\r\n  /* ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** You can also access the action sheet as stated below from the [docs][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; `App` component can access the actionSheet method as `this.props.showActionSheetWithOptions`\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/expo/react-native-action-sheet#1-connect-your-component-which-uses-showactionsheetwithoptions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402771/how-to-use-hook-with-switchnavigator/58458839#58458839","title":"How to use hook with SwitchNavigator"}],"owner":{"reputation":1591,"user_id":4399243,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1382fc0b398211f7db089dd881914ec5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Onichan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4399243/onichan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1591,"user_id":4399243,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1382fc0b398211f7db089dd881914ec5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Onichan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4399243/onichan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571500558,"creation_date":1571174303,"last_edit_date":1571500558,"question_id":58402771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402771","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use [https://github.com/expo/react-native-action-sheet][1] with switch navigator.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure how to do the basic setup as the example in the readme is different than my App.js.

Threading continues with the `for` loop even when the execution of `scoring_function` in the current iteration is not finished (yeah, I know that&#39;s threading&#39;s purpose).\r\n\r\nI tried using conditions and events, even using them as global variables so the `scoring_function` could regulate them, but all they do is freezing the program.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion on what I should use?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402762/how-to-regulate-threads-inside-a-for-loop","title":"How to regulate threads inside a &quot;for&quot; loop?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pandas"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24785,"user_id":4333359,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/231e42e97a07b2937c1bf8a313dfa3f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ALollz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4333359/alollz"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571174832,"post_id":58402755,"comment_id":103150665,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402755/pandas-merge-asof-ambiguous-argument-types-error#comment103150665_58402755"},{"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":8285831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b755e231874fef0e24a7893e146d40d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jcp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8285831/jcp"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24785,"user_id":4333359,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/231e42e97a07b2937c1bf8a313dfa3f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ALollz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4333359/alollz"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571175221,"post_id":58402755,"comment_id":103150787,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402755/pandas-merge-asof-ambiguous-argument-types-error#comment103150787_58402755"}],"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":8285831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b755e231874fef0e24a7893e146d40d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jcp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8285831/jcp"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571174193,"creation_date":1571174193,"question_id":58402755,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402755","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use `merge_asof` from Pandas and I&#39;ve been getting the error:\r\n\r\n`TypeError: Function call with ambiguous argument types`\r\n\r\nReproducible example:\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n\r\n    a = pd.DataFrame({&#39;foo&#39;: [1., 2.], &#39;bar&#39;: [&#39;2019-01-01 00:00:10&#39;, &#39;2019-01-01 00:00:20&#39;]})\r\n    b = pd.DataFrame({&#39;foo&#39;: [2., 5.], &#39;baz&#39;: [&#39;2019-01-01 00:00:05&#39;, &#39;2019-01-01 00:00:25&#39;]})\r\n    a[&#39;bar&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(a[&#39;bar&#39;])\r\n    b[&#39;baz&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(b[&#39;baz&#39;])\r\n    \r\n    pd.merge_asof(a,\r\n                  b,\r\n                  left_on=&#39;bar&#39;,\r\n                  right_on=&#39;baz&#39;,\r\n                  direction=&#39;backward&#39;,\r\n                  by=&#39;foo&#39;,\r\n                  allow_exact_matches=False)\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried to inspect the pandas.core.reshape.merge file but had no luck solving the problem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402755/pandas-merge-asof-ambiguous-argument-types-error","title":"pandas merge_asof: ambiguous argument types error"},{"tags":["angular","typescript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":83498,"user_id":3001761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/feZwC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jonrsharpe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3001761/jonrsharpe"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571174265,"post_id":58402752,"comment_id":103150478,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402752/how-to-get-the-system-date-in-angular-8-using-form-builder#comment103150478_58402752"},{"owner":{"reputation":316,"user_id":8060667,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n8cir7Q5yo0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAo/Wa-zMtl5WP4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jorge M.

The issue being that I&#39;m running on Windows 10 1903. It happens both in a .NET Framework project using the `Microsoft.PowerShell.5.ReferenceAssemblies` package from NuGet, and in .NET Core 3 using the `Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK` package from NuGet. Other PowerShell commands run without any issue using the exact same method, and the same command runs without issues in a slightly tweaked remote version of our method where we set the remote runspace to run against remote machines. This problem seems to only be limited to running on the local machine.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any insight on this issue?

only way to create or delete a node and have Apollo automatically update the cache to reflect the change is to return the parent field of whatever field contains the updated List field. For example, let&#39;s say we have a schema like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Query {\r\n  me: User\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype User {\r\n  id: ID!\r\n  posts: [Post!]!\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Post {\r\n  id: ID!\r\n  body: String!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy convention, if we had a mutation to add a new post, the mutation field would return the created post.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Mutation {\r\n  writePost(body: String!): Post!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we could have it return the logged in User instead (the same thing the `me` field returns):\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Mutation {\r\n  writePost(body: String!): User!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nby doing so, we enable the client to make a query like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmutation WritePost($body: String!){\r\n  writePost(body: $body) {\r\n    id\r\n    posts {\r\n      id\r\n      body\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere Apollo will not only create or update the cache for all the returned posts, but it will also update the returned User object, including the list of posts.\r\n\r\n**So why is this not commonly done? Why does Apollo&#39;s documentation suggest using `writeQuery` when adding or deleting nodes?**\r\n\r\nThe above will work fine when your schema is simple and you&#39;re working with a relatively small amount of data. However, returning the entire parent node, including all its relations, can be noticeably slower and more resource-intensive once you&#39;re dealing with more data. Additionally, in many apps a single mutation could impact multiple queries inside the cache. The same node could be returned by any number of fields in the schema, and even the same field could be part of a number of different queries that utilize different filters, sort parameters, etc. \r\n\r\nThese factors make it unlikely that you&#39;ll want to implement this pattern in production but there certainly are use cases where it may be a valid option.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402732/update-apollo-cache-after-object-creation/58420141#58420141","title":"Update Apollo cache after object creation"}],"owner":{"reputation":3358,"user_id":994197,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d28ca46ce146502f578c6fd8dd85ffb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tuff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/994197/tuff"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3358,"user_id":994197,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d28ca46ce146502f578c6fd8dd85ffb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tuff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/994197/tuff"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58420141,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571258917,"creation_date":1571174066,"last_edit_date":1571256433,"question_id":58402732,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402732","body_markdown":"What are all the different ways of updating the Apollo [InMemoryCache](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master/packages/apollo-cache-inmemory) after a mutation? [From the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/#updating-the-cache-after-a-mutation), I can see:\r\n\r\n1. [Id-based updates](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/#updating-a-single-existing-entity) which Apollo performs automatically\r\n - Happens for single updates to existing objects only.\r\n - Requires an `id` field which uniquely identifies each object, or the cache must be configured with a `dataIdFromObject` function which provides a unique identifier.\r\n1. &quot;Manual&quot; cache updates via [update functions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/#making-all-other-cache-updates)\r\n - Required for object creation, deletion, or updates of multiple objects.\r\n - Involves calling `cache.writeQuery` with details including which query should be affected and how the cache should be changed.\r\n1. Passing the `refetchQueries` option to the `useMutation` hook\r\n - The calling code says which queries should be re-fetched from the API, Apollo does the fetching, and the results replace whatever is in the cache for the given queries.\r\n\r\nAre there other ways that I&#39;ve missed, or have I misunderstood anything about the above methods?\r\n\r\nI am confused because I&#39;ve been reading the code of a project which uses Apollo for all kinds of mutations, including creations and deletions, but I don&#39;t see any calls to `cache.writeQuery`, nor any usage of `refetchQueries`. How does the cache get updated after creations and deletions without either of those?\r\n\r\nIn my own limited experience with Apollo, the cache is not automatically updated after an object creation or deletion, not even if I define `dataIdFromObject`. I have to update the cache myself by writing update functions. \r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m wondering if there is some secret config I&#39;ve missed to make Apollo handle it for me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402732/update-apollo-cache-after-object-creation","title":"Update Apollo cache after object creation"},{"tags":["matlab","matlab-figure","ellipse","orbital-mechanics"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7769,"user_id":2917957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c73ad68d6b98c2e2529d69ab0402bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2917957/david"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571175307,"post_id":58402731,"comment_id":103150817,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402731/plotting-two-ellipses-with-same-foci-in-matlab#comment103150817_58402731"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10134664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efde6108152cae900a5f1643d6625613?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Scotch Jones","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10134664/scotch-jones"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571177430,"post_id":58402731,"comment_id":103151451,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402731/plotting-two-ellipses-with-same-foci-in-matlab#comment103151451_58402731"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10134664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efde6108152cae900a5f1643d6625613?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Scotch Jones","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10134664/scotch-jones"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10134664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efde6108152cae900a5f1643d6625613?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Scotch Jones","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10134664/scotch-jones"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571177562,"creation_date":1571174061,"last_edit_date":1571177562,"question_id":58402731,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402731","body_markdown":"I am trying to plot two different ellipses in Matlab with the same foci.

Depending on how your platform implements TTS, it might be getting directly streamed from the TTS server.  What may be happening is that the TTS engine can&#39;t keep with the request.\r\n\r\nIf this is on premise (unlikely these days), monitor the performance of the TTS server(s). CPU is the best metric.  If the platform uses MRCP (likely) logs for that communication may provide insights.\r\n\r\nIf this is a hosted solution, contact your provider.  Odds are, their test environment is underprovisioned for TTS.  Mostly because in test environments, everybody else is doing the same.  In production, many apps switch to recorded audio for quality, so the scale of TTS resources is reduced.\r\n\r\nFor an ugly hack, you could play a recording (actual audio file) of 1s of silence at the beginning of all forms.

When I place calls to test that our VUI and it&#39;s corresponding functions and TTS prompts are working correctly, I often run into the following problem.\r\n\r\nWhen I run tests (placing phone calls and navigating the VUI), in our local environment I&#39;ll randomly have prompts that stop playing for a few seconds. Instead of hearing the prompt, there is silence, and then the prompt picks up where you&#39;d expect it to be a few seconds from where the cut off began.\r\n\r\nFor example, take the prompt: &quot;Hello, thank you for calling today.&quot;\r\nAt certain times, while testing in our local environment, I&#39;ll hear, for example, &quot;Hello, *brief silence* calling today.&quot;\r\n\r\nBut, when I run the exact same test in our environment that we deploy to, I hear the same prompt just as I&#39;d expect it. I know environment issues can be common with TTS, specifically prompts cutting out and not playing clearly, but I&#39;m curious, can anyone elaborate on what these &quot;environment problems&quot; could be? Furthermore, I do know that these issues aren&#39;t grammar issues. I&#39;ll run tests where the prompt is spoken perfectly, but then when I give a no-input or no-match response, to hit the next function, which in that case is essentially the same exact prompt, the cut-off / silence occurs.\r\n\r\nAny information, sites or books are much appreciated.

And the second time you use `useInterval` it will create another instance of `useRef` for your `setCountMin(countMin + 1)`.

The main change with respect to my original example is that I configure the RabbitMQ broker with a passwordless user which has the same name as the CN field of the TLS certificate on both the server and the client side. To illustrate, below, I go through my example again in detail:\r\n\r\n(1) The **RabbitMQ configuration file** is:\r\n\r\n    listeners.tcp.default = 5672\r\n    listeners.ssl.default = 5671\r\n    \r\n    ssl_cert_login_from = common_name\r\n    \r\n    ssl_options.verify               = verify_peer\r\n    ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true\r\n    ssl_options.cacertfile           = /etc/cert/tms.crt\r\n    ssl_options.certfile             = /etc/cert/tms.crt\r\n    ssl_options.keyfile              = /etc/cert/tmsPrivKey.pem\r\n    \r\n    auth_mechanisms.1 = EXTERNAL\r\n    auth_mechanisms.2 = PLAIN\r\n    auth_mechanisms.3 = AMQPLAIN\r\n\r\nNote that, with the `ssl_cert_login_from` configuration option, I am asking for the username of the RabbitMQ account to be taken from the &quot;common name&quot; (CN) field of the TLS certificate.\r\n\r\n(2) The **rabbitmq-auth-mechanism-ssl plugin** is enabled with the following command:\r\n\r\n    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_auth_mechanism_ssl\r\n\r\nSuccessful enabling can be confirmed by checking the enable status through command: `rabbitmq-plugins list`.\r\n\r\n(3) The **signed TLS certificate** must have the issuer and subject CN fields equal to each other and equal to the hostname of the RabbitMQ broker node. In my case, inspection of the RabbitMQ log file (in `/var/log/rabbitmq`) shows that the broker is running on a node called: `rabbit@pnp-vm2`. The host name is therefore `pnp-vm2`. In order to check the CN fields of the client-side certificate, I use the following command:\r\n\r\n    ap@pnp-vm2:openssl x509 -noout -text -in /etc/cert/node.crt | fgrep CN\r\n            Issuer: C = CH, ST = CH, L = Location, O = Organization GmbH, CN = pnp-vm2\r\n            Subject: C = DE, ST = NodeProvince, L = NodeTown, O = Node GmbH, CN = pnp-vm2\r\n\r\nAs you can see, both the Issuer CN field and the Subject CN Field are equal to: &quot;pnp-vm2&quot; (which is the hostname of the RabbitMQ broker, see above). I tried using this name for only one of the two CN fields but then the connection to the broker could not be established. In my test environment, it was easy to create a client certificate with identical CN names but, in an operational environment, this may be a lot harder to do. Also, I do not quite understand the reason for this constraint: is it a bug or it is a feature? And does it originate in the particular RabbitMQ library I am using (python&#39;s pika) or in the AMQP protocol? These question probably deserve a dedicated post.\r\n\r\n(4) The **client-side program** to set up the connection is:\r\n\r\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\r\n    import logging\r\n    import pika\r\n    import ssl\r\n    from pika.credentials import ExternalCredentials\r\n    \r\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\r\n    context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=&quot;/home/ap/RocheTe/cert/sampleNodeCert/tms.crt&quot;)\r\n    context.load_cert_chain(&quot;/home/ap/RocheTe/cert/sampleNodeCert/node.crt&quot;,\r\n                            &quot;/home/ap/RocheTe/cert/sampleNodeCert/nodePrivKey.pem&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    ssl_options = pika.SSLOptions(context, &#39;pnp-vm2&#39;)\r\n    conn_params = pika.ConnectionParameters(host=&#39;a.b.c.d&#39;,\r\n                                            port=5671,\r\n                                            ssl_options=ssl_options,\r\n                                            credentials=ExternalCredentials(),\r\n                                            heartbeat=0)\r\n    \r\n    with pika.BlockingConnection(conn_params) as conn:\r\n        ch = conn.channel()\r\n        ch.queue_declare(&quot;foobar&quot;)\r\n        ch.basic_publish(&quot;&quot;, &quot;foobar&quot;, &quot;Hello, world!&quot;)\r\n        print(ch.basic_get(&quot;foobar&quot;))\r\n        input(&quot;Press Enter to continue...&quot;)\r\n\r\nHere, &quot;a.b.c.d&quot; is the IP address of the machine on which the RabbitMQ broker is running.\r\n\r\n(5) The **environment** in which this test was done is Ubuntu 18.04 using RabbitMQ 3.7.17 on Erlang 22.0.7.

There is a case that I don&#39;t understand. \r\n\r\nI have a container, with a card inside of it. I want to add a footer inside of this card, so I put another div inside of it, as follow : \r\n\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n       &lt;section id=&quot;experiences&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;experiences-cards-container&quot;&gt;\r\n             &lt;div class=&quot;experience-card&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;card-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n             &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n       &lt;/section&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n\r\nAs it is a footer, I want it to be displayed at the bottom of my card.

[The AWS documentation for DLQs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html) says:\r\n\r\n&gt; Sometimes, messages can’t be processed because of a variety of possible issues, such as erroneous conditions within the producer or consumer application or an unexpected state change that causes an issue with your application code. For example, if a user places a web order with a particular product ID, but the product ID is deleted, the web store&#39;s code fails and displays an error, and the message with the order request is sent to a dead-letter queue.\r\n\r\nThe context here is that my company uses a Cloud Formation setup to run a virus scanner against files which users upload to our S3 buckets. \r\n\r\n* The buckets have bucket events which publish `PUT` actions to an SQS queue. \r\n* An EC2 instance subscribes to that queue and runs files which get uploaded to those buckets through a virus scanner. \r\n\r\nThe messages which enter the queue are coming from S3 bucket events, so it seems like that rules out &quot;erroneous conditions within the producer.&quot; Could an SQS redrive policy get fired if a subscriber to the queue fails to process the message?\r\n\r\nThis is one of the messages which was sent to the DLQ (I&#39;ve changed letters and numbers in each of the IDs):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  &quot;Records&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;eventVersion&quot;: &quot;2.1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;eventSource&quot;: &quot;aws:s3&quot;,\r\n      &quot;awsRegion&quot;: &quot;us-east-1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;2019-09-30T20:21:13.762Z&quot;,\r\n      &quot;eventName&quot;: &quot;ObjectCreated:Put&quot;,\r\n      &quot;userIdentity&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;principalId&quot;: &quot;AWS:AIDAIQ6ZKWSHYT34HC0X2&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;requestParameters&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;sourceIPAddress&quot;: &quot;52.161.96.193&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;responseElements&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;x-amz-request-id&quot;: &quot;9F500CA65B966D84&quot;,\r\n        &quot;x-amz-id-2&quot;: &quot;w1R6BLPAI68na+xNssfdscQjfOQk56gmof+Bp4nF/rY90jBWnlqliHLrnwHWx20329clJckCIzhI=&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;s3&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;s3SchemaVersion&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;,\r\n        &quot;configurationId&quot;: &quot;VirusScan&quot;,\r\n        &quot;bucket&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;uploadcenter&quot;,\r\n          &quot;ownerIdentity&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;principalId&quot;: &quot;A2CSGHOAZOCNTU&quot;\r\n          },\r\n          &quot;arn&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:s3:::sharingcenter&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;object&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;key&quot;: &quot;Packard/f43edeee-6d58-118f-f8b8-4ec57f9cdb54Transformers/Transformers.mp4&quot;,\r\n          &quot;size&quot;: 1317070058,\r\n          &quot;eTag&quot;: &quot;4a828a976dbdfe6fe1931f8e96437e2&quot;,\r\n          &quot;sequencer&quot;: &quot;005D20633476B28AE7&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been puzzling over this message and similar ones trying to figure out what may have triggered the redrive policy. Could it have been caused by the EC2 instance failing to process the message? There&#39;s nothing in Ruby script on the instance which would publish a message to the DLQ. Each of these files is uncommonly large. Is it possible that something in the process choked on the file because of its size, and that caused the redrive? If it&#39;s not possible for the EC2 failure to have caused the redrive, what is it about the message which would cause SQS to send it to the DLQ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402665/why-does-sqs-fail-to-process-these-messages","title":"Why does SQS fail to process these messages?"},{"tags":["kubernetes"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":32971,"user_id":78722,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf611565f0b79abd0b3dc200ad867661?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"coderanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/78722/coderanger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571174023,"creation_date":1571174023,"answer_id":58402724,"question_id":58402661,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58402724","body_markdown":"This is up to your underlying nodes.

I have encode, channel and decode part.
