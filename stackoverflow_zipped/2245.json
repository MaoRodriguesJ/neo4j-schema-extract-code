So we can&#39;t use this as the existing nodes would not have the correct environment variables anymore.\r\n\r\nAs a last resort we tried to set the environment variables on the dynamic ec2 slaves by creating an `/etc/profile.d/jenkinsvars.sh` on the AMI used by the Spot Request Instance.\r\nThis script would be automatically run on login system wide (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#A.2Fetc.2Fprofile.d.2F.2A.sh).\r\nNext to that we also attempted to set them in `/home/ubuntu/.profile` on the AMI singling out the ubuntu user which is the user running the Jenkins agent (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#A.2BAH4-.2F.profile).\r\nBut it appears Jenkins does not use these environment variables but its own...\r\n\r\nA way that works is to adapt the jobs to load a groovy file that&#39;s part of the AMI to set the environment variables we need but that would mean to change almost all jobs we have, next to all Jenkinsfiles that are included in our repositories (Bitbucket project).\r\nWe would like to avoid this....","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006452/issue-setting-jenkins-environment-variables-on-ec2-fleet","title":"Issue setting Jenkins environment variables on EC2-Fleet"},{"tags":["java","rest","spring-boot","web-applications","paytm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":35568,"user_id":3890632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNkgF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"khelwood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3890632/khelwood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568880636,"post_id":58006449,"comment_id":102417718,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006449/is-this-possible-to-run-two-web-application-with-different-java-version-on-one-s#comment102417718_58006449"},{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":11493068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--sDyfegMOcs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfoMpoT_PF4Kk2mVg-SFvwn368m6Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pranav Kuldharan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11493068/pranav-kuldharan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":35568,"user_id":3890632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNkgF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"khelwood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3890632/khelwood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569300324,"post_id":58006449,"comment_id":102541536,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006449/is-this-possible-to-run-two-web-application-with-different-java-version-on-one-s#comment102541536_58006449"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":11493068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--sDyfegMOcs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfoMpoT_PF4Kk2mVg-SFvwn368m6Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pranav Kuldharan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11493068/pranav-kuldharan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2,"user_id":11493068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--sDyfegMOcs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfoMpoT_PF4Kk2mVg-SFvwn368m6Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pranav Kuldharan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11493068/pranav-kuldharan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569315416,"creation_date":1568880309,"last_edit_date":1568880723,"question_id":58006449,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006449","body_markdown":"We want to run our one application on JDK 1.8 version of java and other on JDK 12 version, Is this possible?\r\nWe create our entire rest application on Java 1.8 version also we integrate paytm gateway for payment integration.

Is there any resources or good documentation for **using drools UI in Spring boot application?**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.drools.org/\r\n  [2]: https://www.baeldung.com/drools-spring-integration","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006442/spring-boot-using-drools-ui-designer","title":"Spring boot using Drools ui designer"},{"tags":["javascript","google-apps-script","google-sheets"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":38512,"user_id":7108653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2EI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tanaike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568880685,"post_id":58006441,"comment_id":102417743,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006441/get-the-real-value-of-time-in-google-script#comment102417743_58006441"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11760093,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qUyppUwPF3k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd9Y4JQucMqKKYcOE7YbvDMrUqjVw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Glenn Perey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11760093/glenn-perey"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":38512,"user_id":7108653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2EI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tanaike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568881003,"post_id":58006441,"comment_id":102417883,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006441/get-the-real-value-of-time-in-google-script#comment102417883_58006441"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11760093,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qUyppUwPF3k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd9Y4JQucMqKKYcOE7YbvDMrUqjVw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Glenn Perey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11760093/glenn-perey"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568880668,"creation_date":1568880260,"question_id":58006441,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006441","body_markdown":"I have values of time in my Google Sheet:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lEfzjG1zzJVPMN8r-OpeZm6q9_IqSwk9DNCEY-q7ozY/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nBut when logging the values of it is reflecting as Date and not as Time.\r\n\r\nGoogle Apps Script:\r\n\r\n    function getData(){\r\n      var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(url);\r\n      var ws = ss.getSheetByName(&quot;Test_Data&quot;);  \r\n      var myData = ws.getRange(2, 7, ws.getLastRow()-1, 2).getValues();\r\n      Logger.log(myData[0][1])\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLog output:\r\n\r\n    [19-09-19 15:44:58:643 HKT] Sat Dec 30 09:30:59 GMT+07:36 1899\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using this:\r\n\r\n    var time = new Date(myData[0][1]);\r\n    var timeForm = Utilities.formatDate(time, &#39;GMT+8&#39;, &quot;MMM dd, yyyy&#39;T&#39;HH:mm&#39;Z&#39;&quot;);\r\n    Logger.log(timeForm)\r\n\r\n\r\nand the result is:\r\n\r\n    [19-09-19 16:02:11:481 HKT] Dec 30, 1899T09:54Z\r\n\r\nPlease help me how to get the real value which is `10:00AM` and not the date.

What is the simplest, but still secure way of handling sign in to the Grafana dashboard? The dashboard is currently rendered inside an iframe on one of the Razor pages in the web app.\r\n\r\nI have experimented with setting Grafana up to use Azure AD for authentication, but then the sign in and sign out of the web app and Grafana dashboard is not synced, and it is possible to be signed in to the web app as one user, and the dasboard as an other user.\r\n\r\nFor deployment I&#39;m thinking to use Docker containers, possibly in a Kubernetes Pod. Grafana will run as one container, and the web app as a separate container.\r\n\r\nWould I be better off by using the AuthProxy of Grafana? Is that an option that will work in a production environment?\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t think I need to differentiate too much between the users of Grafana, except the admin user and regular users. Data access will be handled by the ASP.NET Core backend. Should I go for just one Grafana user, and embed separate panels instead of whole dashboard, as described [here](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/whats-new-in-v2/#panel-iframe-embedding)?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions to approach will be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006438/how-to-integrate-grafana-in-an-asp-net-core-web-app-with-azure-ad-authentication","title":"How to integrate Grafana in an ASP.NET Core web app with Azure AD authentication?"},{"tags":["javascript","arrays","mergesort"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":115,"user_id":12046335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uK8qjEEqoT8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdicKVxDrvCMR0w081mjiJu77kJ0g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"P4uB0rd4","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046335/p4ub0rd4"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568880423,"post_id":58006436,"comment_id":102417616,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006436/javascript-merging-two-sorted-arrays-can-someone-please-tell-me-why-this-isnt#comment102417616_58006436"},{"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":115,"user_id":12046335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uK8qjEEqoT8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdicKVxDrvCMR0w081mjiJu77kJ0g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"P4uB0rd4","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046335/p4ub0rd4"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568880533,"post_id":58006436,"comment_id":102417669,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006436/javascript-merging-two-sorted-arrays-can-someone-please-tell-me-why-this-isnt#comment102417669_58006436"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":889,"user_id":4635829,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qIfH2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jmtalarn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4635829/jmtalarn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568880530,"creation_date":1568880530,"answer_id":58006509,"question_id":58006436,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006509","body_markdown":"In the while condition when i or j indexes reach the length of the corresponding array finishes the loop returning an array of the lower length.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006436/javascript-merging-two-sorted-arrays-can-someone-please-tell-me-why-this-isnt/58006509#58006509","title":"Javascript, Merging two sorted arrays: Can someone please tell me why this isn&#39;t giving the correct mergeSort?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24471,"user_id":9819146,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ioXmnWNrB_w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/Q47JYDWDFyo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Maheer Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9819146/maheer-ali"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568881029,"post_id":58006579,"comment_id":102417895,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006436/javascript-merging-two-sorted-arrays-can-someone-please-tell-me-why-this-isnt/58006579#comment102417895_58006579"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":115,"user_id":12046335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uK8qjEEqoT8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdicKVxDrvCMR0w081mjiJu77kJ0g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"P4uB0rd4","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046335/p4ub0rd4"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568880772,"creation_date":1568880772,"answer_id":58006579,"question_id":58006436,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006579","body_markdown":"This works:\r\n\r\n    function mergeTwoSortedArrays(arr1, arr2) {\r\n      let merged = [];\r\n      let index1 = 0;\r\n      let index2 = 0;\r\n      let current = 0;\r\n    \r\n      while (current &lt;

The first parameter is a single `ArrayList` instance, **not** a lambda expression can produce multiple `ArrayList` instances.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the entire reduction operates on a single `ArrayList` instance. When multiple threads modify that `ArrayList` in parallel, the results may change in each execution.\r\n\r\nYour `combiner` actually adds all the elements of a `List` to the same `List`. \r\n\r\nYou can obtain the expected `[a,b]` output if both the `accumulator` and `combiner` functions will produce a new `ArrayList` instead of mutating their input `ArrayList`:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; join = vals.parallelStream().reduce(\r\n         new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(),\r\n            (List&lt;String&gt; l, String v) -&gt; {\r\n                List&lt;String&gt; cl = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(l);\r\n                cl.add(v);\r\n                return cl;\r\n            }, (a, b) -&gt; {\r\n                List&lt;String&gt; ca = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(a);\r\n                ca.addAll(b);\r\n                return ca;\r\n            }\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThat said, you shouldn&#39;t be using `reduce` at all. `collect` is the correct way to perform a mutable reduction:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; join = vals.parallelStream()\r\n                            .collect(ArrayList::new,ArrayList::add,ArrayList::addAll);\r\n\r\nAs you can see, here, unlike in `reduce`, the first parameter you pass is a `Supplier&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;&gt;`, which can be used to generate as many intermediate `ArrayList` instances as necessary.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006434/java-stream-reduce-unexplained-behaviour/58006750#58006750","title":"Java Stream reduce unexplained behaviour"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":187814,"user_id":2711488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhkI9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Holger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2711488/holger"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568884256,"post_id":58007497,"comment_id":102419622,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006434/java-stream-reduce-unexplained-behaviour/58007497#comment102419622_58007497"},{"owner":{"reputation":84363,"user_id":984823,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2KYN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joop Eggen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/984823/joop-eggen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":187814,"user_id":2711488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhkI9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Holger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2711488/holger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568884639,"post_id":58007497,"comment_id":102419811,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006434/java-stream-reduce-unexplained-behaviour/58007497#comment102419811_58007497"},{"owner":{"reputation":187814,"user_id":2711488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhkI9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Holger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2711488/holger"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568885127,"post_id":58007497,"comment_id":102420063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006434/java-stream-reduce-unexplained-behaviour/58007497#comment102420063_58007497"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":84363,"user_id":984823,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2KYN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joop Eggen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/984823/joop-eggen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":84363,"user_id":984823,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2KYN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joop Eggen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/984823/joop-eggen"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568885679,"last_edit_date":1568885679,"creation_date":1568884024,"answer_id":58007497,"question_id":58006434,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58007497","body_markdown":"It is rather simple, the first argument is the _identity_ or I would say _zero_ to start with.

And you should give a try to jQuery function [toggle][1] which do the same functionality with `display: none/bock;` but in much easier way.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n      $(&#39;.package_validity_child&#39;).each(function() {\r\n        const $firstCb = $(this).find(&quot;input[name=&#39;plan_name_selector&#39;]&quot;).first();\r\n        $firstCb.prop(&#39;checked&#39;, true);\r\n        showValue($firstCb.val());\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      $(&#39;.plan_name&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, function() {\r\n        const hideDays = $(this).val() !== &#39;Daily&#39;;\r\n        $(&#39;.days_names&#39;).toggle(hideDays);\r\n        $(&#39;.select_days&#39;).toggle(hideDays);\r\n\r\n        showValue($(this).val());\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      function showValue(value) {\r\n        $(&#39;.selected_plan_name&#39;).val(value).html(&quot;You have choosed &lt;b&gt;&quot; + value + &quot;&lt;/b&gt; validity.&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;package_validity_child&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;custom-control custom-radio custom-control-inline&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; class=&quot;custom-control-input plan_name&quot; id=&quot;daily&quot; name=&quot;plan_name_selector&quot; value=&quot;Daily&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label class=&quot;custom-control-label&quot; for=&quot;daily&quot;&gt;Daily&lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;custom-control custom-radio custom-control-inline&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; class=&quot;custom-control-input plan_name&quot; id=&quot;weekly&quot; name=&quot;plan_name_selector&quot; value=&quot;Weekly&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label class=&quot;custom-control-label&quot; for=&quot;weekly&quot;&gt;Weekly&lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;custom-control custom-radio custom-control-inline&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; class=&quot;custom-control-input plan_name&quot; id=&quot;monthly&quot; name=&quot;plan_name_selector&quot; value=&quot;Monthly&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label class=&quot;custom-control-label&quot; for=&quot;monthly&quot;&gt;Monthly&lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;plan_name&quot; class=&quot;form-control ml-4 mt-2 w-50 selected_plan_name&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle-display","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006432/set-first-radio-button-check-and-get-value-in-jquery/58007034#58007034","title":"Set first radio button check and get value in jquery"}],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":11977154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDoxSv1jvbhwnvCNXb2pg43ztADkpzJqcAySBNE=k-s128","display_name":"Zain Shabir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11977154/zain-shabir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4539,"user_id":4370109,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UcQgO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Tompsett - 汤莱恩","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4370109/brian-tompsett-%e6%b1%a4%e8%8e%b1%e6%81%a9"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58007034,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568901876,"creation_date":1568880217,"last_edit_date":1568901876,"question_id":58006432,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006432","body_markdown":"I have 3 radio buttons and I was trying to set first radio button checked, I did it but I am not getting value with by default check first button.

My code is as below :\r\n\r\n```         \r\nimport glob\r\nimport os\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\noutput = pd.DataFrame()\r\nfor file in glob.glob(os.getcwd()+&quot;\\\\*.xlsx&quot;):\r\n    cn = pd.read_excel(file)\r\n    output = output.append(cn)\r\noutput.to_excel(os.getcwd()+&quot;\\\\outPut.xlsx&quot;, index = False, na_rep = &quot;NA&quot;, header=None)\r\nprint(&quot;Completed +::&quot; )```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006398/append-multiple-excels-into-a-single-excel-placed-inside-a-folder-using-python","title":"append multiple excels into a single excel placed inside a folder using python"},{"tags":["c#","identityserver3"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":5492123,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zoq1QP_e7DU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB_I/4VICQTQuyoI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"AjItH V S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5492123/ajith-v-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569383907,"post_id":58006395,"comment_id":102574638,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006395/how-to-secure-a-custom-webapi-controller-in-an-identityserver3-host-application#comment102574638_58006395"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":10835467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a283bbdc51108574db14e18d88b39d10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raymond Brink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10835467/raymond-brink"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34,"user_id":10835467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a283bbdc51108574db14e18d88b39d10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raymond Brink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10835467/raymond-brink"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568882676,"creation_date":1568880092,"last_edit_date":1568882676,"question_id":58006395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006395","body_markdown":"I have, from what I think, a pretty straight forward task. We have a running Website and an IdentityServer3 instance. The Website is secured using cookie autentication. The login form is part of the website, so we use the ResourceOwner flow to authenticate users against the token endpoint. When successfull we get the user&#39;s claims from the userinfo endpoint and sign the user in. All this can be done using the original IdSvr3 source code.\r\n\r\nNow we want to allow the user to update his own profile through another page of the Website. This requires the Website to be able to update the user&#39;s claims through a custom API, because such API is not offered by IdSvr3 source code.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve added a profile page to the Website, which is only available to an authenticated user (secured using the Authorize attribute). Now I need to implement the API.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve added WebApi2 to the IdentityServer3 project and the ApiController works when consumed from the Website. It uses a different client configuration for this, relying on the ClientCredentials flow. As soon as I secure the ApiController with a specific role: &#39;identityApi&#39;, it returns Unauthorized (as expected).\r\n\r\nNow here comes the tricky part: I was under the impression that adding the &#39;identityApi&#39; scope to the ClientCredentials client&#39;s scopes would allow the Website to access the API again, but that&#39;s not the case! The ApiController in the IdentityServer project keeps returning Unauthorized.\r\n\r\nMy questions are: \r\n\r\n* Am I on the right path? \r\n* Am I missing some plumbing in either the IdentityServer3 project or the Website client? \r\n* Does anyone have an end-to-end sample somewhere that I can investigate/compare to?\r\n\r\nI found documentation on how to add custum API&#39;s to IdentityServer4 [here](http://docs.identityserver.io/en/latest/topics/add_apis.html), but unfortunately I&#39;m still on IdentityServer3.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also found [this IdentityServer3 issue](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3/issues/812), where someone suggests to configure a second application in OWIN for a custom API controller. I&#39;ve tried this, but without result.\r\n\r\nIf any code is required to illustrate the above, I&#39;m more than willing to share.

communicating with an Active Directory which responds with, for example, user parameters. Among those parameters are the CN and DN. As the structure of this DN can be variable from system to system, I need to come up with a general solution.\r\n\r\nThe problem I&#39;m facing is when the DN is returned with double backslashes, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUser:  { \r\n  dn: &#39;CN=LastName\\\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL&#39;,\r\n  cn: &#39;LastName, Surname&#39; \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I then request all groups this user belongs to, this fails. When I try to access the key &#39;dn&#39; of this object, the double backslashes are automatically parsed to a single backslash. Like this:\r\n```\r\nUser dn:  CN=LastName\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL\r\n```\r\nAnd this does not give back any results because the members are stored in the AD with double backslash.\r\n\r\nI need a generic way to take the value of the object-key in literal form, without JavaScript parsing the escape characters.\r\n\r\nThe following forms can also occur inside the AD system for the DN:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDN: CN=LastName\\\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL\r\nDN: CN=LastName\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL\r\nDN: CN=Surname LastName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL\r\nDN: CN=LastName SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL\r\n```\r\n\r\nI already tried String.raw, escape(), JSON.stringify, but all those result in invalid DN&#39;s which I can paste in the search query for the groups of a user.\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\nAs pointed out in the replies I wasn&#39;t completely thorough in my explaination.\r\nSo the return object as depicted above is correct, that is what is returned from the AD via LDAP search (searched for a user first).\r\n\r\nIt is then injected in the function that requests all the groups for that specific user while not modifying or touching the object and the filter is constructed the following manner (where ldapUser is the object from above):\r\n```\r\nconst opts = {\r\n    filter: `(&amp;(objectClass=group)(member=${ldapUser.dn}))`,\r\n    scope: &quot;sub&quot;,\r\n    attributes: [&quot;dn&quot;, &quot;cn&quot;],\r\n};\r\n```\r\nI&#39;m using the ldapjs package by the way on NodeJS v10.15.3.\r\nThe resulting filter when printed is then:\r\n```\r\nfilter:  (&amp;(objectClass=group)(member=CN=LastName\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update 2**\r\nSo here is the requested output of various console.log statements:\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(ldapUser.dn, opts.filter);\r\nCN=LastName\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL (&amp;(objectClass=group)(member=CN=LastName\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL))\r\n\r\nconsole.log(ldapUser, ldapUser.dn, opts.filter);\r\n{ dn: &#39;CN=LastName\\\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL&#39;,\r\n  controls: [],\r\n  cn: &#39;LastName, SurName&#39; } &#39;CN=LastName\\\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL&#39; &#39;(&amp;(objectClass=group)(member=CN=LastName\\\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL))&#39;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(opts);\r\n{ \r\nfilter: &#39;(&amp;(objectClass=group)(member=CN=LastName\\\\, SurName,OU=People,DC=COMP,DC=NL))&#39;,\r\n  scope: &#39;sub&#39;,\r\n  attributes: [ &#39;dn&#39;, &#39;cn&#39; ] \r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006345/how-to-get-literal-value-of-js-object-key","title":"How to get literal value of JS object key"},{"tags":["r","airflow"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":106232,"user_id":1412059,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQ33X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1412059/roland"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568880694,"post_id":58006344,"comment_id":102417748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006344/segmentation-fault-when-schedule-r-script-with-airflow#comment102417748_58006344"},{"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":7156808,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3ef8fb782c8fd92f6b933e7c6089b266?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H.

I am deciding between global access via Singleton pattern, or already existing messaging system. \r\n\r\nWith messaging system it would work like this: State machine would register event listener for TO_CHANGE_STATE events and when some other component need to change one of stateTypes it would register event describing state change. StateMachine will listen to theese changes and alter states accordingly. After state change, StateMachine would register event STATE_CHANGED describing state change. All relevant components with appropriate listeners would get notified about this state change.\r\n\r\nWith Singleton it would be much simpler, just getState(), setState() whenever needed.\r\n\r\nAs I am reading, Singletons are not favorite pattern(or &quot;antipattern&quot;) of many, I understand all it&#39;s disadvantages, but I am worried about possible unnecessary overhead that comes with messaging.

For example, you may temporarily set its `BorderThickness=&quot;5&quot;` and see if it isn&#39;t clipped anywhere (this may be the case if you have any `HorizontalAlignment` / `VerticalAlignment`  other than `Stretch`).\r\n\r\n---------\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, for scrolling a `TextBox`, all depends on the value of `TextWrapping` property. \r\n\r\nFor a `TextBox`, scrolling horizontally out-of-the-box only only makes sense if the text isn&#39;t wrapped (meaning there&#39;s only one very long line):\r\n\r\n\r\n        &lt;TextBox ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility=&quot;Disabled&quot; \r\n            ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=&quot;Auto&quot;\r\n            Width=&quot;300&quot;\r\n            Height=&quot;200&quot;\r\n            TextWrapping=&quot;NoWrap&quot;\r\n            FontSize=&quot;22pt&quot;\r\n            Text=&quot;Some loooooooooong text. Some loooooooooong text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. &quot;\r\n            /&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you want to have more than one line of text to scroll it horizontally, you have to wrap a `TextBox` in a `ScrollViewer` explicitly and set the sizes correctly to limit the `ScrollViewer`&#39;s content:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ScrollViewer \r\n            Width=&quot;200&quot;\r\n            VerticalScrollBarVisibility=&quot;Auto&quot; \r\n            HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=&quot;Auto&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;TextBox Name=&quot;txb1&quot;\r\n                Width=&quot;500&quot;\r\n                VerticalAlignment=&quot;Stretch&quot;\r\n                TextWrapping=&quot;Wrap&quot;\r\n                AcceptsReturn=&quot;True&quot;\r\n                FontSize=&quot;22pt&quot;\r\n                Text=&quot;Some loooooooooong text. Some loooooooooong text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. Some long text. &quot;\r\n            /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;\r\n\r\nI guess if you want to &quot;auto-adjust&quot; the width of the `TextBox` somehow, you&#39;d need to calculate it as text changes. A way to do it off the top of my head (there are probably better solutions):\r\n\r\n\r\n    private void TextBox_TextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n            txb1.Width = txb1.Text.Split(&#39;\\n&#39;).Max(a =&gt;a.Length) * approximatedCharWidth;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nwhere as `approximatedCharWidth` I used:\r\n\r\n    approximatedCharWidth = MeasureString(txb1, &quot;lext&quot;).Width/4.0;\r\n    private Size MeasureString(TextBox textBlock, string candidate)\r\n        {\r\n            var formattedText = new FormattedText(\r\n                candidate,\r\n                CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,\r\n                FlowDirection.LeftToRight,\r\n                new Typeface(textBlock.FontFamily, textBlock.FontStyle, textBlock.FontWeight, textBlock.FontStretch),\r\n                textBlock.FontSize,\r\n                Brushes.Black,\r\n                new NumberSubstitution(),\r\n                1);\r\n\r\n            return new Size(formattedText.Width, formattedText.Height);\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006323/wpf-how-to-make-a-textbox-slideable/58007986#58007986","title":"WPF How to make a textbox slideable"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5811,"user_id":426185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed64e54f32c14d0f11e4e91009703322?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/426185/andy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568889638,"creation_date":1568889638,"answer_id":58009205,"question_id":58006323,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58009205","body_markdown":"If you just have a plain string with no line feeds then this can only work for horizontal OR vertical scrolling.\r\n\r\nIf you can scroll horizontally then you&#39;re telling the text it can be as wide as it likes.

Seems to be a bug, Google please fix this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006293/android-studio-lldb-crash-when-showing-value-tooltip-only-armeabi-v7a","title":"Android Studio LLDB crash when showing value tooltip (only armeabi-v7a)"},{"tags":["get","cucumber","karate"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":945,"user_id":10791639,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/062d5e50fa619f753e11f2862a1e00d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adrien","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10791639/adrien"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568880026,"post_id":58006291,"comment_id":102417454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006291/karate-when-i-run-a-basic-feature-with-get-call-i-get-karate-exception-as-ins#comment102417454_58006291"},{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":1881683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45221f7cd87316fa8d7f01e76e567075?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"irfan mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1881683/irfan-mike"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":945,"user_id":10791639,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/062d5e50fa619f753e11f2862a1e00d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adrien","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10791639/adrien"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568881778,"post_id":58006291,"comment_id":102418263,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006291/karate-when-i-run-a-basic-feature-with-get-call-i-get-karate-exception-as-ins#comment102418263_58006291"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":1881683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45221f7cd87316fa8d7f01e76e567075?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"irfan mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1881683/irfan-mike"},"last_editor":{"reputation":52,"user_id":1881683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45221f7cd87316fa8d7f01e76e567075?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"irfan mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1881683/irfan-mike"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568891658,"creation_date":1568879653,"last_edit_date":1568880380,"question_id":58006291,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006291","body_markdown":"I have a simple karate feature file where i use get call to a particular rest api and i get the following exception,\r\n\r\ncom.intuit.karate.exception.KarateException: JOBS.feature:16 - INSTANCE\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know or come across this type of exception.

In Terraform 0.12 there is no need to use `template_file`, because it has been replaced with two other features:\r\n\r\n* For templates in separate files, [the built in `templatefile` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/templatefile.html) can render an external template from directly in the language, without the need for a separate provider and data source.\r\n* For inline templates (specified directly within the configuration) you can just write them in directly where they need to be, or factor them out via [Local Values](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/locals.html).\r\n\r\nThe `local_file` resource is also a better way to create a local file on disk than to use a `local-exec` provisioner. By using `template_file` and `local-exec` here you&#39;re forcing yourself to contend with two levels of additional escaping: Terraform template escaping to get the literal template into the `template_file` data source, and then shell escaping inside your provisioner.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a more direct way to represent your template and your file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;postfix_config_path&quot; {\r\n  # Note that for my example this is expected to be the full path\r\n  # to the file, not just the filename. Terraform idiom is to be\r\n  # explicit about this sort of thing, rather than relying on\r\n  # environment variables like HOME.\r\n  type = string\r\n}\r\n\r\nlocals {\r\n  postfix_config = &lt;&lt;-EOT\r\n    ##\r\n    ## Network settings\r\n    ##\r\n    mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128\r\n    inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1, ::1, 120.121.123.124, 2a03:b0a0:3:d0::5e79:4001\r\n    myhostname = ${var.hostname}.${var.domain_name}\r\n\r\n    ###\r\n    ### Outbound SMTP connections (Postfix as sender)\r\n    ###\r\n    smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:$${data_directory}/smtp_scache\r\n  EOT\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;local_file&quot; &quot;postfix_config&quot; {\r\n  filename = var.postfix_config_path\r\n  content  = local.postfix_config\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs the `local` provider documentation warns, Terraform isn&#39;t really designed for directly managing files and other resources on a local machine. The `local` provider is there for unusual situations, and this might be one of those situations, in which case the above is a reasonable way to address it.\r\n\r\nNote though that a more standard Terraform usage pattern would be for Terraform to be used to start up a new virtual machine that will run Postfix and pass in the necessary configuration via a vendor-specific `user_data` or `metadata` argument.\r\n\r\nIf the postfix server is managed separately from this Terraform configuration, then an alternative pattern is to arrange for Terraform to write the necessary data to a shared configuration store (e.g. AWS SSM Parameter Store, or HashiCorp Consul) and then use separate software on the postfix server to read that and update the `main.cf` file. For HashiCorp Consul, that separate software might be [consul-template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template). Similar software exists for other parameter stores, allowing you to decouple the configuration of individual virtual machines from the configuration of your overall infrastructure.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006272/how-to-create-a-file-with-terrafom-and-include-variable-as-literal/58016788#58016788","title":"How to create a file with terrafom and include variable as literal?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12088798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6171d640919ccfe359fd2704f8b3fa73?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hobak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12088798/hobak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58016788,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568916588,"creation_date":1568879595,"question_id":58006272,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006272","body_markdown":"Using terraform v0.12.9 and building a file using template_file data source, I could not use double dollar signs &lt;b&gt;$$&lt;/b&gt;

The truth value of all integers except 0 is true (in this case, the 2).\r\n\r\n`if x == True:`, however, compares `x` to the value of `True`, which is a kind of `1`. Comparing `2 == 1` results in a false value.\r\n\r\nTo be exact, there are two adjacent concepts:\r\n* the one is the &quot;truth value&quot;, which determines the behaviour of `if`, `while` etc.\r\n* the other are the values `True` and `False`, which have the respective truth values &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;, but are not necessary equal ot other true resp. false values.\r\n\r\nIf you absolutely need to check for the exact values of `True` and `False` for whatever reason, you can do so with `if x is True` or `if x is False`. This ensures that if y is exactly `True` will pass the test, if it is `1`, it won&#39;t.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006256/what-is-the-difference-between-if-x-true-and-if-x/58006312#58006312","title":"What is the difference between &quot;if x == True&quot; and &quot;if x:&quot;"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1568880080,"creation_date":1568880080,"answer_id":58006391,"question_id":58006256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006391","body_markdown":"The `==` operator doesn&#39;t compare the truthiness of its operands, it compares their values.\r\n\r\nWhen boolean values are used in a context that requires numbers, such as when comparing them with numbers, they get converted automatically: `True` becomes `1`, `False` becomes `0`.\r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\n```\r\nif some_boolean == some_number:\r\n```\r\nis effectively equivalent to:\r\n```\r\nif int(some_boolean) == some_number:\r\n```\r\nThis is why \r\n```\r\nif True == 2:\r\n```\r\ndoes not succeed. `int(True)` is `1`, so this is equivalent to\r\n```\r\nif 1 == 2:\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006256/what-is-the-difference-between-if-x-true-and-if-x/58006391#58006391","title":"What is the difference between &quot;if x == True&quot; and &quot;if x:&quot;"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2698,"user_id":3161575,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002151173457/picture?type=large","display_name":"rusu_ro1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3161575/rusu-ro1"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2698,"user_id":3161575,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002151173457/picture?type=large","display_name":"rusu_ro1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3161575/rusu-ro1"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568882917,"last_edit_date":1568882917,"creation_date":1568881574,"answer_id":58006773,"question_id":58006256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006773","body_markdown":"equivalent ways to look at the problem:\r\n\r\n    &quot;if x&quot; &lt;==&gt; &quot;if bool(x)&quot;\r\nsince your x is an integer: \r\n\r\n    &quot;if x&quot; &lt;==&gt; &quot;if x != 0&quot;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    &quot;if x == True&quot;  &lt;==&gt; &quot;if x == 1&quot;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006256/what-is-the-difference-between-if-x-true-and-if-x/58006773#58006773","title":"What is the difference between &quot;if x == True&quot; and &quot;if x:&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11156092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xbYpG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthias Heppner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11156092/matthias-heppner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":71807,"user_id":296974,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0e26cfe3ac75cd582ca200fbc6fa0421?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"glglgl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/296974/glglgl"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":347,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":13,"closed_date":1568893674,"accepted_answer_id":58006312,"answer_count":3,"score":11,"last_activity_date":1568882917,"creation_date":1568879546,"last_edit_date":1568879921,"question_id":58006256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006256","body_markdown":"Hello stackoverflow Community :-)\r\n\r\nI am learning Python at the moment and I don&#39;t understand the &quot;True/False&quot; concept entirely.\r\n\r\nIn Python the number 0 is associated to &quot;False&quot; and 1 to &quot;True&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhen I write following code\r\n\r\n    x = 2\r\n    y = 1\r\n\t\r\n    if y == True:\r\n        print(&quot;Y is True&quot;)\r\n    if x == True:\r\n        print(&quot;X is True&quot;)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;X is False&quot;)\r\n\r\nI get &quot;Y is True&quot;, because the &quot;1&quot; is truthy.

I don&#39;t think that there are better way that just direct measurement of how long `exec` runs.\r\n\r\n2. Profiler is the only way (`valgrind`). However, profiler will influence performance (it will decrease it drammatically). While process is still running, you can check its memory usage via following command:\r\n\r\n    `grep VmPeak /proc/$PID/status`\r\n\r\nPrecision will be very bad, and for quick process similar to `echo` you can even have no time to run this shell command. \r\n\r\n3. Check exit codes (from `g++` and `./code`) to check for errors. It is guaranteed for `g++`, about custom program, it may have custom logic and use its own protocol to report error, but generally if the `./code` follows common practice, it must set exit code to nonzero on error.\r\n\r\nHowever, generally speaking, there are not guaranteed way to understand whether the program runs correctly, because &quot;correctly&quot; is about semantics and not about pure coding. &quot;Correctly&quot; is how the software author wants it to work. If software author thinks that the software must exit with specific code, he can do it independently from any internal errors.\r\n\r\nSee this code for example:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        int z = 1;\r\n        int y = 1;\r\n        int x = 1 / (z - y);\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt generates &quot;division by zero&quot; exception.\r\n\r\nLets compile and execute it:\r\n\r\n    $ g++ program_1.cpp -o program_1\r\n    $ ./program_1\r\n    Floating point exception (core dumped)\r\n    $ echo $?\r\n    136\r\n\r\nThe program exits with code `136`; the reason is that default division by zero signal handler implemented by C runtime exits with this code.\r\n\r\nIf we add our own signal handler, the exit code will still be `0`:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\r\n    \r\n    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;signal.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    void signal_handler (int signo) \r\n    {\r\n        if(signo == SIGFPE) \r\n            exit(0);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        signal(SIGFPE,(*signal_handler));\r\n        int z = 1;\r\n        int y = 1;\r\n        int x = 1 / (z - y);\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, when you run completely unknown external code, it is near impossible to understand what does it really do; it is how viruses work for example, they behave in different way than you expect.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006242/how-to-get-execution-time-and-memory-usage-of-a-program-c-c-java-python-php/58006437#58006437","title":"How to get execution time and memory usage of a program (c,c++,java,python,php) in php script on ubuntu?"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":4579780,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b16a64de932e2dad76a957db7669ed3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Md.
