See (KIP-38)(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-38%3A+ZooKeeper+Authentication)\r\n\r\nIn Kafka + Zookeeper deployments with default settings, Zookeeper essentially applies no noteworthy protection mechanisms. Any rogue actor who can connect to a Zookeeper instance (e.g. after penetrating the so-called isolated network) can change Kafka metadata stored in Zookeeper at will, such as creating new Kafka users and elevating permissions.\r\n\r\nWith the **zookeeper.set.acl=true** setting, Kafka will automatically apply ACLs to all the Znodes it creates (for clusters, topics, offsets, etc.) so that its Znodes are protected from unauthenticated and unauthorized access = more defense in depth. \r\n\r\n**Important**: These ACLs are Znode ACLs (a Zookeeper concept) and not the same as the Kafka ACLs that can be applied to clusters, topics, and the like. The *zookeeper-shell.sh* example below shows the subnodes of */config* and the ACL set on the */config/users* Znode. Only the *kafka* identity has full control, *world* has no access whatsoever:\r\n```\r\nls /config\r\n   [changes, clients, brokers, users, topics]\r\ngetAcl /config/users\r\n   &#39;sasl,&#39;kafka\r\n   : cdrwa\r\n```\r\n\r\nKafka will only set ACLs on Znodes for one account, which is typically named *kafka*. Certain Kafka administration tasks, such as adding Kafka users with SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication (kafka-configs.sh tool), cannot be done through Kafka brokers but require direct interaction between the CLI tool and Zookeeper.\r\n\r\nAnd this finally gets me to the problem that I am facing: Because Znode ACLs automatically set by Kafka brokers are only set for the *kafka* identity, it is not possible to perform Zookeeper CLI operations using any other identity, such a *superuser* identity.\r\n\r\n**Question**: Does anybody know how to make Kafka set Znode ACLs for more than just the *kafka* identity? Specifically, I would also like the *superuser* identity to be able to make modifications directly in Zookeeper.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122879/kafka-set-acls-for-multiple-users-when-zookeeper-set-acl-true","title":"Kafka: Set ACLs for multiple users when zookeeper.set.acl=true?"},{"tags":["python","pandas","google-bigquery"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1080,"user_id":11206202,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-B5wYhU6eUcU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/erhKjsowEiA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yun Zhang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11206202/yun-zhang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523763,"post_id":58122877,"comment_id":102634614,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122877/get-json-format-for-google-bigquery-data-using-pandas-python#comment102634614_58122877"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":123,"user_id":6714205,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/728ea0924e8c21ddc87ec9c312ebc269?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bradchattergoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6714205/bradchattergoon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569532861,"post_id":58123027,"comment_id":102638195,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122877/get-json-format-for-google-bigquery-data-using-pandas-python/58123027#comment102638195_58123027"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":627,"user_id":983302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cb6d25c076c3c95005dacf4633ffcca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user983302","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/983302/user983302"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569523762,"creation_date":1569523762,"answer_id":58123027,"question_id":58122877,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58123027","body_markdown":"Just add `.to_json(orient=&#39;records&#39;)` call after converting to dataframe:\r\n\r\n    json_data = bqclient.query(query_string).result().to_dataframe(bqstorage_client=bqstorageclient).to_json(orient=&#39;records&#39;)\r\n\r\n[pandas docs][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122877/get-json-format-for-google-bigquery-data-using-pandas-python/58123027#58123027","title":"Get JSON format for Google BigQuery Data using Pandas/Python"}],"owner":{"reputation":123,"user_id":6714205,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/728ea0924e8c21ddc87ec9c312ebc269?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bradchattergoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6714205/bradchattergoon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58123027,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569523762,"creation_date":1569522968,"question_id":58122877,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122877","body_markdown":"I am trying to query Google BigQuery using the Pandas/Python client interface.

engine to the tdsqlengine parameter to override the default DBAPI and dialect combination.\r\n    \r\n        temp_database_name:\r\n            Optional Argument.\r\n            Specifies the temporary database name where temporary tables, views will be created.\r\n            Types: str\r\n\r\n```\r\nBefore running the following example make sure the database specified in temp_database_name argument exists and corresponding user has execute access to function with grant option and select access on the input table with grant option. This can be achieve by running:\r\n```\r\ngrant execute function on &lt;function name&gt; to &lt;user&gt; with grant option;\r\ngrant select on &lt;input table&gt; to &lt;temp db user&gt; with grant option;\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nimport teradataml\r\nfrom teradataml.context.context import *\r\nfrom teradataml.dataframe.dataframe import DataFrame\r\nfrom teradataml.analytics.mle.XGBoost

is a saying in computer science by *David Wheeler* that &quot;*All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection (except too many layers of indirection)*&quot;.\r\n\r\nWe thus can define a class `Temperature` for example to store the temperature:\r\n\r\n    from enum import Enum\r\n    from decimal import Decimal\r\n    NINE_FIFTHS = Decimal(9)/Decimal(5)\r\n    \r\n    class TemperatureUnit(Enum):\r\n        KELVIN = (1,0, &#39;K&#39;)\r\n        FAHRENHEIT = (NINE_FIFTHS, Decimal(&#39;-459.67&#39;), &#39;&#176;F&#39;)\r\n        CELSIUS = (1, Decimal(&#39;-273.15&#39;), &#39;&#176;C&#39;)\r\n        RANKINE = (NINE_FIFTHS, 0, &#39;&#176;R&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    class Temperature:\r\n        \r\n        def __init__(self, kelvin, unit=TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS):\r\n            self.kelvin = Decimal(kelvin)\r\n            self.unit = unit\r\n        \r\n        @staticmethod\r\n        def from_unit(value, unit=TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS):\r\n            a, b, *__ = unit.value\r\n            return Temperature((value-b)/a, unit)\r\n        \r\n        @property\r\n        def value(self):\r\n            a, b, *__ = self.unit.value\r\n            return a * self.kelvin + b\r\n        \r\n        def convert(self, unit):\r\n            return Temperature(self.kelvin, unit)\r\n        \r\n        def __str__(self):\r\n            return &#39;{} {}&#39;.format(self.value, self.unit.value[2])\r\n\r\nFor example we can here create tempratures:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(Temperature(15, unit=TemperatureUnit.FAHRENHEIT))\r\n    &#39;-432.67 &#176;F&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(Temperature(0, unit=TemperatureUnit.FAHRENHEIT))\r\n    &#39;-459.67 &#176;F&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(Temperature(1, unit=TemperatureUnit.FAHRENHEIT))\r\n    &#39;-457.87 &#176;F&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(Temperature(0, unit=TemperatureUnit.FAHRENHEIT))\r\n    &#39;-459.67 &#176;F&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(Temperature(0, unit=TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS))\r\n    &#39;-273.15 &#176;C&#39;\r\n\r\nNow we can make a Django model field that stores and retrieves `Temperature`s, by saving these for example in a decimal on the database side, in Kelvin:\r\n\r\n    class TemperatureField(models.DecimalField):\r\n    \r\n        def from_db_value(self, value):\r\n            kelvin = super().from_db_value(value)\r\n            if kelvin is not None:\r\n                return Temperature(kelvin)\r\n            return None\r\n    \r\n        def to_python(self, value):\r\n            if isinstance(value, Temperature):\r\n                return value\r\n            if value is None:\r\n                return value\r\n            kelvin = super().to_python(value)\r\n            return Temperature(kelvin)\r\n    \r\n        def get_prep_value(self, value):\r\n            if isinstance(value, Temperature):\r\n                value = value.kelvin\r\n            return

See the [documentation on writing custom model fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-model-fields/) for more information. You can add a form field, widget, lookups to query the database, etc. So you can define an extra layer of logic to your `TemperatureField`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122830/django-how-to-call-a-method-from-a-custom-field-given-a-model-instance/58124263#58124263","title":"Django how to call a method from a custom field given a model instance?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3504,"user_id":10746224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25bb2589e5ce6b9bd2c2fa2d81961c95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caleb Goodman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10746224/caleb-goodman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3504,"user_id":10746224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25bb2589e5ce6b9bd2c2fa2d81961c95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caleb Goodman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10746224/caleb-goodman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569545539,"last_edit_date":1569545539,"creation_date":1569545044,"answer_id":58126374,"question_id":58122830,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58126374","body_markdown":"Here is a slightly modified, working version of WillemVanOnsem&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/58124263/10746224&quot;&gt;wonderful answer&lt;/a&gt;:\r\n\r\n    class TemperatureField(models.DecimalField):\r\n    \r\n        def from_db_value(self, value, expression, connection):\r\n            if value is not None:\r\n                return Temperature(value)\r\n            return None\r\n    \r\n        def to_python(self, value):\r\n            if isinstance(value, Temperature):\r\n                return value\r\n            if value is None:\r\n                return value\r\n            kelvin = super().to_python(value)\r\n            return Temperature(kelvin)\r\n    \r\n        def get_prep_value(self, value):\r\n            if isinstance(value, Temperature):\r\n                value = value.kelvin\r\n            return super().get_prep_value(value)\r\n    \r\n        def get_db_prep_save(self, value, connection):\r\n            if isinstance(value, Temperature):\r\n                return connection.ops.adapt_decimalfield_value(value.kelvin, self.max_digits, self.decimal_places)\r\n            elif isinstance(value, (float, int)):\r\n                return connection.ops.adapt_decimalfield_value(Decimal(value), self.max_digits, self.decimal_places)\r\n            elif isinstance(value, (Decimal,)):\r\n                return connection.ops.adapt_decimalfield_value(Decimal(value), self.max_digits, self.decimal_places)\r\n\r\n    Test(models.Model):\r\n        temp = TemperatureField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n\r\nIn order to save custom field types to your DB, you have to override `get_db_prep_value`, so that your model knows how to handle `Temperature` objects, otherwise, your model will think it&#39;s working with a `Decimal`, which will result in:\r\n&gt;AttributeError: &#39;Temperature&#39; object has no attribute &#39;quantize&#39;\r\n\r\nClear error with an easy fix...\r\n\r\nNow, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-model-fields/#converting-values-to-python-objects&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; on `from_db_value`:\r\n&gt;If present for the field subclass, from_db_value() will be called in all circumstances when the data is loaded from the database, including in aggregates and values() calls.\r\n\r\nemphasis on **when the data is loaded from the database**!  \r\n\r\nThis means that when you call `t = Test.objects.create(...)`, `from_db_value` will not be evaluated, and the corresponding custom column for the `t` instance will be equal to whatever value you set it to in the `create` statement!\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t = Test.objects.create(temp=1)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t.temp\r\n    1\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;type(t.temp)\r\n    &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t = Test.objects.first()\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t.temp\r\n    &lt;extra_fields.fields.Temperature object at 0x10e733e50&gt;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(t.temp)\r\n    &lt;class &#39;extra_fields.fields.Temperature&#39;&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you tried to run the original version of `from_db_value`:\r\n\r\n    def from_db_value(self, value):\r\n        kelvin = super().from_db_value(value)\r\n        if kelvin is not None:\r\n            return Temperature(kelvin)\r\n        return None\r\n\r\nYou won&#39;t even get errors until you call:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t = Test.objects.get(...)\r\n    TypeError: from_db_value() takes 2 positional arguments but 4 were given\r\n    AttributeError: &#39;super&#39; object has no attribute &#39;from_db_value&#39;\r\n\r\nLastly, **note** that `from_db_value` is not a method in any of Django&#39;s base model fields, so calling `super().from_db_value` will always throw an error.

It seems Django&#39;s ORM magically transforms an instance of a field class into a value.  I&#39;ve spent hours digging through source code and can&#39;t seem to find where the transformation takes place.\r\n\r\nTLDR;\r\n\r\nIs it possible to return an instance of a field class given a model instance?\r\n\r\nAny idea where this happens in Django&#39;s source code?  I assume this takes place in `django/db/models/base.py`, but that file is over 1800 lines of code, so it&#39;s really hard to tell.\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n-\r\nHere is a practical example of why this would be useful:\r\n\r\n    class TempField(models.DecimalField):\r\n        def __init__(self, initial_unit=&#39;C&#39;, **kwargs):\r\n            self.initial_unit = initial_unit\r\n            self.units = [&#39;F&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;K&#39;]\r\n    \r\n        def convert(self, unit):\r\n            if self.initial_unit == unit:\r\n                return self.value\r\n            \r\n            if unit not in self.units:\r\n                raise\r\n    \r\n            attr = getattr(self, f&#39;_{initial_unit}_to_{unit}&#39;, None)\r\n            if attr is None:\r\n                raise\r\n    \r\n            return attr(unit)\r\n    \r\n            def _C_to_F(self, unit):\r\n                ...\r\n             \r\n\r\nNow you can conveniently convert this field to the desired unit:\r\n\r\n    class Test(models.Model):\r\n        temperature = TempField(...)\r\n    \r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t = Test.objects.create(temperature=100)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t.temperature\r\n    100\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;t.temperature.convert(&#39;F&#39;)\r\n    212\r\n\r\nThis is all just untested pseudo code.  Also, I can think of several ways of having this functionality without the headache of using custom fields in this manner; so this question is really about understanding how Django&#39;s ORM works, and not necessarily how to solve any real world problems.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122830/django-how-to-call-a-method-from-a-custom-field-given-a-model-instance","title":"Django how to call a method from a custom field given a model instance?"},{"tags":["kubernetes","google-cloud-platform","escaping","google-cloud-run"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25251,"user_id":8016720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Is3Wi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Hanley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8016720/john-hanley"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569535288,"post_id":58122828,"comment_id":102638857,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122828/cloudrun-debug-authentication-error-from-curl#comment102638857_58122828"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3065,"user_id":2409793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QDLY9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pkaramol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2409793/pkaramol"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569562154,"post_id":58127852,"comment_id":102643904,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122828/cloudrun-debug-authentication-error-from-curl/58127852#comment102643904_58127852"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3020,"user_id":481649,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AoETz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/481649/steren"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569558178,"creation_date":1569558178,"answer_id":58127852,"question_id":58122828,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58127852","body_markdown":"In your Job, `gcloud auth print-identity-token` likely does not return any tocken.\r\nThe reason is that locally, gcloud uses your identity to mint a token, but in a Job, you are not logged into gcloud.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122828/cloudrun-debug-authentication-error-from-curl/58127852#58127852","title":"CloudRun: Debug authentication error from curl"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3065,"user_id":2409793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QDLY9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pkaramol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2409793/pkaramol"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569562272,"post_id":58128117,"comment_id":102643953,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122828/cloudrun-debug-authentication-error-from-curl/58128117#comment102643953_58128117"},{"owner":{"reputation":3199,"user_id":11372593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FQBr5NRaPHA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABb0/XuGqOq18jyg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"guillaume blaquiere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11372593/guillaume-blaquiere"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3065,"user_id":2409793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QDLY9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pkaramol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2409793/pkaramol"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569695005,"post_id":58128117,"comment_id":102682287,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122828/cloudrun-debug-authentication-error-from-curl/58128117#comment102682287_58128117"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3199,"user_id":11372593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FQBr5NRaPHA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABb0/XuGqOq18jyg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"guillaume blaquiere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11372593/guillaume-blaquiere"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3199,"user_id":11372593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FQBr5NRaPHA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABb0/XuGqOq18jyg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"guillaume blaquiere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11372593/guillaume-blaquiere"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569695015,"last_edit_date":1569695015,"creation_date":1569560354,"answer_id":58128117,"question_id":58122828,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58128117","body_markdown":"In your job you use this container `google/cloud-sdk` which is a from scratch installation of `gcloud` tooling.

Here is an example I put together with my suggestions to what you&#39;ve provided. You can further optimize it by adding classes to each `&lt;td&gt;` which would allow you to remove `first()` and target the elements individually.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(function() {\r\n      $(&quot;table&quot;).click(function(event) {\r\n        event.stopPropagation();\r\n        var $target = $(event.target.parentNode);\r\n    \t\r\n        $target.children().first().find(&#39;i&#39;)\r\n        .toggleClass(&quot;fa-envelope fa-envelope-open&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        $target.next().find(&quot;.message-body-body&quot;).slideToggle();\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    table {\r\n      border-collapse: collapse;\r\n    }\r\n    th, td {\r\n      border: 1px solid #000;\r\n    }\r\n    th {\r\n    background-color: #ccc;\r\n    }\r\n    .message-row {\r\n      cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n    .message-body-body {\r\n      padding: 20px;\r\n      background-color: #f5f5f5;\r\n      /* prevents element from flashes when page is loaded */\r\n      display: none;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;link href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;table&gt;\r\n      &lt;tr class=&#39;message-body&#39;&gt;\r\n        &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\r\n        &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;\r\n        &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;\r\n        &lt;th&gt;To&lt;/th&gt;\r\n        &lt;th&gt;From&lt;/th&gt;\r\n        &lt;th&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;tr class=&quot;message-row&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;i class=&#39;far fa-envelope message-icon&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;09/26/2019&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;Message #1&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;someone@demo.com&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;someone@demo.com&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;id&quot; value=&quot;20&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;button class=&quot;rem-button&quot;&gt; Delete&lt;/button&gt;\r\n            &lt;/form&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;tr colspan=&#39;6&#39;&gt;\r\n        &lt;td class=&#39;message-body-body&#39; colspan=&#39;6&#39;&gt;\r\n          This is the message body #1\r\n        &lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;tr class=&quot;message-row&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;i class=&#39;far fa-envelope message-icon&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;09/26/2019&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;Message #2&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;someone@demo.com&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;someone@demo.com&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;td&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;id&quot; value=&quot;20&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;button class=&quot;rem-button&quot;&gt; Delete&lt;/button&gt;\r\n            &lt;/form&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;tr colspan=&#39;6&#39;&gt;\r\n        &lt;td class=&#39;message-body-body&#39; colspan=&#39;6&#39;&gt;\r\n          This is the message body #2\r\n        &lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122824/jquery-find-to-get-icon-i-class/58123964#58123964","title":"Jquery find() to get Icon &lt;i&gt; Class"}],"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":10297365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/726a3323c7736d5b52a06a674d8fd648?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FamousAv8er","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10297365/famousav8er"},"last_editor":{"reputation":199,"user_id":10297365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/726a3323c7736d5b52a06a674d8fd648?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FamousAv8er","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10297365/famousav8er"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":79,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58123964,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569567507,"creation_date":1569522738,"last_edit_date":1569527437,"question_id":58122824,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122824","body_markdown":"I am very new to jquery and haven&#39;t been able to find a solution for my problem.

I&#39;d appreciate if someone can help me with.\r\n\r\n1. My understanding is that the `Precise Throughput Timer` under `ForEach controller` in `Thread Group` schedules the POST requests to be sent so that the desired throughput is achieved. However, I am confused because the `POST request` is in a loop, which I expect that the a request in the next iteration can only be sent if the request in the current iteration is finished, i.e. getting back a response. If the current request is taking a long time to finish, does it mean it changes the time the next request is sent and thus affects the throughput? Or is the next request being sent without waiting for the current request to finish to ensure the defined schedule (made by the `Precise Throughput Timer`) is maintained?\r\n\r\n2. I need to save the resource ID returned from the POST request (if the POST request is successful) to a variable to a list and later in the `Teardown Thread Group` I can loop through these IDs. I could not find yet any list type variable in JMeter that allows me to do that.

So in case it helps, here is my stored procedure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIF  EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N&#39;[REDACTED].[CreateOrEditQuote]&#39;) AND type in (N&#39;P&#39;, N&#39;PC&#39;))\r\nDROP PROCEDURE [REDACTED].[CreateOrEditQuote]\r\nGO\r\n\r\nSET ANSI_NULLS ON\r\nGO\r\n\r\nSET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON\r\nGO\r\n\r\nCREATE procedure [REDACTED].[CreateOrEditQuote]\r\n(\r\n\t@QuoteRequestID int,\r\n\t@Amount money\r\n)\r\nas\r\nbegin\r\n\tdeclare @qid int\r\n\tselect @qid = QuoteID from QuoteRequest where ID = @QuoteRequestID\r\n\tif @qid is null\r\n\tbegin\r\n\t\t-- quote does not exist, create it\r\n\t\tinsert into quote (Amount) values (@Amount)\r\n\t\tselect @qid = @@IDENTITY\r\n\tend\r\n\telse\r\n\tbegin\r\n\t\t-- quote exists, edit it\r\n\t\tupdate quote set Amount = @Amount where ID = @qid\r\n\tend\r\n\tupdate QuoteRequest set QuoteID = @qid where ID = @QuoteRequestID\r\n\tselect @qid as QuoteID\r\nend\r\nGO\r\n```\r\n\r\nWeird thing is, if I run the stored procedure manually though SQL Server Management Studio, it runs, but if I do it through my web app (calling the code I shared at the top of my post) it crashes...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122798/there-is-already-an-open-datareader-associated-with-this-command-which-must-be","title":"&quot;There is already an open DataReader associated with this command which must be closed first.&quot; - but where?"},{"tags":["javascript","object-literal"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4421,"user_id":8376184,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U6TIU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FZs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8376184/fzs"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569523262,"post_id":58122797,"comment_id":102634417,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122797/javascript-issue-with-code-developing-a-credit-card-schedule#comment102634417_58122797"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":158,"user_id":12081978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0c2ddc88c910a43f9a8156752c46c49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"protestator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081978/protestator"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569523325,"creation_date":1569523325,"answer_id":58122938,"question_id":58122797,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58122938","body_markdown":"Your code is really buggy.

can get the user arguments and their values that are passed into _your_ subclass, as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass():\r\n    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2=2):\r\n        self.arg1 = arg1\r\n        self.arg2 = arg2\r\n        self.user_args = dict([(key,val) for key,val in locals().items() \r\n                                       if key!=&#39;self&#39; and

can:\r\n```python\r\nprint(user_class.some_object.user_args)\r\n# {&#39;arg1&#39;: 5, &#39;arg2&#39;: 10}\r\n```\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nIf you seek to also get the `UserClass` arguments, that&#39;s vastly more involved, if even reliably possible; a major complication is, `MyClass` is passed to `UserClass` as an argument, rather than _inherited_ - meaning, `MyClass` is first instantiated, then set as an attribute to `UserClass`. In other words, as far as `MyClass` is concerned, `UserClass` doesn&#39;t exist. \r\n\r\nOne way I see to get `UserClass` args without inheritance is, decompile the `pycache` generated during runtime, which can be accessed from within `MyClass` via `globals()` - but it won&#39;t be easy.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122776/how-to-get-argument-values-used-in-function/58149649#58149649","title":"How to get argument values used in function"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":8705375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5dd4621a72de763ca326d6d37262c2c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xela","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8705375/xela"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":8705375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5dd4621a72de763ca326d6d37262c2c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xela","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8705375/xela"},"comment_count":19,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569699053,"creation_date":1569522558,"last_edit_date":1569615192,"question_id":58122776,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122776","body_markdown":"I have a superclass (defined in a framework).

I have an Apache2 server (v2.4.25) running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, and it serves a page to the host computer that the Pi is connected to. Prior to my updating this project, it was being run on a Pi 2, which was running an older version of Apache that still used the httpd.conf file, so the configuration options are a little different, so attempting to run the older page on the newer server causes some unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that one of the Python scripts in the cgi-bin directory generates a page and puts it in the cgi-bin directory, and when I try to run the older version of the website on the Pi 3 (with the newer version of Apache), it interprets redirects to this page as an attempt to execute it as a script, but because it is not a CGI script and does not have execute permissions, I get an internal server error. To be clear, this was not the case on the Pi 2 -- when redirecting to this page on the Pi 2, it would simply go to that page and it worked just fine.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried adding a handler to the Pi 3&#39;s conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf file to only consider .sh and .py files as scripts, giving me this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;IfModule mod_alias.c&gt;\r\n        &lt;IfModule mod_cgi.c&gt;\r\n            Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN\r\n        &lt;/IfModule&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;IfModule mod_cgid.c&gt;\r\n            Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN\r\n        &lt;/IfModule&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN&gt;\r\n            ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin/\r\n            &lt;Directory &quot;/var/www/cgi-bin&quot;&gt;\r\n                AllowOverride None\r\n                Options +ExecCGI\r\n                AddHandler cgi-script .sh .py\r\n            &lt;/Directory&gt;\r\n        &lt;/IfDefine&gt;\r\n    &lt;/IfModule&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, this change didn&#39;t correct this behavior and I continue to get the same permissions error.\r\n\r\nI would simply move this page out of the cgi-bin directory, but this would present compatibility issues with older builds of the server which are still being used if they were to be installed on the Pi 3.\r\n\r\nAm I missing an option somewhere to have the Apache server not consider HTML files that are inside the cgi-bin directory to be scripts? Or will it always consider any file in that directory to be a script and try to execute it when I redirect to it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122766/ignoring-html-files-in-cgi-bin-directory-for-redirects","title":"Ignoring HTML files in CGI-BIN directory for redirects"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pandas","scikit-learn"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":50106,"user_id":198536,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9edaf4c1c1b89b5d39c40528d0017509?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"wallyk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/198536/wallyk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523413,"post_id":58122764,"comment_id":102634481,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122764/my-fitted-model-is-too-large-to-be-uploaded-to-github-despite-the-dataset-not-be#comment102634481_58122764"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9561154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tPDfL5YjREw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEeQ/6Yu4wwMQ_Cg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Scott M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9561154/scott-m"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":50106,"user_id":198536,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9edaf4c1c1b89b5d39c40528d0017509?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"wallyk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/198536/wallyk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523539,"post_id":58122764,"comment_id":102634533,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122764/my-fitted-model-is-too-large-to-be-uploaded-to-github-despite-the-dataset-not-be#comment102634533_58122764"},{"owner":{"reputation":50106,"user_id":198536,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9edaf4c1c1b89b5d39c40528d0017509?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"wallyk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/198536/wallyk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569527246,"post_id":58122764,"comment_id":102636143,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122764/my-fitted-model-is-too-large-to-be-uploaded-to-github-despite-the-dataset-not-be#comment102636143_58122764"},{"owner":{"reputation":2158,"user_id":4553309,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5517d1e4c6e16084e1b8155365e03d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shihab Shahriar Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4553309/shihab-shahriar-khan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569604239,"post_id":58122764,"comment_id":102664150,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122764/my-fitted-model-is-too-large-to-be-uploaded-to-github-despite-the-dataset-not-be#comment102664150_58122764"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9561154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tPDfL5YjREw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEeQ/6Yu4wwMQ_Cg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Scott M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9561154/scott-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523614,"post_id":58122936,"comment_id":102634556,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122764/my-fitted-model-is-too-large-to-be-uploaded-to-github-despite-the-dataset-not-be/58122936#comment102634556_58122936"},{"owner":{"reputation":348,"user_id":10728920,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0192524897b5c8338ab18669f7e2c346?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jamesfranco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10728920/jamesfranco"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9561154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tPDfL5YjREw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEeQ/6Yu4wwMQ_Cg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Scott M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9561154/scott-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523969,"post_id":58122936,"comment_id":102634698,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122764/my-fitted-model-is-too-large-to-be-uploaded-to-github-despite-the-dataset-not-be/58122936#comment102634698_58122936"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":348,"user_id":10728920,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0192524897b5c8338ab18669f7e2c346?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jamesfranco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10728920/jamesfranco"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569523308,"creation_date":1569523308,"answer_id":58122936,"question_id":58122764,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58122936","body_markdown":"Is there a reason you want to use git for this?

are calling `Gender.next()` twice when taking input in for the Gender.  This is making it appear that the program is not doing anything because it is waiting for an extra input.\r\n\r\nYou should only use one variable for the gender and then use an `if` to check what the gender is and do the calculation accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere is what it would look like corrected:\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Mettre votre sexe (Homme or Femme)&quot;);\r\n    String gender = in.next();\r\n    sc = Math.pow(Poids, 0.425) * Math.pow(Taille, 0.725) *0.202;\r\n\tMetH = sc * 24 * 40;\r\n\tMetF = sc * 24 * 35;\r\n\t\t      \r\n\tif (gender.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Homme&quot;)) {\r\n\t    System.out.println(&quot;Le Metabolisme pour un homme est: &quot; + MetH);\r\n\t}\r\n    else if (gender.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Femme&quot;)){\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Le Metabolisme pour une femme est: &quot; +  MetF);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow when a user types `Homme` or `Femme` it will do the correct calculation.  I also removed the extra `Scanner` you used called `Gender`, and just reused the `in` `Scanner`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to _always_ calculate both genders, you do not need to take input for this at all!

This directly addresses the error you are receiving.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122754/how-to-resolve-error-message-discrete-value-supplied-to-continuous-scale-for-d/58123131#58123131","title":"How to resolve error message &quot;Discrete value supplied to continuous scale&quot; for data density plot; Diff function?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12069128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c0fde35f3830a2575a34196c64bb674?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"scarceabundance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12069128/scarceabundance"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24393,"user_id":8245406,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fa3ab438fa0bb4c23c7a436c4f9b217?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rui Barradas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8245406/rui-barradas"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58123131,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569524214,"creation_date":1569522466,"last_edit_date":1569523181,"question_id":58122754,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122754","body_markdown":"I am having some trouble trying to plot a density map for crime in my city.

in the comments section was very instrumental to me solving this. As he mentioned firstly, I am not asking my `format to respond to js` under the `else` condition of the create method. So this is what I did:\r\n\r\n\r\n**controller create action**\r\n\r\nAdd the line below to the `else` condition of the create action:\r\n\r\n&gt; format.js { render :new }\r\n\r\nSo my controller action becomes:\r\n\r\n    def create\r\n        @clock_entry = current_user.clock_entries.new(clock_entry_params)\r\n        @clock_entry.set_time_in\r\n    \r\n        respond_to do |format|\r\n          if @clock_entry.save\r\n            format.html { redirect_to @clock_entry, notice: &#39;Clock entry was successfully created.&#39; }\r\n            format.js { redirect_to root_path, notice: &#39;Clock entry was successfully created.&#39; }\r\n            format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @clock_entry }\r\n          else\r\n            format.js { render :new } # Added this...\r\n            format.html { render :new }\r\n            format.json { render json: @clock_entry.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }\r\n          end\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n\r\n\r\n**new.js.erb file**\r\n\r\n\r\nThen in the `new.js.erb` file, upon rendering the `:new` form, you need to remove or hide what is already there and append a new form that has the error message. So I had to remove the whole form by supplying the `form tag to be hidden` in my `new.js.erb`. So I add this line below to my `new.js.erb` file:\r\n\r\n&gt; $(&#39;#new-clock-entry form&#39;).hide().parent().append(&quot;&lt;%= j render &#39;form&#39;, clock_entry: @clock_entry %&gt;&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo new `new.js.erb` file now becomes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;#new-clock-entry a&#39;).hide().parent().append(&quot;&lt;%= j render &#39;form&#39;, clock_entry: @clock_entry %&gt;&quot;)\r\n    $(&#39;#new-clock-entry form&#39;).hide().parent().append(&quot;&lt;%= j render &#39;form&#39;, clock_entry: @clock_entry %&gt;&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this should be handy to anyone who runs into the same problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122741/validation-errors-not-showing-after-i-ajax-a-rails-form/58129904#58129904","title":"Validation errors not showing after I ajax a rails form"}],"owner":{"reputation":960,"user_id":5614748,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153324566173505/picture?type=large","display_name":"Afolabi Olaoluwa Akinwumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5614748/afolabi-olaoluwa-akinwumi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":960,"user_id":5614748,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153324566173505/picture?type=large","display_name":"Afolabi Olaoluwa Akinwumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5614748/afolabi-olaoluwa-akinwumi"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58129904,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569571008,"creation_date":1569522418,"last_edit_date":1569567359,"question_id":58122741,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122741","body_markdown":"I am using ajax-rails to render my form and validations stopped working.

By convention, all those packages are named with an identifying prefix, for example foo-package. These packages may depend on public packages available on PyPi. Let&#39;s assume there&#39;s no risk of having a package in PyPi with the same name. By using --index-url together with --extra-index-url, I can make pip search on both. This will happen every single time.\r\n\r\nEven when pip finds a package on PyPi, it will still try to find it also on the extra url.

is alot of improvements you can make with this code.

The db is running fine and I can retrieve other stuff from it, but the problem is comparing the two strings. \r\n    \r\n    Session[&quot;searchFor&quot;]=&quot;Central&quot;;\r\n    Session[&quot;adress&quot;]=null;\r\n    var db = new Models.DB();\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Models.Station&gt; allStations = db.Station.ToList();\r\n    foreach (Station station in allStations)\r\n    {\r\n        if(String.Compare(Session[&quot;searchFor&quot;].toString(), station.name) == 0)\r\n        {\r\n            Session[&quot;adress&quot;]=station.adress;\r\n            break;\r\n        } \r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have tried every possible compare to method I have found online, but nothing seems to be working. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy DB class looks like this:\r\n\r\n    public class Station\r\n        {\r\n            [Key]\r\n            public int id { get; set; }\r\n            public string name { get; set; }\r\n            public string adress { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe page that write it out looks like this.\r\n\r\n    From station: @Session[&quot;searchFor&quot;] &lt;br /&gt;\r\n    From station adress: @Session[&quot;adress&quot;] &lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd the result,\r\n[enter image description here][1]\r\n the session has not been given a value by the function.

To avoid letting clients modify those collections you can either each time return copy of them in getter for instance via `return new ArrayList(manufactureSet);` or you can make that collection immutable and then return it like\r\n\r\n    private static Set&lt;Manufacture&gt; manufacturers = Collections.unmodifiableSet(\r\n            Stream.of(values()).map(MyEnum::getManufacture).collect(Collectors.toSet())\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    public static Set&lt;String&gt; getManufacturers() {\r\n        return manufacturers;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122721/get-all-data-out-from-enum-type/58122803#58122803","title":"Get all data out from enum type"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2144,"user_id":5699679,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f95f2952c81f5b82524208fe4c1fef65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Avi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5699679/avi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569522836,"post_id":58122818,"comment_id":102634209,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122721/get-all-data-out-from-enum-type/58122818#comment102634209_58122818"},{"owner":{"reputation":10818,"user_id":636009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIQJV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Conrad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/636009/david-conrad"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2144,"user_id":5699679,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f95f2952c81f5b82524208fe4c1fef65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Avi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5699679/avi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523175,"post_id":58122818,"comment_id":102634387,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122721/get-all-data-out-from-enum-type/58122818#comment102634387_58122818"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10818,"user_id":636009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIQJV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Conrad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/636009/david-conrad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10818,"user_id":636009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIQJV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Conrad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/636009/david-conrad"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569523157,"last_edit_date":1569523157,"creation_date":1569522714,"answer_id":58122818,"question_id":58122721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58122818","body_markdown":"Set:\r\n\r\n    Arrays.stream(Product.values()).map(Product::getManufacture).collect(Collectors.toSet())\r\n\r\nList:\r\n\r\n    Arrays.stream(Product.values()).map(Product::getManufacture).collect(Collectors.toList())\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122721/get-all-data-out-from-enum-type/58122818#58122818","title":"Get all data out from enum type"}],"owner":{"reputation":15655,"user_id":959734,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44608a8e81f8ca8ee21619d07df32b92?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Leem.fin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/959734/leem-fin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15655,"user_id":959734,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44608a8e81f8ca8ee21619d07df32b92?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Leem.fin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/959734/leem-fin"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58122803,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569524164,"creation_date":1569522363,"last_edit_date":1569522816,"question_id":58122721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122721","body_markdown":"I have an `enum` named `Product`, each item override its abstract method which returns a `Manufacture` instance:\r\n\r\n    public enum Product {\r\n         FOO {\r\n           @Override\r\n           Manufacture getManufacture(){\r\n                return // a instance of Manufacture\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n    \r\n         BAR {\r\n           @Override\r\n           Manufacture getManufacture(){\r\n                return // another instance of Manufacture\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n       \r\n        abstract Manufacture getManufacture();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(`Manufacture` is another class I created, but it is not important to see its details for this question)\r\n\r\nQuestion 1:\r\nIn another class, I want to get a set of manufacture (`Set&lt;Manufactore&gt;`) out from the `Product` enum.

If you are using the GCP console to fetch messages while a subscriber is up and running, it is possible that subscriber got the messages.\r\n3. If you got the message on the console once and then reloaded to get the messages again, you may not see the message again until the ack deadline has passed, which defaults to 10 seconds.\r\n4. A single pull request (which is what the GCP console &quot;View Messages&quot; feature does), may not be sufficient to retrieve the message. If you click on it multiple times or [start up a basic subscriber][1], you will likely see the message.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#receive_messages","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122695/does-recieving-message-id-future-indicate-message-is-sent-in-pubsub/58123157#58123157","title":"Does recieving message id (future) indicate message is sent in PubSub?"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":1063239,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75d439e92f43c184bfaacf37be5e9632?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JD009","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1063239/jd009"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58123157,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569524358,"creation_date":1569522266,"question_id":58122695,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122695","body_markdown":"I am sending messages to google pubsub using a callback function which reads back the message id from the future.

the OP&#39;s permission, let me show here how achieve the same JSON query using a _walk-path_ unix utility [**`jtc`**](https://github.com/ldn-softdev/jtc). However, instead of explaining the _walk-path_, I&#39;ll show how to build it.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the question: validate JSON documents so that if there&#39;s anywhere in the document an entry with the label `Statement ` which contains elements `&quot;Action&quot;: &quot;*&quot;` and `&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;`, then print the whole record containing those elements, otherwise don&#39;t (i.e. leave a blank output)\r\n\r\n1\\. Let&#39;s begin with finding a JSON entry with the label `Statement` recursively (a notation for a recursive search is `&lt;..&gt;`, suffix `l` instructs to search _labels_ only), so it can be anywhere in the JSON document (I&#39;ll be using first JSON example):\r\n```\r\nbash $ &lt;file.json jtc -w&#39;&lt;Statement&gt;l&#39;\r\n[\r\n   {\r\n      &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\r\n   }\r\n]\r\nbash $ \r\n```\r\n\r\n2\\. Once `Statement` record is found, we need to see if there&#39;s a record `&quot;*&quot;` somewhere in the found entry **_attached_** to the label `&quot;Action&quot;` (use a recursive search again but restrict the search only to entries with `Action` label - a.k.a. _scoped search_):\r\n```\r\nbash $ &lt;file.json jtc -w&#39;&lt;Statement&gt;l[Action]:&lt;*&gt;&#39;\r\n&quot;*&quot;\r\nbash $ \r\n```\r\n\r\n3\\. Now we need to see if there&#39;s a sibling (`&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;`) to the found entry. For that let&#39;s step up one level in the JSON tree (a.k.a address a parent):\r\n```\r\nbash $ &lt;file.json jtc -w&#39;&lt;Statement&gt;l[Action]:&lt;*&gt;[-1]&#39;\r\n{\r\n   &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\r\n   &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,\r\n   &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\r\n}\r\nbash $\r\n```\r\nand then use a _non-recursive_ scoped search (a _non-recursive_ search notation is `&gt;..&lt;`):\r\n```\r\nbash $ &lt;file.json jtc -w&#39;&lt;Statement&gt;l[Action]:&lt;*&gt;[-1][Resource]:&gt;*&lt;&#39;\r\n&quot;*&quot;\r\nbash $ \r\n```\r\n\r\n4\\. Finally, to select the record, let&#39;s address again a parent of the last found/walked entry:\r\n```\r\nbash $ &lt;file.json jtc -w&#39;&lt;Statement&gt;l[Action]:&lt;*&gt;[-1][Resource]:&gt;*&lt;[-1]&#39;\r\n{\r\n   &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\r\n   &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,\r\n   &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\r\n}\r\nbash $ \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above _walk-path_ will facilitate required JSON query for all JSON documents (whether `Statement` is nested or not, or whether `Action` and `Resource` records (deeply) enlisted in the array or not - but they must remain siblings).  \r\nIf any of the walk lexemes fails, then the whole output will be blank:\r\n```\r\nbash $ &lt;file.json jtc -w&#39;&lt;Statement&gt;l[Action]:&lt;blah&gt;[-1][Resource]:&gt;*&lt;[-1]&#39; \r\nbash $ \r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, `jtc` is times faster when reading from file (instead of `stdin`), for performance reasons it&#39;s best to use it passing file as an argument:\r\n```\r\njtc -w&#39;&lt;Statement&gt;l[Action]:&lt;*&gt;[-1][Resource]:&gt;*&lt;[-1]&#39; file.json \r\n``` \r\n\r\nPS&gt; I&#39;m the creator of the [**`jtc`**](https://github.com/ldn-softdev/jtc) unix utility for JSON processing\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122691/select-within-either-array-or-object/58130750#58130750","title":"select within either array or

object or an array.\r\n\r\nOf course something like: `jq &#39;.PolicyVersion.Document.Statement[] | select((.Action == &quot;*&quot;) and .Resource == &quot;*&quot;)` works for an array and `jq &#39;.PolicyVersion.Document.Statement | select((.Action == &quot;*&quot;) and .Resource == &quot;*&quot;)` works for when it&#39;s not an array but I&#39;d like to acheive this in one command.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a few things around `select` like:\r\n\r\n`jq &#39;.PolicyVersion.Document | select((.Statement[] | select((.Action == &quot;*&quot;) and .Resource == &quot;*&quot;) or select((.Statement[] | select((.Action == &quot;*&quot;) and .Resource == &quot;*&quot;)&#39;`\r\n\r\nwhich returns nothing, and:\r\n\r\n`jq &#39;.PolicyVersion.Document | select((.Statement[] | select((.Action == &quot;*&quot;) and .Resource == &quot;*&quot;) or select((.Statement | select((.Action == &quot;*&quot;) and .Resource == &quot;*&quot;)&#39;`\r\n\r\nwhich returns a unix shell

I now need to extend float operators (like + - * / ^) to them. Addition, substraction, multiplication and division were easy to implement (I did it in same way as [here](http://eviatarbach.com/2013/05/13/dual-numbers-and-automatic-differentiation/)), however, i ran into problems while working with exponentiation.\r\n\r\nI have DualNumber class implemented like this : \r\n```\r\nclass DualNumber:\r\n    def __init__(self, real, dual):\r\n        self.real = real\r\n        self.dual = dual\r\n\r\n    # definitions of __add__, __sub__, __mul__ etc. ...\r\n  \r\n    def __pow__(self, other):\r\n        if isinstance(other, DualNumber):\r\n            return DualNumber(self.real ** other.real,\r\n                              self.dual * other.real * self.real ** (other.real - 1) + self.real ** other.real * other.dual * log(self.real))\r\n        else:\r\n            return DualNumber(self.real**other,\r\n                              self.dual * other * self.real**(other - 1))\r\n\r\ndef auto_diff(f, x):\r\n    return f(DualNumber(x, 1.)).dual\r\n```\r\nThis only allows for instances of DualNumber to be exponentiated. How can i define output of raising float to instance of DualNumber when there is no \\__rpow__ analogous to reversed variants of other operators ? So that i can perform operations like \r\n```\r\na = DualNumber(1,2)\r\n5 ** a\r\n```\r\n__Note__ : by &quot;float&quot; i mean any representation of real numbers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122630/how-can-i-raise-float-to-instance-of-another-class","title":"How can i raise float to instance of another class?"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7672}
