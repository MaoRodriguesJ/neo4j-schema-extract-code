of all, I am no expert of Shiny and there are many functions I don&#39;t really understand. So please, be patient with me. I found some other topics ([this][1] and [this][2]) discussing the same problem but I am not sure how to apply the solution to mine.\r\n\r\nI got two `selectizeInput()`, one called `Run` and the other `Sample`. I have the function written for `Sample` to be dependent of `Run`. Which means that if I select some inputs from `Run`, it will filter results of `Sample`. Here&#39;s the code below.\r\n\r\n```R\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(shinydashboard)\r\n\r\nget_some_data &lt;- structure(list(Sample = c(&quot;ADAWD&quot;, &quot;23016&quot;, &quot;11384&quot;),\r\n                                Flowcell_Line = c(&quot;1,2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;),\r\n                                Run = c(&quot;Run_399&quot;, &quot;Run_399_auto2&quot;, &quot;Run_399_auto2&quot;),\r\n                                Date = structure(c(1569836460, 1569836460, 1569836460),\r\n                                                 class = c(&quot;POSIXct&quot;, &quot;POSIXt&quot;))), \r\n                           row.names = c(NA, 3L), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;)\r\n\r\nui &lt;- fluidPage(fluidRow(\r\n    box(selectizeInput(&quot;run&quot;, &quot;Run&quot;,\r\n        choices = unique(get_some_data[[&quot;Run&quot;]]),\r\n        multiple = TRUE,\r\n        options = list(placeholder = &quot;Enter a Run ID...&quot;)\r\n    )),\r\n    box(shiny::uiOutput(&quot;ui_sample&quot;))\r\n))\r\n\r\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session)\r\n    ({\r\n        output$ui_sample &lt;- renderUI(if (is.null(input$run)) {\r\n            selectizeInput(\r\n                inputId = &#39;sample&#39;,\r\n                &#39;Sample&#39;,\r\n                choices = unique(get_some_data[[&quot;Sample&quot;]]),\r\n                multiple = TRUE,\r\n                options = list(placeholder = &#39;Enter a Sample ID...&#39;)\r\n            )\r\n        } else {\r\n            selectizeInput(\r\n                inputId = &#39;sample&#39;,\r\n                &#39;Sample&#39;,\r\n                choices = unique(filter(get_some_data, Run %in% input$run)[[&quot;Sample&quot;]]),\r\n                multiple = TRUE,\r\n                options = list(placeholder = &#39;Enter a Sample ID...&#39;)\r\n            )\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n\r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I wish to make it reversible. By that, I mean that if I type something in the `Sample` box, the `Run` box will be filtered. But I am not able to make the inter-dependency because it creates a loop that actualize the inputs. This is what I tried:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nui &lt;- fluidPage(fluidRow(\r\n    box(shiny::uiOutput(&quot;ui_run&quot;)),\r\n    box(shiny::uiOutput(&quot;ui_sample&quot;))\r\n))\r\n```\r\n\r\nand adding to `server`:\r\n```R       \r\n        output$ui_run &lt;- renderUI(\r\n            if (is.null(input$sample)) {\r\n                selectizeInput(\r\n                    inputId = &#39;run&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;Run&#39;,\r\n                    choices = unique(get_some_data[[&quot;Run&quot;]]),\r\n                    multiple = TRUE,\r\n                    options = list(placeholder = &#39;Enter a Run ID...&#39;)\r\n                )\r\n            } else {\r\n                selectizeInput(\r\n                    inputId = &#39;run&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;Run&#39;,\r\n                    choices = unique(filter(\r\n                        get_some_data, Sample %in% input$sample\r\n                    )[[&quot;Run&quot;]]),\r\n                    multiple = TRUE,\r\n                    options = list(placeholder = &#39;Enter a Run ID...&#39;)\r\n                )\r\n            })\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel like there is an important function I am missing that I don&#39;t know about... can you please help me figure it out ?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42436998/three-interdependent-selectinput-in-r-shiny-application\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48209365/shiny-interdependent-filters-values","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235567/two-interdependent-selectizeinput-in-r-shiny","title":"Two Interdependent selectizeInput in R Shiny"},{"tags":["c#","xaml","uwp"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":3133193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aab87f59d2c2610ea23a7f7294e8aebb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Weissu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3133193/weissu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570256610,"creation_date":1570256610,"answer_id":58245903,"question_id":58235566,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58245903","body_markdown":"Solved finally.

seems to cause trouble, but i dont know how to handle this, removing &quot;await&quot; makes me need to click twice to get setState that i want\r\n```\r\nclass AppHeader extends React.Component{\r\n    \r\n    constructor(props){\r\n      super(props);\r\n      this.state={\r\n        tab:&quot;temp&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    handleClick=async (e)=&gt;{\r\n\r\n      e.preventDefault();\r\n      \r\n     await this.setState({tab:e.target.attributes.tab.value});\r\n  \r\n      await this.props.handleData(this.state.tab);\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      //console.log(this.state.tab);\r\n    }\r\n render(){\r\n          return(\r\n              \r\n        &lt;div className=&#39;row&#39;&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div className=&#39;col-md-12&#39;&gt;

or Key-User extensibility** are means provided by the SAP product that enables you to extend the apps. For example one may add a new custom field to the UI which is then saved together with the business object instance. It can even be forwarded to follow-up documents in case of process extensibility. Further options of key-user extensibility are own business objects or business logic modifications in pre-defined extension points.\r\nThis concept applies for cloud software. OnPremise customers have other options to get such kind of enhancements because they have direct access to the code.\r\n\r\n**Side-by-Side extensibility** refers to enhancements that you create on a different platform (e.g. SAP Cloud Platform) but integrate with your SAP product. As an example, you might react on a certain event in your SAP product, notify your own SCP implementation to handle accordingly. Or you have an own app on SCP that writes data back into the SAP product. \r\nThe communication works via public APIs in such cases.\r\n\r\nHere is the reference from SAP which is quite clear end

$SERVICENOW_API_URL?table_name=$SERVICENOW_ATTACHMENT_TABLE_NAME\\&amp;table_sys_id=$SERVICENOW_ATTACHMENT_TABLE_SYS_ID\\&amp;file_name=$UPLOAD_FILE_NAME --request POST --header

&quot;uploadFile=@./blank.txt&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Whenever I upload a file, the uploaded file has the below type of headers added to it. Please make changes in my command to upload the file without this header. \r\n\r\n``` \r\n--------------------------565a353520eb07b1\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;uploadFile&quot;; filename=&quot;blank.txt&quot;\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------565a353520eb07b1--\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

A more\r\n&gt; elaborate definition characterizes AI as &quot;a system&#39;s ability to\r\n&gt; correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use\r\n&gt; those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible\r\n&gt; adaptation.&quot;\r\n\r\nTo take your Rubiks Cube as an example, there would be at least 2 ways you could write the algoritm to solve the puzzle. Firstly, any cube can be solved by following a hardcoded path or set of instructions once you have a certain start position. Implementing this would not be considered AI in my opinion as the machine itself is not learning anything. It just follows a well defined path of instructions till the end.\r\n\r\nA second way to implement this would be to have the program just start solving it randomly. But the machine remembers it&#39;s moves, and learns the most effective path to reach the solution. When solving the next cube, the machine can build upon this newly learned information to solve it faster and again learn from this iteration to improve it&#39;s algorithm.\r\n\r\nSo in short, as far as I&#39;m concerned, it can be considered AI when a machine is capable of optimizing/extending its own algorithms to become more efficient in its tasks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235502/when-does-an-algorithm-become-considered-artificial-intelligence/58235718#58235718","title":"When does an algorithm become considered artificial intelligence?"}],"owner":{"reputation":329,"user_id":7660724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BdjGi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Snuffles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7660724/snuffles"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1570205871,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570189207,"creation_date":1570188324,"question_id":58235502,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235502","body_markdown":"I understand that an algorithm is a set of instructions.

There is one difference however, and that is the way you&#39;re defining your input parameters.\r\n\r\nI see that you are defining your `p_startdate` and `p_end_date` as `NUMBER` parameters.

I have tried using two for loops but would end up get segmentation faults and also I didn&#39;t like how messy it looked. On my second attempt I found a different approach that&#39;s cleaner due to it only using one loop and one condition vs 2 loops and 2 conditions.

much digging, I finally resolved this.\r\n\r\nThe problem was some CSS that was linked to an element some distance further up the DOM tree, and not really relevant to the map. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.local-branch img {\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    width: 25%;\r\n    padding: 0 10px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe intention of this CSS is to lay out a set of images related to the branch. The map is being added later as part of the branch details, within the `.local-branch` element. The styles are obviously not intended to apply to the map, but are applying anyway as the CSS selector is too broad.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll need to find a way to fix it that doesn&#39;t break the existing image layout, which still needs some thought, but at least I&#39;ve worked out what was going on, so the mystery is solved.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235408/leafletjs-rendering-with-squashed-tiles/58235762#58235762","title":"LeafletJS rendering with squashed tiles"}],"owner":{"reputation":145103,"user_id":352765,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f858a5d21c7c306f472ace32d3cc2fda?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Spudley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/352765/spudley"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58235762,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570189343,"creation_date":1570187934,"question_id":58235408,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235408","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using LeafletJS to display maps in a number of places on my site.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it is working fine, but on one specific page I am getting a weird rendering glitch, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n[![LeafletJS rendering glitch: Notice the vertical grey lines][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the map is rendering with vertical grey bars at each tile boundary. Additionally, if I add markers to the map, they also display squashed.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is that I&#39;m using the same code (ie the exact same JS file) to render similar maps on other pages without any problems. I&#39;m also using similar code to render two other maps on the same page, again without problems.\r\n\r\nThe JS code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n(function(L) {\r\n    var element = document.querySelector(&#39;.details-map&#39;);\r\n    if (!element) { return; }\r\n    var coords = element.getAttribute(&#39;data-coords&#39;);\r\n    var latlng = coords.split(&#39;,&#39;);\r\n    var location = {lat: parseFloat(latlng[0]), lng: parseFloat(latlng[1])};\r\n\r\n    var zoom = element.getAttribute(&#39;data-zoom&#39;);\r\n\r\n    var map = new L.Map(element, {center: location, zoom: zoom, gestureHandling: true});\r\n    L.tileLayer(&#39;https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png&#39;, {\r\n        attribution: &#39;&amp;copy; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstreetmap.org&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; contributors&#39;,\r\n    }).addTo(map);\r\n})(L);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the associated HTML looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;details-map&quot; data-coords=&quot;51.5216,-0.71998&quot; data-zoom=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rendering glitch occurs at all zoom levels and persists after the doing things like `map.invalidateSize()` to force a redraw.\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain why I&#39;m getting this glitch and how to fix it?

The problem is the OPTIONS request doesn&#39;t integrate the custom headers.\r\n\r\nHow can I change this ?\r\nThank ou in advance.\r\n\r\n**EDIT** Thanks to @jonrsharpe I know it&#39;s impossible to set custom headers in a preflight request.\r\nHow can I set my htaccess to :\r\n\r\n - Allow OPTIONS all everytime\r\n - Redirect every other method if header is not set\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235406/axios-cors-custom-headers","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Axios CORS custom headers"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","webrtc","turn","collider","apprtc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12163003,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c61a4fc23b3c9fbdd8879347285fb19b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sputnik9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12163003/sputnik9"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570278807,"post_id":58235402,"comment_id":102867437,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235402/webrtc-apprtc-appspot-join-room-500-internal-server-error-google-bigquery#comment102867437_58235402"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12163003,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c61a4fc23b3c9fbdd8879347285fb19b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sputnik9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12163003/sputnik9"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570187903,"creation_date":1570187903,"question_id":58235402,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235402","body_markdown":"https://github.com/webrtc/apprtc\r\n\r\nhttps://appr.tc/\r\n\r\nI need to implement above demo to my AWS EC2 Ubuntu server.\r\n\r\nI have attached some screenshots that might help you to address the solution.\r\n\r\n[starting collider][1]\r\n\r\n[turn server][2]\r\n\r\n[joining room from browser][3]\r\n\r\n[app screen for that room][4]\r\n\r\n[google cloud platform error log][5]\r\n\r\n[AWS EC2 Instance Inbound Rules][6]\r\n\r\nBelow is my /etc/turnserver.config file code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nlistening-port=3478\r\nlistening-ip=XX.XXX.XXX.XX (ie. my aws ec2 instance&#39;s public ip address)\r\nuse-auth-secret\r\nstatic-auth-secret=641eaa0e9dacd772ec8610ba962ed5e5a505795ca2ece640f8920d415eb8XXXX\r\nrelam=north.gov\r\nuser=ninefingers:0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee\r\nno-tls\r\nno-dtls\r\ncert=/etc/turn_server_cert.pem\r\npkey=/etc/turn_server_pkey.pem\r\ncli-port=5766\r\ncli-password=qwerty\r\n```\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPlease guide me on this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6WRWt.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JDYn.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXgor.jpg\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/kLoEB.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGP3N.png\r\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsgzL.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235402/webrtc-apprtc-appspot-join-room-500-internal-server-error-google-bigquery","title":"WebRTC AppRTC - appspot join room - 500 internal server error - google bigquery analytics insertAll api Returnrd Not found Dataset"},{"tags":["swift","arkit","realitykit"],"owner":{"reputation":576,"user_id":4019584,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/519085370/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mostafa Mohamed Raafat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4019584/mostafa-mohamed-raafat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570187882,"creation_date":1570187882,"question_id":58235400,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235400","body_markdown":"So I created a scene in reality composer that has one object (In my case a rocket).
