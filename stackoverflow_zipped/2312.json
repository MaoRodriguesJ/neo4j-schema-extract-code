That is to be able to infer that a car that is of type `Tesla` is no longer of type `Tesla` because it has been modified. As AKSW has pointed out, this cannot happen due to inferencing being monotonic. This roughly means that whatever has been inferred before adding further axioms will still be inferred after adding further axioms. The only way to &quot;loose&quot; inferences is to modify or delete existing axioms in your ontology.\r\n\r\nWhat you **will be able to do** is to define the properties of your `Tesla` class and allow the reasoner to infer that an individual is of type `Tesla`. The following ontology will do just that.\r\n\r\n\tDataProperty: hasSeats\r\n\t\tRange: xsd:integer\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\tDataProperty: hasTopSpeed\r\n\t\tRange: xsd:integer\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\tClass: Car\r\n\t\tEquivalentTo: \r\n\t\t    (hasSeats exactly 1 xsd:integer)\r\n\t\t     and (hasTopSpeed exactly 1 xsd:integer)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\tClass: Tesla\r\n\t\tEquivalentTo: \r\n\t\t    (hasSeats value 5)\r\n\t\t     and (hasTopSpeed value 100)\r\n\t\tSubClassOf: \r\n\t\t    Car\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\tIndividual: aTesla\r\n\t\tFacts:  \r\n\t\t hasSeats  5,\r\n\t\t hasTopSpeed  100\r\n\t\t\r\n\tIndividual: notATesla\r\n\t\tFacts:  \r\n\t\t hasSeats  2,\r\n\t\t hasTopSpeed  80\r\n\r\nThis will infer that the `aTesla` individual is of type `Tesla`, while no such inference will be made for the individual `notATesla`. However, if you create an individual `modifiedTesla` as below, this will result in the reasoner giving an inconsistency. \r\n\r\n    Individual: modifiedTesla\r\n\t    Type: Tesla\r\n\t\tFacts: hasTopSpeed  200 \r\n \r\nThe reason for the inconsistency (for the ontology as above) is because `modifiedTesla` is related twice via the `hasTopSpeed` property: Once for `hasTopSpeed 100` and once for `hasTopSpeed 200`. This is because `hasTopSpeed 200` **does not override** the properties in the `Tesla` class.\r\n\r\nFrom your question you seem to approach this from an object oriented perspective. There are some similarities, but for the most part object orientation and ontologies are worlds apart. I have written about some of the pitfalls that trip people up in this regard [here][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://henrietteharmse.com/2018/04/15/object-oriented-features-that-owl-lacks/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989427/creating-new-instance-values-for-each-member-of-a-class/57996692#57996692","title":"Creating new instance values for each member of a class"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12084081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alessandro Tommasi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084081/alessandro-tommasi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568822145,"creation_date":1568798813,"question_id":57989427,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57989427","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s what I want to do, and couldn&#39;t:\r\n\r\nI am instantiating devices belonging to various classes (models). Let&#39;s say it&#39;s cars. The instantiated cars should inherit &quot;default&quot; attributes depending on the model, but should have each his own. Example of class hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCar\r\n  Tesla\r\n  Honda\r\nProperty\r\n```\r\n&quot;Property&quot; would be a `&lt;key, value&gt;` pair, for example, `&lt;&quot;top_speed&quot;, &quot;100&quot;&gt;`, `&lt;&quot;seats&quot;, 5&gt;`.\r\nI can define default properties for, say, Tesla, creating the instances:\r\n```\r\nteslaPropertySpeed = &lt;&quot;top_speed&quot;, 100&gt;\r\nteslaPropertySeats = &lt;&quot;seats&quot;, 5&gt;\r\n```\r\nand then make all Teslas have the property:\r\n```\r\nTesla SubClassOf ((hasProperty value teslaPropertySpeed) and (hasProperty value teslaPropertySeats))\r\n```\r\n...however, if I buy a Tesla, I might &quot;hack it&quot; to make it go faster or slower, or remove seats. Because I said that all Teslas have that property, it wouldn&#39;t be a Tesla anymore.\r\n\r\nA better way would be saying that all Teslas have THEIR OWN speed and seat properties, which I would like to set to a default, modifiable value.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I would like to create NEW properties for each instantiated Tesla. Can I do that declaratively?

The second object in the array causes chaos (understandably). The Request and Response fields for this object are actually Strings and they contain the JSON code. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to deserialize this properly? I realize that it is a lot to ask from a library to be flexible enough to do this - but I&#39;m just a little stumped at how to use this.\r\n\r\nAll the messages I receive look roughly the same - but specifically the content of the Request and Response objects are different depending on the specific request/response. \r\n\r\nThe guys who built this do not have any sort of Schema or contract in place, other than the fact that they send Json text around and they seem unwilling or unable to change how the Json is created.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny advice will really be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** It seems that the behavior isn&#39;t random. Whether I get a proper object or a string is determined by the attribute:  **&quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Application&quot;**. There are many different &quot;Types&quot; - and some are properly serialized and others not....  Aaarrggghhh!!!!

After adding the datarow, I was calling AcceptChanges() method on data table instead of datarow.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989407/oracle-dataadapter-update-method-inserts-only-one-row-when-updatebatchsize-0","title":"Oracle DataAdapter Update method inserts only one row when updateBatchSize=0"},{"tags":["reactjs","next.js","antd"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":107,"user_id":6436209,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3bbb653f3d9f03c6edafdfe1af131d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karthi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6436209/karthi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568799915,"post_id":57989500,"comment_id":102386972,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989405/how-to-send-data-from-one-component-to-another-in-nextjs/57989500#comment102386972_57989500"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":115,"user_id":12046335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uK8qjEEqoT8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdicKVxDrvCMR0w081mjiJu77kJ0g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"P4uB0rd4","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046335/p4ub0rd4"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568799043,"creation_date":1568799043,"answer_id":57989500,"question_id":57989405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57989500","body_markdown":"You can use ReactRedux to create a store and have it accessible from all components.\r\n\r\nhttps://redux.js.org/api/store [1]\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989405/how-to-send-data-from-one-component-to-another-in-nextjs/57989500#57989500","title":"How to send data from one component to another in nextjs"}],"owner":{"reputation":107,"user_id":6436209,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3bbb653f3d9f03c6edafdfe1af131d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karthi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6436209/karthi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":107,"user_id":6436209,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3bbb653f3d9f03c6edafdfe1af131d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karthi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6436209/karthi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568806676,"creation_date":1568798733,"last_edit_date":1568806676,"question_id":57989405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57989405","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working in nextjs.I have header component and in order to show header in all other pages ,overrided app.js with _app.js .Header has 2 navigation link usersList and users.\r\nNow I want to send data from header component to another page say usersList and users on click of submit in header.How we can achieve that .\r\nI know that we can use context .I&#39;m using class based component don&#39;t  know weather we can use context.\r\nIs there any other solution to this problem..\r\nPlease help \r\n\r\n```\r\nheader.js\r\nclass HeaderComponent extends Component {\r\n onSearch(event){\r\n       //some code\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            &lt;div className=&quot;navbar&quot;&gt;\r\n                \r\n                          &lt;Input id=&quot;search-input&quot;

It is recommended to enable both `word position` and `element word position` indexes.\r\n\r\nOne important difference between above scope queries, and a path index on `e/c1` is that with the path index the `c1` must be a child of `e`, while the scope query only checks for descendants.

You can traverse “relationship paths” using Django’s `__` syntax to filter fields on a related model. ex, `author__last_name`.\r\n\r\nlookup_expr: The field lookup to use when filtering. Django’s `__` syntax can again be used in order to support lookup transforms. ex, `year__gte`. For full list of field lookups you can use see here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups.\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether, the field `field_name` and `lookup_expr` represent a complete Django lookup expression. A detailed explanation of lookup expressions is provided in Django’s lookup reference here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/lookups/#module-django.db.models.lookups.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that in mind here is the answer:\r\n```\r\nimport django_filters\r\nfrom .models import Book, Author\r\n\r\nclass BookFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):\r\n    title = django_filters.CharFilter(field_name=&#39;title&#39;, lookup_expr=&#39;iexact&#39;)\r\n    author = django_filters.CharFilter(field_name=&#39;author__last_name&#39;, lookup_expr=&#39;iexact&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    class Meta():\r\n        model = Book\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to filter by exact date just add to your `BookFilter` class:\r\n```\r\ndate_of_birth = django_filters.DateFilter(field_name=&#39;author__date_of_birth&#39;, lookup_expr=&#39;exact&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever it would make more sense to filter by year of birth (for example to get all the books from authors born between 1980 and 1990). To do that here is what you add to `BookFilter` class:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbirth_year__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter(field_name=&#39;author__date_of_birth&#39;, lookup_expr=&#39;year__gt&#39;)\r\nbirth_year__lt = django_filters.NumberFilter(field_name=&#39;author__date_of_birth&#39;, lookup_expr=&#39;year__lt&#39;)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989320/django-filter-foreignkey-related-model-filtering/57989498#57989498","title":"Django-filter ForeignKey related Model filtering"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12084037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1a3584b92bd35badbd11e503a53c4f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zorka5","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084037/zorka5"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568800056,"post_id":57989572,"comment_id":102387047,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989320/django-filter-foreignkey-related-model-filtering/57989572#comment102387047_57989572"},{"owner":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12084037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1a3584b92bd35badbd11e503a53c4f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zorka5","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084037/zorka5"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568800099,"post_id":57989572,"comment_id":102387068,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989320/django-filter-foreignkey-related-model-filtering/57989572#comment102387068_57989572"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568799248,"creation_date":1568799248,"answer_id":57989572,"question_id":57989320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57989572","body_markdown":"You can take a look at [the document][1] of `django-filter` package.\r\n\r\n&gt; Items in the fields sequence in the Meta class may include “relationship paths” using Django’s __ syntax to filter on fields on a related model.\r\n\r\nLike so:\r\n\r\n    import django_filters\r\n    from .models import Book, Author\r\n\r\n    class BookFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):\r\n        class Meta():\r\n            model = Book\r\n            fields = [&#39;title&#39;, &#39;author__first_name&#39;, &#39;author__last_name&#39;]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/usage.html#generating-filters-with-meta-fields","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989320/django-filter-foreignkey-related-model-filtering/57989572#57989572","title":"Django-filter ForeignKey related Model filtering"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12084037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1a3584b92bd35badbd11e503a53c4f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zorka5","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084037/zorka5"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57989498,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568800132,"creation_date":1568798486,"question_id":57989320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57989320","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been struggling with dajngo-filter recently.

An [ephemeral port](https://pubs.vmware.com/view-50/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.view.installation.doc%2FGUID-0E9C03E8-D85F-4325-908B-9CD390EC21E9.html) is a short-lived endpoint that is created by the operating system when a program requests any available user port. The operating system selects the port number from a predefined range, typically between 1024 and 65535, and releases the port after the related TCP connection terminates.\r\n\r\nBy default, the system can create a maximum of approximately 4,000 ephemeral ports that run concurrently on Windows Server 2003 and approximately 16,000 on Windows Server 2008.\r\n\r\n&gt;You can find a detailed discussion in [How do I protect the ports that chromedriver use?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55442679/how-do-i-protect-the-ports-that-chromedriver-use/55450099#55450099)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue in details\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- As per @visionscaper&#39;s [comment](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues/1630#issuecomment-256922339) on _Windows_ systems you need to **remove** / **comment out** the following type of entries from **`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts`** file:\r\n\r\n\t\t127.0.0.1 my-site.local\r\n\t\t192.168.100.48 localhost\r\n\t\t\r\n- As per @DavidGDD&#39;s [comment](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues/1630#issuecomment-304682673) on _Linux_ systems in `PortProber.java` and `LinuxEphemeralPortRangeDetector.java` there is a case in `createAcceptablePort` in which is always returning the same port, not random.\r\n - When you have defined in the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range` the port range as `1024-65535`, the method always returns **1024**.\r\n - When you change your range defined in the file to `1025-65535` (or any other range) it will work returning random ports.\r\n- @tflori [mentions](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues/1630#issuecomment-442857566) from [Selenium](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54459701/what-is-selenium-and-what-is-webdriver/54482491#54482491) point of view:\r\n - [LinuxEphemeralPortRangeDetector.java](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/net/LinuxEphemeralPortRangeDetector.java#L49) had more than one space between the two ports. So the result was `[1025, , , , 65535]` then `Integer.parseInt(split[1]);` throws and the default is used which leads to the same issue we had without modifying the lower port.\r\n - [PortProber.java](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/net/PortProber.java#L88) we were geting the highest and lowest ports from the platform and then we overwrite one or the other 1024 or 65535.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n--------\r\nThis [merge](https://github.com/softagram/selenium/pull/1) solves the port negotiation problem on linux and other platforms. The removed code leads to the result that FIRST_PORT and LAST_PORT is both set to 1024 which always returns 1024. In fact we should trust the ephemeral ports reports by the detector. With the min and max we just assure a valid port range. So you need to ensure that:\r\n\r\n- _JDK_ is upgraded to  current levels [JDK 8u222](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).\r\n- _Selenium_ is upgraded to  current levels [Version 3.141.59](https://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/).\r\n- _ChromeDriver_ is updated to  current [ChromeDriver v77.0](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=77.0.3865.40/) level.\r\n- _Chrome_ is updated to  current _Chrome Version 77.0_ level. (as per [ChromeDriver v77.0 release notes](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/77.0.3865.40/notes.txt))\r\n- _Clean_ your _Project Workspace_ through your _IDE_ and _Rebuild_ your project with required dependencies only.\r\n- If your base _Web Client_ version is too old, then uninstall it and install a recent GA and released version of _Web Client_.\r\n- Take a _System Reboot_.\r\n- Execute your `@Test` as **non-root** user.\r\n- Always invoke `driver.quit()` within `tearDown(){}` method to close &amp; destroy the _WebDriver_ and _Web Client_ instances gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989305/is-there-any-way-to-solve-java-lang-runtimeexception-unable-to-find-a-free-por/57996046#57996046","title":"Is

If the user is going to do a task and there&#39;s nobody in the waitlist, it is allowed to do it (it is joined into the waitlist with the status of &quot;doing the task&quot; and redirected in the app to the action screen. But if the user is going to to a task and there are someone in the waitlist it is joined with the status of &quot;waiting&quot;. When his turn comes, the backend sends a notification trough Firebase Cloud Messaging for him to do the task and set him in the waitlist as &quot;doing the task&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that users has time limits to accept his turn in the waitlist, so everytime a user is notified i have to wait for 60 seconds.

What am I missing and how does the high precedence of the subscript operator express itself?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989262/subscript-operator-precedence","title":"Subscript operator precedence"},{"tags":["typo3","phpstorm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":116935,"user_id":783119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4bbfd3e5e9f8b698abf7cd1c7aae7a10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LazyOne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/783119/lazyone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568801008,"post_id":57989259,"comment_id":102387596,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989259/typo3-querybuilder-how-to-let-phpstorm-recognise-methods#comment102387596_57989259"},{"owner":{"reputation":1248,"user_id":2444812,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTvnq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sybille Peters - on strike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2444812/sybille-peters-on-strike"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":116935,"user_id":783119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4bbfd3e5e9f8b698abf7cd1c7aae7a10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LazyOne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/783119/lazyone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568836481,"post_id":57989259,"comment_id":102405664,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989259/typo3-querybuilder-how-to-let-phpstorm-recognise-methods#comment102405664_57989259"},{"owner":{"reputation":116935,"user_id":783119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4bbfd3e5e9f8b698abf7cd1c7aae7a10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LazyOne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/783119/lazyone"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1248,"user_id":2444812,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTvnq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sybille Peters - on strike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2444812/sybille-peters-on-strike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568898845,"post_id":57989259,"comment_id":102427890,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989259/typo3-querybuilder-how-to-let-phpstorm-recognise-methods#comment102427890_57989259"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":206,"user_id":6003035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/446158f7f8d615ac89cc95e05cf36a40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jack70","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6003035/jack70"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568798943,"post_id":57989409,"comment_id":102386401,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989259/typo3-querybuilder-how-to-let-phpstorm-recognise-methods/57989409#comment102386401_57989409"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1876,"user_id":10052668,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/b5Z0w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rudy Gnodde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10052668/rudy-gnodde"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568798742,"creation_date":1568798742,"answer_id":57989409,"question_id":57989259,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57989409","body_markdown":"PhpStorm doesn&#39;t automatically know what class `$connectionPool` is and so can&#39;t know what class everything derived from that is.

You can create a PHP project which includes your entire web root (typically &quot;public&quot; folder), but excludes directories like filadmin, uploads, typo3temp etc. It is important to exclude these directories so PhpStorm does not unnecessarily scan them. (In particular if you run the core functional tests this is very much recommended.) I find this is the most practical approach and also useful for debugging and core development\r\n 2. You can create a PhpStorm project for your extension and include your TYPO3 source as well. Don&#39;t know about this off the top of my head, but should be possible.\r\n\r\nOnce you do this and PhpStorm scanned your files, it should be possible to do any of the following:\r\n\r\n* Auto-expand class and function names\r\n* Add use statements automatically (see [PhpStorm help][1] for more)\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nSee also DynamicReturnType plugin and [other plugins recommended for TYPO3 core development][2]. The DynamicReturnType plugin along with the file [dynamicReturnTypeMeta.json][3] shipped with the core should give PhpStorm enough information for return type of classes instantiated with makeInstance

&quot;ezJen&quot;]\r\n\r\nIf &lt;code&gt;this.state.name&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; containing multiple names with new line (&lt;code&gt;\\n&lt;/code&gt;) delimiters in it, then you can first extract an array of names from the string and then use the above code, for example:\r\n\r\n    var names = &quot;menez\\nasJenas\\nbenez\\ndestruction\\npresent\\nJenosus\\nezJen&quot;\r\n    \r\n    const namesArray = names.split(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    const nameMatch = namesArray.filter((word) =&gt; { \r\n      return !(word.startsWith(&quot;Jen&quot;) || word.endsWith(&quot;ez&quot;));\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    console.log(nameMatch);\r\n    // expected output: Array [&quot;asJenas&quot;, &quot;destruction&quot;, &quot;present&quot;, &quot;ezJen&quot;]\r\n\r\nIf &lt;code&gt;this.state.name&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; containing a single name, then you can use the following function, which will return true if the name does not start with &quot;Jen&quot; or end with &quot;ez&quot;:\r\n\r\n    const nameMatch = (name) =&gt; {\r\n    \treturn !(name.startsWith(&quot;Jen&quot;) || name.endsWith(&quot;ez&quot;));\r\n    };\r\n\r\nYou can use it like so:\r\n\r\n    const nameMatch = (name) =&gt; {\r\n    \treturn !(name.startsWith(&quot;Jen&quot;) || name.endsWith(&quot;ez&quot;));\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    var names = &quot;Ben&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    if (nameMatch(names)) {\r\n    \tconsole.log(&quot;This name matched&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    // expected output: &quot;This name matched&quot;\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that where I have used &lt;code&gt;names&lt;/code&gt;, you will need to swap it to &lt;code&gt;this.state.name&lt;/code&gt;.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989255/condition-assign-to-const-variable/57990102#57990102","title":"condition assign to const

your question still is very broad I guess I got now what you want. This will probably not be exactly the solution you want since your question is quite vague but it should give you a good idea and starting point for implementing it in the way you need it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI can just assume Unity UI here is the setup I would use. Since it is quite complex I hope this image will help to understand\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nso what do we have here:\r\n\r\n - `Canvas` \r\n  - has the `RowController` script attached. Here reference the row prefab and adjust how many rows shall be added\r\n - `Panel` is the only child of `Canvas`. I just used it as a wrapper for having a custom padding etc - it&#39;s optional\r\n\r\n - FixedRowPanel\r\n  - Here we will add the fixed rows on runtime\r\n  - Initially has a height of **0**!\r\n  - Uses anchore pivot **Y = 1**! This is later important for changing the height on runtime\r\n  - Uses a `Vertical Layout Group` for automatically arranging added children\r\n\r\n - `ScrollView` - Your scrollview as you had it **but**\r\n  - Uses streched layout to fill the entire `Panel` (except later the reduced space for the fixed rows)\r\n  - Uses anchor pivot **Y = 1**! Again important for changing the height and position on runtime later\r\n\r\n - `Viewport` afaik it should already use streched anchors by default but not sure so make it\r\n\r\n - `Content`\r\n  - Uses a `Vertical Layout Group`\r\n  - Initially has a height of **0** (but I set this in the code anyway) and will grow and shrink accordingly when adding and removing rows\r\n\r\n - And finally `RowPrefab`\r\n  - I didn&#39;t add its hierachy in detail but it should be clear. It has a Toggle and a Text as childs ;)\r\n  - Has the `Row` script attached we use for storing and getting some infos\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow to the scripts - I tried to comment everything\r\n\r\nThe **Row.cs** is quite simple\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language-all: lang-c# --&gt;\r\n\r\n    public class Row : MonoBehaviour\r\n    {\r\n        // Reference these via the Inspector\r\n        public Toggle FixToggle;\r\n        public Text FixTogText;\r\n        public Text RowText;\r\n        public RectTransform RectTransform;\r\n    \r\n        // Will be set by RowController when instantiating\r\n        public int RowIndex;\r\n    \r\n        private void Awake()\r\n        {\r\n            if (!RectTransform) RectTransform = GetComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();\r\n            if (!FixToggle) FixToggle = GetComponentInChildren&lt;Toggle&gt;(true);\r\n            if (!FixTogText) FixTogText = FixToggle.GetComponentInChildren&lt;Text&gt;(true);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd here is the **RowController.cs**\r\n\r\n    public class RowController : MonoBehaviour\r\n    {\r\n        public Row RowPrefab;\r\n    \r\n        public RectTransform ScrollView;\r\n        public RectTransform Content;\r\n        public RectTransform FixedRowParent;\r\n    \r\n        public int HowManyRows = 24;\r\n    \r\n        public List&lt;Row&gt;

the second method call ```find``` which will filter by ```Task``` to get desribale effect. As a side note, Factory contains two fields: ```Optional&lt;List&lt;Employees&gt;&gt;``` and ```String``` which is a name of factory. \r\nI will be grateful for a suggestion on how to solve a problem.

have my website set to a foreign language so that when Cypress clicks on the contact button or any button with href tag on my website, it should have sent me to the foreign version of that page but instead, it sends me to the english one. I cannot replicate this when I try to do it by hand.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m testing my website, salaenrollment.com, to make sure that if I switch the language on the website to a foreign language, it doesn&#39;t switch back when I click around to the contact and such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    cy.visit(&#39;https://salaenrollment.com/&#39;)\r\n\r\n    cy.contains(&#39;ភាសាខ្មែរ&#39;).click()\r\n      .url().should(&#39;include&#39;, &#39;/kh&#39;)\r\n\r\n    cy.contains(&#39;ទំនាក់ទំនង&#39;).should(&#39;have.attr&#39;, &#39;href&#39;, &#39;/kh/contact&#39;)\r\n      .click()\r\n\r\n\r\nEverytime I test it with cypress, the language always switches but when I try to replicate it manually, I can never get it to switch. I wrote the code on cypress as simple as possible and I manually set wait times in the code but nothing works. About 90% of the time, when I test with cypress, the language doesn&#39;t switch. There is nothing wrong with the website and there are no errors.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen is that cypress will enter the website, change the language, click on the contact button and the contact page will be in the foreign language. The cypress test should match a manual test.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989184/cypress-loads-wrong-page-after-click","title":"Cypress loads wrong page after click"},{"tags":["angular","typescript","npm","npm-start"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":709,"user_id":8810941,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9xic.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pavindu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8810941/pavindu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569401422,"post_id":57989179,"comment_id":102581495,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989179/object-prototype-may-only-be-an-object-or-null-undefined-typeerror-object-prot#comment102581495_57989179"}],"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":10532751,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2162101957392423/picture?type=large","display_name":"Udith Indrakantha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10532751/udith-indrakantha"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":102,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568798083,"creation_date":1568798083,"question_id":57989179,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57989179","body_markdown":"I&#39;m very new to angular.

In your case, this runs (quotes added)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-sh --&gt;\r\n\r\n    bash -c &quot;/opt/app/wait-for-it-and-start.sh&quot; &quot;$$MONGO_HOST:$$MONGO_PORT&quot;\r\n\r\nIf you look at [the bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Invoking-Bash.html), the first parameter after the text to evaluate is taken as the implicit `$0` parameter that normally holds the name of the script, which is why it&#39;s getting swallowed here.\r\n\r\nThe easiest mechanical change is to just remove the `sh -c` wrapper.  (You almost never need it, unless you need things like redirection or command chaining, and if you do, the plain-string form of _e.g._ `CMD` will insert it for you.)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-sh --&gt;\r\n\r\n    ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/opt/app/wait-for-it-and-start.sh&quot;]\r\n\r\nI suspect you&#39;re counting on the shell to expand the environment variables for you here.  It&#39;s hard to make that happen with this sequence (there&#39;s nowhere you can actually insert the `sh -c` wrapper that works).

As soon as I put the `*.jar` in the deployment folder or when I launch the app first time?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989139/deployment-of-maven-project-to-jboss-noob-question","title":"Deployment of Maven project to JBoss - noob question"},{"tags":["webcam","video-capture","ms-media-foundation","uvc"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":5345480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y___1o_mqfQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGKE/5X0erZPzhAk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jerry Zhang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5345480/jerry-zhang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568963612,"post_id":58017352,"comment_id":102449560,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989137/how-to-use-the-h-264-uvc-1-5-camera-encoders-in-windows-media-foundation/58017352#comment102449560_58017352"},{"owner":{"reputation":769,"user_id":5110855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93f29bdd015d8a9b204efd66fb798c72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mofo77","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5110855/mofo77"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":36,"user_id":5345480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y___1o_mqfQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGKE/5X0erZPzhAk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jerry Zhang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5345480/jerry-zhang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569004456,"post_id":58017352,"comment_id":102469311,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989137/how-to-use-the-h-264-uvc-1-5-camera-encoders-in-windows-media-foundation/58017352#comment102469311_58017352"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":769,"user_id":5110855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93f29bdd015d8a9b204efd66fb798c72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mofo77","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5110855/mofo77"},"last_editor":{"reputation":769,"user_id":5110855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93f29bdd015d8a9b204efd66fb798c72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mofo77","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5110855/mofo77"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568919745,"last_edit_date":1568919745,"creation_date":1568919107,"answer_id":58017352,"question_id":57989137,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58017352","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t check by myself, but if you have succeeded with IMFSourceReader, try to use it :\r\n\r\n- Call IMFSourceReader::GetServiceForStream with MF_SOURCE_READER_FIRST_VIDEO_STREAM to get IMFTransform : [GetServiceForStream][1]\r\n- Than QueryInterface for ICodecAPI with IMFTransform like you do.\r\n\r\nPS : perhaps you need to do this before or after setting MediaType.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/mfreadwrite/nf-mfreadwrite-imfsourcereader-getserviceforstream","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989137/how-to-use-the-h-264-uvc-1-5-camera-encoders-in-windows-media-foundation/58017352#58017352","title":"How to use the &quot;H.264 UVC 1.5 camera encoders&quot; in Windows Media Foundation"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":5345480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y___1o_mqfQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGKE/5X0erZPzhAk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jerry Zhang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5345480/jerry-zhang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568963974,"creation_date":1568963974,"answer_id":58023572,"question_id":57989137,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023572","body_markdown":"I have figure out the solution.
