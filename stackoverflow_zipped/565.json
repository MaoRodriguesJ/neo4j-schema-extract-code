to create colour filter based on RGB ratio of pixels in an image using python?\r\n\r\nI am a beginner in python and have some problems in creating colour filtering for my image.\r\n\r\nI am trying to detect blue objects in an RGB image using opencv (python).\r\nI could filter most of the blue objects in image but my codes couldn&#39;t filter blue objects with low intensity; my code:\r\n\r\n    #b=img1[:,:,0]\r\n    #img1[:,:,1]=0\r\n    #img1[:,:,2]=0\r\n    #b[b&lt;220]=0\r\n\r\nthere are some pixels out of ROI that have higher intensity resulted from light scattering; so when I decrease threshold to keep low intensity pixels in ROI, many other unwanted pixels with higher intensity remain in my output image.\r\nSo, I am trying to work with RGB ratios of those pixels but my codes are not working!

Know the reason of the current issue - for some reason the imports from shared project (as in here https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) are not loaded (despite that they are working in other modules and tsconfig.json is the same with other modules). no particular error, just this `npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR! errno 1`.\r\n\r\n**Question:**\r\n\r\nHowever the main question of this topic is not the solution of the particularly this problem, but how to debug this kind of import problems where all available log is basically `npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR! errno 1`. I am facing this kind of issues periodically and every time it takes a lot of time to resolve since the only way to debug i know about is to comment chunks of code which might be associated with the possibly failed imports and sometimes this process could take hours.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406005/debugging-npm-err-code-elifecycle-npm-err-errno-1","title":"debugging npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR! errno 1"},{"tags":["vue.js","memory"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":9306467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oWfb478OLTE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAYR4/YbqP3u4ejKc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zubaer Haque","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9306467/zubaer-haque"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571208991,"post_id":58406002,"comment_id":103158858,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406002/handling-big-images-with-vuejs3-0#comment103158858_58406002"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":973310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7da75b53018ab27f68ec2700ceca21bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user973310","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/973310/user973310"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":157,"user_id":9306467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oWfb478OLTE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAYR4/YbqP3u4ejKc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zubaer Haque","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9306467/zubaer-haque"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571296008,"post_id":58406002,"comment_id":103194851,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406002/handling-big-images-with-vuejs3-0#comment103194851_58406002"},{"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":9306467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oWfb478OLTE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAYR4/YbqP3u4ejKc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zubaer Haque","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9306467/zubaer-haque"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571297759,"post_id":58406002,"comment_id":103195748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406002/handling-big-images-with-vuejs3-0#comment103195748_58406002"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":973310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7da75b53018ab27f68ec2700ceca21bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user973310","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/973310/user973310"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":157,"user_id":9306467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oWfb478OLTE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAYR4/YbqP3u4ejKc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zubaer Haque","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9306467/zubaer-haque"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571302340,"post_id":58406002,"comment_id":103198148,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406002/handling-big-images-with-vuejs3-0#comment103198148_58406002"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":973310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7da75b53018ab27f68ec2700ceca21bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user973310","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/973310/user973310"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571201805,"creation_date":1571201805,"question_id":58406002,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58406002","body_markdown":"I want to use VueJs for displaying large format image display for the technical people in a specialised domain.

Likewise, aesthetic mappings (the things inside `aes`) that apply to all geoms can also be put in the in main ggplot call, rather than repeating them in each geom. The only mapping that needs to be in `geom_point` alone is `size=TB` because you don&#39;t want the line width to change for different levels of `TB`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gck7I.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58405971/r-breaking-linetype-rule-at-axis-line/58406690#58406690","title":"R breaking linetype rule at axis line"}],"owner":{"reputation":950,"user_id":1476075,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGQTc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Teererai Marange","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1476075/teererai-marange"},"last_editor":{"reputation":950,"user_id":1476075,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGQTc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Teererai Marange","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1476075/teererai-marange"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58406690,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571289933,"creation_date":1571201500,"last_edit_date":1571273501,"question_id":58405971,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58405971","body_markdown":"I am trying to plot 2 variables using different linetypes based on a column called TB in my dataframe.

Of course, you should create the index.\r\n\r\nThe most direct answer to your alternate questions that lie within your question is &quot;no&quot;. There is no function or sub query or view or other &quot;read&quot; action you can make to get a list of the batches for a given CorpID. You NEED to access the corpID data to do that... all your sample queries do not work because, at some point, they NEED to access the CorpIDs to know which rows to gather for BatchIDs. Any summary or &quot;rollup&quot; function that might exist would still NEED to access all the pages of data to &quot;see&quot; them. The reading of the pages cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nWithout changes to your architecture, it&#39;s not physically possible to optimize your query further.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some changes, you could have some options (but Id guess they are much uglier than just adding the index). For instance, you could modify the structure of your BatchID to include data for both the BatchID and the CorpID. Something like &quot;8888899999999&quot;... the 9&#39;s are the batchID and the 8&#39;s are the CorpID. This doesn&#39;t win you much though, you&#39;re not saving any index space, but at least you dont have to index the CorpID field :) Somethings like this could be done, but I wont share any others. I dont want the really experienced people here to see this stuff and get ill. :)\r\n\r\nYou need an index on CorpID if you want to improve performance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58405953/if-a-table-has-an-unindexed-column-with-a-1-to-many-relationship-to-an-indexed-c/58417633#58417633","title":"If a table has an unindexed column with a 1 to many relationship to an indexed column, how to optimize a query for the unindexed column?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":2180079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H8v0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reza Yousefi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2180079/reza-yousefi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2253,"user_id":8898324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0f76695dba2a7806ef75c62822c9200?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TomC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8898324/tomc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571423498,"post_id":58428325,"comment_id":103249911,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58405953/if-a-table-has-an-unindexed-column-with-a-1-to-many-relationship-to-an-indexed-c/58428325#comment103249911_58428325"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":2180079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H8v0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reza Yousefi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2180079/reza-yousefi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571301465,"creation_date":1571301465,"answer_id":58428325,"question_id":58405953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58428325","body_markdown":"Part 01=&gt;\r\n\r\n    /*01Create DB*/\r\n    IF DB_ID(&#39;Test01&#39;)&gt;0\r\n    BEGIN\r\n    \tALTER DATABASE Test01 SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE\r\n    \tDROP DATABASE Test01\r\n    END\r\n    GO\r\n    CREATE DATABASE Test01\r\n    GO\r\n    USE Test01\r\n    Go\r\n\r\nPart 02=&gt;\r\n\r\n    /*02Create table*/\r\n    CREATE TABLE Table01(\r\n    \tID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,\r\n    \tTitle NVARCHAR(100),\r\n    \tCreationDate DATETIME,\r\n    \tCorporationID INT ,\r\n    \tMyID INT ,\r\n    \t[GuidId1] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,\r\n    \t[GuidId2] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,\r\n    \t[Code] [nvarchar](50) NULL\r\n    )\r\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Table01] ADD  DEFAULT (GETDATE()) FOR [CreationDate]\r\n    GO\r\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Table01] ADD  DEFAULT (NEWSEQUENTIALID()) FOR [GuidId1]\r\n    GO\r\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Table01] ADD  DEFAULT (NEWID()) FOR [GuidId2]\r\n    GO\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE Table02(\r\n    \tID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,\r\n    \tTitle NVARCHAR(100),\r\n    \tCreationDate DATETIME,\r\n    \tCorporationID INT ,\r\n    \tMyID INT ,\r\n    \t[GuidId1] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,\r\n    \t[GuidId2] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,\r\n    \t[Code] [nvarchar](50) NULL\r\n    )\r\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Table02] ADD  DEFAULT (GETDATE()) FOR [CreationDate]\r\n    GO\r\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Table02] ADD  DEFAULT (NEWSEQUENTIALID()) FOR [GuidId1]\r\n    GO\r\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Table02] ADD  DEFAULT (NEWID()) FOR [GuidId2]\r\n    GO\r\n\r\nPart 03=&gt;\r\n\r\n    /*03Add Data*/\r\n    DECLARE @I INT = 1\r\n    WHILE @I &lt;

The first is a truthy value, the second is a falsy value.\r\n\r\nYou understand that `find(16, &quot;(((1 + 5) + 5) + 5)&quot;)` returns `null` and so the other part of the `||`-expression is evaluated, i.e. `find(33, &quot;(((1 + 5) + 5) * 3)&quot;)`. \r\n\r\nJust like the left part of `||` can return `null`, so also the right part of it can return `null`. In that case that whole expression returns `null` to the &quot;parent&quot; call, which also was made from such an `||` expression. \r\n\r\nAnd so you really get the same thing happening there, but one level higher in the recursion tree. The above was happening when at that higher level `find(11, &quot;((1 + 5) + 5)&quot;)` was executing. It eventually returned `null || null`, i.e. `null`, and so then (at that higher level) it goes to the other side of its own `||` expression and evaluates `find(18, &quot;((1 + 5) * 3)&quot;)`. That also returns `null` (immediately this time). And so we again have `null || null`, and backtrack (that&#39;s the word!) to yet a higher level in the recursion tree.\r\n\r\n# The &quot;Parent&quot;\r\n\r\nRecursion means that – while the function is executing – a new call of the same function is made. I call the *parent* the function&#39;s execution that made the recursive call and which is waiting for that call to come back with a return value. \r\n\r\nThat *child* may also become *parent* of yet a more nested, *grandchild* call. So you have a stack of unfinished function executions. When the deepest of those returns a value, the one &quot;above&quot; it will &quot;wake up&quot; and receive that value: it can then continue and make another child call and a similar scenario repeats. If it has no more such calls to make, it will return a value to its *parent* (backtracking), which was all the time waiting for a recursive call to come back with a value.\r\n\r\nImagine this whole recursive process as a stack. When some code calls this function, the caller&#39;s *execution context* is pushed on a stack, and the execution continues with executing the function. This execution context holds everything the initiating code needs to proceed from the point where it makes the function call. It has variables with their values, the exact place in the code where it made the function call, the parameters it passed to that function call, ...etc.\r\n\r\nThen the function may call itself, so again its *own* execution context is pushed on the stack (the &quot;call stack&quot;), and so the stack may grow. But at some point the function will return a value, and the stack unwinds: the previous execution context is restored, and that *parent* will continue executing from where it made the recursive call. Execution ends when this call stack is emptied.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58405946/recursive-function-returning-null/58406050#58406050","title":"Recursive Function: returning null"}],"owner":{"reputation":931,"user_id":6024090,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a7d401eff80d1cb2834790eee0514e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"J.

When you log in to your dashboard, this sets up the cookies correctly for you, so plugin and theme developers need only to have a logged-in user.\r\n\r\nHowever, the REST API includes a technique called nonces to avoid CSRF issues. This prevents other sites from forcing you to perform actions without explicitly intending to do so. This requires slightly special handling for the API.\r\n\r\nFor developers using the built-in Javascript API, this is handled automatically for you. This is the recommended way to use the API for plugins and themes. Custom data models can extend wp.api.models.Base to ensure this is sent correctly for any custom requests.\r\n\r\nFor developers making manual Ajax requests, the nonce will need to be passed with each request. The API uses nonces with the action set to wp_rest. These can then be passed to the API via the _wpnonce data parameter (either POST data or in the query for GET requests), or via the X-WP-Nonce header. If no nonce is provided the API will set the current user to 0, turning the request into an unauthenticated request, even if you’re logged into WordPress.\r\n\r\nNote: Until recently, most software had spotty support for DELETE requests. For instance, PHP doesn’t transform the request body of a DELETE request into a super global. As such, supplying the nonce as a header is the most reliable approach.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that this authentication method relies on WordPress cookies. As a result this method is only applicable when the REST API is used inside of WordPress and the current user is logged in. In addition, the current user must have the appropriate capability to perform the action being performed.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this is how the built-in Javascript client creates the nonce:\r\n\r\n````\r\n&lt;?php\r\nwp_localize_script( &#39;wp-api&#39;, &#39;wpApiSettings&#39;, array(\r\n    &#39;root&#39; =&gt; esc_url_raw( rest_url() ),\r\n    &#39;nonce&#39; =&gt; wp_create_nonce( &#39;wp_rest&#39; )\r\n) );\r\nThis is then used in the base model:\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\noptions.beforeSend = function(xhr) {\r\n    xhr.setRequestHeader(&#39;X-WP-Nonce&#39;, wpApiSettings.nonce);\r\n \r\n    if (beforeSend) {\r\n        return beforeSend.apply(this, arguments);\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n````\r\nHere is an example of editing the title of a post, using jQuery AJAX:\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n$.ajax( {\r\n    url: wpApiSettings.root + &#39;wp/v2/posts/1&#39;,\r\n    method: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n    beforeSend: function ( xhr ) {\r\n        xhr.setRequestHeader( &#39;X-WP-Nonce&#39;, wpApiSettings.nonce );\r\n    },\r\n    data:{\r\n        &#39;title&#39; : &#39;Hello Moon&#39;\r\n    }\r\n} ).done( function ( response ) {\r\n    console.log( response );\r\n} );\r\n\r\n````\r\nNote that you do not need to verify that the nonce is valid inside your custom end point. This is automatically done for you in\r\nrest_cookie_check_errors()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58405915/api-integration-in-wordpress-to-pass-login-details-to-app/58406528#58406528","title":"API integration in WordPress to pass login details to app"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12224136,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCapOYOTMsCBQtOTBScaJob3BwrHkBu5I9848xC=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Rajalakshmi R Nair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12224136/rajalakshmi-r-nair"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571217475,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571205034,"creation_date":1571201118,"question_id":58405915,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58405915","body_markdown":"I have created a website using WordPress.

to the *Network* tab (that of *Inspect-Element*), those ComboBoxes don&#39;t use any *AJAX* and they simply work with pure *JavaScript*.\r\n\r\nBased on [another answer][1]; What you are looking for is called data binding and there are a lot of libraries and stuff that will provide it for you.\r\n\r\nI will assume you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about and I&#39;ll just explain to you what the basic idea is.\r\n\r\nYou have a set of data, in your case prices. \r\n\r\n    var prices = [\r\n      1500,\r\n      2000,\r\n      342\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nThen you have your object of currency rates\r\n\r\n    var rates = {\r\n      USD: 1, // obviously\r\n      EUR: 0.86\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow every time the currency is changed you recalculate the price and update every occurrence.\r\n\r\n    function updatePrices(rate) {\r\n      var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;price&quot;);\r\n    \r\n      prices.forEach((price, index) =&gt; {\r\n        elements[index].innerHTML = price * rate\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    document.getElementById(&quot;selector&quot;).onchange = function() {\r\n      updatePrices(rates[this.value]);\r\n    }\r\n \r\nAnd call it initially as well.\r\n\r\n    updatePrices(rates.USD);\r\n\r\nNow obviously this is a very dumb way to bind your data, using array indexes and class names, but that&#39;s the basic idea behind it.\r\n\r\nAs to the currency signs, it is generally a bad idea to include them as very few currencies actually have them but the idea is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel:
