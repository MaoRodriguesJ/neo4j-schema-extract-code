In your case, the *target* is the label, while the *property* is the [pos](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#pos-prop) QProperty.\r\n\r\nRemember some important things:\r\n\r\n- if a widget is added to a layout, you cannot move it (in the example below I&#39;m using an &quot;animator container&quot; widget, which contains the object that you&#39;re going to animate);\r\n- only [**properties**](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/properties.html) of QObjects (and their descendants, including QWidgets) can be used; this means that you can&#39;t use a QPropertyAnimation on an object that&#39;s not a subclass of QObject;\r\n- if you want to animate any other property that&#39;s not provided by the object, you can &quot;create&quot; a new one with `object.setProperty(&#39;propertyName&#39;, value)`, or use the [`QtCore.pyqtProperty` decorator](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/qt_properties.html);\r\n- be very careful with hardcoded positions, if the widget that contains the animation can change its size, you&#39;ll face some problems for sure (that&#39;s why I used a fixed size in my example)\r\n- [QGraphicsScene](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qgraphicsscene.html) (and its visualization widget [QGraphicsView](doc.qt.io/qt-5/qgraphicsview.html)) is usually a better solution for animations like those you seem you&#39;re interested in, since they provide an advanced animation framework which, amongst other things, helps solving scale issues and mouse/keyboard interaction; unfortunately they require some advanced skills and patience to be understood and mastered.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom PyQt5 import QtCore, QtWidgets\r\n\r\nclass AnimationArea(QtWidgets.QWidget):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super(AnimationArea, self).__init__()\r\n        self.setFixedSize(640, 480)\r\n        self.enemy = QtWidgets.QLabel(&#39;X&#39;, self)\r\n        self.enemyAnimation = QtCore.QPropertyAnimation(self.enemy, b&#39;pos&#39;)\r\n        # set a start value for the animation; if we don&#39;t provide this\r\n        # the animation will use the end value as soon as it finishes.\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.setStartValue(self.enemy.pos())\r\n        # set an end value for the animation; this is always required.\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.setEndValue(QtCore.QPoint(400, 200))\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.setDuration(2000)\r\n\r\n    def start(self):\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.start()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass AniWindow(QtWidgets.QWidget):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super(AniWindow, self).__init__()\r\n        layout = QtWidgets.QVBoxLayout()\r\n        self.setLayout(layout)\r\n        self.animationArea = AnimationArea()\r\n        layout.addWidget(self.animationArea)\r\n        self.startButton = QtWidgets.QPushButton(&#39;Start&#39;)\r\n        layout.addWidget(self.startButton)\r\n        self.startButton.clicked.connect(self.animationArea.start)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n    import sys\r\n    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    aniWindow = AniWindow()\r\n    aniWindow.show()\r\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more complex paths there are two solutions.\r\n\r\nGroup of linear animations\r\n---\r\nThis uses [QSequentialAnimationGroup](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsequentialanimationgroup.html) which allows to concatenate multiple animations. The advantage is that you can set different speeds for each segment, but the will always be linear paths. Since the animations are sequential (and we&#39;re returning to the start position at the end), you only need to set the end values. This snippet will move your enemy around a triangle.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        self.enemyAnimation = QtCore.QSequentialAnimationGroup()\r\n        first = QtCore.QPropertyAnimation(self.label_enemy, b&#39;pos&#39;)\r\n        first.setEndValue(QtCore.QPoint(0, 400))\r\n        first.setDuration(1000)\r\n        second = QtCore.QPropertyAnimation(self.label_enemy, b&#39;pos&#39;)\r\n        second.setEndValue(QtCore.QPoint(400, 400))\r\n        second.setDuration(2000)\r\n        third = QtCore.QPropertyAnimation(self.label_enemy, b&#39;pos&#39;)\r\n        third.setEndValue(QtCore.QPoint(0, 0))\r\n        third.setDuration(3000)\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.addAnimation(first)\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.addAnimation(second)\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.addAnimation(third)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollow a path\r\n---\r\nA [QPainterPath](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpainterpath.html) can be used to draw more complex (and non linear) paths. For this approach you&#39;ll need to use [QVariantAnimation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qvariantanimation.html) going from `0.0` to `1.0`, and the [QPainterPath.pointAtPercent](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpainterpath.html#pointAtPercent) function, that returns the coordinates at any percentage of the path. In this case I used a segment and a curve.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        self.enemyAnimation = QtCore.QVariantAnimation()\r\n        # *BOTH* start and end values *HAVE* to be float!\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.setStartValue(0.0)\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.setEndValue(1.0)\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.setDuration(2000)\r\n        self.enemyPath = QtGui.QPainterPath()\r\n        self.enemyPath.lineTo(100, 400)\r\n        self.enemyPath.quadTo(400, 400, 400, 0)\r\n        self.enemyAnimation.valueChanged.connect(self.moveEnemy)\r\n\r\n    def moveEnemy(self, percent):\r\n        self.label_enemy.move(self.enemyPath.pointAtPercent(percent).toPoint())\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150896/how-can-i-move-a-label-slowly-in-pyqt5-i-want-the-label-to-move-automatically/58151071#58151071","title":"How can i move a label slowly in pyqt5?

But it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nIn the custom component I&#39;m doing this:\r\n```\r\n&lt;StackLayout&gt;\r\n    &lt;Label text=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;&lt;/Label&gt;\r\n    &lt;Label text=&quot;some text&quot;&gt;&lt;/Label&gt;\r\n&lt;/StackLayout&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: &#39;ns-custom&#39;,\r\n  templateUrl: &#39;./custom.component.html&#39;,\r\n  styleUrls: [&#39;./custom.component.css&#39;]\r\n})\r\nexport class CustomComponent{\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the parent element I&#39;m doing this:\r\n```\r\n&lt;ns-custom (tap)=&quot;onCustomComponentClick()&quot;&gt;&lt;/ns-custom&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n    onCustomComponentClick() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;custom-component was tapped&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect the (tap) event to fire when I tap the custom component, but it does not. I built the same structure in pure Angular, and the (click) event does fire if put to a custom component.\r\n\r\nI tried to propogate the (tap) event from the custom component like below, but then it fired twice (as expected because the tap event would propogate up to the parent component if I don&#39;t use `event.stopPropagation() `):\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;StackLayout (tap)=&quot;emitTap()&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;Label text=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;&lt;/Label&gt;\r\n    &lt;Label text=&quot;some text&quot;&gt;&lt;/Label&gt;\r\n&lt;/StackLayout&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: &#39;ns-custom&#39;,\r\n  templateUrl: &#39;./custom.component.html&#39;,\r\n  styleUrls: [&#39;./custom.component.css&#39;]\r\n})\r\nexport class CustomComponent{\r\n   @Output() tap = new EventEmitter();\r\n\r\n   emitTap() {\r\n       this.tap.emit();\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then catch the event on the parent component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;ns-custom (tap)=&quot;onCustomComponentClick()&quot;&gt;&lt;/ns-custom&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n    onCustomComponentClick() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;custom-component was tapped&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now the tap event fires twice. I can solve it by changing the EventEmitter name to something other than &#39;tap&#39; (for ex. `@Output() childTapped = new EventEmitter();` and `&lt;ns-custom (childTapped)=&quot;onCustomComponentClick()&quot;&gt;&lt;/ns-custom&gt;`) or pass the `$event` object on tap and then use `event.stopPropagation()`, but this is not elegant at all.\r\n\r\nAny idea how to solve this simple problem in an elegant way?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150877/nativescript-tap-event-on-a-custom-angular-component","title":"Nativescript (tap) event on a custom Angular component"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio-code"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5135,"user_id":9938317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b72fceef5630b6b962624fed6ac9c82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rioV8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9938317/riov8"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569846714,"post_id":58150875,"comment_id":102717176,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150875/quick-create-a-class-in-visual-studio-code#comment102717176_58150875"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":298,"user_id":3347630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41b967d05a393a5b9568532d18c658e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sdyess","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3347630/sdyess"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569712647,"creation_date":1569712647,"answer_id":58150992,"question_id":58150875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58150992","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t think it takes very long to just create them manually with just a class name, especially in vs code, but this extension looks like it might do something like what you&#39;re looking for.\r\n\r\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ACharLuk.easy-cpp-projects","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150875/quick-create-a-class-in-visual-studio-code/58150992#58150992","title":"Quick create a class in Visual Studio Code"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10355229,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0gvPe8Kq8eY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/APUIFaNFOl94gUW6VER-BuTt7lzJePwymA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dallin Davis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10355229/dallin-davis"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569712647,"creation_date":1569711189,"question_id":58150875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150875","body_markdown":"I&#39;m fairly new to programming and I&#39;ve always used Visual Studio.

Each docket number takes the form such as\r\n\r\n - AB19-1-000\r\n - CD19-1043-000\r\n - EF18-24-001\r\n\r\nThese are comprised of &quot;root&quot; dockets and &quot;sub&quot; dockets.  The roots here are\r\n\r\n - AB19-1\r\n - CD19-1043\r\n - EF18-24\r\n\r\nThe root dockets are comprised of the two alpha character docket prefix, which indicates the case type.  Followed by a two numerical character code indicating the fiscal year the case was filed.  Then a hyphen.  Then a &quot;sequence&quot; number (with no fixed # of digits, although none have ever had more than 4 digits) indicating the sequence that the case was filed (relative to other cases of the same type that were filed in that fiscal year).\r\n\r\nThe final three digits (after the final hyphen) of the overall docket number represent the &quot;subdocket,&quot; and are to allow for multiple filings within the docket.  The initial filing is always docketed with a 000 subdocket.  Subsequent filings within that root docket are subdocketed as 001, 002, 003, etc.\r\n\r\nTo make things more complicated, there can be multiple docket numbers listed within the Docket field, and (in the horrid legacy database design we have) multiple docket numbers are always separated with exactly one space.  (I know.  Don&#39;t get me started.)\r\n\r\nI want to create a tool that will help us generate the docket number for new cases easier/quicker than our current approach (which uses a VBA loop and is very slow).  Specifically, I want to write a function for use on SQL Server that will spit out the next sequence number for a new filing of a given type and fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe steps would be roughly:\r\n\r\n 1. Accept as an argument a two character case type and a two digit fiscal year.\r\n 2. Identify all docket numbers entered where the alpha prefix is the specified case type and the next two characters are the specified fiscal year (ignoring subdocket, which we don&#39;t care about here).\r\n 3. Identify the highest existing sequence number for that case type and docket year.\r\n 4. Add one to the identified number, and return that number.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m a decent programmer, but my SQL is pretty limited to fairly normal queries.  I have very limited experience creating functions.  So any help (even a general outline of what this kind of function might looks like and how to create it) is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s some code to generate some simple test data.\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE MyCases (\r\n        CaseId   INTEGER       PRIMARY KEY,\r\n        Docket   VARCHAR(50) not null\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    INSERT INTO MyCases \r\n    VALUES \r\n    (1, &#39;XL14-204-001 TS14-1-000 PI14-1-000&#39;),\r\n    (2, &#39;PI14-2-000&#39;),\r\n    (3, &#39;PI14-3-000&#39;),\r\n    (4, &#39;PI14-4-001 XL14-22-000&#39;),\r\n    (5, &#39;PI14-6-000&#39;),\r\n    (6, &#39;PI14-7-000 XL14-382-000&#39;),\r\n    (7, &#39;PI15-1-000 XL15-23-000&#39;),\r\n    (8, &#39;PI15-2-000 TS15-23-000&#39;),\r\n    (9, &#39;PI15-3-000&#39;),\r\n    (10, &#39;PI15-4-000 TS15-2-000&#39;)\r\n    ;\r\n\r\nAnd with the desired function, if the user entered MyFunction(&#39;PI&#39;,14), the result would be 8, because the highest existing sequential number for all PI14 docket numbers is PI14-7, and adding one to 7 gives 8.

So for example in 2018 Real Madrid defeated Liverpool, the dictionary will look like this:\r\n\r\n    2018: [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,   &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Liverpool&quot;]\r\n\r\nAssuming this structure the `Data` variable has the results from 2018 to 2011. If you want to know who won in 2018 you can do something like this:\r\n\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter { $0.key == 2018 }\r\n\r\nIf you want know when Real Madrid won you doo like this:\r\n\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter { $0.value[&quot;1stPlace&quot;] == &quot;Real Madrid&quot; }\r\n\r\nIf you want to know when Real Madrid defeated Atl&amp;eacute;tico Madrid you do it like this:\r\n\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter {\r\n      $0.value[&quot;2ndPlace&quot;] == &quot;Atl&#233;tico Madrid&quot; &amp;&amp;\r\n      $0.value[&quot;1stPlace&quot;] == &quot;Real Madrid&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen you have the results in `filteredData` you can do query the data in different ways: you can sort by year, you can extract just the years, etc.\r\n\r\nThe following code is the playground I used to test different kinds of queries:\r\n\r\n    import Foundation\r\n\r\n    typealias DictOfDicts = [Int : [String : String]]\r\n\r\n    var Data: DictOfDicts = [\r\n      2018:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,   &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Liverpool&quot;],\r\n      2017:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,   &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Juventus&quot;],\r\n      2016:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,   &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Atl&#233;tico Madrid&quot;],\r\n      2015:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Barcelona&quot;,     &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Juventus&quot;],\r\n      2014:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,   &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Atl&#233;tico Madrid&quot;],\r\n      2013:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Bayern Munich&quot;, &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Borussia Dortmund&quot;],\r\n      2012:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Chelsea&quot;,       &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Bayern Munich&quot;],\r\n      2011:\r\n        [&quot;1stPlace&quot;: &quot;Barcelona&quot;,     &quot;2ndPlace&quot;: &quot;Manchester United&quot;]\r\n      ]\r\n\r\n    var filteredData: DictOfDicts = [:]\r\n\r\n    print(&quot;Results from 2017 to present&quot;)\r\n    print(&quot;----------------------------&quot;)\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter { $0.key &gt;= 2017 } // Filter from 2017 to present\r\n    filteredData\r\n      .sorted { $0.key &gt; $1.key } // Sort by year\r\n      .forEach {\r\n        print(&quot;In \\($0.key) \\($0.value[&quot;1stPlace&quot;]!) defeated \\($0.value[&quot;2ndPlace&quot;]!)&quot;)\r\n      }\r\n    print(&quot;&quot;)\r\n\r\n    print(&quot;Results before 2015&quot;)\r\n    print(&quot;----------------------------&quot;)\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter { $0.key &lt; 2015 } // Filter before 2015\r\n    filteredData\r\n      .sorted { $0.key &gt; $1.key } // Sort by year\r\n      .forEach {\r\n        print(&quot;In \\($0.key) \\($0.value[&quot;1stPlace&quot;]!) defeated \\($0.value[&quot;2ndPlace&quot;]!)&quot;)\r\n      }\r\n    print(&quot;&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter { $0.value[&quot;1stPlace&quot;] == &quot;Real Madrid&quot; } // Filter Real Madrid won\r\n    var years = filteredData\r\n      .sorted { $0.key &lt; $1.key } // Sort by year\r\n      .map { &quot;\\($0.key)&quot; } // Convert year to string\r\n      .joined(separator: &quot;, &quot;) // Convert to comma separated single string\r\n    print(&quot;Real Madrid won in: \\(years)&quot;)\r\n    print(&quot;&quot;)\r\n\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter { $0.value[&quot;2ndPlace&quot;] == &quot;Juventus&quot; } // Filter Juventus lost\r\n    years = filteredData\r\n      .sorted { $0.key &gt; $1.key } // Sort by year\r\n      .map { &quot;\\($0.key)&quot; } // Convert year to string\r\n      .joined(separator: &quot;, &quot;) // Convert to comma separated single string\r\n    print(&quot;Juventus lost the final match in: \\(years)&quot;)\r\n    print(&quot;&quot;)\r\n\r\n    filteredData = Data.filter {\r\n      $0.value[&quot;2ndPlace&quot;] == &quot;Atl&#233;tico Madrid&quot; &amp;&amp;\r\n      $0.value[&quot;1stPlace&quot;] == &quot;Real Madrid&quot;\r\n    } // Filter Real Madrid defeated Atl&#233;tico Madrid\r\n    years = filteredData\r\n      .sorted { $0.key &gt; $1.key } // Sort by year\r\n      .map { &quot;\\($0.key)&quot; } // Convert year to string\r\n      .joined(separator: &quot;, &quot;) // Convert to comma separated single string\r\n    print(&quot;Real Madrid defeated Atl&#233;tico Madrid in: \\(years)&quot;)\r\n    print()\r\n\r\n    let winnersAndChampionships =\r\n      Set(Data.map { $0.value[&quot;1stPlace&quot;]!

Here the build_app function name is common in both the frontend.yml and backend.yml but the functionality is different.\r\n\r\nIn the top-level.yml stages, I specified the common function name as build_app in the script key.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstages:\r\n  - build\r\n\r\nvariables:\r\n  GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY: &quot;1&quot;\r\n\r\n.build_script: &amp;build_script\r\n  stage: build\r\n  tags:\r\n    - default\r\n    - docker\r\n\r\nbuild:\r\n  &lt;&lt;: *build_script\r\n  image: maven:latest\r\n  script:\r\n    - build_app\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in the .gitlab-ci.yml, depending on the build I need to do, I include that specific yml file. In the below example I want to build the backend and included the backend.yml same applies for the frontend.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninclude: \r\n  - project: &#39;root/B&#39;\r\n    ref: master\r\n    file: &#39;top-level.yml&#39;\r\n\r\n  - project: &#39;root/B&#39;\r\n    ref: master\r\n    file: &#39;backend.yml&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I have to build both the backend and frontend, I will use a hybrid.yml with the same function name as build_app but include both the maven and npm command. I know this is not the right approach but I will suffice the use case I&#39;m trying to solve.\r\n\r\nThank you for helping me with the question!\r\n\r\nHappy Automation :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150822/gitlab-ci-yml-to-include-multiple-shell-functions-from-multiple-yml-files/58435765#58435765","title":".gitlab-ci.yml to include multiple shell functions from multiple yml files"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":10735849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9GbFwwoaXcQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/iUKmVM_fx4M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Venkata Surya Lolla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10735849/venkata-surya-lolla"},"last_editor":{"reputation":69,"user_id":10735849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9GbFwwoaXcQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/iUKmVM_fx4M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Venkata Surya Lolla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10735849/venkata-surya-lolla"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571325084,"creation_date":1569710272,"last_edit_date":1569710904,"question_id":58150822,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150822","body_markdown":"I have a Gitlab mono repository with some backend Java and frontend Node.js code.

I&#39;m not sure exactly which—feel free to experiment!\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I named your data `pdat` (point data) instead of `table`. `table` is the name of a built-in R function, and it&#39;s best to avoid using it as a variable name.\r\n2. I have placed both `data=` expressions inside the geom function that needs that data (instead of placing the `data=` and `aes()` inside the initial `ggplot()` call.) When I use two or more data.frames in a single plot, I do this defensively and find that it avoids many problems.\r\n3. I have moved `colour=&quot;red&quot;` and `size=2` outside of the `aes()` function. `aes()` is used to create an association between a column in your data.frame and a visual attribute of the plot. Anything that&#39;s not a name of a column doesn&#39;t belong inside `aes()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Load data.\r\n    \r\n    pdat &lt;- read.table(header=TRUE,\r\n    text=&quot;long2  lat2 mag1\r\n    1  -2.62 52.84  1.9\r\n    2   1.94 57.03  4.2\r\n    3  -0.24 51.16  0.6\r\n    4  -2.34 53.34  0.8\r\n    5  -3.16 55.73  2.0\r\n    6  -0.24 51.16  1.0\r\n    7  -4.11 53.03  1.5\r\n    8  -0.24 51.16  0.2\r\n    9  -0.24 51.16  1.1\r\n    10 -5.70 57.08  1.6\r\n    11 -2.40 53.00  1.4\r\n    12 -1.19 53.35  1.2\r\n    13 -1.02 53.84  1.7\r\n    14 -4.24 52.62  0.8\r\n    15 -3.23 54.24  0.3\r\n    16 -2.06 52.62  1.0\r\n    17  1.63 54.96  1.7\r\n    18 -5.24 56.05  0.7\r\n    19 -5.86 55.84  1.3\r\n    20 -3.22 54.23  0.3\r\n    21 -0.24 51.16 -1.4\r\n    22 -0.24 51.16 -0.7\r\n    23 -4.01 55.92  0.3\r\n    24 -5.18 50.08  2.3\r\n    25 -1.95 54.44  1.0&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    library(maps)\r\n    \r\n    w &lt;- map_data(&quot;world&quot;, region = &quot;uk&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    uk &lt;- ggplot() + \r\n          geom_polygon(data = w, \r\n                       aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\r\n                       fill = &quot;seagreen2&quot;, colour = &quot;white&quot;) + \r\n          coord_map() + \r\n          geom_point(data = pdat, \r\n                     aes(x = long2, y = lat2), \r\n                     colour = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2, \r\n                     position = &quot;jitter&quot;, alpha = 0.5)\r\n    \r\n    ggsave(&quot;map.png&quot;, plot=uk, height=4, width=6, dpi=150)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lJyA2.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150802/problems-creating-points-on-a-map-ggplot2-r/58151123#58151123","title":"Problems creating points on a map ggplot2/r"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12102002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LsPcTTevLTs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc0v0wZy7AgoYxmkYfg6gCUAtRb5A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"HappyDinosaur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12102002/happydinosaur"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58151123,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569714615,"creation_date":1569710043,"question_id":58150802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150802","body_markdown":"I have a data set of UK earthquakes that I want to plot by location on a map.

Then, replace your `Update()` method with an event OnClick() as you did before.\r\n\r\nYour pause button will catch the left click and your background button will not.\r\nBe sure to tick **Interactable** in the `Button` component.\r\n\r\nThen you can safly remove the `Image` component of your background button, if you don&#39;t need it.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nWhat it means is you can create (or modify) a class for your pause button\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing UnityEngine.EventSystems;\r\n\r\npublic class PauseButton : MonoBehaviour, IPointerEnterHandler, IPointerExitHandler\r\n{\r\n    public bool IsMouseOver = false;\r\n\r\n    public void OnPointerEnter(PointerEventData eventData)\r\n    {\r\n        IsMouseOver = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void OnPointerExit(PointerEventData eventData)\r\n    {\r\n        IsMouseOver = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // --\r\n    // Your OnClick method\r\n    // --\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Note: the using eventSystems.**\r\n\r\nNow you can use this bool value within a code like `amengelbrecht` send you.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll will copy and paste his code from his answer, and add the bool value based on the previous class above.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class BackgroundButtonScript : MonoBehaviour\r\n{\r\n    // Public objects\r\n    public Sprite[] sprites;\r\n    public PauseButton pauseButton;\r\n\r\n    //Private variables\r\n    private Image buttonImage;\r\n    private int spriteIndex;\r\n\r\n    private void Start()\r\n    {\r\n        buttonImage = GetComponent&lt;Image&gt;(); // Get the image component of your button\r\n        spriteIndex = 0; // Set the index to 0\r\n        buttonImage.sprite = sprites[spriteIndex]; // Set the image to the first image in your sprite array\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void Update()\r\n    {\r\n        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) &amp;&amp; !pauseButton.IsMouseOver)\r\n        {\r\n            spriteIndex++; // Increment the index\r\n            if (spriteIndex &gt; sprites.Length - 1) // Ensure that you stay within the array size\r\n            {\r\n                spriteIndex = 0;\r\n            }\r\n            buttonImage.sprite = sprites[spriteIndex]; // Set the image\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow you to click anywhere on your screen except if the mouse is over your pause button. In this case, OnClick from the pause button will be called.\r\n\r\n**Be careful**\r\n\r\nIf your game is is pause and the user left click anywhere but the pause button, depends on how your pause works, the Update() method of BackgroundButtonScript will be called and can lead to `if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) &amp;&amp; !pauseButton.IsMouseOver)`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150795/how-to-make-button-image-change-with-on-click-anywhere-on-screen/58157437#58157437","title":"How to make button image change with on click anywhere on screen?"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12136093,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2618452174860177/picture?type=large","display_name":"vaso","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12136093/vaso"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58151478,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569807930,"creation_date":1569709960,"question_id":58150795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150795","body_markdown":"I am very new to Unity and I have trouble understanding on click possibilities with my UI buttons etc..

am experienced with classic C, C++, but I am now learning how to use the various &quot;newer&quot; resources in the C++ Standard Library.\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, when I start typing a function name,

Usually the function name is preceded by a long list of libraries, parent classes, template typename(s), etc.\r\n\r\nHow do I interpret these various fields?\r\n\r\nUsing the std::tuple get&lt;&gt;() function, here is a typical example for VS intellisense popups (with cursor positions shown in **red**.)\r\n\r\n[![cursor selecting the template typename][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[![cursor selecting the

highlighting the function argument(s).\r\n \r\nBut how do I make sense of the other fields, *preceding* the function-name?\r\n\r\n**For example:** `constexpr std::tuple_element_t&lt;_ldx,

If access control is enabled, the output of the `parsed` server configuration options should include a section like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t&quot;security&quot; : {\r\n\t\t&quot;authorization&quot; : &quot;enabled&quot;\r\n\t},\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Check users &amp; roles for the current session via `db.runCommand({connectionStatus:1})`. As noted in [Authenticate a User](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-users/#authenticate-a-user):\r\n\r\n  &gt; Authenticating multiple times as different users does not drop the credentials of previously-authenticated users. This may lead to a connection having more permissions than intended by the user, and causes operations within a logical session to raise an error.\r\n\r\nAccess control is a separate option from configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to allow for scenarios like resetting admin access. Multiple concurrent logins provide additive permissions, but are mostly a legacy carryover from more simplistic versions of access control in earlier versions of MongoDB.\r\n\r\nFor more information on available security measures, see the [Security Checklist](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/) in the MongoDB manual.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150775/role-on-mongodb-can-insert-even-the-user-is-not-authorized/58152145#58152145","title":"Role on mongodb - can insert even the user is not authorized"}],"owner":{"reputation":158,"user_id":7771545,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TmMPXnIpzBc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/5fjz56hpjBs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rafael Guimar&#227;es","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7771545/rafael-guimar%c3%a3es"},"last_editor":{"reputation":158,"user_id":7771545,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TmMPXnIpzBc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/5fjz56hpjBs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rafael Guimar&#227;es","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7771545/rafael-guimar%c3%a3es"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58152145,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569956908,"creation_date":1569709751,"last_edit_date":1569956908,"question_id":58150775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150775","body_markdown":"I create 2 db, and one user per db, but user 2 can insert in db1?\r\n\r\n    use shop\r\n    db.createUser({user: &quot;appdev&quot;,pwd:&quot;appdev&quot;, roles:[&quot;readWrite&quot;]})\r\n    db.auth(&quot;appdev&quot;,&quot;appdev&quot;)\r\n    show collections\r\n    db.products.insertOne({name: &quot;A book for appdev&quot;})\r\n    \r\n    db.logout()\r\n    \r\n    use shop2\r\n    db.createUser({user: &quot;appdev2&quot;,pwd:&quot;appdev2&quot;, roles:[&quot;readWrite&quot;]})\r\n    db.auth(&quot;appdev2&quot;,&quot;appdev2&quot;)\r\n    show collections\r\n    db.products.insertOne({name: &quot;A book for appdev2&quot;})\r\n    \r\n\r\nHere, I still logged as appdev2 and can insert on db shop.\r\n\r\n    use shop\r\n    db.products.insertOne({name:&quot;i-am-appdev2&quot;})\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;acknowledged&quot; : true,\r\n        &quot;insertedId&quot; : ObjectId(&quot;5d8fdba878f7555a2060f1ec&quot;)\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150775/role-on-mongodb-can-insert-even-the-user-is-not-authorized","title":"Role on mongodb - can insert even the user is not authorized"},{"tags":["javascript","d3.js","d3pie.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2245,"user_id":11081214,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b53d0cefd959372f49e84b943a1187f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Snow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11081214/snow"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569709765,"post_id":58150773,"comment_id":102685352,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150773/d3-pie-chart-doesnot-showing-the-color#comment102685352_58150773"},{"owner":{"reputation":455,"user_id":1923565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5dcd4cbd0ad2489a2a81ea6c8bdbc918?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Guillermo Garcia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1923565/guillermo-garcia"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569714191,"post_id":58150773,"comment_id":102685946,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150773/d3-pie-chart-doesnot-showing-the-color#comment102685946_58150773"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12136588,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rSDxtFWIu0A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd3szPbo-1Q0BhDQtcKvi0CkDdrlQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sanjana Srabanti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12136588/sanjana-srabanti"},"last_editor":{"reputation":132,"user_id":11978973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/033e73b8f6c01a606e6b245c6df486c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zephyrus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11978973/zephyrus"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569768040,"creation_date":1569709726,"last_edit_date":1569768040,"question_id":58150773,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150773","body_markdown":"My code is like this.

Is it possible to show the activity  in lock-screen and get some user input? something like the clock app that comes with devices; where we can set alarm and we can stop or snooze alarms when it goes off even in lock screen.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150758/how-to-show-a-activity-on-lock-screen","title":"How to show a activity on lock screen"},{"tags":["javascript","html","addeventlistener","keydown","removeeventlistener"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8577261,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3bfd3b7c492026653b7a50de9d44570e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sup3r D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8577261/sup3r-d"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569710880,"post_id":58150768,"comment_id":102685530,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150755/add-keydown-event-listener-to-document-except-for-input-field/58150768#comment102685530_58150768"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"last_editor":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569710970,"last_edit_date":1569710970,"creation_date":1569709636,"answer_id":58150768,"question_id":58150755,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58150768","body_markdown":"Inside `handleKeyDown`, only execute the body of the function if the `event.target` does not match the input field, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst handleKeyDown = (event) =&gt; {\r\n  if (event.target.matches(&#39;[name=&quot;letter&quot;]&#39;)) {\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  // rest of function body\r\n};\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150755/add-keydown-event-listener-to-document-except-for-input-field/58150768#58150768","title":"Add &#39;keydown&#39; event listener to document except for input field"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8577261,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3bfd3b7c492026653b7a50de9d44570e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sup3r D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8577261/sup3r-d"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58150768,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569710970,"creation_date":1569709498,"question_id":58150755,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150755","body_markdown":"I am creating a Hangman game with a virtual keypad and a form input section where users can guess the entire word.\r\n\r\nI am able to add a &#39;keydown&#39; event listener to the document, but I DO NOT want want the &#39;keydown&#39; event to fire off if I am typing into the input field.\r\n\r\nHere is how I&#39;ve added the event listener.\r\n\r\n```document.addEventListener(&#39;keydown&#39;, handleKeyDown);```\r\n\r\nHere is the form input.\r\n```\r\n&lt;form onSubmit={e =&gt; onSubmit(e)}&gt;\r\n          &lt;div className=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;input\r\n              type=&quot;text&quot;\r\n              className=&quot;form-control&quot;\r\n              name=&quot;letter&quot;\r\n              placeholder=&quot;Guess the word&quot;\r\n              value={formWord}\r\n              onChange={e =&gt; setFormWord(e.target.value.toUpperCase())}\r\n              disabled={disabled}\r\n            /&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;div className=&quot;input-group-append&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;button\r\n                className=&quot;btn text-white&quot;\r\n                type=&quot;submit&quot;\r\n                disabled={disabled}\r\n              &gt;\r\n                &lt;i className=&quot;far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right&quot; /&gt; Go!\r\n              &lt;/button&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/form&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve already tried using ```document.getElementsByTagName[0].removeEventListener(&#39;keydown&#39;, handleKeyDown)```, but that&#39;s not working.

My app is targeting Tizen 4.0.\r\n\r\nThe Samsung Seller portal needs the release binary but doesn&#39;t give much instruction, so I assume to get this I&#39;m rebuilding the solution in release mode with the certificate profile setup correctly.  The result TPK file is in the `bin/Release` folder.\r\n\r\nInspecting the TPK binary archive I see all my built DLLs, resources, manifest, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n------\r\n\r\nOnce I upload this binary to the Samsung Seller portal and submit it for review, it fails the automated pre-review due to the following error:\r\n\r\n&gt; [Defect] Application was built by x86 compiler. X86 means app run on\r\n&gt; Tizen emulator, not real target.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [Expected Result] Please configure Architecture to arm when you build\r\n&gt; app. Project properties -&gt; C/C++ build -&gt; Tizen settings and you can\r\n&gt; check architecture of your app filename.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; e.g. org.example.app-1.0.0-arm.tpk e.g. org.exapmple.ap-1.0.0-x86.tpk\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [Reference] In generally, Platform architecture automatically selected\r\n&gt; based on the test environment. If test device connected by USB, Tizen\r\n&gt; IDE selected arm architecture automatically but if emulator connected\r\n&gt; to sdb, Tizen IDE selected arm architecture automatically.\r\n\r\nThe instructions here are useless as I&#39;m using Visual Studio and C# .NET, not Tizen Studio or C++.\r\n\r\nAttached to the rejection is a file named `gear_core_architecture.txt` whose contents are simply:\r\n\r\n&gt; Intel 80386[libSkiaSharp.so]\r\n\r\nIs this problematic file? If I inspect the release binary TPK archive I find the `libSkiaSharp.so` file inside the `bin/runtimes/linux-x86/native` and `bin/runtimes/tizen-armel/native` folder.  I am not using `SkiaSharp` in my app at all, but my nuget packages might be (Tizen.NET, Xamarin, etc.).  Looking at the `Tizen-CSharp` samples project, the SkiaSharp project sample also includes these libraries in their TPK as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have looked everywhere in Visual Studio and cannot change the platform type for any solution or project to `arm`.  Right now it only builds for `Any CPU`, `x86`, or `x64`.  I&#39;ve added the C++ compilers for ARM and ARM64 to Visual Studio from the individual components but no change.  Manually creating an `ARM` build configuration won&#39;t let me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n-------\r\n\r\nHow do you build a Tizen Wearable C# .NET app for ARM platform in Visual Studio 2017 for publishing

The only thing you can figure out there is to use `new`/`delete` for these pointers everywhere. But we don&#39;t do that. If `a` is meant to be a default shared among all instances of the class, it should be `static`. That way, it would outlive all instances and this problem wouldn&#39;t exist.

The Model has a list of data which is used to build the control in the View. I also have a Behaviour that will remove overflow of the list, based on a limit set on how many values there should be in the list and shown in the control. When items in the list is removed it should then remove those from the View.\r\nIn an MVC, the Control is the Model, the Skin is the View, and Behaviour the controller.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class CustomControl\r\npublic class CustomControlSkin\r\npublic class CustomControlBehavior\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a ListChangeListener added to the model data, which listens for additions and removals. New values are added to the control, while removals should be removed from it.\r\n\r\nI have created a SSCCE that illustrates the problem. I first used a timer in the example to simulate the receiving of data which comes in a different thread than the JavaFX thread. In my application I have a async service the delivers this data. However the example works to illustrate the problem even without the Timer, but I wanted to keep it there.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity the Example just creates an Label for each value in the model, and it creates 30 values at first.

However that does not feel like it is a proper solution to the problem.\r\nAlso Why is the removal actually triggering a second addition, not of the items removed, but the remaining items?\r\n\r\nEdit: Seems it is not recommended to change the list from within the ListChangeListener. Any suggestion how I can change the list outside of the ListChangeListener which is triggered from an addition?\r\nI tried with an JavaFX Task to call the removal, which works, but it kinda seem like overkill to have a thread within a custom control for each update of its data.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150741/javafx-listchangelistener-removals-triggers-an-addition-change","title":"JavaFX ListChangeListener removals triggers an addition change"},{"tags":["javascript","css","twitter-bootstrap","vue.js","core-ui"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12133933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6pRhIi0CB0M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc3O-E7k3Xiu6t_7BlfEMmsONlglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"happy forever","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12133933/happy-forever"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569725244,"post_id":58150740,"comment_id":102687277,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150740/how-can-i-set-up-vue-and-core-ui#comment102687277_58150740"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12133933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6pRhIi0CB0M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc3O-E7k3Xiu6t_7BlfEMmsONlglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"happy forever","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12133933/happy-forever"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569771001,"post_id":58153706,"comment_id":102695900,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150740/how-can-i-set-up-vue-and-core-ui/58153706#comment102695900_58153706"},{"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":9982309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5hm0E6OYJno/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq3UJp9_kiioF-oLobxNgXoYdTCMIg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JTInfinite","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9982309/jtinfinite"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12133933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6pRhIi0CB0M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc3O-E7k3Xiu6t_7BlfEMmsONlglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"happy forever","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12133933/happy-forever"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569860376,"post_id":58153706,"comment_id":102724442,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150740/how-can-i-set-up-vue-and-core-ui/58153706#comment102724442_58153706"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12133933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6pRhIi0CB0M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc3O-E7k3Xiu6t_7BlfEMmsONlglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"happy forever","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12133933/happy-forever"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569873392,"post_id":58153706,"comment_id":102729722,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150740/how-can-i-set-up-vue-and-core-ui/58153706#comment102729722_58153706"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12133933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6pRhIi0CB0M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc3O-E7k3Xiu6t_7BlfEMmsONlglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"happy forever","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12133933/happy-forever"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569873495,"post_id":58153706,"comment_id":102729761,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150740/how-can-i-set-up-vue-and-core-ui/58153706#comment102729761_58153706"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":9982309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5hm0E6OYJno/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq3UJp9_kiioF-oLobxNgXoYdTCMIg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JTInfinite","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9982309/jtinfinite"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569746989,"creation_date":1569746989,"answer_id":58153706,"question_id":58150740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58153706","body_markdown":"the first page of the documentation literally spells out how to add CSS to the project. \r\n\r\n[Docs](https://coreui.io/docs/getting-started/introduction/)\r\n\r\n&gt;

seem to only be checking for immediate loops in your first iterative version. (You are not checking if you have a larger loop A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A. You are only checking for loops like A -&gt; B -&gt; A). I assume that what you presented is correct and what you want, albeit strange. (If you have a larger loop it will go on infinitely).\r\n\r\nThe proper and simpler way to do what you presented recursively is: \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic boolean hasImmediateCycle(Node node) {\r\n   if (node == null || node.getNext() == null) {\r\n      return false;\r\n   } else if (node == node.getNext().getNext()) {\r\n      return true;\r\n   } else {\r\n      return hasImmediateCycle(node.getNext());\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to make it check for all possible loops you would need to do it slightly differently:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate boolean hasCycle(Node node, Set&lt;Node&gt; seen) {\r\n   if (node == null) {\r\n      return false;\r\n   } else if (seen.contains(node)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n   } else {\r\n      seen.add(node);   \r\n      return hasCycle(node.getNext(), seen);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic boolean hasCycle(Node node) {\r\n  return hasCycle(node, new HashSet&lt;Node&gt;());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will check all the `seen` nodes in case they appear again in the `next` reference. This actually uses the `.equals()` and `.hashCode()` of your `Node` so it is important they are implemented consistently with each other.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58150730/converting-while-loop-to-recursion-in-java/58150777#58150777","title":"Converting while loop to recursion in java"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12136524,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b84556767c6cff1aba60ea86be78516?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DaGuyWhoCodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12136524/daguywhocodes"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569710377,"creation_date":1569709143,"question_id":58150730,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58150730","body_markdown":"Hi I&#39;m trying to convert this java while loop code into recursion.

Instead of there being a 1-1 mapping of each character in set A to a corresponding character in set B, it&#39;s slightly more complicated. Think of like a natural language transliterator from a script like [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_11940) or [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKATS) to Latin script. In the Korean example, you get something like this:\r\n\r\n\tSKATS:  LUM CU LE  MEG KUGG BE.\r\n\tHangul: 김치가 맛있다.\r\n\r\nThere is a 1-to-1 mapping of SKATS to Korean Hangul. `LU` is one letter, `M` another, `CU` another, etc. There is no correspondence between these letters and the pronunciation of the Hangul characters, these are just picked from a hat basically.\r\n\r\nThe issue starts to come in when you have multiple characters represent a single character.\r\n\r\nSay for example you have an &quot;aspirated `t`&quot; sound, represented as `tʰ` in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), and you also have the letters `t` and `h`, and you have the english `th` sound (`θ` in IPA). Say you decide to represent the `tʰ` sound as `th`. Well, you  could have this actual sequence:\r\n\r\n    tʰ-tʰ-th-t-t-h-t-tʰ-h-th\r\n\r\nIf you translated that it would be:\r\n\r\n     th-th-th-t-t-h-t-th-h-th\r\n\r\nCombined how it would actually look is:\r\n\r\n     thththtthtthhth\r\n\r\nNow the problem is how to get back to the original character sequence. We could interpret this in many ways:\r\n\r\n     th-th-th-t-th-t-th-h-th\r\n     th-th-th-t-t-h-t-th-h-th\r\n     th-th-th-t-t-h-t-t-h-h-th\r\n     th-th-th-t-t-h-t-t-h-h-t-h\r\n     th-th-th-t-t-h-t-t-h-h-tʰ\r\n     th-th-th-t-t-h-t-tʰ-h-tʰ\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\nHow do you write an algorithm that will check if your mapping is 1:1 lossless to prevent this problem?
