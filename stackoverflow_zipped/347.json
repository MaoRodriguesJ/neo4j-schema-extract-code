How can I make uint8_t behave like the other integer types when doing stream I/O?\r\n\r\n&lt;strike&gt;You can&#39;t.&lt;/strike&gt; [Apparently](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21389821/7359094) you can.\r\n\r\nIf `std::uint8_t` is an alias of `unsigned char`, as it usually (maybe always) is, then it is a character type, and the standard streams treat it as a character type.\r\n\r\nYou can convert it to a non-character integer type before inserting to a stream:\r\n\r\n     std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;var = &quot; &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt;(var) &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n\r\nOr with an intermediary variable:\r\n\r\n    unsigned temp = var;\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;var = &quot; &lt;&lt; temp &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n\r\n\r\nStream extraction works only with the intermediary variable approach:\r\n\r\n    unsigned temp;\r\n    std::cin &gt;&gt; temp;\r\n    var = temp;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a related note, if you wish to output the address of a variable, then `std::cout &lt;&lt; &amp;var;` won&#39;t work, because it will be treated as a null terminated string... which it isn&#39;t and thus results in undefined behaviour. To achieve that, you can use `std::cout &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;var);`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455787/how-do-i-use-an-uint8-t-with-i-o-streams-while-avoiding-the-char-behavior/58455871#58455871","title":"How do I use an uint8_t with I/O streams while avoiding the char behavior?"}],"owner":{"reputation":550,"user_id":5863987,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z7wZz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NieDzejkob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5863987/niedzejkob"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571474837,"creation_date":1571420622,"question_id":58455787,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455787","body_markdown":"Consider this simple C++ program:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;cstdint&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    uint8_t var;\r\n    std::cin &gt;&gt; var;\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;var = &quot; &lt;&lt; var &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n    if (var == 1) {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;var is 1\\n&quot;;\r\n    } else {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;var is not 1\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning it shows some surprising behavior.

Player can &quot;pick up&quot; that Apple. If more players are in the game, player who picks up the most apples, wins.\r\n\r\n**What I have:** I have a tree and apples are falling down. Until here it works perfect. Player can pick up an apple - if he touches the apple by his foot, apple is destroyed and player gets 1 point. Still OK.\r\n\r\n**What is wrong:** If more players join the game, it looks like every player can see his own (local) apple. So if Player1 picks up an apple, apple is destroyed - **but only for him :(** all other players can see that apple still there and they can pick it up too. If I test-run the game with 2 players, in the server-window I can see that apple still there, even after all players picked it up. So the server has it&#39;s own instance apparently.\r\n\r\nBut I want just **one global** apple.\r\n\r\n**Application is like this:**\r\n\r\nI have an apple in the Workspace. Every few seconds I clone it in the script (not local script, but Script) which is under the AppleTree model in Workspace:\r\n\r\n\tfunction GrowNewApple()\r\n\t\r\n\t\tlocal newApplePos = GetRandomPlace()\r\n\t\tlocal appleTemplate = workspace.apples.prototype\r\n\t\tlocal newApple = appleTemplate:Clone()\r\n\t\r\n\t\tnewApple.Parent = appleTemplate.Parent\r\n\t\tnewApple.Name = &quot;apple&quot;\r\n\t\tnewApple.Position = newApplePos\r\n\tend\r\n\r\nIn StarterPlayer / StarterPlayerScripts I have a **local**script with this:\r\n\r\n\tlocal player = game.Players.LocalPlayer\r\n\tlocal character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:wait()\r\n\t\r\n\tcharacter:WaitForChild(&quot;LeftFoot&quot;)\r\n\t\r\n\tcharacter.LeftFoot.Touched:Connect( PickUpApple )\r\n\r\nAnd finally my PickUpApple function looks like this:\r\n\r\n\tfunction PickUpApple( touchObject )\r\n\t\r\n\t\tif touchObject:IsDescendantOf(workspace.apples) then\r\n\t\t\ttouchObject:Destroy()\r\n\t\tend\r\n\tend\r\n\r\nAny ideas please?\r\n\r\nIs it because the `PickUpApple()` is called from LocalScript? Is it possible that this LocalScript is sending **local** `touchObject` into this function?\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to do this.

You are almost certainly running into an IO bottleneck: your GPU is processing whatever the CPU is throwing at it way faster than the CPU can load and preprocess it. This is very common in deep learning, and there are ways to address it. \r\n\r\nWe cannot provide a lot of help without knowing more about your data pipeline (byte size of a batch, preprocessing steps, ...), and how the data is stored. One typical way to speed things up is to store the data is a binary format, like `TFRecords`, so that the CPU can load it faster. See the [official documentation for this.][1] \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nEdit: I quickly went through your input pipeline. The issue is very likely to indeed by IO:\r\n\r\n- You should run the preprocessing steps on the GPU as well, plenty of the augmentation techniques you use are implemented in `tf.image`. If you can, you should think about using Tensorflow 2.0, because it includes Keras and there are plenty of helpers in there as well.\r\n- Checkout the `tf.data.Dataset` API, it has plenty of helpers to load all the data in different threads, which can roughly speed up the process by the number of cores you have.\r\n- You should store your images as `TFRecords`. This is likely to speed up the loading by an order of magnitude if your input images are smallish.\r\n- You could probably try larger batch sizes as well, I&#39;m thinking your images are probably really small.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/load_data/tf_records.ipynb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455765/keras-sees-my-gpu-but-doesnt-use-it-when-training-a-neural-network/58455845#58455845","title":"Keras sees my GPU but doesn&#39;t use it when training a neural network"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":7672661,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/46ce39b12ee76fc09e7660a524198a10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ibvfteh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7672661/ibvfteh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":7672661,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/46ce39b12ee76fc09e7660a524198a10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ibvfteh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7672661/ibvfteh"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58455845,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571423548,"creation_date":1571420505,"last_edit_date":1571423548,"question_id":58455765,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455765","body_markdown":"My GPU is not used by Keras/TensorFlow.\r\n\r\nTo try to make my GPU working with tensorflow, I installed tensorflow-gpu via pip (I am using Anaconda on Windows)\r\n\r\nI have nvidia 1080ti\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(tf.test.is_gpu_available())\r\n\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n```\r\nprint(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices())\r\n\r\n[PhysicalDevice(name=&#39;/physical_device:CPU:0&#39;, device_type=&#39;CPU&#39;), \r\n PhysicalDevice(name=&#39;/physical_device:GPU:0&#39;, device_type=&#39;GPU&#39;)]\r\n```\r\nI tied\r\n```\r\nphysical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices(&#39;GPU&#39;)\r\ntf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)\r\n```\r\nbut it didnt help\r\n\r\n```\r\nsess = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))\r\nprint(sess)\r\n\r\nDevice mapping:\r\n/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 -&gt;

problem here is that you are trying to add an event (your `click`) to a button that still there isn&#39;t in your document because it is dynamic.\r\n\r\nSo your solution could be find here =&gt; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements\r\n\r\nTechnically **this is a duplicate question**, but since you are writing a code that is too complicated for what it has to do, I try to point you to a much simpler way.\r\n\r\nYou are adding a lot of `append` &amp; `addClass` that create recursive and dirty code.\r\nA solution to make it more drier could be to use a single variable with all your buttons and prepend only that.\r\n\r\n    var row=&quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n    row+=&quot;&lt;div class=&#39;attraction&#39;&gt;&quot;;\r\n    row+=&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; + itineraryInput + &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;\r\n    row+=&quot;&lt;button class=&#39;newButton review&#39;&gt;Add to leave a review&lt;/button&gt;&quot;;\r\n    row+=&quot;&lt;button class=&#39;newButton doSomething&#39;&gt;Do something&lt;/button&gt;&quot;;\r\n    row+=&quot;&lt;button class=&#39;newButton deleteButton&#39;&gt;Remove itinerary&lt;/button&gt;&quot;;\r\n    row+=&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;\r\n\r\n    $(&quot;#first&quot;).prepend(row);\r\n\r\nAfter that you can use the solution that I post you before to add your event to delete button:\r\n\r\n    $(document).on(&quot;click&quot;, &quot;.deleteButton&quot;, function() {\r\n        $(this).closest(&quot;.attraction&quot;).remove();\r\n    });\r\n\r\nTo add another events to the others buttons the technique is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is your code in action with a working delete buttons:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false

0, W, H/4))\r\n    left = cv.GetSubRect(tmp, (0, 0, W/4, H))\r\n    bottom = cv.GetSubRect(tmp, (0, H*3/4, W, H/4))\r\n    right = cv.GetSubRect(tmp, (W*3/4, 0, W/4, H))\r\n    \r\n    whitenesses =

Now, if each access token represents individual user then I want is:\r\n\r\nif the user already exists in the database then grab the access token from the DB and pass it to `GetUserProfileInfo()` and if the user does not exist in DB(NEW USER) then Insert the access token in Database.  \r\n\r\nHere is my bad practice:p\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $insta_data = $instagram_ob-&gt;GetAccessToken(INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID, INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URI, INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET, $_GET[&#39;code&#39;]);\r\n          \r\n    $exist = new existance();\r\n    $user_exist = $exist-&gt; exist($insta_data[&#39;user&#39;][&#39;id&#39;]);\r\n       \r\n    if($user_exist == 0) //user not exist {\r\n        $instagram_ob-&gt;insertoken($insta_data[&#39;access_token&#39;], $insta_data[&#39;user&#39;][&#39;username&#39;]); //calling function to insert access token into db\r\n        \r\n    }else {\r\n        $data = $exist-&gt; fetch($insta_data[&#39;user&#39;][&#39;id&#39;]); // fetch user details from db\r\n       \t\r\n       \tif($data) {\r\n        \t// Get user insta information\r\n        \t$user_info = $instagram_ob-&gt;GetUserProfileInfo($data[&#39;access_token&#39;]);\r\n        \techo &#39;db access token&#39;;\r\n       \t} else {\r\n       \t    // Get user insta information\r\n        \t$user_info = $instagram_ob-&gt;GetUserProfileInfo($insta_data[&#39;access_token&#39;]);\r\n        \techo &#39;api access token&#39;;\r\n       \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n`$user_exist` is always 0 I don&#39;t know why:/\r\n\r\n**fetch class**\r\n\r\n    class existance\r\n    {\r\n        public function exist($insta_id)\r\n        {\r\n            $Dbobj = new DbConnection();  \r\n            $query = mysqli_query($Dbobj-&gt;getdbconnect(), &quot;SELECT id FROM access WHERE uid=&#39;.$insta_id.&#39;&quot;);\r\n            $total = mysqli_num_rows($query);\r\n            return $total;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public function fetch($insta_id)\r\n        {\r\n            $Dbobj = new DbConnection(); \r\n            $query = mysqli_query($Dbobj-&gt;getdbconnect(), &quot;SELECT * FROM access WHERE uid=&#39;.$insta_id.&#39;&quot;);\r\n            $fetch_data = mysqli_fetch_array($query);\r\n            \r\n            return $fetch_data;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nI am really unsure whether this is a good practice or not but giving my best but also looking for some alternatives as well it would be my pleasure if someone guides me in this:)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/A7CBU.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvEtY.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455747/how-to-insert-access-token-into-mysql-database","title":"How to insert access token into MySQL database?"},{"tags":["eclipse","svn"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14192,"user_id":6505250,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FgNJn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"howlger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6505250/howlger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571488026,"post_id":58455740,"comment_id":103262760,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455740/delete-committed-files-in-svn-with-eclipse#comment103262760_58455740"},{"owner":{"reputation":162,"user_id":1505272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12ff9740769bef5a2a9a6b6e463bb88c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Moxie C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1505272/moxie-c"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14192,"user_id":6505250,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FgNJn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"howlger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6505250/howlger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571670449,"post_id":58455740,"comment_id":103308605,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455740/delete-committed-files-in-svn-with-eclipse#comment103308605_58455740"}],"owner":{"reputation":162,"user_id":1505272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12ff9740769bef5a2a9a6b6e463bb88c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Moxie C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1505272/moxie-c"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571420344,"creation_date":1571420344,"question_id":58455740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455740","body_markdown":"I am using Eclipse Version: Kepler Service Release 2 Build and using SVN.

The equation of a line is `x = c` where `c` is a constant. You can substitute the value of x or y into the circle equation. For example, for `x = 2`:\r\n\r\n`2^2 + y^2 = r^2 =&gt; 4 + y^2 = r^2`\r\n\r\n`r` is given to you too, so substitute that in `r = 1 =&gt; 4 + y^2 = 1^2 = 1`\r\n\r\n`=&gt; y^2 = -3`\r\n\r\nHence, since there&#39;s no (real) square root of `-3`, they don&#39;t collide.\r\n\r\nIf the circle is sufficiently big enough, relative to the square, there will be a real solution to the last part. Our equation of a line that represents the square&#39;s side should actually be constrained since the squares straight lines don&#39;t go on forever, they stop at `x = y = +- square_length/2`. So check if `y(from equation) &lt; y(square_height)` (or `x` and `width`, they&#39;re the same). So essentially, there are 2 cases you need to check.

For example, `Foo&lt;Bar&gt;` as a type.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m curious whether any languages allow us to parameterise types with specific integer values, like `Foo&lt;10&gt;`. A simple example of a use case might be a fixed length array that could be statically checked by the type checker.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m particularly interested in languages that might allow basic mathematical operations within the type system. This C# style pseudocode would concatenate two fixed length arrays into a third fixed length array with a known length, which would be calculated and treated as a constant by the compiler.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFixedArray&lt;Length1 + Length2&gt; Concat&lt;Length1, Length2&gt;(FixedArray&lt;Length1&gt; a, FixedArray&lt;Length2&gt; b)\r\n    where Length1: Integer, &gt;= 0\r\n    where Length2: Integer, &gt;= 0\r\n    {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m aware of TypeScript, which comes close. It allows constants as types, so `Foo&lt;10&gt;` is valid. However, I believe the type system treats them more like enums or symbols, and doesn&#39;t understand them as mathematical values. There are ways to fake this a bit using overloading.\r\n\r\nResearch keywords and documents discussing features like this - even if not implemented in a language - are of interest. Resources that don&#39;t presume a deep familiarity with type theory are preferred, although I&#39;ll take anything.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455707/are-there-any-languages-which-incorporate-integer-maths-into-their-type-system","title":"Are there any languages which incorporate integer maths into their type system?"},{"tags":["excel","vba","offset"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":104684,"user_id":4851590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xlEi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Craner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4851590/scott-craner"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571420448,"post_id":58455705,"comment_id":103248702,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455705/what-is-wrong-with-the-bolded-code-below-what-code-should-i-use-to-add-an-unkno#comment103248702_58455705"},{"owner":{"reputation":98748,"user_id":478884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLckc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Williams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/478884/tim-williams"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571420798,"post_id":58455705,"comment_id":103248850,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455705/what-is-wrong-with-the-bolded-code-below-what-code-should-i-use-to-add-an-unkno#comment103248850_58455705"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12239224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20b1fc8ea207d7c6f8eb9ece07a01fcb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ITSUPPORTHELP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239224/itsupporthelp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571654435,"post_id":58455705,"comment_id":103300131,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455705/what-is-wrong-with-the-bolded-code-below-what-code-should-i-use-to-add-an-unkno#comment103300131_58455705"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12239224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20b1fc8ea207d7c6f8eb9ece07a01fcb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ITSUPPORTHELP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239224/itsupporthelp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571655020,"post_id":58455705,"comment_id":103300395,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455705/what-is-wrong-with-the-bolded-code-below-what-code-should-i-use-to-add-an-unkno#comment103300395_58455705"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12239224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20b1fc8ea207d7c6f8eb9ece07a01fcb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ITSUPPORTHELP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239224/itsupporthelp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571655355,"post_id":58455705,"comment_id":103300540,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455705/what-is-wrong-with-the-bolded-code-below-what-code-should-i-use-to-add-an-unkno#comment103300540_58455705"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12239224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20b1fc8ea207d7c6f8eb9ece07a01fcb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ITSUPPORTHELP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239224/itsupporthelp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":98748,"user_id":478884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLckc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Williams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/478884/tim-williams"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571420275,"creation_date":1571420180,"last_edit_date":1571420275,"question_id":58455705,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455705","body_markdown":"How can I fix this code **&quot;rFound.Offset(0, 2).Value = rFound.Offset(0, 2).Value + 1&quot;**.

On the other hand, if you change the selection by clicking on a row and then pressing &quot;Shift+Arrows&quot;, the selection behaves as one would expect.\r\n\r\nI should note that if you change the selected row by calling `Gtk.TreeSelection.select_iter`, the UI updates as you would expect and calling `Gtk.TreeSelection.get_selected_rows()` returns the rows it should. It&#39;s only when you then try to select multiple rows using the arrow keys that you get strange behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps best illustrated in this self contained example, which I&#39;ve tried to make as simple as possible:\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\n    import gi\r\n    gi.require_version(&#39;Gtk&#39;, &#39;3.0&#39;)\r\n    from gi.repository import Gtk\r\n\r\n    class TreeViewBug(Gtk.Window):\r\n\r\n      def __init__(self):\r\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self)\r\n        self.connect(&#39;destroy&#39;, Gtk.main_quit)\r\n\r\n        # Create model consisting of row path and a name\r\n        self.treeModel = Gtk.ListStore(int, str)\r\n        self.treeModel.append([0, &#39;alice&#39;])\r\n        self.treeModel.append([1, &#39;bob&#39;])\r\n        self.treeModel.append([2, &#39;chad&#39;])\r\n        self.treeModel.append([3, &#39;dan&#39;])\r\n        self.treeModel.append([4, &#39;emma&#39;])\r\n\r\n        self.treeView = Gtk.TreeView()\r\n        self.treeView.append_column(Gtk.TreeViewColumn(&#39;path&#39;, Gtk.CellRendererText(), text=0))\r\n        self.treeView.append_column(Gtk.TreeViewColumn(&#39;name&#39;, Gtk.CellRendererText(), text=1))\r\n        self.treeView.set_model(self.treeModel)\r\n\r\n        # Allow for multiple selection\r\n        self.treeView.get_selection().set_mode(Gtk.SelectionMode.MULTIPLE)\r\n\r\n        self.add(self.treeView)\r\n        \r\n      def run(self):\r\n        self.show_all()\r\n\r\n        # Focus the TreeView so we can test multiple select via keyboard without clicking on a row\r\n        self.treeView.grab_focus()\r\n\r\n        # Manually change the selected row to the row with &quot;chad&quot;\r\n        chadIter = self.treeModel[2].iter\r\n        self.treeView.get_selection().select_iter(chadIter)\r\n\r\n        print(&#39;Press &quot;Shift+Down&quot; and see what happens&#39;)\r\n        print(&#39;  it should select &quot;chad, dan&quot;, but instead it selects &quot;bob, chad&quot;&#39;)\r\n        print(&#39;Afterwards, try clicking on &quot;chad&quot; and then pressing Shift+Down. It should behave normally&#39;)\r\n\r\n        Gtk.main()\r\n\r\n    if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n      tv = TreeViewBug()\r\n      tv.run()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Things I&#39;ve tried**\r\n\r\nI initially encountered the bug when my code changed the selected row via `Gtk.TreeSelection.select_iter` in response to a button click. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried:\r\n\r\n - adding a custom select function (`Gtk.TreeSelection.set_select_function`)\r\n - clearing the selection before changing it (`Gtk.TreeSelection.unselect_all`)\r\n - changing the selection asynchronously (`GLib.idle_add`).\r\n - redrawing `TreeView` after changing selection\r\n\r\n**Speculations**\r\n\r\nI&#39;m guessing that `TreeView`/`TreeViewSelection` has some internal state variable tracking selection and row that, for some reason, isn&#39;t getting properly updated when `TreeSelection.select_iter` is called. These variables are probably related to UI features, because `TreeSelection.get_selected_rows` still works properly. Also it makes sense the UI would need additional state information since the UI logic of multiple selection depends on previous UI interaction (Shift+Down behaves differently when extending a selection depending on whether you initially selected upwards or downwards)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455685/treeview-multiple-selection-does-not-work-correctly-after-changing-selection-wit","title":"TreeView multiple selection does not

still looking for an explanation as to why the issue occurs, but I&#39;ll post my (albeit somewhat hacky) workaround here in case it helps anyone else.

When restarting the script I want to be able to kill the background process and exit it cleanly by sending it a `CTRL_C_EVENT` signal.

the question should have included is\r\n\r\n 1. The table schema, preferrably the CREATE TABLE statement used to define the table.\r\n 2. The SQL statement used in opening the `sqlite_datareader`.\r\n\r\nAny time you&#39;re dealing with data type issues from a database, it is prudent to include such information.  Otherwise there is much unnecessary guessing and floundering (as apparent in the comments), when so very useful, crucial information is explicitly defined in the schema DDL.  The underlying query for getting the data is perhaps less critical, but it could very well be part of the issue if there are CAST statements and/or other expressions that might be affecting the returned types.  If I were debugging the issue on my own system, these are the first thing I would have checked!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe comments contain good discussion, but a best solution will come with understanding how [sqlite handles data types](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html) straight from the official docs.  The key takeaway is that sqlite defines type affinities on a column and then stores actual values according to a limited set of storage classes.  A type affinity is *a type to which data will attempt to be converted before storing*.  But (from the docs) ...\r\n\r\n&gt;  The important idea here is that the type is recommended, not required. Any column can still store any type of data.\r\n\r\nBut now consider...\r\n\r\n&gt; A column with TEXT affinity stores all data using storage classes NULL, TEXT or BLOB. If numerical data is inserted into a column with TEXT affinity it is converted into text form before being stored.\r\n\r\nSo even though values of **any storage class** can be stored in **any column**, the default behavior should have been to convert any numeric values, like `350297`, as a string before storing the value... *if the column was properly declared as a TEXT type*.\r\n\r\nBut if you read carefully enough, you&#39;ll eventually come to the following at the end of section *3.1.1. Affinity Name Examples*:\r\n\r\n&gt; **And the declared type of &quot;STRING&quot; has an affinity of NUMERIC, not TEXT.**\r\n\r\nSo if the question details are taken literally and `field1` was defined like `field1 STRING`, then technically it has NUMERIC affinity and **so a value like `350297` would have been stored as an integer, not a string**.  And the behavior described in the question is precisely what one would expect when retrieving data into strictly-typed data model like `System.Data.SQLite`.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to cuss at such an unintuitive design decisions and I won&#39;t defend the behavior, but \r\n\r\n 1. at least the results of &quot;STRING&quot; type are clearly stated so that the column can be redefined to TEXT in order to fix the problem, and   \r\n 2. &quot;STRING&quot; is actually not a standard SQL data type.  SQL strings are instead defined with TEXT, NTEXT, CHAR, NCHAR, VARCHAR, NVARCHAR, etc.\r\n\r\n**The solution** is either to use code as currently implemented:  Get all values as objects and then convert to string values... which should be universally possible with .Net objects since they should all have `ToString()` method defined.\r\n\r\nOr, redefine the column to have TEXT affinity like\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE myTable (\r\n       ...\r\n       field1 TEXT,\r\n       ...\r\n    )\r\n\r\nExactly how to redefine an existing column filled with data is another question altogether.  However, at least when doing the conversion from the original to the new column, remember to use a `CAST(field1 AS TEXT)` to ensure the storage class is changed for the existing data.  (I&#39;m not certain whether type affinity is &quot;enforced&quot; when simply copying/inserting data from an existing table into another or if the original storage class is preserved by default.  That&#39;s why I suggest the cast to force it to a text value.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455678/invalidcastexception-when-using-datareader-getstring-on-a-string-field-that-co/58471063#58471063","title":"InvalidCastException when using datareader.getString() on a string field that contains numerical value"}],"owner":{"reputation":1089,"user_id":9040866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WW6Gx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"silencedogood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9040866/silencedogood"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1089,"user_id":9040866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WW6Gx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"silencedogood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9040866/silencedogood"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58471063,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571559166,"creation_date":1571420043,"last_edit_date":1571421113,"question_id":58455678,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455678","body_markdown":"I have a field in a sqlite database, we&#39;ll call it `field1`, on which I&#39;m trying to iterate over each record (there&#39;s over a thousand records).

Merges the two files into one file containing a list of all clients, maintaining ID member order.\r\n\r\nI know I have to use `#include &lt;fstream&gt;` to open and process the files, but am unsure how to go from there.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455664/merging-two-files-in-c","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"merging two files in c++"},{"tags":["javascript","html","forms"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10884,"user_id":1449624,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e25733719a24d1b446e2c44a6e12583c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"A1rPun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1449624/a1rpun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571420821,"post_id":58455663,"comment_id":103248864,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455663/how-can-you-rank-certain-total-values-with-javascript-within-a-form-built-in-htm#comment103248864_58455663"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":10549827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XGgBZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"matthew-e-brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549827/matthew-e-brown"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571421879,"creation_date":1571421879,"answer_id":58456045,"question_id":58455663,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58456045","body_markdown":"If I&#39;m understanding your question correctly, you just want to place a number in these three sections&#39; &quot;Rank&quot; column based on how well the user performed in each?\r\n\r\nYou should be able to just compare the text content of the &quot;Percent Achieved&quot; columns (I assume that&#39;s what you want to compare).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I would do (after giving the top table an ID of &#39;results&#39;):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction calculateRankings() {\r\n  // grab all the spans that hold the percentages\r\n  const spans = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;#results td:nth-child(4) span&#39;);\r\n  \r\n  // make a list of objects, making up a percentage and its corresponding rank column \r\n  const percentages = [];\r\n  for (const span of spans) {\r\n     percentages.push({\r\n       //some way to select the neighboring rankings column:\r\n       e: span.parentElement.nextSibling, // &lt;&lt;---- YOU&#39;LL HAVE TO CHANGE THIS!!\r\n       p: Number(span.innerText.replace(&#39;%&#39;, &#39;&#39;))\r\n     });\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // sort based on the percentage field of each object \r\n  percentages.sort((a, b) =&gt; a.p - b.p);\r\n  \r\n  // place an index based on the order of the list \r\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; percentages.length; i++) {\r\n    percentages[i].e.innerText = i + 1;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t test this but it should be a good place to start.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455663/how-can-you-rank-certain-total-values-with-javascript-within-a-form-built-in-htm/58456045#58456045","title":"How can you rank certain total values with JavaScript within a form built in HTML?"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":7015719,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1338481516184239/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jos&#233; Pablo Huizar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7015719/jos%c3%a9-pablo-huizar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7667,"user_id":6634591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHVdG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Luca Kiebel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6634591/luca-kiebel"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571421879,"creation_date":1571419974,"last_edit_date":1571420053,"question_id":58455663,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455663","body_markdown":"I have a simple form in HTML. There are 3 sections (Section A, B and C). As the user fills out the form each section is calculated by displaying total points and percentage. I would like to rank the scores and display it in the ranking column but cannot seem to figure how to do it. For example if Section A has 4 points and Section B has 3 points and Section C has 0 points then section A would have the rank of 1, section B would have the rank of 2 and section C would have the rank of 3. Also having the ranking change as the form is being filled out would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI am new to JavaScript and am having trouble on how to logically implement this. This is just a sample of my form. I really have a much larger form with more sections and questions. Please run my code so you can see a better visual. Any code snippets and advice that would help me will be appreciated. Also if you can keep my code as it is because I have alot more code depending on how my code is structured.

You can only have a single value for `CMD` so setting it a second time overwrites any previous settings.\n\nContainers can only have a single process to start, and that process is run as pid 1 inside the container. Once that process exits, the entire container is stopped, including any background processes run.\n\nTherefore, you need to set the `CMD` to whatever command or script you want to run, and that command needs to remain running for the duration of your container&#39;s lifetime. That could be as easy as running `tail -f /dev/null` as the last line of your script. However the recommended practice is to run your app in the foreground rather than background daemons that may crash unnoticed. I&#39;d you really need multiple daemons inside a container, there&#39;s tools like supervisord. But in most cases, you are better off running multiple containers, one per service, and communicate between those services over a shared docker network. `docker-compose` is very useful to setup this network and deploy your containers with the appropriate configurations.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455642/docker-entrypoint-using-dos2unix/58459300#58459300","title":"docker entrypoint using dos2unix"}],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":3521261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TC5W6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Karun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3521261/karun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":157,"user_id":3521261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TC5W6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Karun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3521261/karun"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58459300,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571441937,"creation_date":1571419895,"last_edit_date":1571426477,"question_id":58455642,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455642","body_markdown":" - When I run *docker-compose up -d --build*\r\n - The dockerfile does not trigger the CMD bash /webapp/runscript.sh\r\n - Said differently...I don&#39;t see the redis-server or celery application running when I exec into the container\r\n - If I manually run &quot;bash /webapp/runscrip.sh&quot;; the processes end up running\r\n - I originally tried *Entrypoint [&#39;bash&#39;, &#39;/webapp/runscript.sh&#39;]* as well\r\n   with no luck.

It&#39;s another simpl optimization, for clearing `Activities` in background (where process might be still alive).\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/perf/lmkd#using_userspace_lmkd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455638/why-in-api-28-the-app-is-not-really-killed-when-background-process-limit-no-b/58455820#58455820","title":"why in api 28 the app is not really killed when &quot;Background process limit - No background processes&quot;

Part of the requirements includes  it generates zero or more warnings or errors and includes those with the result. I&#39;m also writing unit tests which, in particular, have some contrived data to verify the right warnings are emitted.\r\n\r\nI need to be able to parse the warnings/errors and verify that the expected messages are correctly emitted. I figured I&#39;d store the messages in a container and reference them with a message ID which is pretty similar to how I&#39;ve done localization in the past.\r\n\r\n`errormessages.py` right now looks pretty similar to:\r\n```python3\r\nfrom enum import IntEnum\r\nNO_MESSAGE = (&#39;&#39;)\r\nHELLO = (&#39;Hello, World&#39;)\r\nGOODBYE = (&#39;Goodbye&#39;)\r\n\r\nclass MsgId(IntEnum):\r\n    NO_MESSAGE = 0\r\n    HELLO = 1\r\n    GOODBYE = 2\r\n\r\nMsg = {\r\n    MessageId.NO_MESSAGE: NO_MESSAGE,\r\n    MessageId.HELLO: HELLO,\r\n    MessageId.GOODBYE: GOODBYE,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo then the analysis can look similar to this:\r\n```python3\r\nfrom errormessages import Msg, MsgId\r\ndef analyse(_):\r\n    errors = []\r\n    errors.append(Msg[MsgId.HELLO])\r\n    return _, errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the unit tests I can do something similar to\r\n```python3\r\nfrom errormessages import Msg, MsgId\r\nfrom my import analyse\r\ndef test_hello():\r\n    _, errors = analyse(&#39;toy&#39;)\r\n    assert Msg[MsgId.HELLO] in errors\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBut some of the messages get formatted and I think that&#39;s going to play hell with parsing the messages for unit tests. I was thinking I&#39;d add flavors of the messages; one for formatting and the other for parsing:\r\n\r\nupdated `errormessages.py`:\r\n```python3\r\nfrom enum import IntEnum\r\nimport re\r\nFORMAT_NO_MESSAGE = (&#39;&#39;)\r\nFORMAT_HELLO = (&#39;Hello, {}&#39;)\r\nFORMAT_GOODBYE = (&#39;Goodbye&#39;)\r\n\r\nPARSE_NO_MESSAGE = re.compile(r&#39;^$&#39;)\r\nPARSE_HELLO = re.compile(r&#39;^Hello, (.*)$&#39;)\r\nPARSE_GOODBYE = re.compile(&#39;^Goodbye$&#39;)\r\n\r\nclass MsgId(IntEnum):\r\n    NO_MESSAGE = 0\r\n    HELLO = 1\r\n    GOODBYE = 2\r\n\r\nMsg = {\r\n    MessageId.NO_MESSAGE: (FORMAT_NO_MESSAGE, PARSE_NO_MESSAGE),\r\n    MessageId.HELLO: (FORMAT_HELLO, PARSE_HELLO),\r\n    MessageId.GOODBYE: (FORMAT_GOODBYE, PARSE_GOODBYE),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSo then the analysis can look like:\r\n```python3\r\nfrom errormessages import Msg, MsgId\r\ndef analyse(_):\r\n    errors = []\r\n    errors.append(Msg[MsgId.HELLO][0].format(&#39;World&#39;))\r\n    return _, errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the unit tests I can do:\r\n```python3\r\nfrom errormessages import Msg, MsgId\r\nfrom my import analyse\r\nimport re\r\ndef test_hello():\r\n    _, errors = analyse(&#39;toy&#39;)\r\n    expected = {v: [] for v in MsgId}\r\n    expected[MsgId.HELLO] = [\r\n        Msg[MsgId.HELLO][1].match(msg)\r\n        for msg in errors\r\n    ]\r\n    for _,v in expected.items():\r\n        if _ == MsgId.HELLO:\r\n            assert v\r\n        else:\r\n            assert not v\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there&#39;s perhaps a better / simpler way? In particular, the messages are effectively repeated twice; once for the formatter and once for the regular expression. Is there a way to use a single string for both formatting and regular expression capturing?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455636/verifying-formatted-messages","title":"verifying formatted messages"},{"tags":["python","pandas","performance"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5586,"user_id":11884237,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANKZR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ansev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11884237/ansev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5586,"user_id":11884237,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANKZR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ansev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11884237/ansev"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571420404,"last_edit_date":1571420404,"creation_date":1571420060,"answer_id":58455681,"question_id":58455631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455681","body_markdown":"Use [`Series.isin`][1]:\r\n\r\n    puffer = outfile.loc[outfile[&#39;picturename&#39;].isin(name)]\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    print(df2)\r\n        C   D   E\r\n    0   b   a   l\r\n    1   h  bb   h\r\n    2   r   f   b\r\n    3  cc   g   a\r\n    4   d   r  dd\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    name=[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;d&#39;]\r\n    df2.loc[df2[&#39;C&#39;].isin(name)]\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n       C  D   E\r\n    0  b  a   l\r\n    4  d  r  dd\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.isin.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455631/python-search-string-in-dataframe/58455681#58455681","title":"Python search string in dataframe"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12239820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-enXYDHuoHnc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcdZHbDmA_JkmazzW5XPHKS3ecBig/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Enny Bakery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239820/enny-bakery"},"last_editor":{"reputation":972,"user_id":7542961,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32b2da429fbc6972b707dc3087e171a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mr_U4913","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7542961/mr-u4913"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571425249,"creation_date":1571419841,"last_edit_date":1571425249,"question_id":58455631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455631","body_markdown":"i have a Problem and hope you can help me.

could perhaps write an SQL that writes an SQL:\r\n\r\n\r\n     select REPLACE(\r\n       &#39;SELECT &#39;&#39;{colstub}GuideRef&#39;&#39; as which, {colstub}Qty FROM remainder WHERE {colstub}Ref like &#39;&#39;%somevalue%&#39;&#39; UNION ALL&#39;,\r\n       &#39;{colstub}&#39;,\r\n       REPLACE(column_name, &#39;GuideRef&#39;, &#39;&#39;)\r\n     )  \r\n     FROM information_schema.columns \r\n     WHERE table_name = &#39;remainder&#39; and column_name LIKE &#39;%Ref&#39;\r\n\r\nIt works like &quot;pull all the column names out of the info schema where the column name is like %guideref, replace guideref with nothing to get just the fragment of the column name that is varied: `NWANTguideref -&gt; NWANT, NWANTpreviousguideref -&gt; NWANTprevious ...` then uses this stub to form a query that gives a string depicting the column name, the qty from the quantity column, where the relevant guideref column is LIKE some value&quot;\r\n\r\nIf you run this it will produce a result set like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT &#39;aGuideRef&#39; as which, aQty FROM table WHERE aGuideRef LIKE &#39;%lookingfor%&#39; UNION ALL \r\nSELECT &#39;bGuideRef&#39; as which, bQty FROM table WHERE bGuideRef LIKE &#39;%lookingfor% ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it&#39;s basically utputted a load of strings that are SQLs in themselves. It might need a bit of fine tuning, and hopefully all your columns are reliably and rigidly like `xQty, xGuideRef, xComments` triplets, but it essentially writes most the query for you\r\n\r\nIf you then copy the result set out of the results grid and paste it back into the query window, remove the last UNION ALL and run it, it will search the columns and tell you where it was found as well as the quantity\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not too usable for a production system, but you could do the same in php- run the query, get the strings into another sql command, re-run it..\r\n\r\nI would suggest you consider changing your table structure though:\r\n\r\n   prefix, qty, guideref, comments\r\n   \r\nYou shouldn&#39;t have 86 columns that are the mostly same thing; you should have one column that is one of 86/3 different values then you can just query the guideref and the type. If this were an address table, I&#39;m saying you **shouldn&#39;t* have HomeZipcode, WorkZipcode, UniversityZipcode, MomZipcode, DadZipcode.. and every time you want to store another kind of address you add more columns (BoyfriendZipcode, GirlfriendZipcode, Child1Zipcode...). Instead if you just had an &quot;addresstype&quot; column then you can store any number of different kinds of addresses without recompiling your app and changing your db schema\r\n\r\nYou can use this technique to re-shape the table - write an SQL that writes a bunch of UNION ALL sqls (without WHERE clauses), one of the columns should be the &quot;recordtype&quot; column (from colstub) and the other columns should just be &quot;qty&quot;, &quot;guide&quot;, &quot;comments&quot;. Once you have your result set with the unions you can make a table to hold these 4 things, and then place `INSERT INTO newtable` at the head of the block of unions ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455624/select-columns-names-based-on-user-entry-with-a-mysql-query/58455897#58455897","title":"Select column(s) names based on user entry with a MYSQL query"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11536140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e86f25f2b9bac2b478cdc51aea65be9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bookcellar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11536140/bookcellar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58455897,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571421758,"creation_date":1571419828,"last_edit_date":1571420070,"question_id":58455624,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455624","body_markdown":"Using PHP a secure user will enter a Ref (ex.

have a client running a system with dual Xeon Platinum 8160 hyperthreaded 24 core CPUs and Windows 10 Pro for Workstations 64 bit.

The client spent a lot of money on this system and wants my app to utilize all 96 logical processors. No problem! Based on Microsoft&#39;s documentation, I&#39;ve made the following settings to my app.config\r\n```\r\n  &lt;runtime&gt;\r\n    &lt;Thread_UseAllCpuGroups enabled=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;GCCpuGroup enabled=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;gcServer enabled=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;/runtime&gt;\r\n```\r\nThis should allow the CLR and my app access to all the logical processors present on the client&#39;s machine. But sadly, Environment.ProcessorCount still reports 32 instead of 96. What am I missing?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve checked that his system has 2 processor groups of 48 logical processors each. Two NUMA cores which map to the two physical sockets.

From my understanding, all sites are internally known as groups, from doing work with document libraries.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455619/how-do-you-get-a-list-of-users-for-a-liferay-6-2-site","title":"How do you get a list of users for a Liferay 6.2 site"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","case","erb"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":19947,"user_id":5025116,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WdYi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sebastian Palma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5025116/sebastian-palma"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571420102,"post_id":58455614,"comment_id":103248549,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455614/if-user-signed-in-case-current-user-plan-id-else#comment103248549_58455614"},{"owner":{"reputation":8375,"user_id":847116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YLb4A.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jamesc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/847116/jamesc"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571420756,"post_id":58455614,"comment_id":103248828,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455614/if-user-signed-in-case-current-user-plan-id-else#comment103248828_58455614"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12141121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4zr1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"coopeu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12141121/coopeu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571548015,"post_id":58455614,"comment_id":103274266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455614/if-user-signed-in-case-current-user-plan-id-else#comment103274266_58455614"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12141121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4zr1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"coopeu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12141121/coopeu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571545729,"creation_date":1571545729,"answer_id":58470047,"question_id":58455614,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58470047","body_markdown":"***Thanks!***\r\n\r\n    def user_cat\r\n        if user_signed_in?\r\n          case current_user.plan_id\r\n          when 1 \r\n            &#39;ESPOR&#192;DIC&#39;\r\n          when 2 \r\n            &#39;FREQ&#220;ENT&#39;\r\n          when 3 \r\n            &#39;HABITUAL&#39;\r\n          else\r\n          \t&#39;SUBCRIUTA\\&#39;T&#39; \r\n          end \r\n         else\r\n          &#39;IDENTIFICA\\&#39;T&#39;\r\n        end\r\n      end","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455614/if-user-signed-in-case-current-user-plan-id-else/58470047#58470047","title":"IF user_signed in?

It’s in xml format as you can see the picture below. I’m facing a problem.\r\nI want to access all **‘ne’** elements one by one as shown in below picture. Then I want to access the **text of the ‘W’ elements** which are inside the ‘ne’ elements. Then I want to **concatenate** thy symbols **‘SDi’ and ‘EDi’** with the text of these ‘W’ elements. ‘i’ can take any positive whole number starting from 1. In the case of ‘SDi’ I need only the **text of first ‘W’** element that is inside the ‘ne’ element. In the case of ‘EDi’ I need only the **text of last ‘W’ element** that is inside the ‘ne’ element. \r\nCurrently I don&#39;t get anything as output after running the code. I think this is because of the fact that the element &#39;W&#39; is never accessed. Moreover, i think that element &#39;W&#39; is not accessed because it is a grandchild of element &#39;ne&#39; therefore it can&#39;t be accessed directly rather it may be possible with the help its father node.\r\n\r\nNote1: The number and names of sub elements inside ‘ne’ elements are not same.\r\n\r\nNote2: Only those things are explained here which needed.

I need to share a map between a tc-bpf program and a cgroup bpf program. This should be possible if the map is pinned to file system that act as global namespace. But, I haven&#39;t got this working.\r\n\r\nThe map is created by tc-bpf program and pinned to global namespace. Since it is tc-bpf program, the map is of type  struct bpf_elf_map. This bpf program is loaded via iproute2.\r\n\r\nNow, I have a cgroup bpf program that should be accessing this map, but since it is loaded via a user.c (libbpf) or bpftool and not iproute, the map that is defined here cannot be ‘bpf_elf_map’, but it is struct bpf_map_def. So in the cgroup bpf program, the same map is defined as struct bpf_map_def and not struct bpf_elf_map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably because of this the cgroup program gets a new map_id when I dump the maps (and does not share the intended map), ideally when the same map is shared across bpf programs, these bpf programs would be having the same map_id associated with their unique

Any ideas are appreciated.\r\n\r\nPlease do not link me to another github that tells me to use the request.buffer(), as I have tried many variations.\r\n\r\nError: Protocol error (Network.getResponseBody): No data found for resource with given identifier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455601/intercept-document-download-with-puppeteer-and-extract-csv-data","title":"Intercept document download with Puppeteer and Extract CSV Data"},{"tags":["django"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":487985,"user_id":104349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f4cefeedec5163556751d61625eedd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Roseman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/104349/daniel-roseman"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571419926,"post_id":58455600,"comment_id":103248474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455600/django-template-not-found-although-it-it-exists-in-templates-folder#comment103248474_58455600"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11951494,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2344191829010615/picture?type=large","display_name":"Igor Miranda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11951494/igor-miranda"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571421679,"creation_date":1571421679,"answer_id":58455982,"question_id":58455600,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455982","body_markdown":"You need to set the path of your templates folder in settings.py.\r\n\r\n    TEMPLATES = [\r\n        {\r\n            &#39;BACKEND&#39;: &#39;django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates&#39;,\r\n            &#39;DIRS&#39;: [],\r\n            &#39;APP_DIRS&#39;: True,\r\n            &#39;OPTIONS&#39;: {\r\n                &#39;context_processors&#39;: [\r\n                    &#39;django.template.context_processors.request&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;django.template.context_processors.debug&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;django.template.context_processors.request&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages&#39;,\r\n                ],\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\nLeave DIRS blank and try again.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455600/django-template-not-found-although-it-it-exists-in-templates-folder/58455982#58455982","title":"Django template not found although it it exists in templates folder"}],"owner":{"reputation":1766,"user_id":5452008,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-305SHYPJuxE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/re8EZA9WuXs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"S&#246;ren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5452008/s%c3%b6ren"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571421679,"creation_date":1571419682,"question_id":58455600,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455600","body_markdown":"&gt; Django version 2.2.6\r\n\r\nI have the following folder structure and was expecting Django to find index.html based as it is placed in the default location under templates.\r\nAm I doing something wrong here?

The ImageView fills the screen and is 1080x1920. The Bitmap is centered fit in the ImageView and is 1080x1080. The active region (in terms of y) is thus from 540 to 1380. Touch events in that range properly identified as being in the active region. However...\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWhen I touch, it appears as though the active region starts after the bitmap and ends before it. I also notice that touching the absolute top or bottom of the screen returns neither 0 nor 1920, but similarly offset y coordinates. From this I assume that getY() (and getRawY()) is somehow not accurate, but I cannot determine why.

Moreover, in OCaml, there is no canonical representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to write a function that prints a C printf statement then this is how it will look like in OCaml\r\n\r\n    let print_printf () = \r\n      print_endline {|printf(&quot;%d&quot;);|}\r\n\r\nIn the example above, I&#39;ve used `{||}` to denote a sting literal instead of more common `&quot;&quot;`, since in this literal there is no need to escape special characters and they are interpreted literally (i.e., the don&#39;t have any special meaning).\r\n\r\nYou can achieve the same result using the regular `&quot;&quot;` quotes for denoting it\r\n\r\n    let print_printf () = \r\n      print_endline &quot;printf(\\&quot;%d\\&quot;);&quot;\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the toplevel interaction using these definitions:\r\n\r\n    # let print_printf () = \r\n      print_endline {|printf(&quot;%d&quot;);|};;\r\n    val print_printf : unit -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;\r\n\r\n    # print_printf ();;\r\n    printf(&quot;%d&quot;);\r\n    - : unit = ()\r\n\r\n    # let print_printf () = \r\n      print_endline &quot;printf(\\&quot;%d\\&quot;);&quot;;;\r\n    val print_printf : unit -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;\r\n\r\n    # print_printf ();;\r\n    printf(&quot;%d&quot;);\r\n    - : unit = ()\r\n\r\nIf you will put this code in a file, compile, and execute and redirect into a C file it will be a well-formed C file (modulo the absence of the function body).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455583/ocaml-special-characters-formatting/58456423#58456423","title":"OCaml

So, I tried a simple straight assembly source program:\r\n\r\n     # From GASProfessional Book - location 108 ff\r\n     # cpuid.s Sample program to extract the processor Vendor ID\r\n     \r\n     .section .data\r\n     \r\n     output:\r\n       .ascii &quot;The processor Vendor ID is &#39;xxxxxxxxxxxx&#39;\\n&quot;\r\n       \r\n     .section .text\r\n     \r\n     .globl _start\r\n     \r\n     _start:\r\n     \r\n       movl $0, %eax           # Get the CPU&#39;s Vendor ID\r\n       cpuid\r\n       \r\n       movl $output, %edi      # Setup the output string\r\n       movl %ebx, 28(%edi)\r\n       movl %edx, 32(%edi)\r\n       movl %ecx, 36(%edi)\r\n       \r\n       movl $4, %eax           # Display the output string\r\n       movl $1, %ebx\r\n       movl $output, %ecx\r\n       movl $42, %edx\r\n       int $0x80\r\n       \r\n       movl $1, %eax           # Exit 0\r\n       movl $0, %ebx\r\n       int $0x80\r\n       \r\nThen I did:\r\n\r\n     as -o cpuid.o cpuid.s\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n     ld -o cpuid cpuid.s\r\n\r\nand the command:\r\n\r\n     ./cpuid\r\n\r\nthen produced:\r\n\r\n     The processor Vendor ID is &#39;GenuineIntel&#39;\r\n\r\nas expected.\r\n\r\nSo, in the c program, perhaps I need to play around with main vs. _start ??

Fairly new at Excel VBA here and I&#39;m taking some paid courses right now to get better but I&#39;ve run into a road block and googling isn&#39;t getting me the results I&#39;m looking for.\r\n\r\nI have an ever growing tracking spreadsheet which shows data about what we&#39;ve processed (we call it &quot;building it&quot;) in a column and then data showing we&#39;ve checked (we call it as having been audited) that data we&#39;ve processed in other column. I want to find the year is was processed and find if it was audited regardless of the year of the audit and if so add it up. I want to do this for every year, so 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 etc. etc. \r\n\r\nThen finally place the findings for each year in a dashboard cell.\r\n\r\nE.g. search column J which contains a date we processed the data from 2017, then look at the audited column in the same row (which also contains a date) if there is anything in there and to count 1. Then do it again and again until the whole range has been checked. Each time we find a date from 2017 we add one and we do this for each year. At the end of the search the results for each year needs to be entered in the dashboard sheet.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to write code for it to check every year instead of having to call out each year specifically?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve gotten so far but I keep running into an error. Either &quot;next without for&quot; and others which I can&#39;t remember now. I&#39;ve googled and added all sorts of stuff and moving it etc. etc. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m doing something really obviously wrong here but I&#39;m just not seeing it.
