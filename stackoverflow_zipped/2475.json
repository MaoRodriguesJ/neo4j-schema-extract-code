Earlier there were two seperate folders `index.js` for each `android` and `iOS`. So it created two different bundle files like `index.android.js` and `index.iOS.js` file during compilation.\r\n\r\n2. Now these two files are merged and rendered using a single file known as `index.js`.\r\n\r\nYour command : `react-native bundle --platform android --entry-file index.js --reset-cache --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --dev false --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res/` is basically for `index.js` which works because may be there is a `index.js` file but no `index.android.js`.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make it work please upgrade your react-native-sentry to version `react-native-sentry@0.43.2`.

Ingresses can do a bunch of things including send traffic to different Services based on paths.\r\n\r\nAn Ingress to get you started might look something like:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\r\nkind: Ingress\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: test-ingress\r\nspec:\r\n  rules:\r\n  - http:\r\n      paths:\r\n      - path: /api/user\r\n        backend:\r\n          serviceName: post-service\r\n          servicePort: 44884\r\n      - path: /api/post\r\n        backend:\r\n          serviceName: user-service\r\n          servicePort: 33883 # Or whatever port your user-service is using\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, what makes an Ingress work varies depending on how you&#39;re running your Kubernetes cluster. For example, if you&#39;re using GKE, an Ingress is actually implemented as an [HTTP load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/http-balancer). If you&#39;re using EKS, it&#39;s implemented as an [Application load balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/kubernetes-ingress-aws-alb-ingress-controller/). Each load balancer has lots of features and options, but the big one you should know about before starting anything is they will cost additional money on top of running your cluster.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nAs prometherion mentioned in the comments, Ingresses allow traffic from outside of your cluster. If you&#39;re running a publicly-exposed website of some type, this is probably what you want. However, if these are internal endpoints that should not be exposed to the outside world, you might want to investigate [service meshes from prometherion&#39;s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57947240/868533) instead.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57947088/unify-service-endpoints-in-kubernetes/57947293#57947293","title":"Unify service endpoints in kubernetes"}],"owner":{"reputation":8137,"user_id":2630261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VXBi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BendEg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630261/bendeg"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57947293,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568574358,"creation_date":1568572235,"question_id":57947088,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57947088","body_markdown":"Is it possible to &quot;unify&quot; the endpoints of single services running in kubernetes?

I have defined a literal `&quot;&quot;_err` that takes `long double` as an argument and returns a struct called `Error`. For instance, `1.3_err`.\r\n\r\nA `friend` declaration for this literal is placed in the header file `TStat.h`, and the definition is placed in `TStat.cpp`, as you&#39;ll see in the code below.\r\n\r\nHowever, I got an error when compiling with an example like `b = 0.4_err` where `b` is `Error`. In the error it says it couldn&#39;t find the literal operator. You may check the error message at the end of this question.\r\n\r\nI have tried many combinations, like defining the literal internally or externally, etc. I have searched similar questions but everything seems fine in the code, just like it is described by many tutorials and other C++ sources.\r\n\r\nAs a particle physicist, I use a C/C++ library called [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch) developed by CERN which is actually a C/C++ interpreter. There, I could use this class without any errors (I haven&#39;t used any ROOT class at all). However, when I compile my code by `g++` with `c++11` flag, no match for the literal could be found.\r\n\r\nThis is the header file:\r\n\r\n    #ifdef TSTAT_H\r\n    #define TSTAT_H\r\n \r\n    namespace TStat {\r\n        struct Error {\r\n            // ...\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        class Double {\r\n            // constructors, etc.\r\n            // ...\r\n\r\n            friend Error operator &quot;&quot; _err (long double);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand this is the TStat.cpp file:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &quot;TStat.h&quot;\r\n\r\nusing namespace TStat;\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nTStat::Error operator&quot;&quot; _err(long double err) {\r\n    TStat::Error error;\r\n    // ...\r\n    return error;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiled with the following command in the terminal (I am using MacOS)\r\n\r\n    g++ -Wall -g -std=c++11 example.cpp TStat.cpp -o example.exe\r\n\r\nI get an error saying\r\n\r\n    example.cpp:6:12: error: no matching literal operator for

    for k = to j -i - 1\r\n\r\nIt should read:\r\n\r\n    for k = 0 to j - i - 1\r\n\r\nThere are a few things to bear in mind when converting to Python:\r\n\r\n* In Python the first list element is at index 0, not index 1 as is the case in that pseudo code. So that means you need to subtract one at several places (where it concerns `i` and `j`).\r\n\r\n* Similarly, the `range` function&#39;s second argument (the &quot;end&quot; of the range) is a value that is *not* included in the range, while in the pseudo code, what follows `to` *is* included.\r\n\r\nSo here is how you could translate the code:\r\n\r\n    A= [int(i) for i in input (&#39;Enter Number&#39;).split()]\r\n    \r\n    for j in range(1, len(A)):\r\n        i = 0 # zero-based index\r\n        while A[j] &gt; A[i]:\r\n            i = i+1\r\n        key = A[j]\r\n        for k in range(0, j-i):\r\n            A[j-k] = A[j-k-1]\r\n        A[i] = key\r\n    \r\nAs stated in comments, the loop on `k` seems overly complex. It could just be:\r\n\r\n    for k in range(j, i, -1):\r\n        A[k] = A[k-1]\r\n\r\nAnd a bit more pythonic would be to replace that `for` loop with:\r\n\r\n    A[i+1:j+1] = A[i:j] \r\n\r\nFinally, the outer loop can take the index and value (`key`) with `enumerate`, which saves a few repetitive list look-ups in the form of `A[j]`:\r\n\r\n    for j, key in enumerate(A):\r\n        i = 0\r\n        while val &gt; A[i]:\r\n            i = i+1\r\n        A[i+1:j+1] = A[i:j]\r\n        A[i] = key\r\n\r\nWith this `for` loop, you get one more iteration (with `j == 0`) which does nothing really, so you may decide to use the original loop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57947053/write-this-pseudocode-in-python/57948340#57948340","title":"Write this pseudocode in python"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11791101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f59cb6f00920f7743749eae56999d18?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rabada123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11791101/rabada123"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1568584301,"creation_date":1568572011,"question_id":57947053,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57947053","body_markdown":"I am trying to convert this pseudocode into python code \r\n\r\n    1 for j = 2 to A.length\r\n    2     i=1\r\n    3        while A[j]&gt;A[i]\r\n    4             i = i+1\r\n    5        key = A[j]\r\n    6        for k = to j -i - 1\r\n    7           A[j-k] = A[j-k-1]\r\n    8        A[i] = key\r\n\r\nThe program says that i have to take 10 inputs and display it in the sorted array using Insertion sort algorithm Here&#39;s what i done at the moment i&#39;m stuck at line 6 how do i convert that to python code \r\n\r\n    A= [int(i) for i in input (&#39;Enter Number&#39;).spilt()]\r\n    \r\n        for j in range(2, len(A)):\r\n            i = 1:\r\n                while A[j] &gt; A[i]:\r\n                    i = i+1\r\n                key = A[j]\r\n                for:#?\r\n                    A[j-k] = A[j-k-1]\r\n                A[i] = key\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57947053/write-this-pseudocode-in-python","title":"Write this pseudocode in python"},{"tags":["c#","linq"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":3452747,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca3876950b3c443e6cfe022a88a1bce5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shawn V","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3452747/shawn-v"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568573272,"post_id":57947129,"comment_id":102307567,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57947052/c-linq-find-list-inside-another-list-better-way-to-code-this-than-a-foreach-lo/57947129#comment102307567_57947129"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2577,"user_id":1832330,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A_qG09cVlMw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcCqt6qmCk-turs85lQitFbJhgA3g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zhuber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832330/zhuber"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568572502,"creation_date":1568572502,"answer_id":57947129,"question_id":57947052,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57947129","body_markdown":"    var result = npcData.Where(\r\n        n =&gt; n.active == true || \r\n        eventData.Any(e =&gt; e.can_display == true &amp;&amp; e.npc_id == n.id)\r\n    );","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57947052/c-linq-find-list-inside-another-list-better-way-to-code-this-than-a-foreach-lo/57947129#57947129","title":"C# LINQ Find List Inside Another List, Better way to code this than a foreach loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":3452747,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca3876950b3c443e6cfe022a88a1bce5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shawn V","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3452747/shawn-v"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57947129,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568572502,"creation_date":1568572010,"question_id":57947052,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57947052","body_markdown":"I have two lists. npcData and eventData.

This way the Angular binding takes care of applying the CSS classes so you don&#39;t need to set styles manually.\r\n\r\nTo implement this solution first define the CSS classes for the canvas and the different cursor sizes. For example:\r\n\r\n    .myCanvas {\r\n      width: 400px;\r\n      height: 400px;\r\n      background-color: green;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .brush18px {\r\n      cursor: url(&#39;brush18px.png&#39;), auto;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .brush24px {\r\n      cursor: url(&#39;brush24px.png&#39;), auto;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .brush36px {\r\n      cursor: url(&#39;brush36px.png&#39;), auto;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen in the component you define a property that will provide the classes for the canvas and a property for the size of the brush. For example:\r\n\r\n    @Component({\r\n      selector: &#39;my-app&#39;,\r\n      templateUrl: &#39;./app.component.html&#39;,\r\n      styleUrls: [ &#39;./app.component.css&#39; ]\r\n    })\r\n    export class AppComponent  {\r\n      name = &#39;Angular&#39;;\r\n      @Input() cursorSize = &#39;18&#39;;\r\n      get canvasClasses() {\r\n        return {\r\n          myCanvas: true,\r\n          brush18px: this.cursorSize === &#39;18&#39;,\r\n          brush24px: this.cursorSize === &#39;24&#39;,\r\n          brush36px: this.cursorSize === &#39;36&#39;,\r\n        };\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `canvasClasses` property must return an object that specifies for each CSS class name if it is applied or not by setting the value to true or false. I use a getter property here so the values update automatically when the size changes.\r\n\r\nNow you can bind this in the template and the cursor will automatically update based on the `cursorSize` value.\r\n\r\nHere is how the template looks like:\r\n\r\n    &lt;canvas [ngClass]=&quot;canvasClasses&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\r\n    &lt;br/&gt;\r\n    &lt;select [(ngModel)]=&quot;cursorSize&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;option&gt;18&lt;/option&gt;\r\n      &lt;option&gt;24&lt;/option&gt;\r\n      &lt;option&gt;36&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;/select&gt;\r\n\r\nI have created also a working [StackBlitz sample][2] so you can see it in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#ngclass\r\n  [2]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-cursor?file=src/app/app.component.ts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57947037/resize-the-cursor/57948710#57948710","title":"Resize the cursor"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4450,"user_id":6200414,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a9e4ed371b7b19a4fbf4b483aa2a79a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AlesD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6200414/alesd"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568847158,"creation_date":1568847158,"answer_id":58001671,"question_id":57947037,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58001671","body_markdown":"Another possible solution based on the comment on the first answer. This is more of a workaround solution where you hide the actual cursor and move around an image instead so it looks like it is the cursor. This was inspired by the second answer on this [post][1] about resizing a cursor image.\r\n\r\nI implemented this solution in Angular using a directive that you add to the canvas element in the template. The directive takes as the main parameter the image to show as the cursor and  has an additional parameter for the size for the image. I recommend an SVG image that resizes well. Still it is possible to use also a standard image. \r\n\r\nHere is the implementation of the Directive for an SVG image:\r\n\r\n    @Directive({\r\n      selector: &#39;[svgCursor]&#39;\r\n    })\r\n    export class SvgCursorDirective {\r\n      private cursorSizeValue: number = 16;\r\n      @Input(&#39;svgCursor&#39;) public svgImage: SVGSVGElement;\r\n      @Input() public set cursorSize(cursorSize: number) {\r\n        this.cursorSizeValue = cursorSize;\r\n        this.updateCursorSize();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      constructor(el: ElementRef) {\r\n        el.nativeElement.style.cursor = &#39;none&#39;; // hides the browser cursor\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @HostListener(&#39;mouseenter&#39;) onMouseEnter() {\r\n        // makes image visible only when mous enters the element\r\n        this.svgImage.style.visibility = &#39;visible&#39;;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @HostListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, [&#39;$event&#39;]) onMouseMove(e: MouseEvent) {\r\n        // draws the image at the mouse position\r\n        this.svgImage.style.left = e.clientX.toString();\r\n        this.svgImage.style.top = (e.clientY - this.cursorSizeValue).toString();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @HostListener(&#39;mouseleave&#39;) onMouseLeave() {\r\n        // hides image when the mouse leaves the element\r\n        this.svgImage.style.visibility = &#39;hidden&#39;;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      private updateCursorSize() {\r\n        if (this.svgImage != null) {\r\n          this.svgImage.style.width = this.cursorSizeValue.toString();\r\n          this.svgImage.style.height = this.cursorSizeValue.toString();\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOnce you have the directive you can use it in the following way inside a component template:\r\n\r\n    &lt;svg #cursorImage class=&quot;cursor&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M0 0h24v24H0z&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot;/&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M7 14c-1.66 0-3 1.34-3 3 0 1.31-1.16 2-2 2 .92 1.22 2.49 2 4 2 2.21 0 4-1.79 4-4 0-1.66-1.34-3-3-3zm13.71-9.37l-1.34-1.34c-.39-.39-1.02-.39-1.41 0L9 12.25 11.75 15l8.96-8.96c.39-.39.39-1.02 0-1.41z&quot;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n    &lt;canvas class=&quot;myCanvas&quot; [svgCursor]=&quot;cursorImage&quot; [cursorSize]=&quot;cursorSize&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see you need to add a template reference variable to the image so you can pass it as a parameter to the svgCursor directive.\r\n\r\nAlso important for this to work you need to set the correct CSS styles to the image to disable things that are not needed.

This avoids any possible implied data conversion errors that are more difficult/time-consuming to troubleshoot via BCP. Just pass the character data in the text file into character datatype columns in SQL Server. Then you can move data from the &quot;load&quot; table into your final destination table. This will allow you to use the MUCH more functional T-SQL commands to handle transformation of data types. Do not force BCP/SQL Server to transform your data-types for you by going from text file directly into your final table via BCP.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would also suggest visually inspecting your incoming data file to confirm it is formatted as specified. I often see mixups betweeen \\n and \\r\\n for line terminator.\r\n\r\nLast, when loading the data, you should also use the -e option as Neeraj has stated. This will capture &quot;data&quot; errors (it does not report command/syntax errors; just data/formatting errors). Since you incoming file is an ascii text file, you DO want to use the -c option for loading into the all-varchar &quot;load&quot; table.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57947020/how-to-specify-length-prefix-in-bcp-command/57960685#57960685","title":"How to specify length prefix in bcp command?"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":5117267,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DuPCalHKSxE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF8/Rce625Gl_GA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Haris Muzaffar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5117267/haris-muzaffar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568650084,"creation_date":1568571819,"question_id":57947020,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57947020","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using bcp tool to import CSV into a sql server table.

When running this project (on SD card) on Raspberry 3 , the problem remains.\r\n\r\n7. On Raspberry 3 with Raspbian Stretch and Gstreamer 1.10 from repository there was no problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for the answers!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946999/problem-when-playing-rtsp-stream-with-gstreamer","title":"Problem when playing RTSP stream with Gstreamer"},{"tags":["linux","visual-studio-code"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":35290,"user_id":661872,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqbSi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lawrence Cherone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/661872/lawrence-cherone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568572752,"post_id":57946986,"comment_id":102307427,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946986/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-vscode-settings-json#comment102307427_57946986"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4971565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rIFGLO670Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB5w/w__TqKNBXt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jjmark15","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4971565/jjmark15"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":35290,"user_id":661872,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqbSi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lawrence Cherone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/661872/lawrence-cherone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568574226,"post_id":57946986,"comment_id":102307800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946986/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-vscode-settings-json#comment102307800_57946986"},{"owner":{"reputation":35290,"user_id":661872,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqbSi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lawrence Cherone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/661872/lawrence-cherone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568574551,"post_id":57946986,"comment_id":102307873,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946986/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-vscode-settings-json#comment102307873_57946986"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4971565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rIFGLO670Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB5w/w__TqKNBXt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jjmark15","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4971565/jjmark15"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":35290,"user_id":661872,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqbSi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lawrence Cherone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/661872/lawrence-cherone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568574603,"post_id":57946986,"comment_id":102307887,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946986/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-vscode-settings-json#comment102307887_57946986"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4971565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rIFGLO670Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB5w/w__TqKNBXt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jjmark15","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4971565/jjmark15"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4971565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rIFGLO670Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB5w/w__TqKNBXt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jjmark15","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4971565/jjmark15"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568572571,"creation_date":1568571617,"last_edit_date":1568572571,"question_id":57946986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57946986","body_markdown":"I want to be able to use linux environment variables in vscode workspace settings (specifically `$HOME`) so that I can specify paths that aren&#39;t specific to a user.

Each `Float` is added to an `ArrayList` and finally that `ArrayList` is converted to an array of `Float`.\r\n\r\n    import java.io.BufferedReader;\r\n    import java.io.FileReader;\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    \r\n    public class NumArray {\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            if (args.length &lt; 1) {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Usage: java NumArray &lt;file&gt;&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(args[0]))) {\r\n                    ArrayList&lt;Float&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n                    String line = br.readLine();\r\n                    while (line != null) {\r\n                        String[] parts = line.split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n                        for (String part : parts) {\r\n                            numbers.add(Float.valueOf(part)); // throws java.lang.NumberFormatException\r\n                        }\r\n                        line = br.readLine();\r\n                    }\r\n                    Float[] numArray = new Float[numbers.size()];\r\n                    numbers.toArray(numArray);\r\n                    for (Float number : numbers) {\r\n                        System.out.print(number);\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot; &quot;);\r\n                    }\r\n                    System.out.println();\r\n                }\r\n                catch (IOException xIo) {\r\n                    xIo.printStackTrace();\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOutput...\r\n\r\n&gt; 150.0 4.0 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2\r\n\r\nNote the comment in my code: `throws java.lang.NumberFormatException`  \r\nIf the file contains characters that cannot be converted to a `Float`, the program will crash.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946953/opening-a-data-file-appending-lines-and-splitting-data/57947408#57947408","title":"Opening a data file, appending lines and splitting data"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11670554,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77439e127f3c91891122fc003d355bdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11670554/ant"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57947408,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568574569,"creation_date":1568571419,"question_id":57946953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57946953","body_markdown":"I&#39;m starting a project.

args)\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;How many random numbers do you want: &quot;);\r\n    int input = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());\r\n    Console.WriteLine();\r\n    int[] array = new int[10];\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; input; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        array[GetZufall()]++;\r\n        //Console.WriteLine(GetZufall()); // Random numbers\r\n    }\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine($&quot;{i} : {array[i]}&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    int maxValue = array.Max(); // Linq\r\n    Console.WriteLine();\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Most common value: &quot; + maxValue);\r\n    foreach (var item in array)\r\n    {\r\n        string result = array.ToString();\r\n        result = result.Replace(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;X&quot;);\r\n        Console.WriteLine(result);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo as you can see I&#39;ve tried to convert the array to String and then replace each number with X.\r\n\r\n###Example:\r\n\r\nInput: 5 random numbers\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n+ 0: 0\r\n+ 1: 2\r\n+ 2: 0\r\n+ 3: 0\r\n+ 4: 3\r\n+ 5: 0\r\n+ 6: 0\r\n+ 7: 0\r\n+ 8: 0\r\n+ 9: 0\r\n\r\nThis output is right, but the next one should be like this:\r\n\r\n+ 0: 0\r\n+ 1: XX\r\n+ 2: 0\r\n+ 3: 0\r\n+ 4: XXX\r\n+ 5: 0\r\n+ 6: 0\r\n+ 7: 0\r\n+ 8: 0\r\n+ 9: 0\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried also using Regex ```Regex r = new Regex(&quot;[0-9]&quot;&quot;, RegexOptions.None);```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946952/replacing-numbers-into-specific-string","title":"Replacing numbers into specific

For extensive explanation see [`this`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17027777/relationship-between-hashcode-and-equals-method-in-java).\r\n\r\nIf your requirement is to not allow duplicates based on properties of your class - [`Set`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html) is a good choice. For example [`HashSet`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html). You will have to override `equals` and `hashCode` methods :\r\n````\r\nclass Highscore {\r\n\r\n    private String username;\r\n    public int score;\r\n\r\n    //getters setters constructors\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n        if (this == o) return true;\r\n        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\r\n        Highscore highscore = (Highscore) o;\r\n        return score == highscore.score &amp;&amp;\r\n                Objects.equals(username, highscore.username);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int hashCode() {\r\n        return Objects.hash(username, score);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\nAnd then :\r\n````\r\nSet&lt;Highscore&gt; highscores = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n        \r\nhighscores.add(new Highscore(&quot;user 1&quot;, 25));\r\nhighscores.add(new Highscore(&quot;user 2&quot;, 10));\r\nhighscores.add(new Highscore(&quot;user 3&quot;, 55));\r\nhighscores.add(new Highscore(&quot;user 1&quot;, 25));\r\nhighscores.add(new Highscore(&quot;user 2&quot;, 5));\r\nhighscores.add(new Highscore(&quot;user 3&quot;, 30));\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(highscores.size());\r\n````\r\nWill print `5` and the duplicate entry is not added. If you want to preserve order of insertion use [`LinkedHashSet`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/LinkedHashSet.html).\r\n\r\nOf course you could also use your `ArrayList` and remove elements by calling [`List::remove(object)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#remove(java.lang.Object)) but it uses `equals` to compare objects underneath too. I think that using `Set` here is advisable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946947/removing-duplicate-elements-from-arraylist-containing-custom-classes/57947051#57947051","title":"Removing duplicate elements from ArrayList containing Custom Classes"}],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":9217218,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff62586e63e536cf0f2e5da3ce26af28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"IdleApps Inc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9217218/idleapps-inc"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57947051,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568572630,"creation_date":1568571386,"question_id":57946947,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57946947","body_markdown":"I have an `ArrayList` of a custom class `Highscore`\r\nThe array list contains multiple `Highscore`&#39;s\r\n\r\nAs shown in the code below, there is a duplicate entry.

It&#39;s typically called like this:\r\n\r\n    struct stat stbuf;\r\n    int r = stat(filename, &amp;stbuf);\r\n\r\nWith this setup, if the size of the `stat` structure ever changes, every caller becomes invalid, and will need to be recompiled.  If both the called and the calling code are part of the same project, that may not be a problem.  But if (as in the case of `stat()`, which is a system call into the Unix/Linux kernel) there are lots and lots of callers out there, it&#39;s practically impossible to force them all to recompile, so the implication is that the size of the `stat` structure can never be changed.\r\n\r\nThis sort of problem mainly arises when the caller allocates (or inspects/manipulates) actual instances of the structure.  If, on the other hand, the insides of the structure are only ever allocated and manipulated by library code -- if calling code deals only with pointers to the struct, and doesn&#39;t try to interpret the pointed-to structures -- it may not matter if the structure changes.\r\n\r\n(Now, with all of that said, there are various other things that can be done to mitigate the issues if a struct has to change size.  There are libraries where the caller allocates instances of a structure, but then passes both a pointer to the structure, and the *size* of the structure as the caller knows it, down into the library code.  Newer library code can then detect a mismatch, and avoid setting or using newer fields which an older caller didn&#39;t allocate space for.  And I believe gcc, at least, implements special hooks so that glibc can implement multiple versions of the same structure, and multiple versions of the library functions that use them, so that the correct library function can be used corresponding to the version of the structure that a particular caller is using.  Going back to `stat()`, for example, under Linux there are at least two different versions of the `stat` structure, one which allocates 32 bits for the file size and one which allocates 64.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946935/filler-at-the-end-of-a-struct-for-future-growth/57947281#57947281","title":"Filler at the end of a struct for future growth"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97107,"user_id":2402272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1182b1d5518a596d4e8cfe0567a65c4d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Bollinger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2402272/john-bollinger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568574435,"creation_date":1568574435,"answer_id":57947387,"question_id":57946935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57947387","body_markdown":"&gt; But isn&#39;t the whole point of adding new fields to a structure that you\r\n&gt; didn&#39;t knew you were going to need them?\r\n\r\nWell yes, if you knew all along that you would need those members, then it would be counter-productive to intentionally omit them.  But sometimes you indeed discover only later that you need some additional fields.  Drepper&#39;s recommendations speak to ways to design your code -- specifically your structure definitions -- so that you can add members with the minimum possible side effects.\r\n\r\n&gt; In this example, what if you\r\n&gt; want to add not one field but 20?\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t start out saying &quot;I&#39;m going to want to add 20 members&quot;.  Rather, you start out saying &quot;I may later discover a need for some more members.&quot;  That&#39;s a prudent position to take.\r\n\r\n&gt; Should you then use a filler of 1k\r\n&gt; bytes just in case?\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s a judgment call.  I recon that a KB of extra space in the structure definition is probably overkill in most cases, but there might be a context where that&#39;s reasonable.\r\n\r\n&gt; Also, why does is it important that the size of a\r\n&gt; struct doesn&#39;t change in subsequent versions of a library? If the\r\n&gt; library provides clean abstractions, that shouldn&#39;t matter right?\r\n\r\n*How important* it is that the size remains constant is a subjective question, but the size is indeed relevant to binary compatibility for shared libraries.  Specifically, the question is whether I can drop a new version of the shared lib in place of the old one, and expect existing programs to work with the new one without recompilation.\r\n\r\nTechnically, if the definition of the structure changes, even without its size changing, then the new definition is incompatible with the old one as far as the C language is concerned.  In practice, however, with most C implementations, if the structure size is the same and the layout does not change except possibly within previously-unused space, then existing users will not notice the difference in many operations.\r\n\r\nIf the size *does* change, however, then\r\n\r\n - dynamic allocation of instances of the structure will not allocate the correct amount of space.\r\n - arrays of the structure will not be laid out correctly.\r\n - copying from one instance to another via `memcpy()` will not work correctly.\r\n - binary I/O involving instances of the structure will not transfer the correct number of bytes.\r\n\r\nThere are likely other things that could go wrong with a size change that would (again, in practice) be ok under conversion of some trailing padding into meaningful members.\r\n\r\n**Do note**: one thing that might still be a problem if the structure members change without the overall size changing is passing structures to functions by value and (somewhat less so) receiving them as return values.  A library making use of this approach to provide for binary compatibility would do well to avoid providing functions that do those things.\r\n\r\n&gt; Finally, using a 64 bytes filler (8 uintpr_t (yes, it&#39;s not\r\n&gt; necessarily 64 bytes)) sounds like a waste of memory...\r\n\r\nIn a situation in which those 64 bytes per structure is in fact a legitimate concern, then that might trump binary compatibility concerns.  That would be the case if you anticipate a very large number of those structures to be in use at the same time, or if you are extremely memory-constrained.  In many cases, however, the extra space is inconsequential, whereas the extra scope for binary compatibility afforded by including padding is quite valuable.\r\n\r\n&gt; The document doesn&#39;t go into the details of this at all. Would you\r\n&gt; have any explanations to why this advice &quot;adding fillers at the end of\r\n&gt; struct to plan for future growth&quot; is a good one?\r\n\r\nLike most things, the recommendation needs to be evaluated relative to your particular context.  In the foregoing, I&#39;ve touched on most of the points you would want to consider in such an evaluation.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946935/filler-at-the-end-of-a-struct-for-future-growth/57947387#57947387","title":"Filler at the end of a struct for future growth"}],"owner":{"reputation":2093,"user_id":4990392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89acc35f0339a9c7e6ae36443a23e2d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dada","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4990392/dada"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57947281,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568574435,"creation_date":1568571309,"question_id":57946935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57946935","body_markdown":"This [document](https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/goodpractice.pdf) called &quot;Good Practices in Library Design, Implementation, and Maintenance&quot; by Ulrich Drepper says (bottom of page 5):\r\n\r\n&gt;  [...] the type definition should always create at least a minimal\r\namount of padding to allow future growth\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Second, a structure should contain at the end a certain number of fill bytes.\r\n&gt;\r\n    struct the_struct\r\n    {\r\n      int foo;\r\n      // ...and more fields\r\n      uintptr_t filler[8];\r\n    };\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; If at a later time a field has to be added to the structure the type definition can be changed to this:\r\n&gt;\r\n    struct the_struct\r\n    {\r\n      int foo;\r\n      // ...and more fields\r\n      union\r\n      {\r\n        some_type_t new_field;\r\n        uintptr_t filler[8];\r\n      } u;\r\n    };\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t see the point of adding this filler at the end of the structure.

I don&#39;t know how to dig deep to get metrics of what&#39;s going on.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**To address the first issue: I brainstormed my understanding of how it works in the single container scenario** (and then realized I don&#39;t know the multi-container scenario so I decided to ask this question) \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**This is my understanding of how HPA (autoscaling/v1) works when I have 1 container (temporarily ignore the 2nd container in the above deployment spec):**\r\n&lt;br&gt;The HPA would spawn more replicas when the CPU utilization average of all pods shifted from my normal expected load of 500m or less to 750m (150% x 500m request)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**To address the 2nd issue: I found out how to dig to see concrete numberic value-based metrics vs relative percentage-based metrics to help figure out what&#39;s happening behind the scenes:** \r\n\r\n    Bash# kubectl describe horizontalpodautoscaler nginx-ingress-controller -n=ingress | grep Metrics: -A 1\r\n    Metrics:                                               ( current / target )\r\n      resource cpu on pods  (as a percentage of request):  5% (56m) / 100%\r\n\r\n(Note: kubectl top pods -n=ingress, showed cpu usage of the 5 replicas as 36m, 34m, 88m, 36m, 91m, so that 57m current which ~matches 56m current)\r\n\r\nAlso now it&#39;s a basic proportions Math Problem that allows solving for target static value: &lt;br&gt;\r\n(5% / 56m) = (100% / x m) --&gt; x = 56 * 100 / 5 = 1120m target cpu\r\n&lt;br&gt; (Note: this HPA isn&#39;t associated with the deployment mentioned above, that&#39;s why the numbers are off.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946900/how-does-kubernetes-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-calculate-cpu-utilization-for-mult","title":"How does Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler calculate CPU Utilization for Multi Container Pods?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":38342,"user_id":2535611,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d61593cac94336661b986823abb9852e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rafaelc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2535611/rafaelc"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568571613,"post_id":57946898,"comment_id":102307097,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946898/python-if-else-on-each-lines#comment102307097_57946898"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":160,"user_id":8340881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b887135814e82fe11a5d45f5b09bb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shanoo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8340881/shanoo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568571787,"post_id":57946965,"comment_id":102307141,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946898/python-if-else-on-each-lines/57946965#comment102307141_57946965"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":11854211,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e124698e84294b5539204ab34fbed89?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fborges22","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11854211/fborges22"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568571525,"creation_date":1568571525,"answer_id":57946965,"question_id":57946898,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57946965","body_markdown":"The code you posted is somehow inconsistent but I recommend you to implement like this with startswith:\r\n\r\n    s = {&quot;01dvfgf&quot;,&quot;01fgvr&quot;,&quot;02hjuy&quot;,&quot;01erttt&quot;,&quot;02hjkkk&quot;}\r\n    \r\n    for line in s:\r\n    \tif line.startswith(&#39;01&#39;):\r\n    \t\tprint(line)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946898/python-if-else-on-each-lines/57946965#57946965","title":"Python if else on each lines"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2823,"user_id":11606193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DXr7w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Deepstop","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11606193/deepstop"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568571823,"creation_date":1568571823,"answer_id":57947021,"question_id":57946898,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57947021","body_markdown":"I think the most reliable thing is to split the lines around the colon and remove all leading and trailing spaces.

svyaznoy.ru, but have a bug. \r\nFor example, I hover on &quot;Apple&quot; menu item. Laptops and iPhones show up. Next I hover on &quot;Laptops&quot;. Some apple laptop models show up. And here&#39;s where the bug shows: if my mouse pointer doesn&#39;t leave &quot;Laptops&quot; item and goes straight to laptops submenu - all is ok, but when it leaves &quot;Laptops&quot; on the way to laptops list, e.g. it hovers on iPhones for a moment, then laptops list hides, and I want it to stay there. How can I fix this bug? \r\n\r\njsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/16region/vtrj9wgk/30/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946876/submenu-dissappears-on-mouse-hover","title":"Submenu dissappears on mouse hover"},{"tags":["reactjs","pdf","pdf.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":48598,"user_id":1333975,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2aQ2.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ahmad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1333975/ahmad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568571438,"post_id":57946875,"comment_id":102307059,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946875/what-does-the-width-and-height-parameter-represent-react-pdf-highlighter#comment102307059_57946875"},{"owner":{"reputation":47918,"user_id":1467082,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPeMR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Zemens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1467082/david-zemens"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568571466,"post_id":57946875,"comment_id":102307063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946875/what-does-the-width-and-height-parameter-represent-react-pdf-highlighter#comment102307063_57946875"},{"owner":{"reputation":878,"user_id":3123171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yI739.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sadiq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3123171/sadiq"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":48598,"user_id":1333975,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2aQ2.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ahmad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1333975/ahmad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568577661,"post_id":57946875,"comment_id":102308552,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946875/what-does-the-width-and-height-parameter-represent-react-pdf-highlighter#comment102308552_57946875"}],"owner":{"reputation":878,"user_id":3123171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yI739.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sadiq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3123171/sadiq"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568570956,"creation_date":1568570956,"question_id":57946875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57946875","body_markdown":"I was implementing \r\nhttps://github.com/agentcooper/react-pdf-highlighter\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does the width and height parameter represent?

But yes, you can probably do better; a DFA with 4 states can recognize your language, so there&#39;s definitely a regular grammar with four nonterminals:\r\n\r\n    S -&gt; aS | bR\r\n    R -&gt; aR | bT\r\n    T -&gt; aT | bU | b\r\n    U -&gt; aU | bS | a\r\n\r\nThis works because states S, R, T and U correspond to having seen 0, 1, 2 and 3 instances of b, modulo 4. Seeing instances of a leaves you in whatever state you were in before, while seeing b takes you to the next state.

a sticky container and let children be absolute.\r\n\r\nHad tested with `z-index`, all over, before posting but had not found any satisfactory solution that way.\r\n\r\nI also tried various with `position: sticky`, and there is where I found the solution at last :)\r\n\r\nOne can wrap the sub windows in a sticky container which is positioned top left of the *main* container.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n* Simple\r\n* Fairly clean HTML structure\r\n* The window stay below scroll-bars of container\r\n* Positioning relative to content wrapper\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n* If one want to make it non-fixed / non-sticy one have to move the element to parent and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolute positioned children will not expand the container – thus not rearranging the DOM flow. (Which was the issue on earlier attempts using `sticky`).\r\n\r\nTested in FireFox, Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera Mini and Opera.\r\n\r\nThe core of it:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;outer&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-sticky&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;sub-window&quot;&gt;\r\n                    Fixed Window\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            Other &quot;normal&quot;

E.g. this document is a valid document:\r\n\r\n    foo = &quot;bar&quot;\r\n\r\nBut also this is valid:\r\n\r\n    foo = &quot;bar&quot;\r\n    something = &quot;else&quot;\r\n\r\nI am now trying to parse this document in Rust with the library [toml-rs][1]. However I could not find any guidance in the documentation on how to find out whether a key actually exists in my TOML document. Whenever I try to access this key the program panics with the error `index not found`.\r\n\r\nI came up with the following minimalistic example that shows that the Rust code immediately fails when I try to access a key that does not exist:\r\n\r\n    use toml::Value;\r\n\r\n    fn main() {\r\n        let value = &quot;foo = &#39;bar&#39;&quot;.parse::&lt;Value&gt;().unwrap();\r\n\r\n        println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, value[&quot;foo&quot;]);\r\n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, &quot;before&quot;);\r\n        println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, value[&quot;foo2&quot;]);\r\n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, &quot;after&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich leads to the output:\r\n\r\n    String(&quot;bar&quot;)\r\n    before\r\n    thread &#39;main&#39; panicked at &#39;index not found&#39;, src/libcore/option.rs:1034:5\r\n    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.\r\n\r\nIn the actual code of the library I found [a comment for a function called `get`][2] that states:\r\n\r\n  &gt; Also returns `None` if the given key does not exist in the map or the given index is not within the bounds of the array.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure whether this should also apply to my key access. At least to my tests it does not. I was also unable to find a function in the code that would check whether a key exists.\r\n\r\nI guess there must be some way to find out whether a key exists in the TOML document?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.rs/toml/0.5.3/toml/index.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.rs/toml/0.5.3/src/toml/value.rs.html#76","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946845/how-can-i-check-whether-a-key-exists-in-toml-with-toml-rs","title":"How can I check whether a key exists in TOML with toml-rs?"},{"tags":["c++"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":12010644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i1l-8YCHbyo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfZJV5j8Z91orq10DMayEp-B5V9dg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kevin Bright","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12010644/kevin-bright"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568571099,"post_id":57946843,"comment_id":102306956,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946843/random-number-generator-x-1-stdrand-rand-max-1u-6#comment102306956_57946843"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10512856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mzA6hvoT3mo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DX2vgCQl-PSutcILHWV_GKhUufoHw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mohamed Amr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10512856/mohamed-amr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568571187,"post_id":57946843,"comment_id":102306984,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946843/random-number-generator-x-1-stdrand-rand-max-1u-6#comment102306984_57946843"},{"owner":{"reputation":22199,"user_id":5231607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QzGsq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"1201ProgramAlarm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5231607/1201programalarm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568571687,"post_id":57946843,"comment_id":102307116,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946843/random-number-generator-x-1-stdrand-rand-max-1u-6#comment102307116_57946843"},{"owner":{"reputation":1099,"user_id":3370124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f73352b4adb282c092738f34883488dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Richard Critten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3370124/richard-critten"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568573258,"post_id":57946843,"comment_id":102307559,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946843/random-number-generator-x-1-stdrand-rand-max-1u-6#comment102307559_57946843"},{"owner":{"reputation":62549,"user_id":1593860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1361e47a8bf06d20ffda9a686ceb7e68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pete Becker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1593860/pete-becker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568576598,"post_id":57946843,"comment_id":102308343,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57946843/random-number-generator-x-1-stdrand-rand-max-1u-6#comment102308343_57946843"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10512856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mzA6hvoT3mo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DX2vgCQl-PSutcILHWV_GKhUufoHw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mohamed Amr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10512856/mohamed-amr"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10512856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mzA6hvoT3mo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DX2vgCQl-PSutcILHWV_GKhUufoHw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mohamed Amr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10512856/mohamed-amr"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1568648481,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568577292,"creation_date":1568570710,"last_edit_date":1568572008,"question_id":57946843,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57946843","body_markdown":"i watched many videos to see how to make random generated numbers and most developers do this way\r\n\r\n    srand(time(0));\r\n\tfor (int n = 0;
