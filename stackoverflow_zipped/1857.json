your approach doesn&#39;t work**\r\n\r\nIt probably does work, but features like hot-reload aren&#39;t supported, because you introduce global state to your app, which is often not what you want.\r\n\r\n**So, how to do it better?**\r\n\r\nI already answered a similar question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54072372/share-dimensions-between-widgets/54077940#54077940) more elaborately, but here&#39;s a version adapted to your problem:\r\n\r\nBecause Flutter is open source, we can just look at [how the `Theme` is implemented](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/theme.dart) and copy that code to create a custom widget that functions just like a `Theme`.\r\nHere&#39;s a boiled-down version:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n@immutable\r\nclass MyThemeData {\r\n  MyThemeData({\r\n    this.mutedText,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  final TextStyle mutedText;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyTheme extends StatelessWidget {\r\n  MyTheme({\r\n    Key key,\r\n    @required this.data,\r\n    @required this.child,\r\n  }) : super(key: key);\r\n\r\n  final MyThemeData data;\r\n  final Widget child;\r\n\r\n

In other words, no matter what (e.g. &lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;, clicking with mouse, requesting focus programmatically) the fourth `TextField` will not be able to be focused—nor will anything not a descendant of `innerBox`. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s desired behavior. To disable the behavior simply remove the `ChangeListener` from the `focusOwner` property (will require you to keep a reference to the listener). Of course, you can attempt to modify the code to make it more nuanced.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58100040/detect-focus-out-of-specific-pane-in-javafx/58100641#58100641","title":"Detect focus out of specific Pane in javafx"}],"owner":{"reputation":238,"user_id":3029612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b19a64d8a1f9f0c3faaa728774597a6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3029612","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3029612/user3029612"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569421419,"creation_date":1569419566,"question_id":58100040,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58100040","body_markdown":"How can I detect that the focus has left the specific pane? Because the pane (StackPane) is not focusable I&#39;m having trouble doing this. For example, I have a StackPane with TextFields and if I press tab for several times it leaves the pane focus and goes to the other pane. I want to prevent this kind of behavior by setting the focus back to the first TextField in the pane if you leave the focus of StackPane. \r\n\r\nThis is my attempt:\r\n\r\n    myStackPane().focusedProperty().addListener((obs, wasFocused, isNowFocused) -&gt; {\r\n                if (! isNowFocused) {\r\n                    setFocus(node);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\nbut I think that this does not work due to StackPane being unfocusable.

would suggest that you change the `To` and `From` Properties of the `ThicknessAnimation` so that it is up-to-date with the height of the window. And additionaly that at the start of an animation you set the `Visibility` of the menu to `Visible` and at the end to `Collapsed` if the menu should not be visible at the moment.\r\n\r\nFor this I would suggest that you add a field that holds the _openness_ state of the menu\r\n```cs\r\nprivate bool menuOpen = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd alter one of the stroyboards to this\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;Storyboard x:Key=&quot;MenuStoryboard&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;ThicknessAnimation Storyboard.TargetProperty=&quot;Margin&quot;\r\n                    Storyboard.TargetName=&quot;gridMenu&quot;\r\n                    DecelerationRatio=&quot;0.9&quot;\r\n                    Duration=&quot;0:0:1&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/Storyboard&gt;\r\n```\r\nand remove the other.\r\n\r\nYou should also remove the margin of the `Grid` and add `Collapsed` as a default `Visibility`\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;Grid x:Name=&quot;gridMenu&quot; Background=&quot;Blue&quot;\r\n      Visibility=&quot;Collapsed&quot;\r\n      Grid.Column=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then in the Click-Event-Handler you can adjust the Storyboard to the situation and run the animation.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nprivate void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    var storyBoard = this.FindResource(&quot;ShowRightMenu&quot;) as Storyboard;\r\n    var animation = storyBoard.Children[0] as ThicknessAnimation;\r\n    if (menuOpen)\r\n    {\r\n        animation.To = new Thickness(0, -this.Height, 0, Height);\r\n        animation.From = new Thickness(0);\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        animation.From = new Thickness(0, -this.Height, 0, this.Height);\r\n        animation.To = new Thickness(0);\r\n    }\r\n    this.gridMenu.Visibility = Visibility.Visible;\r\n    storyBoard.Begin();\r\n\r\n    void animationCompleated(object sender2, EventArgs e2)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!menuOpen)\r\n        {\r\n            this.gridMenu.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        storyBoard.Completed -= animationCompleated;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    storyBoard.Completed += animationCompleated;\r\n\r\n\r\n    menuOpen = !menuOpen;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58100030/resizing-window-with-menu/58101046#58101046","title":"Resizing window with menu"}],"owner":{"reputation":130,"user_id":10266595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10155668743473314/picture?type=large","display_name":"David Andrew Thorpe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10266595/david-andrew-thorpe"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58101046,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569422624,"creation_date":1569419540,"question_id":58100030,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58100030","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve come across a problem with making menus within a re-sizeable window.

However, I would like to have a POST Request since I am sending user data to the server.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, I already have tried these solutions (and several similar ones):\r\n\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4015324/how-to-make-http-post-web-request (basically all of them except 3rd Party) \r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29375650/c-sharp-httpclient-not-sending-post-variables\r\n - https://holger.coders-online.net/118\r\n - http://www.howtosolvenow.com/how-to-send-https-post-request-with-c/\r\n\r\nTesting PHP Script:\r\n    \r\n    $newnumber = &#39;Error&#39;;\r\n    if(isset($_POST[&#39;number&#39;]))\r\n    {\r\n        $newnumber = $_POST[&#39;number&#39;]+1;\r\n    }\r\n    echo $newnumber;\r\n    //keeps on returning &#39;Error&#39;\r\n\r\nLatest attempt of C# code:\r\n  \r\n    string resultString = null;\r\n    string _url = &quot;https://myURL.com/test.php&quot;;\r\n\r\n    //ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls11;\r\n\r\n    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\r\n\r\n    var content = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new[] {\r\n        new KeyValuePair&lt;string,string&gt;(&quot;number&quot;, &quot;2&quot;),\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var response = await client.PostAsync(_url, content);\r\n\r\n    resultString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\r\n\r\n    this._txt.Text = resultString;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58100012/c-wpf-post-request-to-php-file-on-https-site-on-strato-server-not-working","title":"C# WPF POST Request to php file on https site on strato server not working"},{"tags":["google-bigquery"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20663,"user_id":6253347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1387a55798cae58a3a836dcbcd6e1951?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Elliott Brossard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6253347/elliott-brossard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569420202,"post_id":58100010,"comment_id":102592199,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58100010/bigquery-query-to-groupby-array-column#comment102592199_58100010"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":20663,"user_id":6253347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1387a55798cae58a3a836dcbcd6e1951?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Elliott Brossard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6253347/elliott-brossard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569422711,"post_id":58100010,"comment_id":102593713,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58100010/bigquery-query-to-groupby-array-column#comment102593713_58100010"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569423053,"post_id":58101128,"comment_id":102593901,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58100010/bigquery-query-to-groupby-array-column/58101128#comment102593901_58101128"},{"owner":{"reputation":76070,"user_id":5221944,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHLm9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikhail Berlyant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221944/mikhail-berlyant"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569429317,"post_id":58101128,"comment_id":102597168,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58100010/bigquery-query-to-groupby-array-column/58101128#comment102597168_58101128"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76070,"user_id":5221944,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHLm9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikhail Berlyant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221944/mikhail-berlyant"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569422838,"creation_date":1569422838,"answer_id":58101128,"question_id":58100010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58101128","body_markdown":"Below is for BigQuery Standard SQL    \r\n\r\n    #standardSQL\r\n    WITH `project.dataset.table` AS (\r\n       SELECT &#39;x.com&#39;

Why does `iCurrentCoupon` get saved but the array does not (and how can I change that)? \r\nAny help is much appreciated!\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Not exactly sure what the problem was, but I fixed it by making `theCoupons[]` an ICollection instead of an array. After that I updated both of my classes so that they have a many-to-many relationship as shown [here][1].

Instead, I&#39;m getting `None` values everywhere. Here&#39;s my desired result: \r\n\r\n```\r\n  left_color right_color  flag\r\n0        red         red     1\r\n1      green        gray     0\r\n2       blue               NaN\r\n3      black       black     1\r\n4      white         red     0\r\n5                          NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to understand what is my mistake and how to fix. Additionally, I would like to see if there is a more *Pythonic* way to solve this problem which is computationally more effective.

This will give the back-end guys an opportunity to tell you its not yet ready. It really depends on the culture in the company. Why are they writing endpoints not yet deployed, and if not deployed, how difficult is it for you to make them deploy them? \r\n\r\nAnother way is DevOps which many think of as scrum for the entire value chain. \r\n\r\nThese methologies are however not something you can dictate, but they arose because of the problem you are refering to. \r\n\r\nIn practice: You should probably ask to get another folder called &quot;SafeToUse&quot; or &quot;ReadyForConsumption&quot; in Postman and in this way you can clearly see whats on its way and whats ready. \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question.

there a reason why you using SSIS?  I think that is best suited for the job.\r\n\r\nAnyways, back to your issue.  `IMEX=1` is not enough.  What you need is to check the registry entries\r\n\r\nYou need set `TypeGuessRows` and `ImportMixedTypes` within this registry path:\r\n\r\n    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Access Connectivity Engine\\Engines\\Excel\r\n\r\n`TypeGuessRows = 0 (the default is 8)`\r\n\r\n`ImportMixedTypes = Text`\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does `TypeGuessRows` do?\r\n-----------------------------\r\nIt tries to guess data type based on the number of rows defined.  The *default* values is 8.  That means it will check 8 rows to see what data type should be used.  If you want to the engine to scan all the rows put *0* there.  There is a catch, however, if your spreadsheet large, you could pay heavy performance penalty for such setting.\r\n\r\nWhat does `ImportMixedTypes` do?\r\n-----------------------------\r\nThis is where your `IMEX` setting comes into the game.  There are 3 possible values for `IMEX` setting `0`, `1`, `2`:\r\n\r\n - 0 is Export mode \r\n - 1 is Import mode \r\n - 2 is Linked mode (full update capabilities)\r\n\r\nOnly when setting `IMEX=1` the registry value is honored. - with the default setting being `ImportMixedTypes=Text`.  In any other value (0, 2) the value in registry is checked, if it is valid, but it does not influence the outcome.  (you will get an error if invalid)\r\n\r\nThere are two valid values for `ImportMixedTypes`:\r\n\r\n    ImportMixedTypes=Text\r\n    ImportMixedTypes=Majority Type\r\n\r\nThe `Majority Type` is rarely used.  What it does it counts type of each column and the majority type is then used for the whole column.  The `Text` type will limit the row size to 255 characters, if you want to use more characters then `Majority Type` must be used and the majority must use more than 256 characters.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099882/import-excel-data-to-sql-server-without-data-conversion/58274074#58274074","title":"Import EXCEL data to SQL Server without data conversion"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":6835534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25237e5d52edc4360fa050c8b1d23eb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"James Anderson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6835534/james-anderson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570552110,"creation_date":1570552110,"answer_id":58290463,"question_id":58099882,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58290463","body_markdown":"I think that you should get the data types from the SQL server table first to create the recordset, rather than letting Excel decide the datatypes from the Sheet.

me preface this by saying - not sure how rules work for multiple accounts. You may need to create the rule for BOTH accounts but they can both reference the same script.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve updated your code to be a public `Sub` vs `Private Sub` and placed it in a module so that it can be referenced by the rules engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, once we have the code in place (scripts run by Rules engine typically inherently pass the email as a MailItem to the sub and ByVal was causing issues with recognizing the script as one to be run from a MailItem so i updated it to `Item as MailItem`). \r\n\r\nWe next create a new rule using the rules engine. If you see this simplistic interface, click on Advanced Options. That will allow us to apply to rule to all emails.  In the advanced options window, do not check any box for `Which conditions do you want to check?` simply click Next. It will confirm you want to add this rule for ALL EMAILS which we do.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter selecting `run a script` we can click on `a script` to indicate which script we want to run.

This approach, unfortunately, does not work. I also noticed that, for example, when the first email arrives at the account &quot;pierwszy@gmail.com&quot;, then until the application is closed, emails will be exported to Excel only from this account &quot;pierwszy@gmail.com&quot; and not exported from the account &quot;drugi@gmail.com&quot;. However, when the first e-mail arrives at the account &quot;drugi@gmail.com&quot;, then emails will be exported from the seccond e-mail &quot;drugi@gmail.com&quot; until application is closed.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099871/auto-export-e-mails-from-outlook-to-excel","title":"Auto export e-mails from Outlook to Excel"},{"tags":["c#","sqlite","xamarin","entity-framework-core","ef-migrations"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":1856337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ebf7008b85ce7fec78c5c577e7a0b2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Juri Pyykk&#246;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1856337/juri-pyykk%c3%b6"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569486663,"post_id":58109005,"comment_id":102614968,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099869/xamarin-ef-core-database-migration-deletes-old-data/58109005#comment102614968_58109005"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":1547309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0fe3bed69a927d2406308dcad7214eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JRice Industries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1547309/jrice-industries"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569466944,"creation_date":1569466944,"answer_id":58109005,"question_id":58099869,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58109005","body_markdown":"Android apps are sandboxed.

I log in, make some local changes, and then shutdown the app. Then I install the new version (with the migration) by debugging in Visual Studio. When I start the app again all the old data is gone, log in info and local changes. I&#39;ve also tried making the first install from an earlier commit (without new stuff) with Visual Studio, without any noticeable difference.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite 2.0.1.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MyDbContext : Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    public MyDbContext(string databasePath)\r\n    {\r\n        DatabasePath = databasePath;\r\n        AddInitialMigrationForPreMigrationInstalls();\r\n        Database.Migrate();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void AddInitialMigrationForPreMigrationInstalls()\r\n    {\r\n        if (Database.Exists()) // This is just an extension doing: dbFacade.GetService&lt;IRelationalDatabaseCreator&gt;().Exists()\r\n        {\r\n            Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(@&quot;\r\n                CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS &quot;&quot;__EFMigrationsHistory&quot;&quot; (\r\n                    &quot;&quot;MigrationId&quot;&quot; TEXT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT &quot;&quot;PK___EFMigrationsHistory&quot;&quot; PRIMARY KEY,\r\n                    &quot;&quot;ProductVersion&quot;&quot; TEXT NOT NULL\r\n                );\r\n\r\n                INSERT OR IGNORE INTO &quot;&quot;__EFMigrationsHistory&quot;&quot; (&quot;&quot;MigrationId&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;ProductVersion&quot;&quot;)\r\n                VALUES (&#39;20180829103834_InitialCreate&#39;, &#39;2.0.1-rtm-125&#39;);        \r\n            &quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        optionsBuilder.UseSqlite($&quot;Filename={DatabasePath}&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect all the data in db to be untouched, while the new tables should have been added.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t really know how to examine this further. How can I see what&#39;s going on?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099869/xamarin-ef-core-database-migration-deletes-old-data","title":"Xamarin EF Core database migration deletes old data"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework","linq","asp.net-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15565,"user_id":5394220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2VGk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jota.Toledo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394220/jota-toledo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569423756,"post_id":58099867,"comment_id":102594355,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099867/linq-grouping-by-sql-function#comment102594355_58099867"},{"owner":{"reputation":15565,"user_id":5394220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2VGk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jota.Toledo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394220/jota-toledo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569424101,"post_id":58099867,"comment_id":102594564,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099867/linq-grouping-by-sql-function#comment102594564_58099867"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10654725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/120beaee4fb44a4df82d41113ba284e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mrDavid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10654725/mrdavid"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":15565,"user_id":5394220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2VGk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jota.Toledo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394220/jota-toledo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569424151,"post_id":58099867,"comment_id":102594592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099867/linq-grouping-by-sql-function#comment102594592_58099867"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10654725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/120beaee4fb44a4df82d41113ba284e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mrDavid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10654725/mrdavid"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":15565,"user_id":5394220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2VGk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jota.Toledo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394220/jota-toledo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569424470,"post_id":58099867,"comment_id":102594770,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099867/linq-grouping-by-sql-function#comment102594770_58099867"},{"owner":{"reputation":15565,"user_id":5394220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2VGk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jota.Toledo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394220/jota-toledo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569424757,"post_id":58099867,"comment_id":102594946,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099867/linq-grouping-by-sql-function#comment102594946_58099867"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10654725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/120beaee4fb44a4df82d41113ba284e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mrDavid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10654725/mrdavid"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":15565,"user_id":5394220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2VGk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jota.Toledo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394220/jota-toledo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569454548,"post_id":58099867,"comment_id":102605948,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099867/linq-grouping-by-sql-function#comment102605948_58099867"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10654725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/120beaee4fb44a4df82d41113ba284e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mrDavid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10654725/mrdavid"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15565,"user_id":5394220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2VGk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jota.Toledo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5394220/jota-toledo"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569423760,"creation_date":1569419117,"last_edit_date":1569423760,"question_id":58099867,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58099867","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying run a linq query where a date field is converted to end-of-quarter (31-03-2019, 30-06-2019), and then grouped.
