As a counter-example:\r\n\r\n    class D(A):  # inherit from A\r\n        pass\r\n    \r\n    inspect.getmro(D)  # should include A now\r\n    # (__main__.D, __main__.A, object)\r\n\r\n[0]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-python/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015066/whats-the-difference-between-declaring-class-a-and-class-a/58015137#58015137","title":"What&#39;s the difference between declaring `class A` and `class A()`?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":438,"user_id":8504799,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d10e90837a07b69ca7e0be758ea30b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"en_lorithai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8504799/en-lorithai"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568910426,"creation_date":1568910426,"answer_id":58015318,"question_id":58015066,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58015318","body_markdown":"in python 2.x there would be a difference, but in python3 it is the same.\r\n\r\nthe long version\r\nclass A(object):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nis the same as\r\nclass A():\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nsince object is the default input of a class\r\n\r\nthis one is just an even shorter version of the one above\r\nclass A:\r\n    pass\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015066/whats-the-difference-between-declaring-class-a-and-class-a/58015318#58015318","title":"What&#39;s the difference between declaring `class A` and `class A()`?"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":10147110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-T6V6qQ8ww7Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7qjJxkbrk2I-wG6f-An17GMS_2hPQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yash Patel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10147110/yash-patel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7579,"user_id":2464597,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12eaebfe8c9ae6c3a29aefe69ebcb4bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Engineero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2464597/engineero"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1568910186,"accepted_answer_id":58015137,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568917058,"creation_date":1568909331,"last_edit_date":1568917058,"question_id":58015066,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015066","body_markdown":"We define class in python as following:\r\n\r\n    class A:\r\n        def x(self):\r\n            print(&quot;In x&quot;)\r\n\r\nBut i just made a typo and it executed successfully in linux cli with python version 3.7.

Specifically I&#39;m interested in the image information that should be found in the .crx file. \r\n\r\nOr maybe there is something wrong with the .CRX file?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015045/unpack-crx-file-created-by-canon-cr3-library-in-python","title":"Unpack .CRX file created by canon_cr3 library in Python"},{"tags":["dart","configuration","vagrant","port","portforwarding"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1080,"user_id":1953515,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50b08d90afd96271299a4dc0fcf672f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"julemand101","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1953515/julemand101"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569179639,"post_id":58015044,"comment_id":102503177,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015044/vagrant-access-dart-webdev-server#comment102503177_58015044"}],"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":8304629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/732359142efcf124901ac021ecc0db39?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dani California","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8304629/dani-california"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568909253,"creation_date":1568909253,"question_id":58015044,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015044","body_markdown":"I am learning Dart.

you don&#39;t set the width of the image and your image is really big they overflow the wrap div.\r\n\r\nDo this:\r\n```css\r\n#logo-center img {\r\n   width: 100%;\r\n   height: auto;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `height:auto` will keep the ratio of the image.\r\n\r\nOn my computer (Windows) at chrome **before**:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my computer (Windows) at chrome **after**:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**To centre image in the div:**\r\n\r\nYou will need to **make the `.table-responsive.bordered.fill` and `.logo-div` the same `width` and `height`** and than:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#container {\r\n  position: relative;\r\n}\r\n#container .logo-div {\r\n  postion: absolute;\r\n  top: 50%;\r\n  left: 50%;\r\n  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd please delete the `right` property on `.logo-div`.\r\n\r\nBasically, the `top` and `left` 50% will align in the middle but considering the borders. To put in the middle considering the centre of element you will need to use `transform: translate` top -50% and left -50% because this will move back based on the child element (.logo-div) size and not the parent (#container) or the border of the child.\r\n\r\n*PS: You can do it with a negative margin or flexbox (justify-content and align-items on centre). But I normally use this presented solution with translate.*\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DrVVO.jpg\r\n  [2]:

One of the queues requires that the messages are delayed for processing at a time in the future.  I noticed in the documentation for rabbmitmq there is a new plugin called RabbitMQ Delayed Message Plugin that seems to allow this functionality.  In the past for rabbmitmq based projects, I used seneca-amqp-transport for message adding and processing.  The issue is that I have not seen any documentation for seneca or been able to find any examples outlining how to add header properties.  \r\n\r\nIt seems as if I need to initially make sure the queue is created with x-delayed-type.  Additionally, as each message is added to the queue, I need to make sure the x-delay header parameter is added to the message before it is sent to rabbbitmq.  Is there a way to pass this parameter, x-delay, with seneca-amqp-transport?\r\n\r\nHere is my current code for adding a message to the queue:\r\n\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n        const client = require(&#39;seneca&#39;)()\r\n            .use(&#39;seneca-amqp-transport&#39;)\r\n            .client({\r\n                type: &#39;amqp&#39;,\r\n                pin: &#39;action:perform_time_consuming_act&#39;,\r\n                url: process.env.AMQP_SEND_URL\r\n            }).ready(() =&gt; {\r\n                client.act(&#39;action:perform_time_consuming_act&#39;, {\r\n                    message: {data: &#39;this is a test&#39;}\r\n                }, (err, res) =&gt; {\r\n                    if (err) {\r\n                        reject(err);\r\n                    }\r\n    \r\n                    resolve(true);\r\n                });\r\n            });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the code above, where would header-related data go?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015018/how-to-add-header-properties-to-messages-using-seneca-amqp-transport","title":"How to add header properties to messages using seneca-amqp-transport"},{"tags":["php"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5198,"user_id":5581565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIrnt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saly 3301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5581565/saly-3301"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568909290,"post_id":58015015,"comment_id":102433989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015015/php-file-renaming#comment102433989_58015015"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12091417,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB6sXHysBat3Knsr3vpXU1KRE-I-sunL-nJTonV=k-s128","display_name":"TheEdgyRocket","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12091417/theedgyrocket"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568909122,"creation_date":1568909122,"question_id":58015015,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015015","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve created a basic website that has user accounts and I&#39;d love if somebody on here could help me in making the following function in PHP.\r\n\r\n1.

am creating a drop-down list to help people choose media and ink for their printers and then generate a table to view the results. I have reached the point where the table is generated and can be downloaded as a PDF using jspdf, but the problem comes when you select a different printer. I cannot seem to figure out a way to clear the tbody elements first then populate the tbody with the medias and inks. \r\n\r\nI have done some research and found that using .empty() works to clear out tbody or divs that have code inside. I cannot figure out a way for the .empty to happen first and then the .each populate the table.    \r\n\r\nWhen the drop down is changed and a printer is selected the table populates perfectly. You can then use the download button to get the pdf of the table information. The problem is when you select a second printer the table just populates the list on top of the previous one. The .empty() isn&#39;t working first or at all. \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function captioncode() {\r\n      var e = document.getElementById(&quot;printers&quot;);\r\n      var resulting = e.options[e.selectedIndex].value;\r\n      document.getElementById(&quot;printertype&quot;).innerHTML = resulting + &quot;

It works neither with comments nor without it.)\r\n\r\n**The problem observed:**\r\nEverything in the first `.then()` block (`successCallBack()`) gets successfully executed, but I do not see result of `s3.putObject()`.\r\n\r\nThe bucket in question is public, no access restrictions. It used to work with sls offline option, then because of it not working in AWS I had to make lot of changes and managed to make successCallback() work which does the database work successfully. However, file upload still doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\n**Some questions:**\r\n\r\nWhile solving this, the real questions I am pondering / searching are, \r\n\r\n- Is lambda supposed to return something? I saw AWS docs but they have fragmented code snippets. \r\n\r\n- Putting `await` in front of `s3.putObject(params).promise()` does not help.

Everything you&#39;d like to change must be reflected in your code.\r\n\r\n    public partial class [removed for confidentiality]Context : IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        public [removed for confidentiality]Context()\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public [removed for confidentiality]Context(DbContextOptions&lt;[removed for confidentiality]Context&gt; options)\r\n            : base(options)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public virtual DbSet&lt;Foo&gt; Foos { get; set; }\r\n    \r\n        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)\r\n            {\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            modelBuilder.HasAnnotation(&quot;ProductVersion&quot;, &quot;[removed for confidentiality]&quot;);\r\n    \r\n            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Foo&gt;(entity =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                entity.Property(e =&gt; e.FooName).IsUnicode(false);\r\n            });\r\n    \r\n            OnModelCreatingPartial(modelBuilder);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        partial void OnModelCreatingPartial(ModelBuilder modelBuilder);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.entityframeworkcore.identitydbcontext-1?view=aspnetcore-2.1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58014966/ef-core-query-custom-identiyuser/58015192#58015192","title":"EF Core Query Custom IdentiyUser"}],"owner":{"reputation":1418,"user_id":1920035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRK2R.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1920035/david"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1418,"user_id":1920035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRK2R.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1920035/david"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58015192,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568909899,"creation_date":1568908970,"last_edit_date":1568909436,"question_id":58014966,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58014966","body_markdown":"I am still relatively new to EF Core and beforehand I used PetaPoco, so please forgive my ignorance. In my database, I added the following fields to my AspNetUsers table:\r\n\r\n - Elevated\r\n - Deactivated\r\n - FirstName\r\n - LastName\r\n\r\nI then created the following classes following [this blog article][1]:\r\n\r\n    public partial class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser\r\n    {\r\n        public bool? Deactivated { get; set; }\r\n        public bool?

In my controller, I want to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n    /// Gets every User.\r\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n    /// &lt;returns&gt;HTTP Result&lt;/returns&gt;\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(&quot;&quot;)]\r\n    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;&gt; GetUsers()\r\n    {\r\n        var users = await this._context.Users.Select(user =&gt; new\r\n        {\r\n            user.Id,\r\n            user.Decativated,\r\n            user.Elevated,\r\n            user.Email,\r\n            user.FirstName,\r\n            user.LastName\r\n        }).ToListAsync();\r\n    \r\n        return Ok(users);\r\n    }\r\nBut obviously I can&#39;t because the properties don&#39;t exist on the Users DbSet.\r\n\r\nSo long story short, I think that I have everything setup properly but how do I actually query my extended IdentityUser?\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nAs requested, the following is my DbContext.

To test, I&#39;m using a super simple script:\r\n\r\n```Invoke-Command -ComputerName MyServer -ScriptBlock { Write-Output &quot;HI&quot;}```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve run this command on a whole bunch of other servers that are configured identically (as far as I can tell), and they all run in a second or less. For this particular server, it takes 2 minutes or more. I can&#39;t figure out why. It does eventually execute properly, but it takes forever to establish the remote pssession.\r\n\r\nSome things I&#39;ve tried/verified:\r\n\r\n - Powershell version is identical on this machine and others (5.1.14393). OS version is the same.\r\n - I&#39;ve tried completely disabling Windows firewall, no luck\r\n - I&#39;ve tried using explicit credentials instead of Kerberos\r\n - Network adapter settings/IP 4 settings are identical on all machines. It doesn&#39;t matter if the servers are on the same subnet or not. \r\n - FROM the problem machine I can Invoke-Command remotely to other machines just fine (&lt; 1 second execution). On the problem machine, invoke-command to itself takes 2+ minutes\r\n - I&#39;ve tried setting PSSessionOptions with options as [described here][1].\r\n - Tried using ISE vs command line, no difference\r\n - Tried using enter-pssession, no difference\r\n - Tried using psexec on this and other servers. It works, takes about 20-30 seconds, but is consistent across all servers, including the problem server.\r\n - I&#39;ve restarted the WinRM service, rebooted the machine, re*deployed* the machine in Azure, no dice.\r\n - DISM and SFC to repair image and installed files\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the machine is identical to its &quot;brother&quot; that was set up at a similar time, in the same way, on the same subnet, with the same routing rules. The only difference is the machine size, but I&#39;ve queried other machines of different sizes and they work as expected.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m out of ideas.

Adding a hover to disable timer will pose other problems and is a kind of active state trying to scroll every timer timeout instead of scrolling only when new data is added and immediately when new data is added.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m looking for this exact behavior:\r\n\r\n- If current table is not scrolled 100% down (last line not visible): DO NOTHING when a line is added. (This means that the user is inspecting upper lines)\r\n- IF current table is scrolled 100% down before adding new lines (last line visible), then add lines and scroll 100%.\r\n\r\nMy annually scrollable table with fixed header is inspired from that: https://forum.alsacreations.com/topic-4-62439-1-TABLE--Scrollable-TBODY-and-fixed-THEAD-reloaded.html and it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this for now: http://www.usablesecurity.net/OSCAR/pkgs/downloads/screenshots/SystemImager_webgui_client_console.png\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when more lines are added, the user needs to scroll down to see them which is not convenient.\r\n\r\nI think I need to do that around line 71 (and maybe 55) in my code here: https://github.com/finley/SystemImager/blob/initrd-from-imageserver-and-dont-package-initrd/webgui/client_console.php\r\n\r\nbefore line 71: check if last line is visible and keep it in mind.\r\n After line 71: scroll down 100% if last line was visible before last update.\r\n\r\nThe css that makes the body scrollable is here starting at line 58: https://github.com/finley/SystemImager/blob/initrd-from-imageserver-and-dont-package-initrd/webgui/css/screen.css\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve searched the web for an auto-scrollable tbody only if last line is visible before update.

Sourcemap for all other files is given and the files are shown in dev mode in Chrome (e.g. for plain .ts files) and also for vue files that are not yet TS based and thus have no `lang=&quot;ts&quot;` attribute.\r\n\r\nHere my webpack extract for ts and vue files \r\n\r\n    devtool: &#39;inline-source-map&#39;,\r\n    module: {\r\n        rules: [\r\n          { test: /\\.vue$/,\r\n            loader: &#39;vue-loader&#39;\r\n          },\r\n          { test: /\\.ts$/,\r\n            exclude: /node_modules|vue\\/src/,\r\n            loader: &quot;ts-loader&quot;,\r\n            options: {\r\n              appendTsSuffixTo: [/\\.vue$/]\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        ...\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    resolve: {\r\n        alias: {\r\n          &#39;vue$&#39;: &#39;vue/dist/vue.esm.js&#39;\r\n        },\r\n        extensions: [&#39;*&#39;, &#39;.js&#39;, &#39;.vue&#39;, &#39;.json&#39;, &#39;.ts&#39;]\r\n      },\r\n\r\nand my tsc settings for sourcemaps and some others that may be relevant\r\n\r\n    &quot;sourceMap&quot;: true,                  \r\n    &quot;strict&quot;: true,                         \r\n    &quot;alwaysStrict&quot;: true,                  \r\n    &quot;moduleResolution&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,          \r\n    &quot;allowSyntheticDefaultImports&quot;: true,  \r\n    &quot;esModuleInterop&quot;: true,                   \r\n        \r\n    /* Source Map Options */\r\n    // &quot;sourceRoot&quot;: &quot;&quot;; \r\n    //&quot;mapRoot&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\r\n    //&quot;inlineSourceMap&quot;: true,              \r\n    // &quot;inlineSources&quot;: true  \r\n\r\n            \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58014876/sourcemap-missing-for-typescript-based-vue-file-due-to-lang-ts-attribute","title":"Sourcemap missing for typescript based vue file due to lang=&quot;ts&quot; attribute"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","jsp","digital-ocean","filenotfoundexception"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":528,"user_id":5332914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aee2e5a701875e608e92f7a0ac24d1e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user404","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5332914/user404"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568911910,"post_id":58014875,"comment_id":102435136,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58014875/spring-boot-404-jsp-page-not-found-when-runned-in-remote-server#comment102435136_58014875"},{"owner":{"reputation":523,"user_id":3510285,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cu8hw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hatice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3510285/hatice"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568930777,"post_id":58014875,"comment_id":102442310,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58014875/spring-boot-404-jsp-page-not-found-when-runned-in-remote-server#comment102442310_58014875"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":193,"user_id":8747255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BonzH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mukhamedali  Zhadigerov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8747255/mukhamedali-zhadigerov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568910708,"post_id":58015338,"comment_id":102434637,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58014875/spring-boot-404-jsp-page-not-found-when-runned-in-remote-server/58015338#comment102434637_58015338"},{"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":7630087,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/541a46e76d75400c20ef0ada359994db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Luke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7630087/luke"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":193,"user_id":8747255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BonzH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mukhamedali  Zhadigerov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8747255/mukhamedali-zhadigerov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568911368,"post_id":58015338,"comment_id":102434915,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58014875/spring-boot-404-jsp-page-not-found-when-runned-in-remote-server/58015338#comment102434915_58015338"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":7630087,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/541a46e76d75400c20ef0ada359994db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Luke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7630087/luke"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568910530,"creation_date":1568910530,"answer_id":58015338,"question_id":58014875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58015338","body_markdown":"I suggest to do some checks: \r\n\r\nCheck if:\r\n\r\n 1.

data-ng-style=&quot;{&#39;background-color&#39;:&#39;#&#39;+n}&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nIn controller `palette` is gathered from localForage (same as localstorage but async)\r\n\r\n

it&#39;s empty array. Now since I always want my array to contain 8 elements (also when other operations on this array) I have $watch which is invoked **after** `vm.palette = colors;` from above.\r\n\r\n    vm.$watch(&#39;palette&#39;, newVal =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(&#39;caught change&#39;);\r\n\r\n        if(newVal.length &lt; 8) {\r\n            const fillArr =  new Array(8 - newVal.length);\r\n            fillArr.fill(&#39;&#39;);\r\n            vm.palette = vm.palette.concat(fillArr);\r\n            console.log(&#39;after fill&#39;, vm.palette)\r\n            //$scope.$apply();\r\n        }\r\n    }, true);\r\n\r\nThis also works fine, after above code palette is array with 8 empty strings.
