All forms/styles etc are modern, multi choice answers are not allowed.\r\n\r\nI have 3 lists, A, B and C. C contains a lookup column to List B so that I can create a parent (B) link to (many) children (C).\r\n\r\nI would now like to create a fourth list D, which includes 3 columns looking up lists A, B and C. Doing this as a straight look up column is not an issue and works out of the box.  Except I would like to filter list C using the selected value from list B. I have been trying to make this work using powerapps and the &#39;Choices&#39;  and &#39;Filter&#39; functionality.\r\n\r\nso in form D, column 3 only show items from list C where list C \r\nparent = list B.selected\r\n\r\nIt appears that you are unable to filter lists where the filtering criteria is, itself, a lookup value.\r\n\r\nwhilst i can type the code into the powerapps editor (see below), the app/form cannot be saved because the code is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n    &quot;Filter(Choices(listC.itemNames), itemName = ListB.Selected.Value)&quot; (pseudo code)\r\n    &quot;Filter(Choices(&#39;Elements&#39;.Primary_Compliance), &#39;Primary Compliance&#39; = DataCardValue2.Selected.Value)&quot; (actual code)\r\n\r\nCould anyone point me in the right direction for a workaround please?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059973/cascading-lookup-list","title":"Cascading Lookup

have two multi-indexed dataframes ```df1``` with three levels and ```df2``` with two.

(this is the best case I can think off, I hope someone could provide a more elegant solution)\r\n\r\nYou might be better off making a stricter definition of your initial number rather than trying to ignore a multitude of specific cases for international numbers\r\n\r\n*PS - Stackoverflow is not a site to ask people to do your work for you, its to help clarify misunderstandings you may have with code that you have tried to implement or to better understand concepts related with development.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059954/regex-how-to-exlude-leading-and-and-following-charactes-and-phone-numbers/58060908#58060908","title":"RegEx: How to exlude leading and and following charactes and phone numbers?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12105694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a22b71e9da517ab6e37f69f888b3a74b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin I.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12105694/martin-i"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12105694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a22b71e9da517ab6e37f69f888b3a74b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin I.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12105694/martin-i"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1569263733,"creation_date":1569232931,"last_edit_date":1569263733,"question_id":58059954,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58059954","body_markdown":"We are currently building a Microsoft Outlook add-in that will be activated based on a regular expression in the email body text.

However, if I click on &#39;3&#39;, the results revert to the unfiltered results, I&#39;m given the results for page 3 of the unfiltered results instead of page 3 of the filtered results, and the total number of pages for the unfiltered results show in the pagination links.\r\n\r\nPlease could anybody help me to understand how to fix the issue and keep the filtered results when navigating through the pagination?\r\n\r\n*all_tickets.html:*\r\n\r\n```\r\n// filter form code //\r\n\r\n// Displayed results (unfiltered results displayed when page is first loaded) //\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- Pagination - only visible if there are multiple pages --&gt;\r\n{% if tickets.has_other_pages %}\r\n    &lt;ul class=&quot;pagination center-align&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- Previous/First button - only visible if previous page available --&gt;\r\n        {% if tickets.has_previous %}\r\n            &lt;!-- First page button --&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;\r\n                &lt;a href=&quot;?page=1&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-angle-double-left&quot;

This is because `CipherOutputStream#close` calls [`Cipher#doFinal`][1] that generates the tag and appends it to the ciphertext. This portion can only be written to the `FileOutputStream`-instance if `FileOutputStream#close` has not yet been called. By the way, `CipherOutputStream#flush` doesn&#39;t need to be called.\r\n\r\n- There is also a problem with decryption: In `decrypt`, `outputStream.write(data)` must be replaced by `outputStream.write(data, 0, read)`. Otherwise usually too much data will be written to the `FileOutputStream`-instance.\r\n\r\n- The classes [`javax.crypto.CipherInputStream`][2] and [`javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream`][3] may perform the authentication *false positive* and are therefore *not* suitable for GCM-mode, e.g. from the documentation (Java 12) for `CipherInputStream`:   \r\n\r\n &gt; This class may catch BadPaddingException and other exceptions thrown by failed integrity checks during decryption. These exceptions are not re-thrown, so the client may not be informed that integrity checks failed. Because of this behavior, this class may not be suitable for use with decryption in an authenticated mode of operation (e.g. GCM). Applications that require authenticated encryption can use the Cipher API directly as an alternative to using this class. \r\n\r\n  Therefore, either the Cipher API should be used directly, as recommended in the documentation, or the BouncyCastle-implementations [`org.bouncycastle.crypto.io.CipherInputStream`][4] and [`org.bouncycastle.crypto.io.CipherOutputStream`][4], e.g. for encryption:\r\n\r\n        import org.bouncycastle.crypto.io.CipherInputStream;\r\n        import org.bouncycastle.crypto.io.CipherOutputStream;\r\n        import org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.AESEngine;\r\n        import org.bouncycastle.crypto.modes.AEADBlockCipher;\r\n        import org.bouncycastle.crypto.modes.GCMBlockCipher;\r\n        import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.AEADParameters;\r\n        import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter;\r\n        ...\r\n        public void encrypt(File inputFile, File outputFile) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n            AEADBlockCipher cipher = getEncryptionCipher();\r\n            // Following code as before (but with fixes described above)\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n \r\n        public AEADBlockCipher getEncryptionCipher() throws Exception {\r\n\r\n            AEADBlockCipher cipher = new GCMBlockCipher(new AESEngine());\r\n            cipher.init(true, // encryption \r\n                new AEADParameters(\r\n                    new KeyParameter(getSecretKey().getEncoded()), \t\r\n                    128, // tag length\r\n                    getInitializationVector(), \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                    &quot;Optional Associated Data&quot;.getBytes()));\t\t\t\t\t\r\n            return cipher;\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n and analog for decryption. \r\n\r\n Note that even if authentication fails, decryption is performed, so the developer must ensure that the result is discarded and not used in this case. \r\n\r\n\r\n[0]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/CipherOutputStream.html#close()\r\n[1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/Cipher.html#doFinal()\r\n[2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/CipherInputStream.html\r\n[3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/CipherOutputStream.html\r\n[4]: https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/docs1.5on/index.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059932/badpaddingexception-mac-check-in-gcm-failed/58079815#58079815","title":"BadPaddingException: mac check in GCM failed"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":5048747,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XMdwi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dexter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5048747/dexter"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58079815,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569326254,"creation_date":1569232848,"question_id":58059932,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58059932","body_markdown":"I am trying to encrypt/decrypt using AES-GCM and JDK 1.8 CipherOutputStream, But getting BadPaddingException during decryption.

Curse of dimensionality as it is also known. KD-tree has a very poor scaling when it comes to a dimension above 15/20 (kinda exponential) whereas brute Force seems to follow a more linear-like pattern. When run on GPUs, for higher dimensions, brute force can indeed be faster.

In this case `2**64 = 1.8E19 &gt;&gt; 1797`, so KDTree is far slower.\r\n\r\nBasically, a KDTree does binary splits of the data along each dimension as a first step. If it has enough data to do that, it can guess the closest neighbors by the number of splits in common they have.  If `N &lt; 2**k`, it runs out of data before it runs out of dimensions to split.  It then has no distance information about the other dimensions.  With no good guess, it still has to brute force the rest of the dimensions, making the KDTree unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\nA more in-depth discussion of the issues and possible solutions can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5751114/nearest-neighbors-in-high-dimensional-data).

are running ECS as container orchestration layer for more than 2 years. But there is one problem which we are not able to figure out the reason for, In few of our (node.js) services we have started observing errors in ECS events as \r\n\r\n```\r\nservice example-service (instance i-016b0a460d9974567) (port 1047) is unhealthy in target-group example-service due to (reason Request timed out)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes our dependent service to start experiencing 504 gateway timeout which impacts them in big way.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Upgraded Docker storage driver from devicemapper to overlay2\r\n\r\n2. We increased the resources for all ECS instances including CPU, RAM and EBS storage as we saw in few containers.\r\n\r\n3. We increase health check grace period for the service from 0 to 240secs\r\n\r\n4. Increased KeepAliveTimeout and SocketTimeout to 180 secs\r\n\r\n5. Enabled awslogs on containers instead of stdout, but there was no unusual behavior\r\n\r\n6. Enabled ECSMetaData at container and pipelined all information in our application logs. This helped us in looking all the logs for problematic container only.\r\n\r\n7.

Why does red not do the same as blue **in chrome**? Is this a bug?\r\n\r\nIm **useing chrome** version: 76.0.3809.132. In firefox everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n# Question\r\n\r\nIm using the waapi to implement an animation relying on a custom timeline (for example the scroll position as timeline). The concept goes as follows:\r\n\r\nThe waapi allowes you to start an animation midway through by setting the `iterationStart` option somewhere between 0 and 1 (assuming the animation has just one iteration). When the animation is then immediately paused we get the requested frame. As the next imput gets in, we override the last frame.\r\n\r\nSo when we get the input of say 0.5 we&#39;d use the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//           test keyframes\r\nelem.animate({marginLeft: [&quot;0px&quot;, &quot;600px&quot;]}, {\r\n  duration: 100, \r\n  easing: &quot;linear&quot;,\r\n  fill: &quot;both&quot;, \r\n  iterations: 1, \r\n  iterationStart: 0.5 // input\r\n}).pause()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly, even with as we set such a frame every 1/60 sec. The problem however arises as we want to ease the aniamtion (e.g. `easing: &quot;ease&quot;` not `linear`). This introduces wierd gliches where the animation jumps around at **the same progress every time** (progress = iterationSatrt / input). The first jump for example is at `0.148` using `ease` as easing function. Can someone explain this behaviour? Is this a bug? \r\n\r\nI have come across the follwing correlation. `0.148 * 2` eased with the `ease` function is just over `0.5`. To calculate this I use the `bezier-easing` library. Here the example: https://runkit.com/embed/1wetjf7jjb2s. I dont know if this is at all relevant but I thought Id share my findings.\r\n\r\nHere the codesandbox link showing the problem: https://codesandbox.io/s/elated-jennings-6budz. Please note to not let it run too long at a time without reloading. \r\n\r\nThe blue div uses a fix to show the expected result. For this I kept `easeing: &quot;linear&quot;` but customly eased each input with the `bezier-easing` library as shown above (and in the code).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059838/waapi-easing-useing-custom-timeline-in-chrome-is-bugged","title":"Waapi easing useing custom timeline in chrome is bugged"},{"tags":["transactions","corda","consensus"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12106094,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e836f4fa34ee49b6b89095c6c58024e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106094/julian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569315318,"post_id":58065860,"comment_id":102547745,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059835/r3-corda-how-is-the-validity-of-a-transaction-input-checked-with-non-validating/58065860#comment102547745_58065860"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12106094,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e836f4fa34ee49b6b89095c6c58024e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106094/julian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569315438,"post_id":58065860,"comment_id":102547815,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059835/r3-corda-how-is-the-validity-of-a-transaction-input-checked-with-non-validating/58065860#comment102547815_58065860"},{"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":9875429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/V6tHv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ashutosh Meher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9875429/ashutosh-meher"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12106094,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e836f4fa34ee49b6b89095c6c58024e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106094/julian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569318169,"post_id":58065860,"comment_id":102549387,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059835/r3-corda-how-is-the-validity-of-a-transaction-input-checked-with-non-validating/58065860#comment102549387_58065860"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12106094,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e836f4fa34ee49b6b89095c6c58024e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106094/julian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569343391,"post_id":58065860,"comment_id":102563515,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059835/r3-corda-how-is-the-validity-of-a-transaction-input-checked-with-non-validating/58065860#comment102563515_58065860"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":9875429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/V6tHv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ashutosh Meher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9875429/ashutosh-meher"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569253191,"creation_date":1569253191,"answer_id":58065860,"question_id":58059835,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58065860","body_markdown":"Consensus in Corda happens at two levels:\r\n\r\n - Validity Consensus \r\n - Uniqueness Consensus\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.corda.net/key-concepts-consensus.html\r\n\r\n**Validity Consensus** involves running the contract by each of the parties involved in the transaction, and providing an agreement on the outcome of the transaction in the form for signature.\r\n\r\n**Uniqueness Consensus**, on the other hand, is taken care of by the notary, where it checks for double-spending.\r\n\r\nSo in your example notary would just check if the input used in the transaction involving Alice paying $20 to Bob, the notary (non-validating) cannot check for the validity part of the consensus, all it checks is whether the input used in the transaction has already been spent or not.\r\n\r\nThe validity part i.e. where the $20 payment is actually valid, has to be checked at the contract level, by the parties. They need to check that the amount of cash in the input state should be equal to the amount of cash in the output state of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThis, however, would require Bob to verify the entire transaction chain, which is also the case with any transaction in Corda, this is required as Bob was unaware of the state in question as he never used to have to state to validate that it was indeed valid.\r\n\r\nThis could be a privacy breach, hence Charlie could use a confidential identity which transacting which would hide his identity in the transaction chain, hence Bob would only know that there was a transaction in which Alice received $10 from an anonymous entity and Charlie&#39;s identity would not be revealed.\r\n\r\nIn future versions of Corda, nodes would likely only exchange transaction chains in SGX-encrypted form. These transaction chains will then be verified inside an SGX enclave on the node. This will prevent nodes from seeing the contents of the transactions they are verifying (see the blogpost here: https://www.corda.net/2017/06/corda-sgx-privacy-update/).

In my use case, it is a critical requirement that the history of the assets is kept confidential. \r\n\r\nThe Corda documentation provides a good overview, but I still don&#39;t understand how consensus is reached with the non-validating notary without showing the history of the asset to the other party involved in the transaction. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\nLet&#39;s say Alice received $10 in transaction A from Charlie and now wants to give $20 to Bob in transaction B. The non-validating notary has recorded transaction A, but does not know that the value of the transaction was $10 (if I understood this correctly, https://docs.corda.net/key-concepts-notaries.html). Now Alice is using transaction A in transaction B and the notary can verify that it hasn&#39;t been used before. But what prevents Alice from telling Bob that she received $20 from Charlie in transaction A? Bob would have to look at the chain of transactions to verify that Alice can actually spend the $20. Therefore, Bob would know the history of the cash. \r\n\r\nI would like to know if I misunderstood the documentation or if this is indeed an issue. \r\n\r\nThank you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059835/r3-corda-how-is-the-validity-of-a-transaction-input-checked-with-non-validating","title":"R3 Corda: How is the validity of a transaction input checked with non-validating notaries without revealing the history of the transaction?"},{"tags":["core-bluetooth","ios13"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":676,"user_id":2663686,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cafad4a02a93145905fccf6ecbe2fa6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Anton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2663686/anton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569321632,"post_id":58059834,"comment_id":102551364,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059834/ios-13-corebluetooth-always-get-nil-on-didwritevaluefor-characteristic-didupd#comment102551364_58059834"},{"owner":{"reputation":127,"user_id":6394379,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":15,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PZPsqxGpwEs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/TAHPhna2eYY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Denis Windover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6394379/denis-windover"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":676,"user_id":2663686,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cafad4a02a93145905fccf6ecbe2fa6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Anton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2663686/anton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569335317,"post_id":58059834,"comment_id":102559255,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059834/ios-13-corebluetooth-always-get-nil-on-didwritevaluefor-characteristic-didupd#comment102559255_58059834"}],"owner":{"reputation":127,"user_id":6394379,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":15,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PZPsqxGpwEs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/TAHPhna2eYY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Denis Windover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6394379/denis-windover"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569232536,"creation_date":1569232536,"question_id":58059834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58059834","body_markdown":"I have developed some app uses CoreBluetooth.

only there isn&#39;t such a feature, **there can never be one**. Doing so would make well-defined programs ill-formed or worst, having Undefined Behaviour.\r\n\r\nConsider this simple well-formed program:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct X {};\r\n\r\nauto bar(X x) -&gt; decltype(x)\r\n{\r\n    return x;\r\n}\r\n\r\nauto test()\r\n{\r\n    bar(X{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow would you transform it? There is no way to make `bar` take reference and not change the semantics of the program or make it UB\r\n\r\nIf you make `bar` take l-value reference then it can&#39;t accept a temporary:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct X {};\r\n\r\nauto bar(X&amp; x) -&gt; decltype(x)\r\n{\r\n    return x;\r\n}\r\n\r\nauto test()\r\n{\r\n    bar(X{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt;     &lt;source&gt;:12:5: error: no matching function for call to &#39;bar&#39;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         bar(X{});\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         ^~~\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     &lt;source&gt;:4:6: note: candidate function not viable: expects an l-value for 1st argument\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     auto bar(X&amp; x) -&gt; decltype(x)\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;          ^\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     1 error generated.\r\n\r\nIf you make it take an r-value reference then you cannot return it without further modifications:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct X {};\r\n\r\nauto bar(X&amp;&amp; x) -&gt; decltype(x)\r\n{\r\n    return x;\r\n}\r\n\r\nauto test()\r\n{\r\n    bar(X{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt;     &lt;source&gt;:6:12: error: rvalue reference to type &#39;X&#39; cannot bind to lvalue of type &#39;X&#39;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         return x;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;                ^\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     1 error generated.\r\n\r\nOk, you can solve this particular problem by moving the parameter. But that is well beyond what you initially set to change. Nevertheless, for the sake of the argument let&#39;s say you do, or that the original program was already doing it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;utility&gt;\r\n\r\nstruct X { };\r\n\r\nauto bar(X&amp;&amp; x) -&gt; decltype(x)\r\n{\r\n    return std::move(x);\r\n}\r\n\r\nauto test()\r\n{\r\n    bar(X{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis finally indeed compiles. But do you see the problem? You return a reference to an expired object, you return a dangling reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// before\r\n\r\n#include &lt;utility&gt;\r\n\r\nstruct X { auto foo() const {} };\r\n\r\nauto bar(X x) -&gt; decltype(x) // bar returns a prvalue\r\n{\r\n    return x;\r\n    // or\r\n    // return std::move(x); // redundant, but valid and equivalent\r\n}\r\n\r\nauto test()\r\n{\r\n    const X&amp; xr = bar(X{}); // xr prolongs the lifetime of the temporary returned by `bar`\r\n\r\n    xr.foo(); // OK, no problem\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// after\r\n\r\n#include &lt;utility&gt;\r\n\r\nstruct X { auto foo() const {} };\r\n\r\nauto bar(X&amp;&amp; x) -&gt; decltype(x) // now bar returns an xvalue\r\n{\r\n    return std::move(x);\r\n}\r\n\r\nauto test()\r\n{\r\n    const X&amp; xr = bar(X{}); // xr cannot prolong the life of an xvalue\r\n    // the temporary objects created as part of calling `bar` is now expired\r\n    // and xr references it\r\n    // any attempt to use xr results in UB\r\n\r\n    xr.foo(); // Undefined Behaviour\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no way to do what you want to do.\r\n\r\nThe burden is on you, the programmer: if you need values write values, if you need references write references. It&#39;s as simple as that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059827/c-compiler-force-pass-by-reference/58060915#58060915","title":"C++ compiler, force pass by reference"}],"owner":{"reputation":1435,"user_id":3416648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qsynr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DDS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3416648/dds"},"last_editor":{"reputation":270566,"user_id":207421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cfe5f7d64f44be04f147295f5c7b88e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user207421","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/207421/user207421"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569240651,"creation_date":1569232504,"last_edit_date":1569233017,"question_id":58059827,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58059827","body_markdown":"Is it possible to set as default a C++ compiler to interpret all parameter passing as being by-reference defining a new modifier to specify that you need a passage by copy.\r\n\r\nProgramming I found that only rerely I need to pass data by copy so, at least for me, would be much more effective to have &quot;reference by default&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059827/c-compiler-force-pass-by-reference","title":"C++ compiler, force pass by reference"},{"tags":["google-sheets"],"owner":{"reputation":417,"user_id":1363960,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdc427e20893da84be75cbce9f904337?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"andio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1363960/andio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569232448,"creation_date":1569232448,"question_id":58059823,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58059823","body_markdown":"I have a table and all the row height is set to fix height of 80 pixels  and turn on &#39;text wrapping&#39; for the cells  and everything looks perfect , but when i publish it to the web, the published version is ignoring this fix height.

At the moment my layout is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;RelativeLayout&gt;\r\n\r\n     &lt;SlidingPanelUp layout_above=&quot;bottom_navigation_view&quot;&gt;\r\n     \r\n

collapsed or closed i have to make navigation visible again.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that i use &quot;setVisibility&quot; method on the navigation bar and it just appears and disappears out of nowhere and the transition is really ugly. \r\n\r\nI tried using animations but the sliding animation from the SlidingPanel is faster than my custom animation so the navigation always ends up on top (basically the &#39;layout_above=&quot;bottom_navigation_view&quot;&#39; is not working).\r\n\r\nAny idea how to make it as smooth as SoundCloud?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

The result was the same.\r\n\r\nTried also setting the layer types of the views to LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE and LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE. Same result.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking the use of two AnimatorSet-s might have been something that slows the animation, but I tried removing the fading animations and the collapse was still laggy sometimes.\r\n\r\nI think the problem lies in the layout and its complexity.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a ConstraintLayout in a NestedScrollView.\r\nInside, the ConstraintLayout has:\r\n\r\n1) a nested ConstraintLayout;\r\n\r\n2) two RecyclerView-s;\r\n\r\n3) an `included` LinearLayout with 4 repeatedly fading in and out Views that is View.GONE by the time the animation starts;\r\n\r\n4) a CardView with a nested LienarLayout which CardView is also View.GONE;\r\n\r\n5) 1 Button, 1 View, 5 TextView-s;\r\n\r\n6) My addition to the layout -&gt; the collapsing background ImageView, another small ImageView, 2 x TextView, TextInputLayout + TextInputEditText, and a Button.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried removing stuff the animation gets better, and is 100% smooth when I remove the nested ConstraintLayout and the RecyclerView-s.\r\n\r\nIn reality though, the only thing I can think of doing is to remove the nested ConstrainLayout and constraining the views inside it to appear the same way they did before.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have ideas on how to improve performance here?\r\nBear in mind that I&#39;m quite limited in my actions since this is not a personal app.\r\n\r\nThank you very

Only when a message is delivered and the acknowledge is not received (or not emit in the expected time frame, 10s by default), or a no HTTP 200 is received in push mode.\r\n\r\n2nd: What is Beam? Beam is a pipeline engine. You can plug your PubSub to it and \r\n your pipeline will read message and deduplicate them. Be careful this deduplication is performed in a windows of 10 to 20 minutes by Beam.\r\n\r\n3rd: What mean &quot;ordered&quot;? Look at the ID of your message. The value is a timestamp, in microsecond (that&#39;s why PubSub can ingest up to 1M of message per second). Ordered the message mean having a message for sequential ID, else put in a buffer and wait for fill in the gaps. Of course, gaps will never be filled in...\r\n\r\nGo back to Beam. Beam has the capability to define [windows of observation](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#windowing). By the way, you can define, for example, sliding windows of 5 minutes, each windows starting every minute. When a window is closed, a PCollection of messages is triggered and it processed into your pipeline. On this finite collection, you can ordered your message. \r\n\r\nWith the same principle, you can remove depublicates manually in this collection.\r\n\r\nLast info, PubSub is a backbone of Google service. It evolves, slowly because it&#39;s critical.

You can obtain it as a center of BBOX, or center of a diagonal (line between any 2 points of polygon circumference far enough between each other like half of points) or intersection of 2 diagonals or as a average of all points or even randomly or however you want ...\r\n\r\n then just check if it lies inside polygon. This however must be done with slow approach (using all polygon points). Luckily this point is needed to compute just once (on creation/load/init of polygon).\r\n\r\n in case of wrong center just use different points to generate it or move it slightly until its inside.\r\n\r\n2. **divide your polygon into sections**\r\n\r\n using diagonal lines (gray lines) between selected center and any polygon point. Select points so the sections have roughly the same number of points and the diagonal itself **must not intersect any polygon edge**. So if you got `m` points and want `n` sections use every `m-th` point as diagonal... and if it intersects use nearby point instead until it is correct.\r\n \r\n The section should be done also just once per polygon.\r\n\r\n3. **faster inside**\r\n\r\n Now to detect if any point (Magenta) is inside first check which section it is by doing **CW/CCW** check between all diagonals or using `atan2` (in which case each diagonal angle can be precomputed once to speed up the process) finding two diagonals that envelope point in question:\r\n\r\n [![section][2]][2]\r\n\r\n so find diagonal which is CW to the point and has minimal angle ... and also another one that is CCW. If &quot;center&quot; point is `C` and tested point is `P` and diagonal points are `D(i)` then\r\n\r\n        angle = acos(dot(P-C,D(i)-C)/(|P-C|*|D(i)-C|))\r\n\r\n and z coordinate of `cross(P-C,D(i)-C)` will tell you if the diagonal/angle is CW or CCW. I think you can ignore the `acos` as the nonlinear result without it should be still monotonic so `min,max` will be still correct.\r\n\r\n This will tell you in which section the point is so now do polygon inside check but use just the section points and used diagonals instead of whole polygon.\r\n\r\n Now when you have your 2 closest diagonals CW `D(i)` and CCW `D(j)` then just test polygon constructed from `C` and all points between `D(i)` and `D(j)`.\r\n\r\n [![point inside section][3]][3]\r\n\r\n As you can see the more sections you have the less points you need for checking (but more diagonals) ...\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**PS** this note is for Paul\r\n\r\nAlgorithm using **CW/CCW**-ness works only for convex polygons on concave ones there are false negatives like in this image:\r\n\r\n [![error][4]][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ekZmW.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/xkj3z.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQCEH.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qaTBu.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059732/can-i-determine-using-only-a-subset-of-polygon-points-where-the-interior-of-th/58061531#58061531","title":"Can I determine, using only a subset of polygon points, where the interior of the polygon lies?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":318,"user_id":1435899,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62d4beafa99dc707da2a400597901681?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1435899","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1435899/user1435899"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569392786,"post_id":58073764,"comment_id":102577167,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059732/can-i-determine-using-only-a-subset-of-polygon-points-where-the-interior-of-th/58073764#comment102577167_58073764"},{"owner":{"reputation":535,"user_id":6505513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VBeEKQC6Ysw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/Ccxuosc_4t0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ben Whitmore","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6505513/ben-whitmore"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":318,"user_id":1435899,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62d4beafa99dc707da2a400597901681?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1435899","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1435899/user1435899"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569823812,"post_id":58073764,"comment_id":102706326,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059732/can-i-determine-using-only-a-subset-of-polygon-points-where-the-interior-of-th/58073764#comment102706326_58073764"},{"owner":{"reputation":535,"user_id":6505513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VBeEKQC6Ysw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/Ccxuosc_4t0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ben Whitmore","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6505513/ben-whitmore"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":318,"user_id":1435899,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62d4beafa99dc707da2a400597901681?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1435899","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1435899/user1435899"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569976642,"post_id":58073764,"comment_id":102766749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059732/can-i-determine-using-only-a-subset-of-polygon-points-where-the-interior-of-th/58073764#comment102766749_58073764"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":535,"user_id":6505513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VBeEKQC6Ysw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/Ccxuosc_4t0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ben Whitmore","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6505513/ben-whitmore"},"last_editor":{"reputation":535,"user_id":6505513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VBeEKQC6Ysw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/Ccxuosc_4t0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ben Whitmore","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6505513/ben-whitmore"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569976443,"last_edit_date":1569976443,"creation_date":1569303951,"answer_id":58073764,"question_id":58059732,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58073764","body_markdown":"The usual approach would be to project a line horizontally left from your given point and find the nearest edge that that line intersects. The direction of that edge tells you whether the point is inside or outside the polygon (with a path direction imposed as per Paul&#39;s suggestion). If no edge is encountered, you are, of course, outside.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, you need each cell of your binary tree to reference every edge that *passes through* the cell, *even if its vertices are outside the cell*. You may sometimes need to traverse through multiple cells to find the nearest intersecting edge.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWithin the cell that contains our point of interest (see the right-hand enlargement above), we project a line out from the point to the left. It meets no edges before it hits the cell boundary. So we must traverse into the next cell over, and continue our line. It hits an edge whose y-direction is positive; thus we conclude the point is *outside* the polygon.\r\n\r\nObserve that a cell can hold information for vertices that fall outside the cell boundaries, so that every edge that passes across the cell is referenced.\r\n\r\nThis approach works for polygons of any complexity *as long as they do not self-intersect*, as well as shapes with multiple (unconnected) contours.\r\n\r\n**Dealing with self-intersecting polygons:**\r\n\r\nIf you expect to encounter self-intersecting polygons, you can no longer tell if you are inside or outside by examining just the *nearest* edge. You must instead use the [non-zero winding rule][2] or the [even odd rule][3], which require counting *all* edges to the left of your point.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you probably shouldn&#39;t bother making x-wise splits in your binary tree: instead let each cell cover the entire width of the polygon, and only split in the y-axis. There is little point creating multiple cells across the x-axis when on average you&#39;ll have to traverse through half of them anyway. This makes the algorithm simpler, as you only need to look at one cell to find all edges to the left of your point.\r\n\r\nBut you can go a step further. As you are only splitting in one axis, you can abandon your standard binary tree and instead use an [interval tree][4] for best efficiency. The simplest variety is an *augmented* interval tree.\r\n\r\n**An edge case (excuse the pun) to be careful of when coding this up:**\r\n\r\nIf your projected line passes directly through a vertex: this vertex is part of *two* edges, so which does the line hit first? It can make a big difference. To simplify this situation you should *only* consider an edge to be intersected if the y-position of the projected line is *strictly less than* the y position of the highest of the edge&#39;s two vertices.\r\n\r\nBelow are illustrated three points, whose projected lines pass through the lowest vertex, the mid-point and the highest vertex of an edge (&#39;highest&#39; meaning largest y-value; edge direction is unimportant here). The first two lines intersect the edge; the third doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\nAs a result, perfectly horizontal edges are always ignored, and you can if you wish skip these when populating your binary tree (or interval tree).\r\n\r\nIf using an interval tree, you can deal with this edge case directly in the tree&#39;s search routine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0VMw.png\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93odd_rule\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/32Igk.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58059732/can-i-determine-using-only-a-subset-of-polygon-points-where-the-interior-of-th/58073764#58073764","title":"Can I determine, using only a subset of polygon points, where the interior of the polygon lies?"}],"owner":{"reputation":318,"user_id":1435899,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62d4beafa99dc707da2a400597901681?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1435899","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1435899/user1435899"},"last_editor":{"reputation":318,"user_id":1435899,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62d4beafa99dc707da2a400597901681?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1435899","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1435899/user1435899"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58073764,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569976443,"creation_date":1569232115,"last_edit_date":1569233532,"question_id":58059732,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58059732","body_markdown":"I&#39;m attempting to render the subset of a polygon with a large amount of points (n &gt; 100 000).

When exactly one list is over, i append it to a main dataframe (initially empty). So we have exactly 1000 records in dataframe at first outer for loop. and increamentally we have 1000 extra records for each loop. The problem however is, that tehre are 1,500 times that each for loop would run, and on every run , the time keeps increasing(strange as on every run it proccesses 1000 times only).
