The language standard acknowledges the existence of a variety of I/O devices with differing characteristics, but it makes no provisions for managing any of them.\r\n\r\nIf instead you mean simply that you don&#39;t want to install or link additional libraries to your program then it&#39;s platform specific, but often yes, there are terminal-management functions provided that way.  In particular, POSIX defines a terminal-control interface whose functions and data structures are sometimes known as &quot;termios&quot;, after [the POSIX-standard termios.h header file][1] where they are declared.  I&#39;m not so sure I would characterize it as an &quot;easy API&quot;, but it should allow you to turn off keyboard input being echoed to the terminal display via two functions calls (or just one, depending on how you count).  You would want to look specifically at [the tcgetattr() and tcsetattr() functions][2].

While it is something I simply don&#39;t like, a more concrete reason is that I have standardised my ```~/.bashrc``` and ```~/.bash_profile``` across multiple computers, some of which have conda installed in different locations. So in this case I want to add some conditional conda setup based on hostname.\r\n\r\nSo my question is why does ```conda init``` need to be able to modify this block beyond the initial installation phase? Put another way, if I modify this myself and remove the ```# &gt;&gt;&gt; conda initialize &gt;&gt;&gt;``` and ```# &lt;&lt;&lt; conda initialize &lt;&lt;&lt;``` markers will it prevent conda from updating properly in the future?\r\n\r\nNote: there are other questions [like this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54429210/how-do-i-prevent-conda-from-activating-the-base-environment-by-default) that are helpful.

have two data frames with different numbers of rows, thus:\r\n\r\n    df1:\r\n               Data1\r\n    2019-03-01 0.011\r\n    2019-04-01 0.021\r\n    2019-05-01 0.013\r\n    2019-06-01 0.032\r\n

0.032\r\n    2019-07-01 0.029\r\n\r\nThe row names are dates. I want to add a second column, &quot;Result&quot;, to df1. This column would sum the value in df1$Data1 + the value in the row of df2$Data2 with the same row name. (The row names in both data frames are unique and ordered.) So, for example:\r\n\r\n    df1$Result[1] &lt;- df1$Data1[1] + df2$Data2[3]\r\n\r\nThe result would be:\r\n\r\n    df1:\r\n               Data1 Result\r\n    2019-03-01 0.011 0.044\r\n    2019-04-01 0.021 0.038\r\n    2019-05-01 0.013 0.068\r\n    2019-06-01 0.032 0.064\r\n    2019-07-01 NA    NA\r\n\r\nThe only way I can figure out how to do this is with a looping construct, but I have to think there is a better way. I&#39;m not finding it, though, so I imagine I&#39;m looking for the wrong thing. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nI am also open to other suggestions for getting to the same end. So, for example, if this would be easier to accomplish with the dates in a data column instead of in the row name, that would be fine. Or if it would be easier to do with a ts object, although I generally find data frames easier to work with.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314061/sum-data-from-two-data-frames-matched-by-rowname","title":"Sum data from two data frames matched by rowname"},{"tags":["swift"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":19700,"user_id":1974224,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQQMq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cristik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1974224/cristik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570683529,"post_id":58314058,"comment_id":102991712,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314058/why-do-the-functions-in-class-extension-use-static-dispatch#comment102991712_58314058"}],"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":8076137,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1cJv5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dowZhang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8076137/dowzhang"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570669451,"creation_date":1570669325,"last_edit_date":1570669451,"question_id":58314058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58314058","body_markdown":"As the title describe, this question is about swift function dispatch. when a function defined in class internal it will use table dispatch.

what I understand you&#39;re trying to join `TABLEONE` and `TABLETWO` on these conditions: \r\n\r\n1. `a.TS = b.UCDE`\r\n\r\n2. `a.ICI IS NOT NULL AND a.ICI = b.STM` and Logic #3; otherwise join on

condition:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT a.TDATE, a.AMT, a.ISI, a.TS, b.UCDE, a.ICI, b.STM, a.S_ID,\r\nCASE WHEN b.SRL1 IS NULL THEN &#39;0000000000&#39; ELSE b.SRL1 END AS SRL, a.RES,\r\n-- Manually

   )\r\n    ) OR\r\n    (a.ICI IS NULL AND b.STM IS NULL) -- a.ICI IS NULL then join on b.STM IS NULL\r\n  )\r\nORDER BY (CASE WHEN STM IS NULL THEN 2 ELSE 1 END)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t have a `TD` system to test, but give it a try and let me know how it turns out.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don&#39;t quite follow this line `If it does not find a match (i.e. b.STM IS NULL), then return DESC for that row.`  I assume that&#39;s logic you have in your `CASE` expression in your `SELECT` so I didn&#39;t touch that part.\r\n\r\n**Update**  \r\nHere&#39;s a truth table based on the query in my answer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCase\ta.ICI\tb.STM\t&quot;Match&quot;\tJoin rows?\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n1\t\tNULL\tNULL\tNO\t\tYES\r\n2\t\t5E\t\tNULL\tNO\t\tNO\r\n3\t\tNULL\t6B\t\tNO\t\tNO\r\n4\t\t5E\t\t6B\t\tNO\t\tNO\r\n5\t\t5E\t\t5E\t\tYES\t\tLogic #3 (a.S_ID = b.SRL?)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this the logic you&#39;re looking for?  If you&#39;re getting the rows you expect, then you can just add a `COALESCE` or `CASE` statement in your `SELECT` to display the correct `DESC` value.\r\n\r\nIf the logic in the table above is not what you want and you&#39;re not getting the expected rows, then based on your comment of having `b.STM IS NULL` as a catch-all, I think you could just modify this line `(a.ICI IS NULL AND b.STM IS NULL)` to be simply `(b.STM IS NULL)`.  That would cause the join to work for Case #2.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314045/how-to-prioritize-or-order-and-account-for-nulls-in-join-on-statement-for-multip/58316586#58316586","title":"How to prioritize OR order and account for NULLs in JOIN ON statement for multiple tables in Teradata SQL?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":47819,"user_id":2527905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aY8e6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dnoeth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2527905/dnoeth"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570793557,"creation_date":1570793557,"answer_id":58340407,"question_id":58314045,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340407","body_markdown":"I doubt you can get the expected result using a single join without multiple rows matching, which must be removed using an OLAP function like ROW_NUMBER (can be quite expensive on a large table). \r\n\r\nTry a 2nd join to `tabletwo` (of course, then you need `COALESCE` for each column from that table):\r\n\r\n    SELECT a.TDATE, a.AMT, a.ISI, a.TS,\r\n       Coalesce(b1.UCDE, b2.UCDE), a.ICI,\r\n       Coalesce(b1.STM,  b2.STM), a.S_ID,\r\n       Coalesce(b1.SRL,  b2.SRL, &#39;0000000000&#39;) AS SRL,\r\n       a.RES,\r\n       -- Manually override certain conditions\r\n       CASE\r\n          WHEN (a.ISI = &#39;AP&#39; AND a.TS = &#39;1234&#39;) THEN &#39;APP&#39;\r\n          WHEN (a.ISI = &#39;JK&#39; AND a.TS = &#39;1234&#39;) THEN &#39;JAX&#39;\r\n          ELSE Coalesce(b1.DESC, b2.DESC)\r\n       END AS DESC_\r\n    FROM tableone AS a\r\n    LEFT JOIN tabletwo AS b1\r\n      ON a.TS = b1.UCDE\r\n     AND (a.ICI = b1.STM OR (a.ICI IS NULL AND b1.STM IS NULL))\r\n     AND (Coalesce(Right(a.S_ID,6), &#39;000000&#39;) = Coalesce(b1.SRL, &#39;000000&#39;))\r\n    LEFT JOIN tabletwo AS b2\r\n      ON a.TS = b2.UCDE\r\n     AND (a.ICI = b2.STM OR (a.ICI IS NULL AND b2.STM IS NULL))\r\n     AND b1.UCDE IS NULL -- join only if no match based on SRL, yet\r\n\r\nPerformance will mainly depend on the PI of tableone and the number of rows in tabletwo.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314045/how-to-prioritize-or-order-and-account-for-nulls-in-join-on-statement-for-multip/58340407#58340407","title":"How to prioritize OR order and account for NULLs in JOIN ON statement for multiple tables in Teradata SQL?"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":7396713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TWREsf1oWjE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH8/ZYfxcnMRKWg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"emiwark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7396713/emiwark"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25,"user_id":7396713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TWREsf1oWjE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH8/ZYfxcnMRKWg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"emiwark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7396713/emiwark"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58316586,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570793557,"creation_date":1570669200,"last_edit_date":1570674406,"question_id":58314045,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58314045","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to join `TABLEONE (a)` and `TABLETWO (b)` on three key columns to then return a description `DESC` for roughly 1 billion rows of data.\r\n\r\nWhile one of these columns is an easy join (`a.TS = b.UCDE`), the other two have various rules which need to be executed in a specific order so they can match properly.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m having trouble accounting for this behaviour, specifically with what happens when certain columns have NULL values.\r\n\r\nThe rules are:\r\n\r\n1. `a.TS = b.UCDE` (always)\r\n2.

And if the element I&#39;m trying to place is equal to an element it&#39;s found, then simply to return the position of that element. I don&#39;t expect a lot of elements in this array, never more than a 1000, but even a 100 elements and a full 100 iterations is **extremely costly**, and since all lookup costs are user-side, it&#39;s in my benefit to make this as efficient as possible. \r\n\r\nI understand sorting algorithms but what we&#39;re using here is a pre-sorted array, as each element that will be added to this array will be sorted one by one over time. Now, what I&#39;ve come up with is and I don&#39;t know the name for this, to divide the array length by half,  do a conditional; compare it the next value or the value beneath it and then divide the or multiply the divisional by half it&#39;s value, then check the neighbors again and multiply or divide by half, the half of the divisional and so on until I get the correct value.\r\n\r\nWill this work?

All I want to do is add it as one of the fields in one of the models but when I try to run\r\n\r\n    sudo python3 manage.py makemigrations\r\n\r\nin the virtual environment, I get\r\n\r\n    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;django&#39;\r\n    \r\n    The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n    \r\n    Traceback(most recent call last):\r\n        File &quot;manage.py&quot;, line 14, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n         ) from exc\r\n\r\nAs the app is currently running fine, why am I receiving this error?\r\nIf this is not how you apply changes in the model field in the live server, how else are you supposed to do it?\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nList list of pip installed packages:\r\n\r\n    APScheduler==3.5.3\r\n    astroid==1.6.4\r\n    Django==2.0.5\r\n    et-xmlfile==1.0.1\r\n    freezegun==0.3.10\r\n    holidays==0.9.6\r\n    isort==4.3.4\r\n    jdcal==1.4\r\n    lazy-object-proxy==1.3.1\r\n    mccabe==0.6.1\r\n    mock==2.0.0\r\n    mod-wsgi==4.6.4\r\n    mysqlclient==1.3.12\r\n    openpyxl==2.5.3\r\n    pandas==0.24.2\r\n    pbr==4.2.0\r\n    pylint==1.9.1\r\n    pylint-django==0.11.1\r\n    pylint-plugin-utils==0.2.6\r\n    python-dateutil==2.7.3\r\n    pytz==2018.4\r\n    rope==0.10.7\r\n    simplejson==3.16.0\r\n    six==1.11.0\r\n    tzlocal==1.5.1\r\n    wrapt==1.10.11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314007/modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-django-when-trying-to-run-makemigrations","title":"ModuleNotFoundError: No Module named &#39;django&#39; when trying to run makemigrations"},{"tags":["php","codeigniter","gd"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":562,"user_id":5426560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ed71bacc6f370c59a3182ba0d9fe0d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omar Abbas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5426560/omar-abbas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570681229,"post_id":58314006,"comment_id":102991233,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314006/81-5000-display-browser-image-created-by-phps-gd-library-using-codeigniter#comment102991233_58314006"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10481238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pe7LOR08kW0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAj8/GNCll01jPyA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Fernando Soares","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10481238/fernando-soares"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":562,"user_id":5426560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ed71bacc6f370c59a3182ba0d9fe0d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omar Abbas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5426560/omar-abbas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570741502,"post_id":58314006,"comment_id":103019949,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314006/81-5000-display-browser-image-created-by-phps-gd-library-using-codeigniter#comment103019949_58314006"},{"owner":{"reputation":562,"user_id":5426560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ed71bacc6f370c59a3182ba0d9fe0d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omar Abbas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5426560/omar-abbas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570759890,"post_id":58314006,"comment_id":103024111,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314006/81-5000-display-browser-image-created-by-phps-gd-library-using-codeigniter#comment103024111_58314006"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10481238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pe7LOR08kW0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAj8/GNCll01jPyA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Fernando Soares","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10481238/fernando-soares"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570668760,"creation_date":1570668760,"question_id":58314006,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58314006","body_markdown":"I have the following code to display in the browser an image created through the GD library, I am using CodeIgniter.

This library is used to read/write GPIOs on the RPi. I am currently using [WiringPi-Sim](https://github.com/dotsha747/WiringPi-Sim) on an Intel/AMD Linux host, which is just a set of basic stubs that do nothing but allow the application to be built and run on the non-RPi host, which is where I&#39;d prefer to run the tests.\r\n\r\nThe C++ application-under-test (AuT) makes a handful of TCP connections to other processes, and receives UDP datagrams from another process. It also writes some data to a serial TTY (normally an external RS485 adapter).\r\n\r\nFor the tests, I need to check a few things by treating the AuT as a black box and removing as many dependencies on the RPi, serial device, external processes, etc, as possible:\r\n\r\n - That the AuT starts up correctly and initialises a set of GPIOs to specific values.\r\n - That the AuT changes a set of GPIOs during execution to specific values.\r\n - That the AuT responds to incoming data on the TCP and UDP sockets.\r\n - That the AuT writes and reads specific data on the serial TTY.\r\n - That the AuT shuts down correctly on receipt of an appropriate signal (e.g. SIGINT), that specific data is seen on the TTY as a result, and that the GPIOs are set to specific final values.\r\n\r\nMy current thinking is to use Python (e.g. `pytest`) to implement the tests:\r\n\r\n - Simple TCP servers can be created within the Python test app to pretend to be the external TCP server applications that the AuT can connect to,\r\n - A simple UDP sender within the Python test app can send appropriate data to the UDP socket on the AuT.\r\n - A fake TTY can be created to act as the serial port, and the python test application can read/write from that (maybe via `socat`?), as can the AuT,\r\n - A library or shared object based on WiringPi-Sim can be written that allows the Python test app to monitor and influence the GPIO state (as far as the AuT can see).\r\n - Then the python app can start the main process and send appropriate signals to check behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe bit I&#39;m not so sure about is the WiringPi &quot;mock&quot; shared object. I know it can be injected into the AuT process with `LD_PRELOAD` but I&#39;m not sure how to communicate with the mock object from the Python test application. Would I need to utilise shared memory or some kind of IPC to allow the library instance in the AuT to communicate with the Python test app? Could the Python test app run a TCP server and the WiringPi mock connects &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to relay data/control to the test app? Could the mock object somehow integrate with Python in some python-friendly way?\r\n\r\nCan the mocked shared object communicate with the test app via a UNIX socket or pipe, perhaps?\r\n\r\nI have the full source for the C++ AuT so I could implement most or all of this in C++ rather than Python, however some aspects (e.g. the simple TCP servers) would be faster and simpler to write in Python. I also like `pyenv` quite a it.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there&#39;s already a solution for this kind of test harness. It doesn&#39;t need to be Python-based, but that is what I&#39;m used to. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nEDIT: another idea is to extract the core of the AuT and test this using C++ language bindings, with dependency injection and C++ mocks. However an important requirement is to test the **built** application, rather than a source-level modification of the application, as it is important to run these tests on the same binary that is shipped, for safety and audit reasons.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313993/what-is-an-effective-test-strategy-for-testing-an-application-by-mocking-ip-sock","title":"What is an effective test strategy for testing an application by mocking IP sockets, serial port, and a shared library?"},{"tags":["ios","objective-c","mkmapview","coordinate-systems","cllocationcoordinate2d"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3238,"user_id":870565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/86wGY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pnizzle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870565/pnizzle"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570668924,"post_id":58313991,"comment_id":102988732,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313991/mkmapview-get-bounding-coordinates-when-map-is-rotated#comment102988732_58313991"}],"owner":{"reputation":3238,"user_id":870565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/86wGY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pnizzle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870565/pnizzle"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3238,"user_id":870565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/86wGY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pnizzle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870565/pnizzle"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570669087,"creation_date":1570668583,"last_edit_date":1570669087,"question_id":58313991,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313991","body_markdown":"I have an MKMapView, that when panned (region did change), the view controller sends off a request to a server to get objects (lets call them houses) within the bounding coordinates.

(Why are there two possible ways to pass the topic ARN?  SNS originally only supported topics as targets, but now supports other kinds of things, so this is likely a case of API backwards-compatibility, which AWS is typically very good at.)\r\n\r\n**tl;dr: Occasionally, when an IAM policy used by a Lambda Execution Role is modified, the Lambda function does not behave as if the policy change has occurred.**\r\n\r\nThe reason it appeared to work only after changing from one to the other was related (on some level) to what happens when you update the code for a Lambda function.\r\n\r\nThe Lambda service manages the containers that run your code, with each container running not more than one concurrent invocation of the function at a time.  Subsequent invocations may reuse the same container... but only when the code associated with the function is identical, unchanged.\r\n\r\nUpdate the function code and then run the function again (for the first time with the new code in place) and you are guaranteed to be in a new container that hasn&#39;t been used before.\r\n\r\nThe new container must fetch the temporary credentials for the Lambda Execution Role using The [`AssumeRole`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) action in AWS Security Token Service, which provides a temporary AWS-Access-Key-ID and Secret Key, as well as a Session Token.  Lambda [stores these in environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-environment-variables.html) as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, where the AWS-SDK in your function (used to make calls to other services, like SNS, in this example) picks them up and uses them to sign requests.\r\n\r\nWhat OP ran into was a quirk somewhere this setup.  Something in IAM or STS results in cached or stale data inside AWS systems -- a policy (or the latest version of a policy) that was necessary to allow the Lambda execution role to perform the `SNS:Publish` action against the topic in question was not yet visible to a component that needed to see it, in order for the action to be allowed.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear where exactly this caching occurs.  Lambda of course caches the temporary credentials, but so does the EC2 metadata service, and so does any well-behaved client, since it wouldn&#39;t make sense to continually make requests to STS when the temporary credentials are still valid.  I&#39;m not convinced that the caching of the credentials, themselves, is the cause (though it contributes).\r\n\r\nSTS credentials are a black box, especially that &quot;Session Token.&quot;  Does it contain encrypted data?  Or is it just a large random value, literally nothing more than a symbolic &quot;token&quot; with no intrinsic meaning?  It doesn&#39;t really matter, but the point is that it isn&#39;t clearly documented.\r\n\r\nIAM is a massive, distributed system, so it naturally does have &quot;eventual consistency&quot; [issues that can arise](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20157294/1695906) on occasion.\r\n\r\nBut, somehow, creating a new Lambda container -- which necessarily must make a new call to STS -- seems to have a cache-busting side effect that makes the current IAM policies for the execution role become available in cases where things don&#39;t work, in a new deployment.\r\n\r\nThe seems to pop up on occasion after you try a given action, it fails, and you realize you need to edit the IAM policy that you intended to be sufficient to allowed the action.  So you edit the policy, but subsequent attempts still fail, yet the policy seems valid, so you can&#39;t figure out why it isn&#39;t working, and you toss your hands in the air, send a message to John Rotenstein that you are at your wits&#39; end... then, after giving up for the night in dispair, you return the next morning to troubleshoot further, and discover it&#39;s suddenly working.\r\n\r\nPresumably this is related to the old execution role temporary credentials being replaced, either due to the containers being pruned and replaced due to inactivity, or simply because temporary credentials have a finite lifespan... but it is unclear whether refreshing the STS tokens is actually a necessary part of the solution, or whether it simply fixes a logjam in side IAM as a side effect.\r\n\r\nRedeploying the Lambda function to test a code change would likely have the same effect, either way, as it did here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313945/what-is-the-difference-between-topic-arn-and-target-arn-aws-sns/58344980#58344980","title":"What is the difference between Topic ARN and

you are describing is essentially adding another dimension to the dataset. There are a few ways to achieve that, but note that some ways might be confusing to other people. The other program you are exporting to might also have strong expectations of the data&#39;s shape, etc, so check that. What follows is just some thoughts about what you&#39;re trying to do...\r\n\r\nEssentially, you&#39;re describing having 2 &#39;attributes&#39; of the data: the colour image (a 3-channel attribute), and the height field (a single &#39;channel&#39;). Some options:\r\n\r\n- **Keep them as 2 separate ndarrays.** That is, a 3D array for the image and a 2D array for the height field. Name them appropriately and save them in a sensible file structure. If I was in a hurry, this is what I would do (basically, do nothing).\r\n- **Put them both into an HDF5 file using [`h5py`](https://www.h5py.org/).** This format is essentially like a little file system, with nested &#39;folders&#39;, and it allows for an arbitrary amount of documentation and metadata. It also provides compression, arbitrary array access, and other useful things. So it&#39;s great for organizing lots of (or two) ndarrays, especially if they are large.\r\n- **Use [`xarray`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/).** This is basically n-dimensional `pandas` and would let you store the two arrays in a single data structure. It&#39;s not ideal for this use case, but it does at least let you label the axes, so you can be clear about what the 4 &#39;channels&#39; are.\r\n- **Make a Python `class` for your data.** This way you can document exactly what the two arrays are, and write methods to do things like plot them together. Class instances can be pickled and saved to disk, or you can write methods to save them in whatever way you like (as HDF5, for example). If I was going to be doing a lot of this and needed a robust, sustainable solution, this is what I would do.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how the class might look:\r\n\r\n    class BumpImage():\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        An image with a 3d height field attached.\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        def __init__(self, photo, height):\r\n            if photo.ndim == 2:\r\n                # Make greyscale image into RGB.\r\n                photo = np.repeat(photo[:, :, None], 3, axis=-1)\r\n            self.photo = photo\r\n            if height.shape == photo.shape[:2]:\r\n                self.height = height\r\n            else:\r\n                raise TypeError(&quot;Height must be 2d array&quot;)\r\n\r\n        def size(self):\r\n            return self.height.shape\r\n\r\n        def plot(self, ax=None):\r\n            # Make a 3d plot with matplotlib or whatever.\r\n            return ax\r\n\r\n        def save(self, fname):\r\n            # Make HDF5 file called fname.\r\n            return\r\n\r\nThings I would not do:\r\n\r\n- Stack the height channel onto the other 3 channels in NumPy, to make a single 4-channel &#39;image&#39;. I would say this is a bad idea, since there&#39;s no convenient way to document what you did in NumPy.\r\n- Try to render them together in some way, e.g. as a plot with the height field expressed as hillshade or in a 3D view, etc. It will be very hard to separate the two datasets again.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313943/converting-2d-depth-image-heatmap-to-3d-height-field/58322559#58322559","title":"Converting 2D depth image/heatmap to 3D height field?"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11371600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12c6080d22565732e11b38851dcb4e86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"doraginuru92","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11371600/doraginuru92"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11371600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12c6080d22565732e11b38851dcb4e86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"doraginuru92","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11371600/doraginuru92"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58322559,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570709283,"creation_date":1570667993,"last_edit_date":1570669991,"question_id":58313943,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313943","body_markdown":"I was wondering how to convert a 2D depth image/heatmap to a 3D height field.

      // Create book buttonc\r\n        $(&quot;.edit-customer&quot;).modalForm({formURL: &quot;{% url &#39;crm:edit_customer&#39; 1 %}&quot; });\r\n\r\n      });  \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter I did that, the editing form popped up, but with unformulated fields and layout like this: \r\n\r\n[The Unformulated Page][1]\r\n \r\n```\r\nedit_customer.html\r\n\r\n{% load widget_tweaks %}\r\n{% load
