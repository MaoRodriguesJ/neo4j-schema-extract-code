Totally free with VS2017 Community.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZX0Z.png\r\n\r\nI think it is the part I was looking for to resolve my problem. \r\n\r\nI tested: \r\n\r\n - **HeidiSQL**: so simple but I didn&#39;t like the theme used. you can&#39;t debug.\r\n - **Toad for mysql**: until now was working with it but now they migrated to **ToadEdge**. \r\n - **ToadEdge**: Now trial only.\r\n - **Workbrench**: Nice solution to forget of Toad but without Debug.\r\n - **dbForge Express**: good theme and easy to work, for me the best one, but debug is in payment products.\r\n -  **MySQL Debugger**: Windows defender didn&#39;t execute because told me it could damage my OS. Untrusted.\r\n -  **Database4**: Windows defender didn&#39;t execute because told me it could damage my OS. Untrusted.\r\n \r\n - **Saving logs**: it is a good idea but you lose too much time configuring it and sometimes is not good to watch the solution.\r\n\r\nMy best bet is dbForge ... but I will use Server Explorer of .Net to debug my stores.\r\n\r\nI hope this solution can help you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209247/sql-developer-what-is-the-reason-i-cannot-debug-or-execute-sp-in-mysql-with-sql/58233836#58233836","title":"sql developer: what is the reason I cannot debug or execute SP in mysql with SQL Developer?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2374,"user_id":3451964,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e694631237d8a033bdaf67847dc37b82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3451964/david"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5639,"user_id":1000551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d8cb0eaa4de7f781e42328ec7544ca3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vadim Kotov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1000551/vadim-kotov"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58216544,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570898502,"creation_date":1570049831,"last_edit_date":1570095334,"question_id":58209247,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209247","body_markdown":"I am quering with oracle sql developer my mysql database.

The simplest way to achieve that is to concatenate the root and sub files together:\r\n\r\n````\r\n$ cat testeroot.cer testesub.cer &gt;testerootandsub.cer\r\n````\r\n\r\nNext we verify like this:\r\n\r\n````\r\n$ openssl verify -CAfile testerootandsub.cer testeapp.cer\r\n````\r\n\r\nUnfortunately when I try this I get some errors:\r\n\r\n````\r\nCN = ecc-crypto-services-encipherment_UC6-InMemory, OU = ApplePay, O = Apple Inc., C = US\r\nerror 34 at 0 depth lookup: unhandled critical extension\r\nCN = ecc-crypto-services-encipherment_UC6-InMemory, OU = ApplePay, O = Apple Inc., C = US\r\nerror 10 at 0 depth lookup: certificate has expired\r\nerror testeapp.cer: verification failed\r\n````\r\n\r\nSo the first one is an &quot;unhandled critical extension&quot; and the second one is &quot;certificate has expired&quot;.

Secondly there is a critical extension that OpenSSL does not recognise:\r\n\r\n````\r\n            1.2.840.113635.100.6.39: critical\r\n                ..\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe can get OpenSSL to ignore these two errors like this:\r\n\r\n````\r\n$ openssl verify -ignore_critical -no_check_time -CAfile testerootandsub.cer testeapp.cer \r\ntesteapp.cer: OK\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe second scenario I talked about is where the intermediate certificate is not trusted by the verifier. In this case the verifier is assumed to have the root in their trust store, and the intermediate and end entity certificates will have been supplied to them.

I don&#39;t know if there is a solution for that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209234/typescript-pass-property-by-reference/58209531#58209531","title":"Typescript pass property by reference"}],"owner":{"reputation":30338,"user_id":871910,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f073f5ca74b61813e689bbda8d12ba2b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"zmbq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/871910/zmbq"},"last_editor":{"reputation":30338,"user_id":871910,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f073f5ca74b61813e689bbda8d12ba2b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"zmbq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/871910/zmbq"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58209527,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570051295,"creation_date":1570049768,"last_edit_date":1570050782,"question_id":58209234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209234","body_markdown":"I have a Typescript class with 4 different properties, like this:\r\n\r\n    class MyClass {\r\n         private x: number;\r\n         private y: number;\r\n         private z: number;\r\n         private w: number;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI want to create four functions that increment these properties:\r\n\r\n       incrementX() { this.x++; }\r\n       incrementY() { this.y++; )\r\n       ...\r\n\r\nHowever, I don&#39;t want the increment logic (`++`) to be duplicated, I want to place it in one function.

Recently I had a test where I wanted a mocked function to return different things depending on how many times it was called. I thought this could be done using the side_effect array technique outlined [here][1]. It seems to work, but theres a problem. I make and exhaust a side_effect array in test A, and if test B runs after test A and also happens to call that same function, I guess it refers to the now mocked version of the function instead of the actual one. This causes an unexpected `StopIteration` error as test B tries to draw from a now depleted array of return values. Here is a code example of my issue\r\n\r\n    class tests(unittest.TestCase):\r\n        def test_a():\r\n            myfile.myclassinstance.myfunction = MagicMock(side_effect=[1, 2, 3])\r\n            myfile.myclassinstance.myfunction()  # returns 1\r\n            myfile.myclassinstance.myfunction()  # returns 2\r\n            myfile.myclassinstance.myfunction()  # returns 3\r\n            \r\n        def test_b():\r\n            myfile.myclassinstance.myfunction()  # StopIteration error raised if test_a runs first\r\n\r\nI think the issue is connected to the fact that both tests reference the same class instance (Though I though each test ran as like a &quot;fresh run&quot;). Is there any way to un-mock a mocked method? Kind of like [reset_mock()][2]?\r\n\r\nAlso for some additional information, running the tests independently, they pass.

the second character of the string (remember - indexes in Java start at `0` and not at `1`).\r\n\r\nProbably the easiest fix for you is going to be to move these two lines:\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Please enter a phone number (ddd)ddd-dddd :&quot;);\r\n    number = sc.nextLine();\r\n\r\nTo just after the `String number = &quot;&quot;;` line, like this:\r\n\r\n    String

another method would be to `UNION` the results of multiple queries.\r\n\r\nNOTE: You never mentioned your table name. The code below assumes it&#39;s `Table`\r\n\r\nThis is our basic query. Easy enough to build, so long as you understand `GROUP BY`.\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT State, City, SUM(Incidents)\r\nFROM Table\r\nGROUP BY City, State;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using Rollup\r\n[Adding `ROLLUP` is simple](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/craigfr/2007/09/21/aggregation-with-rollup/):\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT State, City, SUM(Incidents)\r\nFROM Table\r\nGROUP BY City, State WITH ROLLUP;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using Union\r\nIf you need to combine queries with `UNION`, you might do it this way:\r\n\r\n1. Build your queries.\r\n2. Modify your queries to have the same number of columns in a similar order\r\n3. Apply `UNION` (probably, `UNION ALL`) \r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- Build the three queries\r\n-- By City\r\nSELECT State, City, SUM(Incidents)\r\nFROM Table\r\nGROUP BY City, State;\r\n\r\n-- By State\r\nSELECT State, SUM(Incidents)\r\nFROM Table\r\nGROUP BY State;\r\n\r\n-- Overall\r\nSELECT SUM(Incidents)\r\nFROM Table\r\n; -- No GROUP BY!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same queries, modified to have the same number of columns, and joined with a `UNION`:\r\n```sql\r\n  SELECT State, City, SUM(Incidents)\r\n  FROM Table\r\n  GROUP BY City, State\r\nUNION ALL\r\n  SELECT State, &#39;ALL&#39; AS City, SUM(Incidents)\r\n  FROM Table\r\n  GROUP BY State\r\nUNION ALL\r\n  SELECT &#39;All States&#39; AS State, &#39;ALL&#39; AS City, SUM(Incidents)\r\n  FROM Table\r\n;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209206/sql-using-multiple-agregate-functions-at-once/58209361#58209361","title":"SQL Using Multiple Agregate Functions At Once"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":870966,"user_id":1144035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e514b017977ebf742a418cac697d8996?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Linoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570063087,"last_edit_date":1570063087,"creation_date":1570051540,"answer_id":58209576,"question_id":58209206,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58209576","body_markdown":"Use [`grouping sets`][1]:\r\n\r\n    select state, city, sum(incidents)\r\n    from t\r\n    group by grouping sets ( (state), (state, city), () );\r\n\r\nNote:  I assume you need `state` and `city` together for the `city` rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-group-by-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209206/sql-using-multiple-agregate-functions-at-once/58209576#58209576","title":"SQL Using Multiple Agregate Functions At Once"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12154949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed6c45a04103b848e368bde638ee6575?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mojaveEvan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154949/mojaveevan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570063087,"creation_date":1570049601,"last_edit_date":1570049745,"question_id":58209206,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209206","body_markdown":"I need help with some aggregate functions.

The last traversal is different from the first two because, as a `String` value it refers to a standard property key named &quot;id&quot;. Generally speaking, TinkerPop would recommend that you not use a property key name like &quot;id&quot; or &quot;label&quot; as it can lead to mistakes and confusion with values of `T`.\r\n\r\nAs for the second part of your question revolving around:\r\n\r\n    g.V().has(&#39;Event&#39;, T.id, event[&#39;Id&#39;]) \r\n    g.V().hasLabel(&#39;Event&#39;).has(T.id, event[&#39;Id&#39;])\r\n\r\nYou can&#39;t pass `T.id` to the 3-ary form of `has()` as Kelvin points out as the step signature only allows a `String` in that second position. It also wouldn&#39;t make sense to allow `T` there because `T.label` is already accounted for by the first argument and `T.id` refers to the actual graph element identifier. If you know that value then you wouldn&#39;t bother specifying the `T.label` in the first place, as the `T.id` already uniquely identifies the element. You would just do `g.V(event[&#39;Id&#39;])`.

If the application code fails to compile, ng serve will continue presenting the last good build. This can make testing and troubleshooting difficult. Is there a way to use ng serve that will stop serving up the application if the compile fails?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve searched on Google and in the various github repos&#39; issue lists for angular, and I don&#39;t see anyone talking about this.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example scenario where this could be helpful (among many):\r\n\r\n- You have some failing unit tests. You need to make changes and see if they fix the test or not. You make a change, forget a semicolon (or make another compile error), and you see that the test continues to fail, but you miss that the reason the test isn&#39;t fixed is because you are still running the same test from the previous attempt due to a compile error.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that I can determine whether there is an existing way to deal with the issue when developing a local angular application. I&#39;m also interested in whether or not other people are interested in having an option to not serve on a failed compile.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209184/how-to-stop-serving-site-on-a-compile-error-with-ng-serve","title":"How to stop serving site on a compile error with ng

It serves as a &quot;line separator&quot; that separates unparsed input from parsed input/output string. Then we parse input from the beginning - we handle `^&lt;number&gt;Y`, then `^&lt;number&gt;M` and so on. If for example `^&lt;number&gt;Y` is matched, then we add `+ \\1 year` on the end of the string after `\\x01` and anything else. Parsed parts are removed as we parse them.

This works well enough but sometimes I feel that this can get unwieldy and less direct, at times - especially when I just want a single method and I know there&#39;s not going to be a future addition.\r\nI&#39;ve been switching to Kotlin recently and I&#39;ve been wondering if it makes sense to simply have a direct function var declared in the View subclass, as `Optional` with a `null` default value, something like this:\r\n\r\n``` lang-Kotlin\r\nclass SuperAmazingButton: ImageButton{\r\n    var customAction: (()-&gt;Unit)? = null\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen we need to call customAction we can do it in a simple one liner like this along with the safe null check:\r\n``` lang-Kotlin\r\ncustomAction?.invoke()\r\n```\r\nWhat I&#39;d like to know is if there are any downsides to this approach? Will the android `Context` that is holding on to the View somehow get leaked when the `Activity` or `Fragment` gets dismissed? Are there any other problems that can occur? I mean this looks so simple, easy and straightforward without requiring any new files - it&#39;s almost too good to be

Calling `Count()` means iterating over it - which in turn means the `Union` code iterating over `files1` and `files2`. I suspect you have an awful lot of files.\r\n\r\nThe way to tell that is to measure how long it takes to iterate over `files1` and `files2` separately. One easy way to do that is to call `ToList()`. For example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// The use of ToList forces the result to be materialized, rather than using deferred\r\n// execution.\r\n\r\nvar stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();\r\nvar files1 = Directory\r\n    .EnumerateFiles(dirSwReporter, swReporterFileName, SearchOption.AllDirectories)\r\n    .ToList();\r\nvar files1Time = stopwatch.Elapsed;\r\n\r\nstopwatch.Restart();\r\nvar files2 = Directory\r\n    .EnumerateFiles(dirSwReporter2, swReporterFileName, SearchOption.AllDirectories)\r\n    .ToList();\r\nvar files2Time = stopwatch.Elapsed;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen log `files1Time` and `files2Time`. Now that the content is in two lists, counting the `Union` won&#39;t involve any IO. It will still need to basically create a `HashSet&lt;string&gt;` as it goes, in order to avoid returning the same value more than once, but it will be much, much quicker.\r\n\r\nThis approach won&#39;t be any faster overall - and will use more memory - but it&#39;ll make it obvious whether most of the time is in searching in `dirSwReporter` or `dirSwReporter2`, which may be enough to help you optimize.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209175/call-to-ienumerable-count-takes-multiple-seconds/58209233#58209233","title":"Call to IEnumerable.Count() takes multiple seconds"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9544,"user_id":2581562,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u0aMo.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Legends","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2581562/legends"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570091769,"post_id":58210101,"comment_id":102806821,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209175/call-to-ienumerable-count-takes-multiple-seconds/58210101#comment102806821_58210101"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9661,"user_id":581076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQGy0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tymtam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/581076/tymtam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9661,"user_id":581076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQGy0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tymtam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/581076/tymtam"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570099092,"last_edit_date":1570099092,"creation_date":1570055196,"answer_id":58210101,"question_id":58209175,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210101","body_markdown":"The information about the deferred execution is buried in the Remarks sections at .NET Framework 4.7 [Directory.EnumerateFiles Method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.enumeratefiles?view=netframework-4.7)&#39;s doco.  \r\n\r\n&gt; The `EnumerateFiles` and `GetFiles` methods differ as follows: When you use `EnumerateFiles`, you can start enumerating the collection of names before the whole collection is returned; when you use `GetFiles`, you must wait for the whole array of names to be returned before you can access the array.

error is asking you to identify the `.sln` or `.csproj` (or other proj type) file b/c `dotnet` doesn&#39;t know what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nI tend to use variables for this kind of thing because I&#39;m often using the solution name in other tasks.\r\n\r\n## example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrigger:\r\n- master\r\n\r\npool:\r\n  name: &#39;buildserver&#39;\r\n\r\nvariables:\r\n  buildConfiguration:

that remains unclear)_\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyRepo\r\n|--.git\r\n|--src\r\n   |--proj1\r\n   |  |--proj1.csproj\r\n   |\r\n   |--proj2\r\n   |  |--proj2.csproj\r\n   |\r\n   |--mySol.sln\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou

 displayName: &#39;dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the above examples you shouldn&#39;t need to specify the `.sln` or `.csproj` as each potential build target lives in its own directory, and the dotnet cli searches from `$pwd` if you don&#39;t give it a value. Therefore, if your pipeline is working in the root of the repo (default behavior), `dotnet` should find the `.sln` file first and build it. \r\n\r\n## However \r\nIf your directory structure looks like the following, then you would need to specify:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyRepo\r\n|--.git\r\n|--src\r\n   |--proj1.csproj\r\n   |--class1.cs\r\n   |--class2.cs\r\n   |--proj2\r\n   |  |--proj2.csproj\r\n   |  |--class1.cs\r\n   |\r\n   |--mySol.sln\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above `dotnet` doesn&#39;t know whether you want to build `mySol.sln` or `proj1.csproj`, so indicating the file to build should solve your problem, but I might suggest that you restructure your repository.\r\n\r\n##If `proj2` doesn&#39;t make its home in `myRepo` \r\nAnd is a dependency of `proj1` then you will need to do some other acrobatics (ie: manual git repo clone) in the pipeline to get that project and it&#39;s files where they need to be.

Use both of them in your tests.\r\n\r\n&gt; Espresso tests state expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details getting in the way.\r\n\r\n&gt;Espresso tests run optimally fast! It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest.\r\n\r\nThis is Espresso&#39;s [Multiprocess][2] and this is the [Cheat Sheet][3] for Espresso.\r\n\r\n**Use Espresso with ActivityTestRule**\r\n\r\n&gt; The following section describes how to create a new Espresso test in the JUnit 4 style and use ActivityTestRule to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.

My setup is a custom Android tablet running Android 8.1.0 (the &quot;primary display&quot;) connected to a touchscreen (the &quot;secondary display&quot;) via HDMI (to deliver video signal) and USB (to deliver touch events).\r\n\r\nThe app contains a single activity, which displays &quot;Hello World!&quot; on the primary display but also leverages `DisplayManager` and `WindowManager` to add a counter and two `+` / `-` buttons to the secondary display:\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9iox.png&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9iox.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;\r\n&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nRunning the app normally and interacting with the buttons on the secondary display works as expected.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to use [UI Automator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-automator) to, say, click the `+` button and verify that the the counter records the correct value. This appears to be impossible. Does anyone know how I can do this?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if UI Automator is not the right tool for the job, but there is some _other_ tool that will let me write end-to-end black box-style tests for apps that display content on a secondary display, I am happy to get recommendations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Some things I&#39;ve investigated\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used the `uiautomatorviewer` tool to inspect the layout hierarchy of my app. Only the content on the primary display is visible with this tool:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used [`UiDevice.dumpWindowHierarchy()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/uiautomator/UiDevice.html#dumpwindowhierarchy_1) to get a text dump of everything on the device. Only the content on the primary device is dumped, though _this_ includes information about system windows like the status bar and navigation bar.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used `adb shell dumpsys window` (with both the `tokens` and `windows` commands). **This** will show me information about the window that I&#39;ve created on the secondary display, but I seem to have no way to access this window through Ui Automator:\r\n\r\n    Display #1\r\n    WindowToken{551f82f android.os.BinderProxy@87f65ac}:\r\n      windows=[Window{e40e275 u0 com.example.stackoverflow}]\r\n      windowType=2038 hidden=false hasVisible=true\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\r\n\r\n    Window #10 Window{20ac4ce u0 com.example.stackoverflow}:\r\n      mDisplayId=1 mSession=Session{91fdd93 8079:u0a10089} mClient=android.os.BinderProxy@a3e65c9\r\n      mOwnerUid=10089 mShowToOwnerOnly=true package=com.example.stackoverflow appop=SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW\r\n      mAttrs=WM.LayoutParams{(0,0)(fillxfill) sim=#20 ty=2038 fl=#1280480 colorMode=0}\r\n      Requested w=1280 h=800 mLayoutSeq=908\r\n      mBaseLayer=121000 mSubLayer=0 mAnimLayer=121000+0=121000 mLastLayer=121000\r\n      mToken=WindowToken{a42e219 android.os.BinderProxy@a3e65c9}\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Relevant code samples\r\n\r\nAdding the content to the secondary display (in my Activity&#39;s `onResume()` method):\r\n\r\n    DisplayManager manager = (DisplayManager) getApplicationContext().getSystemService(Context.DISPLAY_SERVICE);\r\n    Display display = manager.getDisplays(DisplayManager.DISPLAY_CATEGORY_PRESENTATION)[0];\r\n    Context displayContext = getApplicationContext().createDisplayContext(display);\r\n    WindowManager windowManager = (WindowManager) displayContext.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE);\r\n\r\n    LinearLayout root = new LinearLayout(displayContext);\r\n    WindowManager.LayoutParams params = createLayoutParams();\r\n    windowManager.addView(root, params);\r\n\r\n    View.inflate(root.getContext(), R.layout.overlay, root);\r\n    root.findViewById(R.id.minus).setOnClickListener(v -&gt; decrementCounter());\r\n    root.findViewById(R.id.plus).setOnClickListener(v -&gt; incrementCounter());\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using the Application context instead of the Activity context so that the content on the secondary display is not dependent on the lifetime of the Activity that creates it.

Of course, you&#39;ll then need to work around having `y` in `baz` (of module `B`) having declared type `foo`: such a `y` doesn&#39;t have a component `ii`.

The function can take as argument this data. The subroutine is just there to call this function with the given data. Now let us assume the data can be of type foo. I would assume that I can also pass data of the from foo derived type bar. Apparently Fortran disagrees. \r\n\r\nI have tried to compile the code below with gfortran 9. It fails with the error message:\r\n\r\n       47 |         call funA(x, y, baz)\r\n          |                        1\r\n    Error: Interface mismatch in dummy procedure ‘baz’ at (1): Type mismatch in argument &#39;y&#39; (CLASS(foo)/CLASS(bar))\r\n\r\nVarious other attempts of replacing foo by bar yield similar resuts.

The function baz must know that y is of type bar, otherwise it cannot access ii. However the rest of the code doesn&#39;t really need to know this, does it?\r\n\r\nWhere is the error in my reasoning?

The first problem I have is that I have three separate price accounting arrays. One is for the product price, another for the subtotal, another including subtotal + another option. I have no trouble adding items to the cart however, it&#39;s just the update that sometimes messes up. Another problem I have is that if I have multiple items in my cart that only the latest added(at the bottom) can be updated.\r\n\r\nThe update itself works it&#39;s that it works the wrong way, let&#39;s say I have a product that costs `0.01653800`, my added option to the price costs `0.00253000`. So when I update my quantity, the sub-total(excluding the added option) multiplies fine, however the total price shows something entirely different, it shows `0.03813600`. This is obviously not correct, if you do the math.\r\n\r\nThis is my code in the view:\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php echo form_open(&#39;main/update&#39;); ?&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;update_row_id&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $items[&quot;rowid&quot;]; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;update_max_qty&quot; value=&lt;?php echo $items[&quot;options&quot;][&quot;max_stock&quot;]; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;update_qty&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $items[&quot;qty&quot;]; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;?php echo form_submit(&#39;submit&#39;, &#39;submit&#39;); ?&gt;\r\n&lt;?php echo form_close(); ?&gt;\r\n```\r\nThis is my controller function:\r\n```\r\nif (isset($_POST[&#39;update_submit&#39;])) {\r\n\r\n\r\n  foreach($this-&gt;cart-&gt;contents() as $updates):\r\n\r\n      $total = $this-&gt;input-&gt;post(&#39;update_qty&#39;) * $updates[&#39;options&#39;][&#39;actual_price&#39;];\r\n\r\n    $data = array(\r\n      &#39;rowid&#39; =&gt;  $this-&gt;input-&gt;post(&#39;update_row_id&#39;),\r\n      &#39;qty&#39; =&gt;  $this-&gt;input-&gt;post(&#39;update_qty&#39;),\r\n      &#39;options&#39; =&gt;  array(\r\n        &#39;subtotal&#39;  =&gt;  $total,\r\n        &#39;distribution&#39;  =&gt;  $updates[&#39;options&#39;][&#39;distribution&#39;],\r\n        &#39;notes&#39;  =&gt;  $updates[&#39;options&#39;][&#39;notes&#39;],\r\n        &#39;extras_price&#39;  =&gt;  $updates[&#39;options&#39;][&#39;extras_price&#39;],\r\n        &#39;product_price&#39;  =&gt;  $updates[&#39;options&#39;][&#39;product_price&#39;],\r\n        &#39;max_stock&#39; =&gt;  $updates[&#39;options&#39;][&#39;max_stock&#39;]\r\n      ),\r\n      &#39;subtotal&#39;  =&gt;  $updates[&#39;options&#39;][&#39;extras_price&#39;] + $total\r\n    );\r\n  endforeach;\r\n\r\n    if ($this-&gt;input-&gt;post(&#39;update_qty&#39;) &gt; $this-&gt;input-&gt;post(&#39;update_max_qty&#39;)) {\r\n      exit(&quot;You can&#39;t buy more than &quot;.$this-&gt;input-&gt;post(&#39;update_max_qty&#39;).&quot; of this item!&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      redirect(&#39;main/cart_page&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI&#39;m assuming I can only update one item because of the way I&#39;ve assigned the hidden input containing the rowid.

You could use that logging abstraction in your project and integrate it with NLog.\r\n\r\nFor example in ASP.NET Core you could inject `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt;` and that could send the logs to NLog. (see [Getting started with ASP.NET Core 2 &#183; NLog/NLog Wiki]( https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Getting-started-with-ASP.NET-Core-2))\r\n\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;\r\n\r\npublic class HomeController : Controller\r\n{\r\n    private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;\r\n\r\n    public HomeController(ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger)\r\n    {\r\n        _logger = logger;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public IActionResult Index()\r\n    {\r\n        _logger.LogInformation(&quot;Index page says hello {Name}&quot;, &quot;Universe&quot;);\r\n        return View();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Packages\r\n\r\nFor NLog and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging there are the following packages:\r\n\r\n- The .NET core logging abstractions are in the package [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions/)\r\n- The NLog integration for those abstractions is in package [NLog.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLog.Extensions.Logging/). You could use this package for .NET Core console applications.\r\n- For ASP.NET Core, there is an optimized package [NLog.Web.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLog.Web.AspNetCore)  which uses NLog.Extensions.Logging\r\n \r\n\r\n## Comparision\r\n\r\n### NLog Pros\r\nPros of using NLog directly\r\n\r\n- Best performance\r\n- More options with the logger API, e.g. `Logger.WithProperty(..)`\r\n- Works in all platforms\r\n- No Dependency Injection needed which saves complexity. \r\n\r\n### Pros Microsoft.Extensions.Logging\r\nPros of using NLog via Microsoft.Extensions.Logging:\r\n\r\n- Fully integrated with ASP.NET Core, e.g. Microsoft also writes to the logger API and that will be also captured (and possible filtered) by NLog\r\n- Writing to the logging abstraction will make your code log-library independent. \r\n- Works well with .NET Core Dependency injection","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209076/microsoft-extensions-logging-vs-nlog/58210510#58210510","title":"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging Vs.

I am looking for advice on what is the easiest route to go without sacrificing performance/security..\r\n\r\nCurrently my site structure is:&lt;br&gt;\r\nMain Company site: www.xxxx.com &lt;br&gt;\r\nScheduler site:    schedule.xxxx.com","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209068/advice-needed-merging-two-instances-of-codeigniter","title":"Advice needed merging two instances of Codeigniter?"},{"tags":["configuration","babeljs","webpack-dev-server","webpack-4","tslint"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11842393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6c412174b982907ce0abd3ff1a836c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DerekDH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11842393/derekdh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570114045,"post_id":58209067,"comment_id":102818929,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209067/what-are-the-proper-configurations-for-a-mixed-ts-js-webpack-babel-tslint-p#comment102818929_58209067"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11842393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6c412174b982907ce0abd3ff1a836c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DerekDH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11842393/derekdh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11842393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6c412174b982907ce0abd3ff1a836c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DerekDH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11842393/derekdh"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570049590,"creation_date":1570048860,"last_edit_date":1570049590,"question_id":58209067,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209067","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on setting up a dev flow for my company utilizing webpack, babel, typescript, and tslint (and probably a 100+ other dependencies) - as of now I have a working base project but it seems I can only either transpile my src/index.js or compile my src/app.ts.

I know how PCA works. I wish to apply PCA to the image data set for image classification. I understand following should be steps to follow:\r\n\r\n1. Considering the size of Data, I apply PCA and then project the given data selecting the first two eigenvectors having the largest eigenvalues. \r\n2. I created Feature vectors from the first step and use them to train a classifier.\r\nMy question is once the classifier is trained, how would I use this classifier on unseen image data. It is because the classifier is trained on feature vector obtained through PCA. should I need to convert the unseen image into the feature vector following the PCA. if it is the case how would I use PCA on the unseen image data? Please advice.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nNadeem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209063/feature-vector-using-pca-for-classification","title":"Feature vector using PCA for classification"},{"tags":["node.js","firebase","express","firebase-authentication","firebase-admin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13975,"user_id":226391,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69dc78b59ef008c58e6e842f9f3e0624?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Bleigh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/226391/michael-bleigh"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570058168,"post_id":58209057,"comment_id":102798324,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209057/firebase-admin-is-it-necessary-to-check-if-uid-decoded-on-the-server-based-on#comment102798324_58209057"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10915,"user_id":1164465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xsyv3.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Christopher Peisert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1164465/christopher-peisert"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10915,"user_id":1164465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xsyv3.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Christopher Peisert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1164465/christopher-peisert"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570064319,"last_edit_date":1570064319,"creation_date":1570063678,"answer_id":58211027,"question_id":58209057,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58211027","body_markdown":"The Firebase Admin docs recommend the following approach to verify the currently signed-in user on the server.\r\n\r\n&gt; If your Firebase client app communicates with a custom backend server, you might need to identify the currently signed-in user on that server. To do so securely, after a successful sign-in, send the user&#39;s ID token to your server using HTTPS. Then, on the server, verify the integrity and authenticity of the ID token and retrieve the `uid` from it. You can use the `uid` transmitted in this way to securely identify the currently signed-in user on your server.\r\n\r\nTherefore, you only need to get the user&#39;s ID token on the client and send it to the server using `HTTPS`.

DataContext is also not a problem - a connection between View and ViewModel is not being broken. I&#39;ve noticed that broken animation is always the first one in xaml file. Now the &quot;Gray&quot; animation stops working correctly, but if i change order in xaml file, firebrick animation will be the broken one.
