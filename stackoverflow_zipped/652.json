When looking at the [architecture diagram in the Akita documentation](https://netbasal.gitbook.io/akita/#what-is-akita) and examples such as [this one on the Akita GitHub repo](https://github.com/datorama/akita/blob/master/examples/angular-ecommerce/src/app/products/products-page/products-page.component.ts#L16) I see that the Query is accessed directly in components. I was surprised to see this because I expected that the state management part of an application would be hidden behind the services and abstracted away from the consumers, i.e. components. Unlike the Query, [the Store is hidden behind the Service](https://github.com/datorama/akita/blob/master/examples/angular-ecommerce/src/app/products/state/products.service.ts#L28) and not accessed directly in the components. The way I see it, if the Query was hidden behind the Service like the Store is hidden behind the Service, then the consumers would only need to import one thing, i.e. the Service, for each data source. \r\n\r\nSo my question is why does Akita want us to access the Query directly in components but not the Store?

Seems to have started recently, not sure what the cause might be.\r\n\r\nWith any fresh installation of Laravel v5.8 apps, and running &#39;php artisan make:auth&#39; to generate authentication scaffolding, I&#39;m running into an error I haven&#39;t encountered before and don&#39;t know where to begin troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nEverything is as expected; I can navigate to the login/register views, however if I try to navigate to the &#39;home&#39; view- instead of being redirected to the login route (as is expected behaviour) I receive a maximum execution time error.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    C:\\web\\appName\\vendor\\laravel\\framework\\src\\Illuminate\\Routing\\Pipeline.php\r\n    ....\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * Get a Closure that represents a slice of the application onion.\r\n         *\r\n         * @return \\Closure\r\n         */\r\n        protected function carry()\r\n        {\r\n            return function ($stack, $pipe) {\r\n                return function ($passable) use ($stack, $pipe) {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        $slice = parent::carry();\r\n     \r\n                        $callable = $slice($stack, $pipe);\r\n     \r\n                        return $callable($passable);\r\n                    } catch (Exception $e) {\r\n                        ### ERROR OCCURS HERE ###\r\n                        return $this-&gt;handleException($passable, $e);\r\n                    } catch (Throwable $e) {\r\n                        return $this-&gt;handleException($passable, new FatalThrowableError($e));\r\n                    }\r\n                };\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThings I have tried:\r\n\r\n 1. I&#39;ve placed a &#39;dd()&#39; in the __construct of the HomeController, which\r\n    is run when navigating to the &#39;home&#39; route. This appears, so I know\r\n    we&#39;re reaching at least the HomeController.\r\n    \r\n 2. The HomeController has the &#39;auth&#39; middleware by default, which calls\r\n    the Authenticate middleware class. Removing this middleware from the\r\n    HomeController for troubleshooting purposes, I am able to reach the home view, which\r\n    suggest the middleware is causing the issue.\r\n    \r\n 3. In the Authenticate middleware class, I&#39;ve placed a &#39;dd()&#39; inside\r\n    the redirectTo() method, just before &quot;return route(&#39;login&#39;)&quot;. This\r\n    works, so I know I&#39;m reaching the redirect method, which is expected\r\n    (Authenticate middleware should call this method is user is not\r\n    authenticated, and redirect them to the login view.)\r\n    \r\n 4. I&#39;ve placed a &#39;dd()&#39; inside the __construct of the LoginController,\r\n    which should be called when redirected to the login view. However\r\n    this does not happen, instead I receive the error.\r\n\r\nIt appears the problem occurs between the redirectTo() method in the Authenticate class and the LoginController.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on what might be causing this?\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nThough I haven&#39;t changed anything, now I am able to reach the login page. However as you can see in the image, the redirect is taking 23 seconds! Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WralG.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386292/laravel-5-8-return-routelogin-causes-maximum-execution-error-on-fresh-inst","title":"Laravel 5.8 return route(&#39;login&#39;) causes &#39;maximum execution&#39;

I also added colors to each div so it&#39;s clear to see.\r\n\r\nI divided up my page into 4. 2 of them called sidenavs to create spaces on both sides to center view my main content, 1 is for the user image, name and nav buttons and the other one is for other content like personal info and will probably add more. So i divided them respectively: 1 - 2 -8 - 1\r\n\r\nMy problem is that, i don&#39;t understand the current alignment of my columns, As you can see from the image, side nav blue which should be at the right edge is now at the bottom. I made sure that all my columns sizes add up to 12 which is the maximum so i don&#39;t know why the other div is pushed down to the next row.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. all those weird html names like sidenav even though it&#39;s not a navigation bar which is on the side. And the row content with an already div container. I copy pasted whole html page code from free bootstrap template(you can actually see the resemblance if you downloaded some of them - i&#39;m not good at deciding how to design my pages so i just decided to pick from a template and tweak it however i want)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

an an answer followed by a suggestion.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start with replicating your structure using some hard coded values\r\n\r\n    users\r\n       uid_0\r\n          chats\r\n             chat_uid_0\r\n               messages\r\n                  unique_id_0\r\n                     msg: &quot;My Message&quot;\r\n                     sent_uid: &quot;uid_1&quot;\r\n                  unique_id_1\r\n                     msg: &quot;Hello, World&quot;\r\n                     sent_uid: &quot;uid_3&quot;\r\n                  unique_id_2\r\n                     msg: &quot;another message&quot;\r\n                     sent_uid: &quot;uid_2&quot;\r\n\r\nthen the code to read in the messages, iterate over them and print out the msg and sent_uid\r\n\r\n    func readMessages() {\r\n        let usersRef = self.ref.child(&quot;users&quot;)\r\n        let messagesRef = usersRef.child(&quot;uid_0&quot;).child(&quot;chats&quot;).child(&quot;chat_uid_0&quot;).child(&quot;messages&quot;)\r\n        messagesRef.observeSingleEvent(of: .value, with: { snapshot in\r\n            let allMessages = snapshot.children.allObjects as! [DataSnapshot]\r\n            for msg in allMessages {\r\n                let msgText = msg.childSnapshot(forPath: &quot;msg&quot;).value as? String ?? &quot;No Msg&quot;\r\n                let sentUid = msg.childSnapshot(forPath: &quot;sent_uid&quot;).value as? String ?? &quot;No sender&quot;\r\n                print(msgText, sentUid)\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand the output is\r\n\r\n    My message uid_1\r\n    Hello, World uid_3\r\n    another message uid_2\r\n\r\nThat being said - your structure is way to deep and should be denormalized. While it may work, as soon as you want to query for items, of find messages posted by a specific user, it just doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know your full use case but this would be a better structure\r\n\r\n\r\n    users\r\n       uid_0\r\n          name: &quot;Hank&quot;\r\n       uid_1\r\n          name: &quot;Leroy&quot;\r\n    \r\n    chats\r\n       uid_0\r\n          chat_id_0: true\r\n          chat_id_1: true\r\n       uid_1\r\n          chat_id_5: true\r\n    \r\n    chat_id_0\r\n       unique_id_0\r\n          msg: &quot;My Message&quot;\r\n          sent_uid: &quot;uid_1&quot;\r\n       unique_id_1\r\n          msg: &quot;Hello, World&quot;\r\n          sent_uid: &quot;uid_3&quot;\r\n       unique_id_2\r\n          msg: &quot;another message&quot;\r\n          sent_uid: &quot;uid_2&quot;\r\n\r\nWith this structure, it&#39;s all very shallow and easy to get to data - perform queries etc. You can quickly retreive all chats that uid_0 is involved with, get any messages that uid_3 ever posted or add an observer to uid_1&#39;s chat so others are notified when a chat has been added. Again, this is just an example and may not fit your case but it&#39;s something to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386289/firebase-gives-sometimes-only-parts-of-my-saved-values-and-sometimes-everything/58417389#58417389","title":"Firebase gives sometimes only parts of my saved values and sometimes everything"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12217480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b7b3f99c33cd93cf35b6af0ece67e36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12217480/david"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12217480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b7b3f99c33cd93cf35b6af0ece67e36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12217480/david"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58417389,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571241544,"creation_date":1571105484,"last_edit_date":1571198976,"question_id":58386289,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386289","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to code my own messenger.

need to render some lines and points that hold some data in a 3d scene. \r\n\r\nAnd points need to be picked by mouse, and then get the data in the point. \r\n\r\nI first try to define a class inherited from QQuickFramebufferObject, however i find it is difficult to do mouse picking. \r\n\r\nI find that it has the ObjectPicker in Qt3D module, so i want to use Qt3D to deal with my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy test code below. I defined my GeometryRenderer Object, and set vertices data(just draw two triangles). Like this:\r\n```\r\nGeometryRenderer {\r\n    id: geometry\r\n    geometry: Geometry {\r\n        boundingVolumePositionAttribute: position\r\n        Attribute {\r\n            id: position\r\n            attributeType: Attribute.VertexAttribute\r\n            vertexBaseType: Attribute.Float\r\n            vertexSize: 3\r\n            count: 4\r\n            byteOffset: 0\r\n            byteStride: 6 * 4\r\n            name: &quot;position&quot;\r\n            buffer: vertexBuffer\r\n        }\r\n        Attribute {\r\n            id: color\r\n            attributeType: Attribute.VertexAttribute\r\n            vertexBaseType: Attribute.Float\r\n            vertexSize: 3\r\n            count: 4\r\n            byteOffset: 3 * 4\r\n            byteStride: 6 * 4\r\n            name: &quot;color&quot;\r\n            buffer: vertexBuffer\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Attribute {\r\n            attributeType: Attribute.IndexAttribute\r\n            vertexBaseType: Attribute.UnsignedShort\r\n            vertexSize: 1\r\n            count: 6\r\n            buffer: indexBuffer\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    Buffer {\r\n        id: vertexBuffer\r\n        type: Buffer.VertexBuffer\r\n        data: new Float32Array(...)\r\n    }\r\n    Buffer {\r\n        id: indexBuffer\r\n        type: Buffer.IndexBuffer\r\n        data: new Uint16Array(...)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnd then define a material object like this:\r\n```\r\nMaterial {\r\n    id: material\r\n    effect: Effect {\r\n        techniques: Technique {\r\n            graphicsApiFilter {\r\n                profile: GraphicsApiFilter.CoreProfile\r\n            }\r\n            renderPasses: RenderPass {\r\n                shaderProgram: ShaderProgram {\r\n                    vertexShaderCode: loadSource(&quot;qrc:/shader/hellotriangle.vert&quot;)\r\n                    fragmentShaderCode: loadSource(&quot;qrc:/shader/hellotriangle.frag&quot;)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd then in my root Entity:\r\n```\r\n\r\nEntity {\r\n    id: root\r\n    components: [\r\n        RenderSettings {\r\n            activeFrameGraph: colorBuffer\r\n            pickingSettings.pickMethod: PickingSettings.TrianglePicking\r\n            pickingSettings.pickResultMode: PickingSettings.NearestPick\r\n        },\r\n        InputSettings { }\r\n    ]\r\n    ClearBuffers {\r\n        id: colorBuffer\r\n        clearColor: Qt.rgba(0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.6)\r\n        buffers: ClearBuffers.ColorDepthBuffer\r\n        RenderSurfaceSelector {\r\n            RenderStateSet {\r\n                renderStates: DepthTest {\r\n                    depthFunction: DepthTest.Less\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works, rendering two triangle. And I want to add Qt3D Camera and ObjectPicker in my scene, How can i make it?\r\n\r\nI find that if i use ForwardRenderer(but i couldn&#39;t find a way to render my own lines/points vertices) instead of ClearBuffers, the Camera and ObjectPicker works","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386268/how-to-add-objectpicker-and-camera-to-my-entity-in-qt3d","title":"How to add objectpicker and Camera to my entity in Qt3D?"},{"tags":["python","django","file-upload","django-views"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571107252,"post_id":58386266,"comment_id":103120284,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386266/django-file-upload-redirect-views-keep-returning-errors#comment103120284_58386266"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11831546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yepSePBKmA8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/Y2y4rcyq7Nw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arianna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11831546/arianna"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571112720,"post_id":58386266,"comment_id":103121410,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386266/django-file-upload-redirect-views-keep-returning-errors#comment103121410_58386266"},{"owner":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571116902,"post_id":58386266,"comment_id":103122338,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386266/django-file-upload-redirect-views-keep-returning-errors#comment103122338_58386266"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11831546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yepSePBKmA8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/Y2y4rcyq7Nw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arianna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11831546/arianna"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571151029,"post_id":58386266,"comment_id":103140288,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386266/django-file-upload-redirect-views-keep-returning-errors#comment103140288_58386266"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1438,"user_id":11418935,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d84d038a9b2c6ad9978ba339b955a615?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"arjun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11418935/arjun"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571109178,"creation_date":1571109178,"answer_id":58386718,"question_id":58386266,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58386718","body_markdown":"you are trying to redirect to the url `results` but this url also takes the `audiofile_id` as the parameter which you haven&#39;t passed while redirecting so you need to change your view with this :\r\n\r\n\r\n       if form.is_valid():\r\n            file = form.save()\r\n            return redirect(&#39;uploads:results&#39;,file.audiofile_id)\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386266/django-file-upload-redirect-views-keep-returning-errors/58386718#58386718","title":"Django file upload: redirect views keep returning errors"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11831546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yepSePBKmA8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/Y2y4rcyq7Nw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arianna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11831546/arianna"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58386718,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571116900,"creation_date":1571105294,"last_edit_date":1571116900,"question_id":58386266,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386266","body_markdown":"I have been working on this music site in Django, basically just trying to get the upload view to work.

version.\r\n\r\nTypically, you&#39;d call `pack()` after adding components to a container, which tries to display the contents of that container at their preferred sizes. To see the correct UI before and after the button press, following your call to `repaint()`, add:\r\n\r\n    window.pack();\r\n\r\nYou may think that looks terrible (which it does) but it&#39;s exactly what your code is asking for, and is therefore the &quot;correct&quot; version.\r\n\r\nTake note that you are trying to set sizes with explicit calls to `setSize()`, which is a bad practice in Swing. At most, you should be setting preferred sizes and letting the layout manager handle the details. When you try to micromanage component sizes and locations, you can often make it look good on one platform, but irredeemably bad on others. Remember that Java is supposed to be the &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; language.\r\n\r\nWhen you want more control over your layout, you should explicitly specify and use a layout manager, rather than just accepting the default layout. In almost every non-trivial UI, [GridBagLayout](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html) is your best bet.\r\n\r\nFinally, you don&#39;t need to explicitly call `repaint()` on your UI when something changes. Typically, you&#39;d call `paint()` and `repaint()` when you are working with graphics. Let Swing handle the painting automatically.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386257/jpanel-changes-shape-position-within-jframe-when-jbutton-is-pressed-why/58386552#58386552","title":"JPanel changes shape/position within JFrame when JButton is pressed.

When the user attempts to log in, I want to store they&#39;re username in $_SESSION[&#39;username&#39;] and have each page compare $_SESSION[&#39;username&#39;] with results from the database, in order to determine whether to disable the link.\r\n\r\nCode which is written on each page, to change the value of \r\n$_SESSION[&#39;disabled&#39;]:\r\n````\r\n&lt;?php\t\r\n\t$db = mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;root&quot;,&quot;&quot;, &quot;database name&quot;)  or die(mysqli_error($db));\r\n\t$q = &quot;select * from member where username = $_SESSION[&#39;username&#39;]&quot;;\r\n\t$results = mysqli_query($db, $q) or die(mysqli_error($db));\r\n\r\n\tif(mysqli_num_rows($results) &gt; 0) {\r\n\t\t$_SESSION[&#39;disabled&#39;] = &#39;&#39;;\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\t$_SESSION[&#39;disabled&#39;] = &#39;disabled&#39;;\r\n\t}\r\n?&gt;\r\n````\r\nCode which processes the login form:\r\n````\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\tif(isset($_POST[&#39;username&#39;])) $username = $_POST[&#39;username&#39;];\r\n\tif(isset($_POST[&#39;password&#39;])) $password = $_POST[&#39;password&#39;];\r\n\t\r\n\t$db = mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;root&quot;,&quot;&quot;, &quot;database name&quot;)  or die(mysqli_error($db));\r\n\r\n\t$q = &quot;select * from member where username=&#39;$username&#39; and password=SHA(&#39;$password&#39;)&quot;;\r\n\r\n\t$results = mysqli_query($db, $q) or die(mysqli_error($db));\r\n    \r\n    \tif(mysqli_num_rows($results) &gt; 0) {\r\n        \tsession_start();\r\n       \t\t$_SESSION[&#39;username&#39;] = $username;\r\n\t\tprint &#39;&lt;h1&gt;You have logged in!&lt;/h1&gt;&#39;;\r\n\t        exit(0);\r\n    \t}\r\n?&gt;\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe first chunk of code should be detecting if my SESSION[&#39;username&#39;] matches a username from the database and then assigning a blank string to SESSION[&#39;disabled&#39;] if a match is found.

At the time of writing, there is not a parallel `sort` implementation in Rakudo, which means that it will fall back to using the regular sort implementation. So, this answers why `native-hyper-sort` doesn&#39;t come out faster right now (however it almost certainly will in the future).\r\n\r\nThe idea in `simple-hyper-sort` is along the right lines: break the data up into sublists, sort the sublists, and then merge them. We can therefore parallelize the sorting of the sublists. As you&#39;ve observed, this achieving a win is dependent on the merge operation itself being fast enough, and so we&#39;d need to carefully optimize that.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s much easier to write a tight (not to mention correct!) merge operation if it only needs to merge two sublists. Thus, we need to structure the problem in a way that gives us that. This points to a different approach:\r\n\r\n1. Break the list in half\r\n2. `start` a task to sort each half\r\n3. `await` the two tasks\r\n4. Merge the results of the two tasks\r\n\r\nNote that step 2 involves recursion. We stop recursing when the size of a partition is too small, and use the built-in `sort` on such partitions. (We can choose to define &quot;too small&quot; by dividing the input list size by the number of CPU cores, along the lines of your example.)\r\n\r\nThus we get a solution like this:\r\n\r\n    sub parallel-merge-sort {\r\n        my $to-sort = &quot;tosort.txt&quot;.IO.open( :r );\r\n        my $lines = $to-sort.lines;\r\n        return do-sort $lines, ceiling($lines.elems / $*KERNEL.cpu-cores);\r\n        \r\n        sub do-sort(@in, $limit) {\r\n            if @in.elems &lt; $limit {\r\n                @in.sort\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                my $pivot = @in.elems div 2;\r\n                merge |await\r\n                    (start do-sort @in[0..$pivot], $limit),\r\n                    (start do-sort @in[$pivot^..@in.end], $limit)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        sub merge(@a, @b) {\r\n            my @result;\r\n            my int $a-idx = 0;\r\n            my int $a-elems = +@a;\r\n            my int $b-idx = 0;\r\n            my int $b-elems = +@b;\r\n            my int $r-idx = 0;\r\n            while $a-idx &lt; $a-elems &amp;&amp; $b-idx &lt; $b-elems {\r\n                my $a := @a[$a-idx];\r\n                my $b := @b[$b-idx];\r\n                if $a before $b {\r\n                    $a-idx++;\r\n                    @result[$r-idx++] := $a;\r\n                }\r\n                else {\r\n                    $b-idx++;\r\n                    @result[$r-idx++] := $b;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            if $a-idx &lt; $a-elems {\r\n                @result[$r-idx++] := $_ for @a[$a-idx..*];\r\n            }\r\n            elsif $b-idx &lt; $b-elems {\r\n                @result[$r-idx++] := $_ for @b[$b-idx..*];\r\n            }\r\n            return @result;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t spend terribly long optimizing this (haven&#39;t profiled, etc.), but did take care to use natives and binding in order to reduce allocations. On My Machine, this does give a speedup over the serial sorting, however.\r\n\r\nOne other easy speedup we can get on this - at the cost of a tad more complexity in the code - comes from realizing that we don&#39;t need to slice the input in `do-sort` until the point that we actually need to send it to the built-in `sort`:\r\n\r\n    sub do-sort(@in, $limit, $from = 0, $to = @in.end) {\r\n        my $elems = $to - $from;\r\n        if $elems &lt; $limit {\r\n            @in[$from..$to].sort\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            my $pivot = $from + $elems div 2;\r\n            merge |await\r\n                (start do-sort @in, $limit, $from, $pivot),\r\n                (start do-sort @in, $limit, $pivot + 1, $to)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich saves some work; by this point, I measure a factor of two speedup on the machine I&#39;m testing it on, which isn&#39;t amazing, but given we&#39;ve an enforced serial O(n) step, and a bunch more parallelized O(n) steps, over the serial sort algorithm, it&#39;s perhaps not so disappointing after all.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386214/create-a-sorted-list-from-n-sorted-sublists-efficiently/58418964#58418964","title":"Create a sorted list from n sorted sublists (efficiently)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1561,"user_id":8893864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mfBb3bzlcfw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADM/vILdjUEHHM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Holli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8893864/holli"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8810,"user_id":891440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd366bcdcf85991fa8af1b6d11d3ad49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jjmerelo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/891440/jjmerelo"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":97,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58418964,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571247876,"creation_date":1571104740,"last_edit_date":1571240517,"question_id":58386214,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386214","body_markdown":"I was playing around with parallel sorting tonight. \r\n\r\n    creating sort file\r\n    naive-sort ...\r\n    1000000\r\n    23.61265496\r\n    partial-hyper-sort ...\r\n    4\r\n    7.4924575\r\n    simple-hyper-sort ...\r\n    1000000\r\n    141.7945921\r\n    naive-hyper-sort ...\r\n    1000000\r\n    23.5756172\r\n\r\nTwo things stand out.\r\n\r\na) `naive-hyper-sort` is just as fast as ordinary `sort`\r\nb) The sorting in `partial-hyper-sort` is 66% faster than ordinary `sort`.\r\n\r\nMy problem: `partial-hyper-sort` is exactly that: &quot;partial&quot;.

as such :\r\n\r\n```python\r\nresult_diff_evo = differential_evolution(func=optimizer_function, bounds=bounds, init=pop_denorm,maxiter=4, workers=-1, mutation=(0.5, 1.5), recombination=0.8)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I look at the actual list of vectors that the algorithm has tried, it looks like it&#39;s only very small variation around the last line of `pop_denorm`.

I removed protection by using the owner account, after that, the script run fine for editors.\r\n\r\nI really need the sheet to be protected (so the user will not mess up the functionality), is there a way to fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386196/protected-sheet-prevent-certain-google-script-functions-to-run-properly","title":"Protected sheet prevent certain Google script functions to run properly"},{"tags":["matlab"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7769,"user_id":2917957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c73ad68d6b98c2e2529d69ab0402bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2917957/david"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571105830,"post_id":58386195,"comment_id":103119993,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386195/how-to-limit-the-amount-of-error-bars-matlab#comment103119993_58386195"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4448,"user_id":11089932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N9t0d.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HansHirse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11089932/hanshirse"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571119418,"creation_date":1571119418,"answer_id":58388139,"question_id":58386195,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58388139","body_markdown":"As David pointed out in [his comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386195/how-to-limit-the-amount-of-error-bars-matlab#comment103119993_58386195), your code is no proper MATLAB code. Nevertheless, I presume you have sufficient MATLAB understanding: Basically you need to set up separate `x` and `y` values for your `errorbar` as well as the actual errors `err`, which should be plotted. Then, you can use the proper [`errorbar`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/errorbar.html#d117e363628) command.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s have a look at this small example:\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\nx = -5:0.1:5;\r\ny = sin(x);\r\n\r\nxErr = linspace(-5, 5, 11);       % Specify x locations for errorbar plot\r\nyErr = sin(xErr);                 % The y values at these x locations\r\nerr = rand(1, 11);                % The actual errors, here: some random values\r\n\r\nplot(x, y, &#39;r&#39;);                  % Plot\r\nhold on;\r\nerrorbar(xErr, yErr, err, &#39;o&#39;);   % Actual errorbar plot at specific x locations\r\nhold off;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll get an output like this:\r\n\r\n[![Output][1]][1]\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I made this with Octave 5.1.0, but the syntax should be identical to MATLAB.

(that&#39;s how long anti-captcha takes approx most of the times to solve a captcha). But sometimes they take up to 200 seconds so that will run into errors and &#39;cause the whole script failing.

Columns that contain more than two values &gt; 1000 within any combinations of id and time in by=.(id,time), or whatever...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386176/select-data-table-columns-based-on-condition-within-by","title":"Select data.table columns based on condition, within by"},{"tags":["typescript"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":50986,"user_id":2887218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WL57j.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jcalz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2887218/jcalz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571107864,"creation_date":1571107864,"answer_id":58386574,"question_id":58386174,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58386574","body_markdown":"When TypeScript 3.7 comes out it will feature [the `asserts` modifier](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/32695) which allows you to mark `void`-returning functions as type assertions, similarly to how [user-defined type guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards) allow you to mark `boolean`-returning functions as type checks.  \r\n\r\nSo pretty soon (or right now if you install `typescript@next`) you should be able to annotate `validateFoo()` like this:\r\n\r\n    private validateFoo(): asserts this is { foo: number } {\r\n      if (this.foo === null) {\r\n        throw new Error(&#39;foo should not be null&#39;)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere we&#39;re saying that the call to `validateFoo()` returns `asserts this is { foo: number }`, meaning that if `validateFoo()` returns at all, it will narrow `this` from `FooClass` (whose `foo` property is `number | null`), to `this &amp; { foo: number }`, which means the `foo` property will not be `null`.\r\n\r\nThe rest of your code should compile as expected:\r\n\r\n    public thisNeedsFooToNotBeNull(): void {\r\n      this.validateFoo();\r\n      doStuff(this.foo); // no error now\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHope that helps; good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?ts=3.7-Beta#code/MYGwhgzhAEBiD28DC4rQN4ChrQA4FcAjEAS2GgDNEAuaAO3wFtCBTAJ2gB978QRoAvDz4BubHjYkAbmAAuLaDNIATOSwTwAFAEpakCO1kxZACxIxzGSjR7N20AL4ZxOEhWibT5gHRV4ggSEGPm1nHHDoUzZ4AHd6FjiAUTZotk0Acj9oCBN4XmV6eFloVmEQdO0xCIdxGsxxAmIySLMIADkWFmUIDQAVeDaigCEWNt4QHVopeBICrAivCG8lWbUNHSrw5XgAZVl8CgpPVt9EStrMOop8OmBZEng6aG29g6O-WgY7NlD56GBHhB4CAWN4QPAAOaaAAGWUsABJ0H4HNDzg4gA)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386174/how-to-extract-null-check-into-method-and-get-valid-null-type-checking/58386574#58386574","title":"How to extract null check into method and get valid null type checking?"}],"owner":{"reputation":164,"user_id":2538263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2ed191e73527fa2db7d98c3696b20ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Birdie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2538263/birdie"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58386574,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571107864,"creation_date":1571104388,"question_id":58386174,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386174","body_markdown":"This assumes strictNullChecks is true.\r\n\r\nIf several methods depend on a value not being null, each one should check that value and throw an exception if it is null. It would be nice to extract that null check into a helper method, rather than duplicating it everywhere. However, if we do so, we can&#39;t get type checking on the value within each method.\r\n\r\nFor example, without extracting the null check:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass FooClass {\r\n  public foo: number | null = null;\r\n\r\n  public thisNeedsFooToNotBeNull(): void {\r\n    if (this.foo === null) {\r\n      throw new Error(&#39;foo should not be null&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n    doStuff(this.foo);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction doStuff(foo: number) {\r\n  console.log(`foo is ${foo}`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith extracting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass FooClass {\r\n  public foo: number | null = null;\r\n\r\n  private validateFoo(): void {\r\n    if (this.foo === null) {\r\n      throw new Error(&#39;foo should not be null&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n  public thisNeedsFooToNotBeNull(): void {\r\n    this.validateFoo();\r\n    doStuff(this.foo);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction doStuff(foo: number) {\r\n  console.log(`foo is ${foo}`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the second version, we get TypeScript errors on the `doStuff(this.foo);` line, saying:\r\n```\r\nArgument of type &#39;number | null&#39; is not assignable to parameter of type &#39;number&#39;.\r\n  Type &#39;null&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;number&#39; ts(2345)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get TypeScript to handle this kind of type checking extraction?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386174/how-to-extract-null-check-into-method-and-get-valid-null-type-checking","title":"How to extract null check into method and get valid

refer to this [article][1] to find out how to use **Power Query** on your version of Excel. It is available in **Excel 2010 Professional Plus and later versions**. My demonstration is using **Excel 2016**.\r\n\r\nSteps are:\r\n\r\n 1. Add your source data to power query editor;\r\n 2. Highlight all `Item` columns, use **Unpivot Columns** function under `Transform` tab to unpivot these columns, then sort your table by `Value` then by `Name` column;\r\n 3. Use **Group By** function under the `Transform` tab to group the `Name` column by `Value` column as set out below:\r\n\r\n[![Group By][2]][2]\r\n\r\n 4. Go back to the last step in the **APPLIED STEPS** section on the right hand side, go to the formula bar to replace this part of the formula `List.Sum([Name])` with `Text.Combine([Name],&quot; &quot;)`;\r\n 5. **Close &amp; Load** the result to a new worksheet (by default).\r\n\r\nIf all your names are consistent without any hidden spaces in front or at the end of the string, you should have the following as a result:\r\n\r\n[![Result][3]][3]\r\n\r\nHere is my Power Query **M code** for your reference:\r\n\r\n    let\r\n        Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=&quot;Table3&quot;]}[Content],\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source,{{&quot;Name&quot;, type text}, {&quot; item1&quot;, type text}, {&quot; item2&quot;, type text}, {&quot; item3&quot;, type text}}),\r\n        #&quot;Unpivoted Columns&quot; = Table.UnpivotOtherColumns(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;, {&quot;Name&quot;}, &quot;Attribute&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Sorted Rows&quot; = Table.Sort(#&quot;Unpivoted Columns&quot;,{{&quot;Value&quot;, Order.Ascending}, {&quot;Name&quot;, Order.Ascending}}),\r\n        #&quot;Trimmed Text&quot; = Table.TransformColumns(#&quot;Sorted Rows&quot;,{{&quot;Value&quot;, Text.Trim, type text}}),\r\n        #&quot;Cleaned Text&quot; = Table.TransformColumns(#&quot;Trimmed Text&quot;,{{&quot;Value&quot;, Text.Clean, type text}}),\r\n        #&quot;Grouped Rows&quot; = Table.Group(#&quot;Cleaned Text&quot;, {&quot;Value&quot;}, {{&quot;names&quot;, each Text.Combine([Name],&quot; &quot;), type text}})\r\n    in\r\n        #&quot;Grouped Rows&quot;\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

problem in your algorithm is that you are not sure if you find the exact pivot when its value is repeated.\r\nFor example for the array `[8,9,2,2,4,5,6]` your algorithm find as pivot the element in the 4th position (counting from 0 is the element 3).\r\nIn this way the left part of the array will be `[8,9,2]` which is not sorted and therefore the binary search doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nA very simply solution is to find two pivots (let&#39;s call left_pivot and right_pivot).\r\nThe right_pivot is exactly the one you are already finding and is defined as &quot;an element that has the lowest value of the array&quot;.\\\r\nThe left_pivot is defined as &quot;an element that has the highest value of the array&quot; and you find with an easy modification:\r\n```java\r\n       while(left&lt; right){\r\n            int mid= left+ (right- left)/ 2;\r\n            if (mid * 2 &lt; right)\r\n                mid = mid + 1\r\n            // if mid&lt; right that means this much part of the array is sorted\r\n            // then do binary search on left and mid\r\n            if(nums[mid]&lt; nums[right])\r\n                right= mid-1;\r\n            // if mid&gt; right that means this part of the array is not sorted\r\n            // then do binary search on mid+1 to right\r\n            else\r\n                left= mid;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen a binary search in the left part of the array will be done from index 0 to index left_pivot (instead of pivot-1) and the one in the right part of the array from index right_pivot to length-1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386167/find-an-element-in-rotated-sorted-array-with-duplicate-elements/58414645#58414645","title":"Find an element in Rotated Sorted Array with

I handled this data so that I could create a sliding window of size `(100, 40)` over the data and use that in an autoregressive fashion. Each &quot;minibatch&quot; has 32 instances, each of size `(100, 40)` which leads me to a total of 1,000 of these so-called minibatches.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is divide these 1,000 batches into the &quot;number of days,&quot; which in this case would be 10, meaning that each separate &quot;day-batch&quot; would contain 100 minibatches, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe code that I have is the following:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ndata = {}\r\nbatches = []\r\nminibatches = []\r\ncount = 1\r\n\r\nfor idx, _ in df.iterrows():\r\n    minibatches.append(df.iloc[idx:(idx + 100), 0:40])\r\n    if count == 32:\r\n        batches.append(minibatches)\r\n        minibatches = []\r\n        count = 0\r\n    count += 1\r\n\r\nnum_days = len(batches) // 100 # 1000 // 100 = 10\r\nbatch_split = np.array_split(batches, num_days)\r\n\r\nfor day in range(num_days):\r\n    data[fold][day] = batch_split[day] # Nevermind the &quot;fold&quot; variable here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error that I&#39;m getting for the `np.array_split` line is:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nValueError: cannot copy sequence with size 100 to array axis with dimension 40\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I were to break down the `batches` variable, it&#39;s simply a list containing 1,000 lists. These 1,000 lists are the aforementioned minibatches, and are also lists containing 32 DataFrames each. Each DataFrame of the 32 DataFrames is of size `(100, 40)`.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand where the `size 100` and `dimension 40` is coming from in this setting. I&#39;m not accessing the DataFrame values, and simply want to split the list `batches`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386158/np-array-split-gives-valueerror-cannot-copy-sequence-with-size","title":"np.array_split gives ValueError: cannot copy sequence with size -"},{"tags":["javascript","vb.net","iframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":671,"user_id":3981539,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/a09Pb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kavitha Karunakaran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3981539/kavitha-karunakaran"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571104922,"post_id":58386157,"comment_id":103119809,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386157/modify-iframe-html-value-with-or-without-javascript-injection#comment103119809_58386157"},{"owner":{"reputation":11953,"user_id":7444103,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HcyKP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jimi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7444103/jimi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571109138,"post_id":58386157,"comment_id":103120698,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386157/modify-iframe-html-value-with-or-without-javascript-injection#comment103120698_58386157"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12217730,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6acf963cfdcbcc0651360321961f69b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"EduardoEMI","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12217730/eduardoemi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":68,"user_id":11087649,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gLPNe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gelxxxx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11087649/gelxxxx"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571110431,"creation_date":1571104259,"last_edit_date":1571110431,"question_id":58386157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386157","body_markdown":"Good people !!\r\n\r\nI need your help, I have a web browser which has an iframe (another html) that is shown along with the web browser and I want to modify a value within the iframe.\r\n\r\nFor what I have investigated, I don&#39;t know if javascript injection could change the value.\r\n\r\nIf you need more info say to update!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386157/modify-iframe-html-value-with-or-without-javascript-injection","title":"Modify iframe html value, with or without javascript injection"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas","export-to-csv"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":8009192,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59c2ac22971fa21fb3d6cef9b37d716f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Siddhant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8009192/siddhant"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571110862,"creation_date":1571110862,"answer_id":58386921,"question_id":58386155,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58386921","body_markdown":"CSVs are nothing but comma separated strings for each column and new-line separated for each row, which you can do like so:\r\n\r\n    data = [[1, 2, 4], [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;AB&#39;, 2], [&#39;P&#39;, 23, 4]]\r\n\r\n    data_string = &#39;\\n&#39;.join([&#39;, &#39;.join(map(str, row)) for row in data])\r\n    with open(&#39;data.csv&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as f:\r\n       f.write(data_string.encode())","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386155/most-efficient-way-to-convert-python-multidimensional-list-to-csv-file/58386921#58386921","title":"Most efficient way to convert Python multidimensional list to CSV file?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12217713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAaf8LH3Y_-nXDykzqtyCrN4ZHEPSxhGKFpMz3wKHQ=k-s128","display_name":"Kunal Dutta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12217713/kunal-dutta"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571110862,"creation_date":1571104215,"question_id":58386155,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386155","body_markdown":"I want to output a multidimensional list to a CSV file.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am creating a new DataFrame object and converting that to CSV.

are integrating Firebase Analytics into our application as we are moving away from Google Analytics to Firebase Analytics. We initialize the FIRApp instance when user logs into the application and we want to delete the FIRApp instance when user logs out of the application. We are doing this because in our application user can switch environments (Production/Staging/QA) etc. We do not want to capture Production Analytics when they login to Staging. So we only initialize the default FIRApp instance when we detect that user logs into the Production Environment and delete the default FIRApp when they logout. We are assuming that once the default FIRApp is deleted, the tracking should stop. But when we look at the analytics, it seems to capture the screens even when the user has deleted the FIRApp instance. I haven&#39;t seen events being captured, but screens are being capture when I delete the FIRApp instance while the app is still running. I can see the screen_views being reported in debug view. \r\n\r\n**Below are some more details:**\r\n\r\n - **Environment:** iOS (and possibly android)\r\n - **To initialize default app:** ```[FIRApp configure];```\r\n - **To delete the default app:** ```[FIRApp defaultApp] deleteApp:^(BOOL success) { }];```\r\n\r\n**Why are we doing fancy things?** Please see history below:\r\n\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53878190/configure-multiple-firebase-projects-runtime-in-ios-application-and-firebase-goo/53887107#53887107\r\n - https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues/230","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386149/firebase-what-happens-when-we-call-delete-app-on-firapp-defaultapp","title":"Firebase: What happens when we call delete app on FIRApp defaultApp"},{"tags":["kubernetes","terraform","bazel","kubectl","kubeconfig"],"owner":{"reputation":435,"user_id":996427,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53a1867421026c940c78946d669b03d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Slackware","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/996427/slackware"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571104114,"creation_date":1571104114,"question_id":58386148,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386148","body_markdown":"I have a project with some files like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# To use Bazel\r\n/home/slackware/tgkj/WORKSPACE\r\n\r\n# To use Bazel and https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_k8s\r\n/home/slackware/tgkj/app/BUILD\r\n\r\n# The app to be ran on the kubernetes cluster.\r\n/home/slackware/tgkj/app/main.py\r\n\r\n# To deploy EC2 instances using terraform\r\n/home/slackware/tgkj/infra/terraform.tf\r\n\r\n# To tell Packer how to build the AMIs (provision using ansible) to deploy to EC2\r\n/home/slackware/tgkj/infra/example.jsonnet\r\n\r\n# To tell Ansible how to provision the AMI\r\n# (Install kubernetes master packages for the master AMI\r\n#  and node packages for the node AMI)\r\n/home/slackware/tgkj/infra/playbook_template.jsonnet\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI am able to create my EC2 instances using terraform, and build+provision my AMIs using Packer+Ansible.\r\n\r\nNow, I would like to deploy my `main.py` program on the kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\nNote: Indeed, I am missing some kubernetes `deployment.yaml` file.

are currently trying to scrape steam.com, but the html only partially loads. The current code uses the requests lib but we also tried urllib.request lib as well and got the same result. basically from what i can gather it only loads the first 1/10th of the page before readyState == complete then does something else so that a user could technically start navigating the page before loading the rest of the content. I know requests doesn&#39;t really handle js loaded pages well but we tried urllib and got the same result (which is why i think some odd js is going on post readyState). We also tried using selenium, but to put it in layman&#39;s terms it &quot;does to much&quot;. Its not made for crawlers and I don&#39;t want to open a headless browser or deal with everything that comes with it and a lot of what if read says not to use selenium for web scraping.

So, if we iterate over the 3rd dimension, we should find 5 items, each with a shape of `(3,4)`. You could achieve this by using `numpy.transpose` as shown below:  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nsrc = np.arange(3*4*5).reshape((3,4,5))\r\nfor e in np.transpose(src, [2,0,1]):\r\n    print(row)\r\n```\r\n**Output**:  \r\n```\r\n[[ 0  5 10 15]\r\n [20 25 30 35]\r\n [40 45 50 55]]\r\n[[ 1  6 11 16]\r\n [21 26 31 36]\r\n [41 46 51 56]]\r\n[[ 2  7 12 17]\r\n [22 27 32 37]\r\n [42 47 52 57]]\r\n[[ 3  8 13 18]\r\n [23 28 33 38]\r\n [43 48 53 58]]\r\n[[ 4  9 14 19]\r\n [24 29 34 39]\r\n [44 49 54 59]]\r\n```\r\nHere the array `src` is:  \r\n```\r\narray([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],\r\n        [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],\r\n        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],\r\n        [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]],\r\n\r\n       [[20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\r\n        [25, 26, 27, 28, 29],\r\n        [30, 31, 32, 33, 34],\r\n        [35, 36, 37, 38, 39]],\r\n\r\n       [[40, 41, 42, 43, 44],\r\n        [45, 46, 47, 48, 49],\r\n        [50, 51, 52, 53, 54],\r\n        [55, 56, 57, 58, 59]]])\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386112/iterating-elements-in-3d-array-gives-wrong-element/58386657#58386657","title":"Iterating elements in 3D array gives wrong element"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8296,"user_id":972202,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5Gxr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sazr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/972202/sazr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571114765,"post_id":58387025,"comment_id":103121834,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386112/iterating-elements-in-3d-array-gives-wrong-element/58387025#comment103121834_58387025"},{"owner":{"reputation":299,"user_id":11301900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8826c4b7675bd83127fddefc109b7f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexander C&#233;cile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11301900/alexander-c%c3%a9cile"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8296,"user_id":972202,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5Gxr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sazr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/972202/sazr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571118867,"post_id":58387025,"comment_id":103122967,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386112/iterating-elements-in-3d-array-gives-wrong-element/58387025#comment103122967_58387025"},{"owner":{"reputation":299,"user_id":11301900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8826c4b7675bd83127fddefc109b7f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexander C&#233;cile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11301900/alexander-c%c3%a9cile"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8296,"user_id":972202,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5Gxr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sazr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/972202/sazr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571169135,"post_id":58387025,"comment_id":103148562,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386112/iterating-elements-in-3d-array-gives-wrong-element/58387025#comment103148562_58387025"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":299,"user_id":11301900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8826c4b7675bd83127fddefc109b7f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexander C&#233;cile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11301900/alexander-c%c3%a9cile"},"last_editor":{"reputation":299,"user_id":11301900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8826c4b7675bd83127fddefc109b7f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexander C&#233;cile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11301900/alexander-c%c3%a9cile"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571119771,"last_edit_date":1571119771,"creation_date":1571111773,"answer_id":58387025,"question_id":58386112,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58387025","body_markdown":"**General advice:** When working with numpy, explicit python loops should be a last resort.
