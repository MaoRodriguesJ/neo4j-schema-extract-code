And the corresponding bit in the `PORTx` register chooses which electrical level is output on the pin. If it is 0 then internal MOSFET shorts the pin to &quot;ground&quot; lane, and sinks current from external source. When the bit of the `PORTx` is one, then the pin is connected to &quot;VCC&quot;, sourcing big amount of current enough to lit up a LED. \r\n\r\nBut if the pin is connected to something, what consumes too much of current, or the pin is shorted to GND or VCC (let&#39;s say you have a button connected and pressed), then output MOSFETS might be overloaded and damaged.\r\n\r\nIf the bit in `DDRx` is set to zero, then the pin is configured as input. If the corresponding bit in the `PORTx` is zero, then the pin has no internal connection to power lines, it is called &quot;Hi-impedance&quot; state, or Tri-state. It does not source or sink any current. So, if no external source of current is connected, then pin level is floating, influenced by electrical interference. Logical level is not detectable and can change occasionally. If you want to connect, for example, a button (between the pin and GND), then logical level will be defined only when button is pressed. When it is released, the logical level will be undefined.\r\n\r\nBut! If the bit in the `PORTx` is set to one, then internal MOSFET connects the pin thru a resistor (about 35 kOhm) to VCC line. This make the pin to source a little amount of current, setting its logical level to high. Therefore, if a button is connected, when it is released, then pin will have defined high level. This is called &quot;pull-up resistor&quot;. When button is pressed, it will not short and damage the MCU, because current flowing thru the button is limited by the resistor, but the logical level will be defined low.\r\n\r\nWhat if instead of button you have a LED connected to the pin? Very small amount of current will flow thru the LED, makes it barely glow.\r\n\r\nRead more in the [datasheet][1] (chapter _13.

(See below for a longer explanation with diagrams.)\r\n\r\nStill, the workaround is not quite as ugly as you think, although it&#39;s not without its problems.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify things, I&#39;m going to assume that the lexer can be convinced to produce only a single `&#39;\\n&#39;` token regardless of how many consecutive newlines appear in the program text, including the case where there are comments scattered among the blank lines. That could be achieved with a complex regular expression, but a simpler way to do it is to use a start condition to suppress `\\n` tokens until a regular token is encountered. The lexer&#39;s initial start condition should be the one which suppresses newline tokens, so that blank lines at the beginning of the program text won&#39;t confuse anything.\r\n\r\nNow, the key insight is that we don&#39;t have to insert &quot;maybe a newline&quot; markers all over the grammar, since every newline must appear right after some real token. And that means that we can just add one non-terminal for every terminal:\r\n\r\n    tok_id: ID | ID &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_if: &quot;if&quot; | &quot;if&quot; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_then: &quot;then&quot; | &quot;then&quot; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_else: &quot;else&quot; | &quot;else&quot; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_do: &quot;do&quot; | &quot;do&quot; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_semi: &#39;;&#39; | &#39;;&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_dot: &#39;.&#39; | &#39;.&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_plus: &#39;+&#39; | &#39;+&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_dash: &#39;-&#39; | &#39;-&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_star: &#39;*&#39; | &#39;*&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_slash: &#39;/&#39; | &#39;/&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_caret: &#39;^&#39; | &#39;^&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_open: &#39;(&#39; | &#39;(&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_close: &#39;)&#39; | &#39;)&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_openb: &#39;[&#39; | &#39;[&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    tok_closeb: &#39;]&#39; | &#39;]&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    /* Etc. */\r\n\r\nNow, it&#39;s just a question of replacing the use of a terminal with the corresponding non-terminal defined above. (No `w` non-terminal is required.) Once we do that, bison will report a number of shift-reduce conflicts in the non-terminal definitions just added; any terminal which can appear at the end of an expression will instigate a conflict, since the newline could be absorbed either by the terminal&#39;s non-terminal wrapper or by the `expr_semicolon_list` production. We want the newline to be part of `expr_semicolon_list`, so we need to add precedence declarations starting with newline, so that it is lower precedence than any other token.\r\n\r\nThat will most likely work for your grammar, but it is not 100% certain. The problem with precedence-based solutions is that they can have the effect of hiding real shift-reduce conflict issues. So I&#39;d recommend running bison on the grammar and verifying that all the shift-reduce conflicts appear where expected (in the wrapper productions) before adding the precedence declarations.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n##Why token fallback is not as simple as it looks\r\n\r\nIn theory, it would be possible to implement a feature similar to the one you suggest.  [Note 1]\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s non-trivial, because of the way the LALR parser construction algorithm combines states. The result is that the parser might not &quot;know&quot; that the lookahead token cannot be shifted until it has done one or more reductions. So by the time it figures out that the lookahead token is not valid, it has already performed reductions which would have to be undone in order to continue the parse without the lookahead token.\r\n\r\nMost parser generators compound the problem by removing error actions corresponding to a lookahead token if the default action in the state for that token is a reduction. The effect is again to delay detection of the error until after one or more futile reductions, but it has the benefit of significantly reducing the size of the transition table (since default entries don&#39;t need to be stored explicitly). Since the delayed error will be detected before any more input is consumed, the delay is generally considered acceptable. (Bison has an option to prevent this optimisation, however.)\r\n\r\nAs a practical illustration, here&#39;s a very simple expression grammar with only two operators:\r\n\r\n    prog: expr &#39;\\n&#39; | prog expr &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n    expr: prod      | expr &#39;+&#39; prod\r\n    prod: term      | prod &#39;*&#39; term\r\n    term: ID        | &#39;(&#39; expr &#39;)&#39;\r\n\r\nThat leads to this state diagram [Note 2]:[![parser state diagram generated using bison&#39;s -g option][1]][1]\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s suppose that we wanted to ignore newlines pythonically, allowing the input \r\n\r\n    ( \r\n      a + b\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThat means that the parser must ignore the newline after the `b`, since the input might be\r\n\r\n    (\r\n      a + b\r\n      * c\r\n    )\r\n\r\n(Which is fine in Python but not, if I understand correctly, in MAXScript.)\r\n\r\nOf course, the newline would be recognised as a statement separator if the input were not parenthesized:\r\n\r\n    a + b\r\n\r\nLooking at the state diagram, we can see that the parser will end up in State 15 after the `b` is read, whether or not the expression is parenthesized. In that state, a newline is marked as a valid lookahead for the reduction action, so the reduction action will be performed, presumably creating an AST node for the sum. Only after this reduction will the parser notice that there is no action for the newline. If it now discards the newline character, it&#39;s too late; there is now no way to reduce `b * c` in order to make it an operand of the sum.\r\n\r\nBison does allow you to request a Canonical LR parser, which does not combine states. As a result, the state machine is much, much bigger; so much so that Canonical-LR is still considered impractical for non-toy grammars. In the simple two-operator expression grammar above, asking for a Canonical LR parser only increases the state count from 16 to 26, as shown here:[![a much bigger state machine generated in the same way][2]][2]\r\n\r\nIn the Canonical LR parser, there are two different states for the reduction `term: term &#39;+&#39; prod`. State 16 applies at the top-level, and thus the lookahead includes newline but not `)` Inside parentheses the parser will instead reach state 26, where `)` is a valid lookahead but newline is not. So, at least in some grammars, using a Canonical LR parser could make the prediction more precise. But features which are dependent on the use of a mammoth parsing automaton are not particularly practical.\r\n\r\nOne alternative would be for the parser to react to the newline by first simulating the reduction actions to see if a shift would eventually succeed. If you request Lookahead Correction (`%define parse.lac full`), bison will insert code to do precisely this. This code can create significant overhead, but many people request it anyway because it makes verbose error messages more accurate. So it would certainly be possible to repurpose this code to do token fallback handling, but no-one has actually done so, as far as I know.\r\n###Notes:\r\n\r\n1. A similar question which comes up from time to time is whether you can tell bison to cause a token to be reclassified to a fallback token if there is no possibility to shift the token. (That would be useful for parsing languages like SQL which have a lot of non-reserved keywords.) \r\n\r\n2. I generated the state graphs using Bison&#39;s `-g` option:\r\n\r\n        bison -o ex.tab.c --report=all -g ex.y\r\n        dot -Tpng -oex.png ex.dot\r\n\r\n    To produce the Canonical LR, I defined `lr.type` to be `canonical-lr`:\r\n\r\n        bison -o ex_canon.c --report=all -g -Dlr.type=canonical-lr ex.y\r\n        dot -Tpng -oex_canon.png ex_canon.dot\r\n \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/klFKF.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/sEr9Q.png\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256518/parsing-maxscript-problem-with-newlines/58278071#58278071","title":"parsing maxscript - problem with newlines"}],"owner":{"reputation":121,"user_id":5768310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbEXN.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeysym","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768310/jeysym"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58278071,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570488457,"creation_date":1570359020,"question_id":58256518,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58256518","body_markdown":"I am trying to create parser for **MAXScript** language using their official [grammar description](https://help.autodesk.com/view/3DSMAX/2017/ENU/?guid=__files_GUID_46ECBAD7_35E9_43BD_8A8C_849772924805_htm) of the language. I use *flex* and *bison* to create the lexer and parser.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have run into following problem. In traditional languages (e.g. C) statements are separated by a special token (`;` in C). But in MAXScript expressions inside a compound expression can be separated either by `;` or `newline`. There are other languages that use whitespace characters in their parsers, like Python. But Python is much more strict about the placement of the `newline`, and following program in Python is invalid:\r\n```python\r\n# compile error\r\ndef \r\nfoo(x):\r\n  print(x)\r\n\r\n# compile error\r\ndef bar\r\n(x):\r\n  foo(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever in MAXScript following program is valid:\r\n```c\r\nfn\r\nfoo x =\r\n(              // parenthesis start the compound expression\r\n   a = 3 + 2;  // the semicolon is optional\r\n   print x\r\n)\r\n\r\nfn bar\r\nx =\r\n   foo x\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you can even write things like this:\r\n```\r\nfor\r\nx\r\nin\r\n#(1,2,3,4)\r\ndo\r\nformat &quot;%,&quot; x\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will evaluate fine and print `1,2,3,4,` to the output. So `newline`s can be inserted into many places with no special meaning.\r\n\r\nHowever if you insert one more `newline` in the program like this:\r\n```\r\nfor\r\nx\r\nin\r\n#(1,2,3,4)\r\ndo\r\nformat &quot;%,&quot;\r\nx\r\n```\r\nYou will get a runtime error as `format` function expects to have more than one parameter passed.\r\n\r\nHere is part of the bison input file that I have:\r\n```bison\r\nexpr:\r\n    simple_expr\r\n|   if_expr\r\n|   while_loop\r\n|   do_loop\r\n|   for_loop\r\n|   expr_seq\r\n\r\nexpr_seq:\r\n    &quot;(&quot; expr_semicolon_list &quot;)&quot;\r\n\r\nexpr_semicolon_list:\r\n    expr\r\n|   expr TK_SEMICOLON expr_semicolon_list\r\n|   expr TK_EOL expr_semicolon_list\r\n\r\nif_expr:\r\n    &quot;if&quot; expr &quot;then&quot; expr &quot;else&quot; expr\r\n|   &quot;if&quot; expr &quot;then&quot; expr\r\n|   &quot;if&quot; expr &quot;do&quot; expr\r\n\r\n// etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will parse only programs which use `newline` only as expression separator and will not expect `newline`s to be scattered in other places in the program.\r\n\r\nMy question is: Is there some way to tell bison to treat a token as an optional token? For bison it would mean this:\r\n\r\n* If you find `newline` token and you can shift with it or reduce, then do so.\r\n* Otherwise just discard the `newline` token and continue parsing.\r\n\r\nBecause if there is no way to do this, the only other solution I can think of is modifying the bison grammar file so that it expects those `newline`s everywhere. And bump the precedence of the rule where `newline` acts as an expression separator. Like this:\r\n```\r\n%precedence EXPR_SEPARATOR   // high precedence\r\n\r\n%%\r\n\r\n// w = sequence of whitespace tokens\r\nw:  %empty    // either nothing\r\n|   TK_EOL w  // or newline followed by other whitespace tokens\r\n\r\nexpr:\r\n    w simple_expr w\r\n|   w if_expr w\r\n|   w while_loop w\r\n|   w do_loop w\r\n|   w for_loop w\r\n|   w expr_seq w\r\n\r\nexpr_seq:\r\n    w &quot;(&quot; w expr_semicolon_list w &quot;)&quot; w\r\n\r\nexpr_semicolon_list:\r\n    expr\r\n|   expr w TK_SEMICOLON w expr_semicolon_list\r\n|   expr TK_EOL w expr_semicolon_list           %prec EXPR_SEPARATOR\r\n\r\nif_expr:\r\n    w &quot;if&quot; w expr w &quot;then&quot; w expr w &quot;else&quot; w expr w\r\n|   w &quot;if&quot; w expr w &quot;then&quot; w expr w\r\n|   w &quot;if&quot; w expr w &quot;do&quot; w expr w\r\n\r\n// etc.\r\n```\r\nHowever this looks very ugly and error-prone, and I would like to avoid such solution if possible.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256518/parsing-maxscript-problem-with-newlines","title":"parsing maxscript - problem with newlines"},{"tags":["wordpress","contact-form-7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":354,"user_id":1846579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZBio.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Senpai.D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1846579/senpai-d"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570360215,"post_id":58256515,"comment_id":102882330,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256515/sup-digit-in-contact-form-7-placeholder#comment102882330_58256515"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":758,"user_id":10175848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8NUk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krupal Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10175848/krupal-panchal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":758,"user_id":10175848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8NUk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krupal Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10175848/krupal-panchal"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570606673,"last_edit_date":1570606673,"creation_date":1570447129,"answer_id":58268531,"question_id":58256515,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58268531","body_markdown":"Contact form 7 doesn&#39;t allow HTML in the placeholder.

You can produce whitespace which matches the length of the input string with the `setw` function from `iomanip` (see http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iomanip/setw/).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example:\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iomanip&gt;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    std::string input = &quot;test&quot;;\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::setw(input.length() * 3) &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;; \r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::setw(input.length() * 3) &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhich produces the output:\r\n```\r\n        test\r\ntesttesttest\r\n        test\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid repeating yourself you could try to use recursion. This may not be a concept you&#39;ve covered yet, in which case it would be best to stick to the first suggestion.

was given  a task by my professor to create a pattern in c++ output using a string input by user. \r\n\r\nThe program should run in the following way:\r\n\r\n    Enter a string: ***\r\n\r\n           ***\r\n            ***\r\n             ***\r\n              ***     \r\n               ***\r\n    ***************\r\n               ***\r\n              ***\r\n             ***\r\n            ***\r\n           ***\r\n\r\n*Note : The input string from user can have any number of length or characters*\r\n\r\nFollowing are the restrictions for the program:\r\n\r\n - No string literals or white spaces in cout statement allowed.\r\n - Use of loops is also forbidden (This is the reason i am stuck ... i successfully created the above program but by using loops)\r\n - No advanced concept of c++ are allowed (at college we just started with basic concepts of how the language works. so please keep this in mind while giving the answer)\r\n\r\nI have tried multiple ways to create the above program but due to given restrictions i don&#39;t think its possible anymore, so that&#39;s why i came here to ask help from the community.\r\n\r\nHere is my code below using loops:\r\n\r\n\r\n    string userInput;\r\n    int m = 1, n = 9;\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\\nEnter a three character string: &quot;;\r\n    cin&gt;&gt;userInput; \r\n    cout&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    while (m &lt;= 6)\r\n          {\r\n             if (m == 6)\r\n               {                \r\n            cout&lt;&lt;userInput&lt;&lt;userInput&lt;&lt;userInput&lt;&lt;userInput&lt;&lt;userInput&lt;&lt;endl; \r\n                 m = 1;\r\n                 n = 13;\r\n                 while (m &lt;= 5)\r\n                  {\r\n                    cout&lt;&lt;setw(n)&lt;&lt;userInput&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n                    m++;\r\n                    n--;\r\n                }\r\n                return 0; //this will finish the execution of the program\r\n            }\r\n            cout&lt;&lt;setw(n)&lt;&lt;userInput&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n            n++;\r\n            m++;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above program works if user enters 3 character string only\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp will be highly appreciated!\r\n\r\n*Sorry for my bad English, feel free to edit and correct it if you find any errors or

Otherwise it pretends like everything is ok.\r\n\r\nI assume that this happens because before executing costly I/O Node somehow evaluates operations and, in my case, instead of creating a new file &amp; re-naming it, just creates file named `myrenamedfile.txt` straight away.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n 1.

Could you also point me to the rules that regulates behaviour of `fs.rename` in this case?

Put a breakpoint in your `Button` function and you&#39;ll see the `href` is an object.\r\n\r\nAlso, as [@George](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5674976/george) mentioned in their [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256469/typeerror-xxx-contains-is-not-a-function-in-react/58256500#comment102881952_58256469), you should use `includes` as `contains` is deprecated and probably doesn&#39;t exist on String&#39;s prototype in modern browsers.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Basic_assignment","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256469/typeerror-xxx-contains-is-not-a-function-in-react/58256500#58256500","title":"TypeError: xxx.contains is not a function in React"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":5218665,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pI2jN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"aahlfeeyann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5218665/aahlfeeyann"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":635,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58256500,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570359100,"creation_date":1570358554,"question_id":58256469,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58256469","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a conditional rendering in Gatsby with React JSX.

In between there are some changes to state which result in `render()` cycles. Some of these `render()` cycles need up to `100ms`, especially on older devices, and while the `render()` runs, there are animations going on, so it&#39;s necessary to synchronize the animations with the `render()` cycles. Maybe the performance of `render()` can be optimized (which we intend to), but I think some of them would still last at least 2-3 animation frames, so the synchronization of animation and `render()` would still be necessary.\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved in several ways, but the most simple I can think of would be to have a predictable time used for a `render()` cycle. If we know that `setState()` together with `render()` take **at least** `100ms`, then the situation &quot;`render()` terminates before the animation&quot; is ruled out, which would greatly simplify the whole process. So I need an API like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.suspendGuiUpdates();\r\nthis.setState(newState);\r\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n    this.resumeGuiUpdates();\r\n}, 100);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, the `setState()` and `render()` methods can do their work, but we have a guarantee that the GUI update takes place **at least** `100ms` after we have initiated the change.\r\n\r\nIs there such a feature in React or React Native?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256465/defer-the-results-of-a-react-render-cycle-for-a-specific-amount-of-time","title":"Defer the results of a React render() cycle for a specific amount of time?"},{"tags":["java","caching","concurrency"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":48352,"user_id":2071828,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8AYO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Boris the Spider","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2071828/boris-the-spider"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570359329,"post_id":58256464,"comment_id":102882120,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256464/both-methods-have-same-erasure-yet-neither-overrides-the-other-even-after-fol#comment102882120_58256464"},{"owner":{"reputation":48352,"user_id":2071828,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8AYO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Boris the Spider","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2071828/boris-the-spider"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570359513,"post_id":58256464,"comment_id":102882159,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256464/both-methods-have-same-erasure-yet-neither-overrides-the-other-even-after-fol#comment102882159_58256464"},{"owner":{"reputation":101057,"user_id":1393766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h0FSp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pshemo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1393766/pshemo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570360423,"post_id":58256464,"comment_id":102882375,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256464/both-methods-have-same-erasure-yet-neither-overrides-the-other-even-after-fol#comment102882375_58256464"},{"owner":{"reputation":101057,"user_id":1393766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h0FSp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pshemo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1393766/pshemo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570361509,"post_id":58256464,"comment_id":102882616,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256464/both-methods-have-same-erasure-yet-neither-overrides-the-other-even-after-fol#comment102882616_58256464"},{"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":860211,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKDl3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dhrubo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860211/dhrubo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570419708,"post_id":58256464,"comment_id":102894676,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256464/both-methods-have-same-erasure-yet-neither-overrides-the-other-even-after-fol#comment102894676_58256464"}],"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":860211,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKDl3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dhrubo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860211/dhrubo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":353,"user_id":860211,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKDl3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dhrubo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860211/dhrubo"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570420029,"creation_date":1570358521,"last_edit_date":1570420029,"question_id":58256464,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58256464","body_markdown":"I am trying to extend ConcurrentHashMap (just for FUN) and noticing following compilation error stating ...\r\n\r\n&gt; Both methods have the same erasure, yet neither overrides the other\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class SimpleCacheImpl2&lt;K, V&gt; extends ConcurrentHashMap&lt;K,SoftReference&lt;V&gt;&gt; {\r\n\r\n    public void put(K key, V data){ // Compilation error at this line \r\n        SoftReference&lt;V&gt; softData = new SoftReference&lt;V&gt;(data);\r\n        super.put(key, softData);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public V get(K key){ // Compilation error at this line\r\n        SoftReference&lt;V&gt; softData =  super.get(key);\r\n        return softData == null ? null : softData.get() ;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nMy intention is to use SoftReference for the data.

am trying to create a blog using GatsbyJS. I follow this tutorial\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/#optimizing-and-querying-images-in-post-frontmatter-with-gatsby-image\r\n\r\nA blog contains a title, featured image and text.\r\n\r\nThe MDX-file structure looks like this.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    title: My First Post\r\n    featuredImage: ./corgi.png\r\n    ---\r\n    Post content...\r\n\r\nAnd, the code in file gatsby-node.js like this\r\n\r\n    exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) =&gt; {\r\n      const { createPage } = actions\r\n      // query for all markdown\r\n      result.data.allMdx.edges.forEach(({ node }) =&gt; {\r\n        createPage({\r\n          path: node.fields.slug,\r\n          component: path.resolve(`./src/components/markdown-layout.js`),\r\n          context: {\r\n            slug: node.fields.slug,\r\n          },\r\n        })\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the template the image will be extracted using this query. \r\n\r\n      query PostQuery($slug: String) {\r\n        markdown: mdx(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\r\n          id\r\n          frontmatter {\r\n            image {\r\n              childImageSharp {\r\n                fluid {\r\n                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\nMy main problem is writing the GraphQL-query in gatsby-node.js.

Unless you have reason to assume that model performance will decrease by inclusion of data, losing information by splitting models should be avoided._ \r\n\r\nIn this case, it appears the data is a bit chaotic. Perhaps merge to a single `X` array _(I&#39;d suggest doing so in pandas)_ and a single `y`. If your `y labels` are not compatible, then you&#39;d want to correct them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n***Additionally, I&#39;d suggest reviewing the following tools:***\r\n\r\n* [`Voting Classifiers`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier.html) and [`Voting Regressors`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.VotingRegressor.html)\r\n * An extra &quot;hack&quot; is to assign a model&#39;s `accuracy` or `f1 score` as the weight in the weighted vote. _This can generate extreme overfitting, so proceed with caution._\r\n* [`Stacking Classifiers`](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/classifier/StackingClassifier/) and [`Stacking Regressors`](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/regressor/StackingRegressor/)\r\n * The outcomes of each model in the stack is used as input for the prediction of the final model. _In my experience, this has comparable performance of an optimized `MLP` or `single layer neural network`._\r\n\r\n* [`Boosting`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting), [`Extreme Gradient Boosting`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/model.html), and [`Light Gradient Boosting`](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\r\n * Each are effective ensemble models which will work in well calibrated &quot;teams&quot;

Specifically, when a method is defined in a mixin, typescript is not picking it up in the mixed class body:\r\n\r\nIn my case, I am applying two mixins. The first mixin - `NotifyingElementMixin` - provides a method called `notify`, and it&#39;s this method which is failing to apply to the mixed class body\r\n\r\n## notifying-element-mixin.js\r\n```js\r\nexport const NotifyingElementMixin = superclass =&gt;\r\n  class NotifyingElement extends superclass {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Fires a `*-changed` event.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param  {string}     propName Name of the property.\r\n     * @param  {any} value  property value\r\n     * @protected\r\n     */\r\n    notify(propName, value) {\r\n      this.dispatchEvent(\r\n        new CustomEvent(`${propName}-changed`, {\r\n          detail: { value },\r\n        })\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## notifying-element-mixin.d.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nexport declare class NotifyingElement {\r\n  public notify(propName: string, value: any): void\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function NotifyingElementMixin&lt;TBase extends typeof HTMLElement&gt;\r\n(superclass: TBase): TBase &amp; NotifyingElement;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second mixin provides other properties and methods, but for the sake of this question, I&#39;ve simplified the implementation\r\n\r\n## apollo-query-mixin.js\r\n```js\r\nexport const ApolloQueryMixin = \r\n  superclass =&gt; class extends superclass {\r\n    data = null;\r\n    is = &#39;Query&#39;;\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n## apollo-query-mixin.d.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nexport declare class ApolloQuery&lt;TCacheShape, TData, TVariables, TSubscriptionData = TData&gt; {\r\n  data: null\r\n  is: string\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Constructor&lt;T = HTMLElement&gt; = new (...args: any[]) =&gt; T;\r\nexport function ApolloQueryMixin&lt;TBase extends Constructor, TCacheShape, TData, TVariables&gt;\r\n(superclass: TBase): ApolloQuery&lt;TCacheShape, TData, TVariables&gt; &amp; TBase;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to export a class which applies both mixins and provides it&#39;s own methods as well.

variable` means the variable does not exist and the reasons for your case is, you did not pass it in the view.\r\n\r\nUsually, to get the `customers` records from the database to your views, you can do it in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. Query it prior to loading your view then pass it to your views:\r\n```\r\n//doing it in the controller\r\n\r\n//create a controller: php artisan make:controller CustomerController\r\n\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\r\n\r\nuse Illuminate\\Routing\\Controller as BaseController;\r\n\r\nuse App\\Customer;     //Dont forget to import your Customer model \r\n\r\nclass CustomerController extends BaseController\r\n{\r\n    public function index()\r\n    {\r\n        $customers = Customer::get();   //this will fetch the customer using your mdoel\r\n\r\n        return view(&#39;customer&#39;, [&#39;customers&#39; =&gt; $customers]);  //this will pass the records to the view\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n//then in your routes/web.php:\r\n\r\nRoute::get(&#39;/customers&#39;, &#39;CustomerController@index&#39;); //when you go to your application/customers in the browser, it will go to the controller and return the view with the records.\r\n\r\n//OR you can skip the controllers and do it in the routes/web.php directly as what @jitesh jose mentioned.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Query straight into your view (Not really recommended, but sometimes you just need to make it work)\r\n\r\nIn your customer.blade.php\r\n```\r\n@php\r\n$customers = \\App\\Customer::get();\r\n@endphp\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n@foreach($customers as $customer)\r\n    &lt;li&gt;{{$customer-&gt;name}}&lt;/li&gt;\r\n@endforeach\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy advice, try to watch a few basic Laravel videos so that you will understand the flow of the request and response.

doing `self.sess.run(self.training_op, feed_dict=feed_dict_batch)` I train my whole network as once. When I have multiple layers I will then create a longer list and the training part of the code will remain untouched. \r\n\r\nThis works so far, the problem comes when I try to restore the networks metadata.

the best of my understanding of your current code, this is a fully asynchronous, promise-returning version of your `getContentInDirectory`. For the sake of testing, I found the TypeScript too noisy and removed it, add that back as you see fit.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function getContentInDirectory(dir, filterContentFn, processContentFn, maxSubFolderDepth) {\r\n        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n            let result = [], pending = 0;\r\n            function worker(currPath, depth) {\r\n                pending++;\r\n                fs.lstat(currPath, (err, stat) =&gt; {\r\n                    pending--;\r\n                    if (err) return reject(err);\r\n                    if (stat.isDirectory()) {\r\n                        if (depth &gt;= 0) {\r\n                            pending++;\r\n                            fs.readdir(currPath, (err, children) =&gt; {\r\n                                pending--;\r\n                                if (err) return reject(err);\r\n                                children.forEach(name =&gt; worker(path.join(currPath, name), depth - 1));\r\n                            });\r\n                        }\r\n                    } else if (!filterContentFn || filterContentFn(currPath)) {\r\n                        result.push(processContentFn ? processContentFn(currPath) : currPath);\r\n                    }\r\n                    if (!pending) resolve(result);\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n            worker(dir, maxSubFolderDepth &gt;= 0 ? maxSubFolderDepth : Infinity);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere are different ways to implement this, including using the [fs Promises API][1], which is available as of node version 10, but as of yet still marked &quot;experimental&quot;. The above makes no assumptions and would work with any node version.\r\n\r\nNow you can use that in `scanFiles` in the spirit of:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function scanFiles(foldersPath) {\r\n        let pendingPaths = foldersPath.map(currFolderPath =&gt; {\r\n            return getContentInDirectory(currFolderPath, filterFunc, processFunc, depth);\r\n        });\r\n        return Promise.all(pendingPaths).then(results =&gt; {\r\n            return Array.prototype.concat.apply([], results);  // flatten\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand finally in your event handler:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    onSubmit(){\r\n        this.scanFiles(this.foldersPath).then(filesPath =&gt; {\r\n            // after scan finish \r\n            console.log(&quot;this prints last&quot;);\r\n        })\r\n        .catch(err =&gt; console.log(err));\r\n        console.log(&quot;this prints first&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe thing to note here is that the function that is doing the actual work needs to be asynchronous from the start, if you want to be your consuming functions to be asynchronous as well. Switching from the &quot;sync&quot; versions of node&#39;s `fs` functions to the regular, async counterparts is the vital step.\r\n\r\nOf course this change means that every consumer of `getContentInDirectory` in your program must be changed to async code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256342/code-is-not-executing-until-after-promise-completed-its-job/58286965#58286965","title":"Code is not executing until after promise completed its job"}],"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":5527079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153809962869382/picture?type=large","display_name":"Bruce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5527079/bruce"},"last_editor":{"reputation":55,"user_id":5527079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153809962869382/picture?type=large","display_name":"Bruce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5527079/bruce"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58286965,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570542080,"creation_date":1570357438,"last_edit_date":1570542080,"question_id":58256342,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58256342","body_markdown":"This question I have might not have anything to do with angular concept. But I am encountering it in the context of angular. I click on a button in angular template, and it triggers onSubmit function.\r\n\r\nscanFiles is a long-running function that returns a promise. I expect console.log(&quot;test1&quot;) to print out right before the long running function kick in. But that not happen. It only print out after the long running function completed.  Why is that so?\r\n\r\n```\r\n    onSubmit(){\r\n\r\n        this.scanFiles(this.foldersPath).then((filesPath)=&gt;{\r\n                 //after scan finish \r\n                \r\n        })\r\n         .catch((err)=&gt;console.log(err))\r\n    \r\n        console.log(&quot;test1&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther updates on 7 Oct 2019)\r\n\r\nAs can be seen below, my scanFiles function return a promise. Hence no matter what my promise job does, theoretically, I thought &#39;test1&quot; should be printed out, before the browser start executing the promise job.\r\n```\r\nscanFiles(foldersPath: any):Promise&lt;string[]&gt; {\r\n        return new Promise(\r\n            (resolveFn, rejectFn)=&gt;{\r\n                try{\r\n            \r\n                    const scanResult:string[]= foldersPath.reduce(\r\n                        (prevFolderPath:string[], currFolderPath:string)=&gt; {\r\n                            let files:string[] =  this.fileService.getContentInDirectory (currFolderPath, this.filter.bind(this), this.getProcessDirectoryContentFn(), this.subfolderDepthInput)\r\n                            prevFolderPath.push(...files)\r\n                            return prevFolderPath\r\n        \r\n                        },new Array&lt;string&gt;())\r\n                    console.log(scanResult)\r\n                    resolveFn(scanResult)\r\n                }\r\n                catch(e){\r\n                    console.log(e)\r\n                    rejectFn(e)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        )\r\n``\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nUpdated on 8 Oct 2019\r\nThere is a readdirSync() function inside geContentInDirectory\r\n```\r\ngetContentInDirectory(dir:string, filterContentFn?:(fullPath:string)=&gt;boolean, processContentFn?:(fullPath:any)=&gt;string, maxSubFolderDepth?:number ): string[]{\r\n  \r\n        let paths:string[]=[];\r\n        \r\n        //const dir_NOT_A_DIRECTORY = \r\n        if(!dir || !fs.lstatSync(dir).isDirectory()) \r\n            throw new Error(&quot;First Parameter must be a directory&quot;)\r\n            \r\n        fs.readdirSync(dir).forEach(entityName=&gt;{\r\n            let fullPath:string = path.join(dir, entityName)\r\n            let isFile = fs.lstatSync(fullPath).isFile()\r\n\r\n            if(maxSubFolderDepth==undefined || maxSubFolderDepth &gt;= 0){\r\n                if(isFile){\r\n                    if(filterContentFn) {\r\n                        if(filterContentFn(fullPath)){\r\n                            let content = processContentFn? processContentFn(fullPath): fullPath\r\n                            paths.push(content)\r\n                        }            \r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                else {\r\n                    const depth = maxSubFolderDepth==undefined ? undefined: maxSubFolderDepth-1\r\n                    paths.push(...this.getContentInDirectory(fullPath, filterContentFn, processContentFn, depth))\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        return paths;\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUpdated on 8 Oct 2019\r\n\r\nI done an experiment by rewriting my code like this:\r\nThe result is &quot;test0&quot;, &quot;test2&quot;, &quot;test1&quot; is printed out in this sequence.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**: When promise object is being created, its long running job defined inside the promise object will get fired and executed immediately. \r\nOnce my scanFiles completed its job, &quot;test0&quot; is printed.\r\n\r\nThe callback is then registered (registered, but not yet executed) in the promise&#39;s then function. Then test2&quot; is printed. The thread will then go back to its event loop, and discover it still need to handle the callback function, resulting in the &quot;test1&quot; being printed\r\n```\r\nlet p= this.scanFiles(this.foldersPath)\r\nconsole.log(&quot;test0&quot;)\r\np.then((filesPath)=&gt;{\r\n  console.log(&quot;test1&quot;)\r\n })\r\n .catch((err)=&gt;console.log(err))\r\n\r\n console.log(&quot;test2&quot;)\r\n```\r\nThanks to **Tomalak** user for his solution and explanation, which lead to my above understanding. \r\n\r\n**ANSWER** to my question: My Promise object contains synchronous tasks inside. No wonder my &quot;test1&quot; (refer to my topmost code) is printed out only after the tasks in the promise object has completed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256342/code-is-not-executing-until-after-promise-completed-its-job","title":"Code is not executing until after promise completed its

have a SaaS platform in which we are on a process to migrate it to a Multi-Tenants architecture. We have multiple micro-services and one Identity server which uses IdentityServer4.\r\n\r\nIn each service in the `Startup.cs` we have the following code:\r\n\r\n    services.AddAuthentication(&quot;Bearer&quot;)\r\n            .AddIdentityServerAuthentication(options =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                options.Authority = Configuration[&quot;URLs:IdentityServer&quot;];\r\n                options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;\r\n\r\n                options.ApiName = &quot;apiInternal&quot;;\r\n            });\r\n\r\nWe are using subdomains to distinguish between tenants and each tenant has its own database.\r\n\r\nThe only problem we are facing is with the IdentityServer.\r\n\r\nOur goal is that we will have a different Identity service for each tenant. But we could not figure out how to replace the authority at runtime based on the subdomain (tenant).\r\n\r\nActually, we tried this approach:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/52955238/how-can-i-set-the-authority-on-openidconnect-middleware-options-dynamically\r\n\r\nAfter some changes it worked with only one problem, the authority is changing only on the first request, meaning, if the first request was from tenant1.example.com it will use the tenant1 identity authority, but any other request will &quot;change&quot; the authority but will use tenant1 authority. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the second request is from tenat2.example.com we will see the code that changes the authority kick in, but in actual, it is not replacing the authority. \r\n\r\nWhat I suspect that happens is that the authority has changed, but it does not initialize the IdentityServer data.\r\n\r\nIf that is actually the problem, I have a couple of questions:\r\n\r\nHow do I solve it?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think the performance impact will be given the fact that on each request, we will have to get the IdentityServer data for token validation?\r\n\r\nAny other ideas what would be a best practice for having idenityserver4 with a multi-tenants approach?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256336/asp-net-core-with-identityserver4-multiple-tenants-changing-authority-at-run","title":"ASP.NET Core with IdentityServer4 - multiple tenants - changing authority at runtime"},{"tags":["regex","apache",".htaccess","mod-rewrite","http-redirect"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13690,"user_id":369434,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e859d665f54b22ab7122877da6deb8da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MrWhite","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/369434/mrwhite"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570383109,"creation_date":1570383109,"answer_id":58259698,"question_id":58256333,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58259698","body_markdown":"&gt; `/domains/foo.com/.htaccess`\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     RewriteEngine On\r\n&gt;     RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on\r\n&gt;     RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [DPI,R=301]\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t work as expected when used in the `/domains/foo.com/.htaccess` file because it is being processed _after_ the URL has been rewritten by the `/.htaccess` file in the root directory and by this stage the `REQUEST_URI` server variable has been updated to the full URL-path that the request has been rewritten to (not the URL that the user requested), ie. `/domains/foo.com/sub/`.\r\n\r\n(_Aside:_ You&#39;ve not stated if you are using PHP, but to clarify just in case... the `REQUEST_URI` PHP superglobal variable, ie. `$_SERVER[&#39;REQUEST_URI&#39;]`), is not the same as the `REQUEST_URI` Apache server variable. The `REQUEST_URI` PHP variable contains the URL that the user requested (which appears to be what you are expecting of the Apache server variable), which in this case is not the same as the Apache server variable of the same name.)\r\n\r\nThe simple solution is to capture the URL-path from the URL-path matched by the `RewriteRule` _pattern_, instead of using the `REQUEST_URI` Apache server variable.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    # /domains/foo.com/.htaccess\r\n    RewriteEngine On\r\n    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on\r\n    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]\r\n\r\nIn `.htaccess`, the `RewriteRule` _pattern_ matches against the URL-path less the directory-prefix - so it is always relative to the directory that contains the `.htaccess` file.\r\n\r\nThe `DPI` flag would not seem to be required here.\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution is to move your HTTP to HTTPS redirect to the root `/.htaccess` file (_before_ the internal rewrites) and maybe check for the requested _hostname_ if you need to be selective. For example:\r\n\r\n    # /.htaccess\r\n    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on\r\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\\.)?sub\\.foo\\.com [NC]\r\n    RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]\r\n\r\nIn the root `/.htaccess` file we can use the Apache variable `REQUEST_URI` providing the redirect is placed _before_ the internal rewrites.\r\n\r\nYou will need to clear your browser cache before testing. Preferably test with 302 (temporary) redirects to avoid potential caching issues.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt;     # remove www from URL\r\n&gt;     RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\\.(.*)$ [NC]\r\n&gt;     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,DPI,L,NC]\r\n\r\nAnother &quot;problem&quot; is that your www to non-www redirect always redirects to HTTP. So, a request for `https://www.sub.foo.com/` will be redirected back to HTTP before (hopefully) being redirected back to HTTPS - an unnecessary additional redirect. There are a number of ways you can resolve this depending on your requirements.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256333/http-https-wrong-final-url-subdomain-redirect/58259698#58259698","title":"http &gt; https wrong final url (subdomain redirect)"}],"owner":{"reputation":4744,"user_id":4024146,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6kHBYaTT2sw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAPZ0/AZk9LqXdwR4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mtrakal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4024146/mtrakal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58259698,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570383109,"creation_date":1570357369,"question_id":58256333,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58256333","body_markdown":"I have:\r\n\r\ndirectory tree:\r\n```\r\n└───domains\r\n    ├───bar.com\r\n    │   ├───sub (sub.bar.com / www.sub.bar.com)\r\n    │   ├───sub2 (sub2.bar.com / www.sub2.bar.com)\r\n    │   └───www (bar.com / www.bar.com)\r\n    └───foo.com\r\n        ├───sub (sub.foo.com / www.sub.foo.com)\r\n        ├───sub2 (sub2.foo.com / www.sub2.foo.com)\r\n        └───www (foo.com / www.foo.com)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n/.htaccess\r\n\r\n\r\nRewriteEngine On\r\n\r\n# remove www from URL\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\\.(.*)$ [NC]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,DPI,L,NC]\r\n\r\n# subdomains (sub.foo.com, sub.bar.com, sub2.foo.com, sub2.bar.com)\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^domains/\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/domains/\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^\\.]*)\\.([^\\.]*\\.[^\\.]*)$\r\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/domains/%2 -d\r\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/domains/%2/%1 -d\r\nRewriteRule (.*) /domains/%2/%1/$1 [DPI]\r\n\r\n# main domains (foo.com, bar.com)\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^domains/\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/domains/\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^\\.]*\\.[^\\.]*)$\r\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/domains/%1 -d\r\nRewriteRule (.*) /domains/%1/www/$1 [DPI]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks that works quite well, but when I need to enable https on `foo.com`, that doesn&#39;t work as expected.\r\n```\r\n/domains/foo.com/.htaccess\r\n\r\nRewriteEngine On\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on\r\nRewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [DPI,R=301]\r\n```\r\nBecause instead of redirect: http://www.sub.foo.com/?query &gt; https://sub.foo.com/?query it redirect to: https://sub.foo.com/domains/foo.com/sub/?query but it really is not what I expect.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58256333/http-https-wrong-final-url-subdomain-redirect","title":"http &gt; https wrong final url (subdomain redirect)"},{"tags":["react-native"],"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":9264686,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f5207705e1a0c44a1ef0acc0fedf22b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hasan Rıza Uzuner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9264686/hasan-r%c4%b1za-uzuner"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570357359,"creation_date":1570357359,"question_id":58256332,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58256332","body_markdown":"How can I make a View Hexagon style?
