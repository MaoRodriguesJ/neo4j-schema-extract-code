have two models: `Owner` and `Accountants`. \r\nA Owner can have 0 or more Accountants, an Accountant can be connected to 1 or more Owners.\r\n\r\nSo far I&#39;ve created the two models using a ManyToManyField, here they are:\r\n\r\n    models.py\r\n        class Accountants(models.Model):\r\n            owner = models.ManyToManyField(Owner, related_name=&#39;accountants&#39;)\r\n            company = models.CharField(db_column=&#39;Company&#39;, max_length=25)\r\n            fiscal_rep = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n    \r\n        class Owner(models.Model):\r\n            name = models.CharField(db_column=&#39;Owner_Name&#39;, max_length=200)\r\n            surname = models.CharField(db_column=&#39;Owner_Surname&#39;, max_length=30)\r\n            property = models.ManyToManyField(Property, blank=True)\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created my form to add the accountant, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n    class AccountantAddForm(forms.ModelForm):\r\n        owner = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Owner.objects.all(),widget=forms.Select(\r\n        attrs={\r\n        ...\r\nThe problem here is that when I add an accountant, the Owner field is expecting more than one value, and on my form I pass the owner pre-filled as `initial data`, so I came up with an idea of making another model named `Owner_Accountant` connecting both `Owner` and `Accountants` models, as below:\r\n\r\n    class Owner_Accountants(models.Model):\r\n        owner_pk = models.ForeignKey(Owner, related_name=&#39;owner_accountant&#39;)\r\n        accountant_pk = models.ForeignKey(Accountants, related_name=&#39;accountants_owner&#39;)\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know is: is this a good solution or is it quite the same? Is there a better way to do this, or am I doing it completely wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062324/what-should-be-applied-manytomany-or-a-model-with-2-foreign-keys","title":"What should be applied, ManyToMany or a model with 2 Foreign Keys?"},{"tags":["java","garbage-collection","windows-10","remote-access","visualvm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1057,"user_id":11310605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lR2XY.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheWhiteRabbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11310605/thewhiterabbit"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569242141,"post_id":58062323,"comment_id":102521527,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062323/run-visualvm-for-monitoring-a-java-app-on-remote-windows-10-host#comment102521527_58062323"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9961140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f52e31cf153cedd7b13b59763a17db8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sa&#39;ay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9961140/saay"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569241263,"creation_date":1569241263,"question_id":58062323,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58062323","body_markdown":"i am working on a Windows 10 (enterprise edition) pc developing java applications.\r\nThese applications are running on another Windows 10 pc.\r\n\r\nI would like to monitor remotely the Memory(GC)/CPU activities, because the pc is not in the same building.

You may even be seeing a warning in the browser console which relates to this. \r\n\r\nIf you send the date as a string the browser has no way to know whether you meant 10th Sept or 9th Oct, so it just has to guess. \r\n\r\nBackground: some cultures (e.g. UK and much of Europe) use `dd.mm.yyyy`, some use `mm.dd.yyyy` (e.g. USA) to present dates (to human beings), some use something else again. There&#39;s variation in the order of the elements, the separators used, and the conventions for when to use particular formats in different situations. As you&#39;ve now learned, it&#39;s a bad idea to tie your data to one of these idiosyncratic formats. Computers cannot guess which culture you are intending to represent with your data.\r\n\r\nWhilst it&#39;s certainly possible to tell the browser how to correctly interpret your ambiguous date, the simple, foolproof solution to this is not to use ambiguous date formats to begin with. Instead, use a non-ambiguous date format such as [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) - i.e. basically `yyyy-mm-dd` (for the date part).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062313/issue-with-fullcalendar-3-9-0-version-month-and-day-value-is-swapped/58063520#58063520","title":"Issue with Fullcalendar 3.9.0 version, Month and day value is swapped"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12106931,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ngEzAE3pv7Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdxCOPLUSS3yaIYn-q8c-CNBZblaw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Matthew Fitzsimons","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106931/matthew-fitzsimons"},"last_editor":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569245196,"creation_date":1569241232,"last_edit_date":1569245196,"question_id":58062313,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58062313","body_markdown":"I am trying out the FullCalendar 3.9.0 in Salesforce lightning component, when I pass the standard salesforce start and end date it displays on the Calendar in the lightning component but either the moment of fullcalendar js messes it and for example 10.9 being 10th September is being placed in 9th October box. \r\nIs there some issue why the plugin changes the Month and day like so? \r\n\r\nAny days above 12 dont show obviously.

this.props.data` it will give my wrong result as it only does the shallow comparison.\r\n\r\nI also know that I can use **lodash** library to deep compare the values, but I wanted to know the best way of comparing the nested array of the object in `shouldComponentUpdate()`\r\n\r\nHere is the live example - https://codesandbox.io/s/crazy-perlman-f3e1k?fontsize=14 In case you are interested to see my

Normally you wouldn&#39;t want to do what you are proposing, so Jackson ships by default with that in mind.\r\n\r\nOne possibility:\r\n====\r\nHowever, since Jackson is nothing more than a java library, you can extend and modify it to suit your needs. My first suggestion would be to create different [`Scopes`][1] for the `parent -&gt; child -&gt; parents` and for the `child -&gt; parent -&gt; child`.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy it&#39;s probably a bad idea:\r\n===\r\nRegardless of that, it&#39;s important to understand why this isn&#39;t a default behavior:\r\n\r\nIf you have `Child` and `Parent` in a relationship where a `Child` can only have one `Parent` and `Parent`s can have multiple `Child`s, then:\r\n```\r\n  A         B            C\r\nChild -&gt; Parent -&gt; List&lt;ChildID&gt;\r\n```\r\n - A and B are different.\r\n - A is contained in C.\r\n - C can also contain other `Child`.\r\n\r\nbut,\r\n```\r\n  A         B                   C (missing)\r\nParent -&gt; List&lt;ChildID&gt; ----&gt; Parent\r\n```\r\n - B contains multiple `Child`\r\n - Each missing C would be equal to A.\r\n\r\nSo, if your problem only appears when you approach `Parent` to get `List&lt;Child&gt;`, then you already have your solution. Since the `Parent` of each and every `Child` in the list would be the parent that has the list in the first place.\r\n\r\nTherefore, you don&#39;t need the C that is missing, since it&#39;s already the element A.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-annotations/javadoc/2.2.0/com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonIdentityInfo.html#scope()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062237/jackson-how-to-prevent-recursive-call-by-only-adding-id-field-inside-child-coll/58214924#58214924","title":"Jackson: How to prevent recursive call by only adding ID field inside child collections"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":137,"user_id":11486142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe05d3fd8a1ff5cee36d6d9e01c66dd1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ravi Mengar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11486142/ravi-mengar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570167180,"creation_date":1570167180,"answer_id":58230466,"question_id":58062237,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58230466","body_markdown":"Try to add &quot;**JsonIgnore**&quot; annotation to prevent the unwanted data comes from the parant entity into the child.\r\n\r\n        @JsonIdentityInfo(generator = ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator.class, property = &quot;id&quot;)\r\n        public class Child {\r\n          private String name;\r\n          @JsonIdentityReference(alwaysAsId = true)\r\n          @ManyToOne\r\n          @JsonIgnore      &lt;- HERE\r\n          private Parent parent;\r\n        }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062237/jackson-how-to-prevent-recursive-call-by-only-adding-id-field-inside-child-coll/58230466#58230466","title":"Jackson: How to prevent recursive call by only adding ID field inside child collections"}],"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":2266807,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vUiU2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yonetmen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2266807/yonetmen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":122,"user_id":2266807,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vUiU2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yonetmen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2266807/yonetmen"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":97,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570167180,"creation_date":1569240925,"last_edit_date":1569249902,"question_id":58062237,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58062237","body_markdown":"I wanted to simplify my question.

It generally supports only THREE columns of input:\r\n\r\n 1. A column of values that remain unchanged, as row labels\r\n 2. A column of values that are pivoted, to become new column names\r\n 3. A column of values that become the values for their respective new pivot columns\r\n\r\nBasically taking this:\r\n\r\n    +------+----------+-------+\r\n    | ITEM |  STATUS  | COUNT |\r\n    +------+----------+-------+\r\n    | foo  | active   |    12 |\r\n    | foo  | inactive |    17 |\r\n    | bar  | active   |    20 |\r\n    | bar  | inactive |     4 |\r\n    +------+----------+-------+\r\n\r\n... and producing this:\r\n\r\n    +------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n    | ITEM | STATUS | ACTIVE | INACTIVE |\r\n    +------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n    | foo  | active |     12 |       17 |\r\n    | bar  | active |     20 |        4 |\r\n    +------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\nBut what about more complex use cases?  What if you have:\r\n\r\n 1. MULTIPLE input columns that you would like to remain as-is in the output?\r\n 2. MULTIPLE input columns that you would like to pivot into new columns?\r\n\r\nAs in the example below:  \r\n\r\n    +--------+-----------------+---------+--------+-------+------------------+\r\n    | SYSTEM |  MICROSERVICE   |  MONTH  | METRIC | VALUE | CONFIDENCE_LEVEL |\r\n    +--------+-----------------+---------+--------+-------+------------------+\r\n    | batch  | batch-processor | 2019-01 | uptime |    99 |                2 |\r\n    | batch  | batch-processor | 2019-01 | lag    |    20 |                1 |\r\n    | batch  | batch-processor | 2019-02 | uptime |    97 |                2 |\r\n    | batch  | batch-processor | 2019-02 | lag    |    35 |                2 |\r\n    +--------+-----------------+---------+--------+-------+------------------+\r\n\r\nWhere the first THREE columns should carry over as-is for each row (no grouping or aggregation).  And the `metric` column has TWO associated columns (i.e. `value` and `confidence_level`) to pivot for it?\r\n\r\n    +--------+-----------------+---------+--------------+-------------------+-----------+----------------+\r\n    | SYSTEM |  MICROSERVICE   |  MONTH  | UPTIME_VALUE | UPTIME_CONFIDENCE | LAG_VALUE | LAG_CONFIDENCE |\r\n    +--------+-----------------+---------+--------------+-------------------+-----------+----------------+\r\n    | batch  | batch-processor | 2019-01 |           99 |                 2 |        20 |              1 |\r\n    | batch  | batch-processor | 2019-02 |           97 |                 2 |        35 |              2 |\r\n    +--------+-----------------+---------+--------------+-------------------+-----------+----------------+\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if this still fits the strict definition of &quot;pivot table&quot;.  But is such a result possible with `crosstab()`, or any other readily-available PostgreSQL function?  If not, then how could it be produced with a custom PL/pgSQL function?

It returns a decimal number `0 &lt;= N &lt; 1`. The input value is a seed, not an upper limit like you are expecting. To get a random integer number between `0 &lt;= N &lt; Count`, you have to multiple the result, ie `RAND()*Count`, which you are not doing. But you don&#39;t need to do that, you can just use `RAND()` by itself, there is no need to query the record count first:\n\n```delphi\nqryCards.SQL.Text := &#39;SELECT * FROM tblCards WHERE Card_Rarity = &quot;Epic&quot; ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1&#39;;\nqryCards.Open;\nShowMessage(qryCards.FieldByName(&#39;Card_Name&#39;).AsString);\n```\n\nOtherwise, you can select a random record by specifying an offset to the `LIMIT` clause, eg:\n\n```delphi\nqryCards.SQL.Text := &#39;SELECT * FROM tblCards WHERE Card_Rarity = &quot;Epic&quot;&#39;;\nqryCards.Open;\niCount := qryCards.RecordCount;\nqryCards.Close;\nqryCards.SQL.Text := &#39;SELECT * FROM tblCards WHERE Card_Rarity = &quot;Epic&quot; LIMIT &#39; + IntToStr(Random(iCount)) + &#39;, 1&#39;);\nqryCards.Open;\nShowMessage(qryCards.FieldByName(&#39;Card_Name&#39;).AsString);\n```\n\nIf your table has an auto-increment id field with no gaps in it, there are other techniques you can use `RAND()` with.

It is not necessarily better to have a large `query_cache_size`.  When any modification occurs to a table, all entries (in the QC) for that table are removed.  The bigger the QC, the longer this takes.  `50M` is a reasonable max.\r\n* The non-QC caching needed involves all the tables in the query -- index blocks need to go into the `key_buffer` and data blocks need to be cached by the OS.  Please provide `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE &#39;%buffer%&#39;;` on both machines.\r\n* The 13s on the busy production system may involve cache misses that did not happen on the less-busy other machine.\r\n* Is the count correct?

You should plan on moving to InnoDB.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062193/count-is-so-slow-in-myisam-table/58250866#58250866","title":"count(*) is so slow in MyISAM table"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":2165007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f69088ec89801e6a6109744695cb9efb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mojtaba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2165007/mojtaba"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":2165007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f69088ec89801e6a6109744695cb9efb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mojtaba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2165007/mojtaba"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":125,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570514627,"creation_date":1569240783,"last_edit_date":1570514627,"question_id":58062193,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58062193","body_markdown":"I have a big database 5GB that most of its database engines are MyISAM,\r\nServer RAM is about 20GB but query_cache and other configs are sets as default (16MB).\r\nMySQL version is 5.7.27, I got an old backup of the database that is 3.5GB and when I run the query in my local It&#39;s so faster than production.\r\n\r\n    FLUSH QUERY CACHE;\r\n    RESET QUERY CACHE;\r\n    SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE \r\n    \tcount(*)\r\n    FROM\r\n    \tcompany_reports rep\r\n    \tLEFT JOIN system_users usr ON rep.user_id = usr.id\r\n    \tLEFT JOIN company_rep_subjects sbj ON rep.subject_id = sbj.id\r\n    \tINNER JOIN company_partners cus ON rep.partner_id = cus.id\r\n    \tLEFT JOIN project_con_messages mes ON rep.message_id = mes.id\r\n    \tLEFT JOIN company_par_user_settings pus ON cus.id = pus.partner_id \r\n    \tAND 1 = pus.user_id \r\n    WHERE\r\n    \t1=1 -- or other where and will generate by ACL and advanced search\r\n\r\n\r\nI disabled cache\r\n\r\n     query_cache_limit = 0\r\n     query_cache_size = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know why this query needs about 13s in production to get counts.\r\nIs there any optimization suggestion?

If a correct match can appear several times in df2, simply remove unique() in the lapply statement.\r\n\r\n    df1 = data.table(df1)\r\n    df2 = data.table(df2)\r\n    \r\n    ids = df1$id # Get IDS\r\n    cols = colnames(df2) # Source appropriate subset for df2\r\n    \r\n    hitmat = df2[, lapply(.SD, function(x) sum(unique(x) %in% ids)/length(x)), .SDcols = cols]\r\n    \r\n    &gt; hitmat\r\n       randomColumnName OtherRandomColumn value\r\n    1:            0.625                 0     0\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062168/automatic-matching-of-right-column/58063147#58063147","title":"Automatic matching of right column"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":7981092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bL57v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mcdesign","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7981092/mcdesign"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36027,"user_id":5635580,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/00uoL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sotos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5635580/sotos"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58063147,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569244508,"creation_date":1569240703,"last_edit_date":1569241226,"question_id":58062168,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58062168","body_markdown":"In R, having the following two dataframes:\r\n\r\n    df1 &lt;- structure(list(id = 1:8, value = c(100L, 100L, 100L, 100L, 100L, \r\n    100L, 100L, 100L)), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;, row.names = c(NA, -8L))\r\n\r\n    df2 &lt;- structure(list(randomColumnName = c(100L, 2L, 3L, 40L, 5L, 6L, 73L, 8L), OtherRandomColumn =    structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), .Label = &quot;&#39;test&#39;&quot;, class = &quot;factor&quot;), value = c(100L, 100L, 100L, 100L, 100L, 100L, 100L, 100L)), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;, row.names = c(NA, -8L))\r\n\r\n    print(df1)\r\n\r\n      id value\r\n    1  1   100\r\n    2  2   100\r\n    3  3   100\r\n    4  4   100\r\n    5  5   100\r\n    6  6   100\r\n    7  7   100\r\n    8  8   100\r\n\r\n    print(df2)\r\n\r\n      randomColumnName OtherRandomColumn value\r\n    1              100            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n    2                2            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n    3                3            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n    4               40            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n    5                5            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n    6                6            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n    7               73            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n    8                8            &#39;test&#39;   100\r\n\r\nDataframe 1 has a unique id column called &#39;id&#39;.

mutations: {\r\n      SET_EMAIL: (state, payload) =&gt; {\r\n        state.email = payload\r\n      },\r\n      SET_PHONE: (state, payload) =&gt; {\r\n        state.phone = payload\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    actions: {\r\n      SAVE_EMAIL: (context, payload) =&gt; {\r\n        context.commit (&#39;SET_EMAIL&#39;, payload);\r\n      },\r\n      SAVE_PHONE: (context, payload) =&gt; {\r\n        context.commit (&#39;SET_PHONE&#39;, payload);\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  return Store\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen you can set the value in store like this:\r\n```\r\nthis.$store.dispatch(\r\n  &quot;SAVE_EMAIL&quot;,\r\n  &#39;my email&#39;\r\n);\r\n```\r\nAnd show it in the component like this:\r\n```\r\n{{this.$store.getters.EMAIL}}\r\n```\r\n  [1]:

don&#39;t understand where I am going wrong with the calculation I did, why did I receive a different result to the IDE console. Console receives a result of `14464` for the `println` for my `ShortTotal`. But via manual calculation on a calculator I received a similar number but `+1` which was `14465`?\r\n\r\nI understand what the short type maximum and minimum values are. Here is what I have done so far:\r\n\r\nAs the short maximum value is around `32,767`. So it goes to the minimum again with the remaining amount. So on a calculator, you can check this by doing: \r\n`1000 x (bytevalue+shortvalue + intvalue) = 80000`. As `80,000` is bigger than short max val it overflows with the remainder. `80,000-32767 =47233` then add this value back onto minimum which is :  `- 32768 + 47233 = 14465` \r\n\r\nI managed to get close to the value of `14464` but don&#39;t know why I&#39;m receiving `14465`?\r\n\r\n```Java\r\npackage com.company;\r\n \r\npublic class Main {\r\n \r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n   byte ByteValue = 10;\r\n   short ShortValue = 20;\r\n   int IntValue = 50;\r\n   long LongTotal = 50000 + 10 * (ByteValue + ShortValue + IntValue);\r\n        System.out.println(LongTotal);\r\n//The issue in question is below.\r\n        short ShortTotal = (short) (1000 * (ByteValue + ShortValue + IntValue));\r\n      System.out.println(ShortTotal);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062140/java-overflow-have-different-result-when-calculating-on-a-calculator-to-the-ide","title":"Java overflow have different result when calculating on a calculator to the IDE result?"},{"tags":["python","django","django-channels"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1764,"user_id":8741781,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ea926dcee3f547fcf84b039290ee6b8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bdoubleu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8741781/bdoubleu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569247038,"post_id":58062139,"comment_id":102524502,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062139/django-channels-how-to-run-asyncconsumer-as-a-worker#comment102524502_58062139"}],"owner":{"reputation":344,"user_id":560449,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb31cbb598b2c00333b30fbc8c31524e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Suresh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560449/suresh"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569240595,"creation_date":1569240595,"question_id":58062139,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58062139","body_markdown":"In Django channels, I want to run an AsyncConsumer in an infinite loop as a separate process, like a worker.

It could be ignored for\r\n   duplication. \r\n - `Year_Duplicate` shows us the first year when that ID\r\n   occurred. If there is no duplicate, there is no need for\r\n   `Year_Duplicate` in which case we will leave it blank.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062128/mark-rolling-duplicate-by-previous-value-year-in-a-grouping-variable","title":"Mark rolling duplicate by previous value (year) in a grouping variable"},{"tags":["google-smart-home"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7863,"user_id":1491707,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/571175831/picture?type=large","display_name":"Nick Felker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491707/nick-felker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569249097,"post_id":58062127,"comment_id":102525728,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062127/support-for-colorsetting-trait-on-non-light-device-types#comment102525728_58062127"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12106808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6012b8ff9ac0139a3e4550d5020ff601?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank Schraufstetter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106808/frank-schraufstetter"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7863,"user_id":1491707,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/571175831/picture?type=large","display_name":"Nick Felker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491707/nick-felker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569249924,"post_id":58062127,"comment_id":102526199,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062127/support-for-colorsetting-trait-on-non-light-device-types#comment102526199_58062127"},{"owner":{"reputation":7863,"user_id":1491707,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/571175831/picture?type=large","display_name":"Nick Felker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491707/nick-felker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569252657,"post_id":58062127,"comment_id":102527680,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062127/support-for-colorsetting-trait-on-non-light-device-types#comment102527680_58062127"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12106808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6012b8ff9ac0139a3e4550d5020ff601?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank Schraufstetter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106808/frank-schraufstetter"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7863,"user_id":1491707,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/571175831/picture?type=large","display_name":"Nick Felker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491707/nick-felker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569303363,"post_id":58062127,"comment_id":102542292,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58062127/support-for-colorsetting-trait-on-non-light-device-types#comment102542292_58062127"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12106808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6012b8ff9ac0139a3e4550d5020ff601?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank Schraufstetter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106808/frank-schraufstetter"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12106808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6012b8ff9ac0139a3e4550d5020ff601?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank Schraufstetter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106808/frank-schraufstetter"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569250023,"creation_date":1569240546,"last_edit_date":1569250023,"question_id":58062127,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58062127","body_markdown":"Our hood supports a backlight which supports full RGB color change.
