Again, I see why: there&#39;s nothing matching exactly, but there&#39;s beans of type `SomeInterface` (in this case, just one) so it constructs a temporary collection of them and autowires with that. Fine, but not what I&#39;m after.\r\n\r\nI would like the solution to be extensible so that if another bean is added, the dependent component does not need to change. I&#39;ve tried using two parameters, each with a `@Qualifier`, and that works but is not extensible.\r\n\r\nHow can I get this to work?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509362/how-can-i-achieve-annotation-based-collection-merging-in-spring","title":"How can I achieve annotation-based collection merging in Spring?"},{"tags":["c#","unity3d","push-notification","android-notifications"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1589,"user_id":8870196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N07y8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"0xBFE1A8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8870196/0xbfe1a8"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571766101,"post_id":58509360,"comment_id":103347084,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509360/unity-mobile-notifications-setting-vibration-pattern#comment103347084_58509360"},{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":3731426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9c5960ee0397a7f7860c6c5a0b37db4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3731426","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3731426/user3731426"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1589,"user_id":8870196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N07y8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"0xBFE1A8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8870196/0xbfe1a8"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571772541,"post_id":58509360,"comment_id":103349725,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509360/unity-mobile-notifications-setting-vibration-pattern#comment103349725_58509360"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":3731426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9c5960ee0397a7f7860c6c5a0b37db4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3731426","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3731426/user3731426"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571764658,"creation_date":1571764658,"question_id":58509360,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58509360","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to set up the unity mobile notification system but when i set VibrationPattern prop of Channel settings I&#39;m getting this error and notification channel is not created correctly.

a comma.\r\n\r\nI would hope to be able to plot each property as a column with each data piece being a cell.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509352/is-it-possible-to-make-a-csv-file-out-of-a-non-delineated-list","title":"Is it possible to make a csv file out of a non delineated

If you have 8 tables, then 8 queries will provide all of the data you require. Here is a contrived example of 3 tables. \r\n\r\n    public class Person\r\n    {\r\n        public int PersonID { get; set; }\r\n        public string PersonName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public Address[] Addresses { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Address \r\n    {\r\n        public int AddressID { get; set; }\r\n        public int PersonID { get; set; }\r\n        public string AddressLine1 { get; set; }\r\n        public string City{ get; set; }\r\n        public string StateCode { get; set; }\r\n        public string PostalCode { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public Note[] Notes { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Note \r\n    {\r\n        public int AddressID { get; set; }\r\n        public int NoteID { get; set; }\r\n        public string NoteText { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou would query each of the tables. \r\n\r\n    var people = conn.Query&lt;Person&gt;(&quot;select * from Person where ...&quot;);\r\n    var personIds = people.Select(x =&gt; x.PersonID);\r\n\r\n    var addresses = conn.Query&lt;Address&gt;(&quot;select * from Address where PersonID in @PersonIds&quot;, new { personIds });\r\n    var addressIds = addresses.Select(x =&gt; x.AddressID);\r\n\r\n    var notes = conn.Query&lt;Note&gt;(&quot;select * from Note where AddressID in @AddressIds&quot;, new { addressIds });\r\n\r\nThen, once you have all of the data, wire it up to fix the relationships between these records you have loaded. \r\n\r\n    // Group addresses by PersonID\r\n    var addressesLookup = addresses.ToLookup(x =&gt; x.PersonID);\r\n    // Group notes by AddressID\r\n    var notesLookup = notes.ToLookup(x =&gt; x.AddressID);\r\n\r\n    // Use the lookups above to populate addresses and notes\r\n    people.Each(x =&gt; x.Addresses = addressesLookup[x.PersonID].ToArray());\r\n    addresses.Each(x =&gt; x.Notes = notesLookup[x.AddressID].ToArray());\r\n\r\nThere are other ways, but a view may not satisfy all conditions, especially when given complex relationships, leading to an explosion of records. \r\n\r\n**Option 2:** \r\n\r\nFrom the following link, you can use QueryMultiple. \r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/dapper-net/handling-multiple-resultsets-4b108a8c5172\r\n\r\nCode as follows, where your child queries will have to select all of the records. \r\n\r\n    var results = conn.QueryMultiple(@&quot;\r\n        SELECT Id, CompanyId, FirstName, LastName FROM dbo.Users WHERE LastName = &#39;Smith&#39;; \r\n        SELECT Id, CompanyName FROM dbo.Companies WHERE CompanyId IN ( SELECT CompanyId FROM dbo.Users WHERE LastName = &#39;Smith&#39; );\r\n    &quot;);\r\n    var users = results.Read&lt;User&gt;();            \r\n    var companies = results.Read&lt;Company&gt;();\r\n\r\nThen you would fix the relationships as in **Option 1**.

Me and my friend were thinking of getting the users location every 1 min, then upload their current location to a database, then update that on the map, and show it on other people&#39;s map. Now we realize that this would consume so much data and time from the user, also that would create so much calling to the database which we are trying to limit. So my question is, how would I show multiple users location on the map in real time? Think of uber or lyft and how they display the driver&#39;s location and also many other driver&#39;s location to the user. How did they accomplish that or if there is away of creating a similar thing without the strain on the user&#39;s data.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509337/how-to-show-multiple-users-location-in-ios-project-live","title":"How to show multiple users location in iOS project live?"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-execution-plan","sql-query-store"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":27408,"user_id":3711162,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7XKVx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan Guzman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3711162/dan-guzman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571796126,"post_id":58509332,"comment_id":103355984,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509332/whats-the-difference-between-client-initiated-aborted-execution-and-exceptio#comment103355984_58509332"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":8315033,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51b74c4f1974dfe758938d30d66ce211?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DBALUKE HUANG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8315033/dbaluke-huang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571765432,"post_id":58509421,"comment_id":103346833,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509332/whats-the-difference-between-client-initiated-aborted-execution-and-exceptio/58509421#comment103346833_58509421"},{"owner":{"reputation":23237,"user_id":6167855,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U9Nf3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"scsimon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6167855/scsimon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":82,"user_id":8315033,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51b74c4f1974dfe758938d30d66ce211?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DBALUKE HUANG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8315033/dbaluke-huang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571766419,"post_id":58509421,"comment_id":103347214,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509332/whats-the-difference-between-client-initiated-aborted-execution-and-exceptio/58509421#comment103347214_58509421"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23237,"user_id":6167855,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U9Nf3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"scsimon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6167855/scsimon"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571764928,"creation_date":1571764928,"answer_id":58509421,"question_id":58509332,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58509421","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t find hard documentation for those descriptions, but generally they&#39;d mean\r\n\r\n - Client initiated aborted execution: The client (application, SSMS query, etc) cancelled the transaction / query\r\n - Exception Aborted execution: An exception / error was raised which caused the query to abort\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d have to find out why the execution failed to prevent the latter (check error logs) and simply *not* kill the query to prevent the first.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509332/whats-the-difference-between-client-initiated-aborted-execution-and-exceptio/58509421#58509421","title":"What&#39;s the difference between &#39;Client initiated aborted execution&#39;

Nevertheless, for the sake of thoroughness [I looked up information regarding PAM and sudo][1]:\r\n```\r\n#%PAM-1.0\r\nauth            include         system-auth\r\naccount         required        pam_unix.so\r\n#account        include         system-auth\r\nsession         include         system-auth\r\n```\r\nIt made no difference.\r\n\r\nI am out of ideas.

I have a question about how to handle errors with my process.  Right now I have basically three steps to the process.\r\n\r\n1. Process payment with stripe\r\n2. Save invoice with paid information and save a payment to database\r\n3. Send a receipt\r\n\r\nRight now I have all of these inside a try/catch block.  Eg:\r\n\r\n    const paymentProcess = async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n      const invoice = await Invoice.findOne({ _id: req._id });\r\n      if (!invoice || invoice.paid) return res.status(400).end();\r\n\r\n      try{\r\n    \r\n        const charge = await stripe.charges.create({\r\n          amount: 0.50,\r\n          currency: &#39;usd&#39;,\r\n          description: invoice.name,\r\n          source: req.body.paymentToken\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n        //Then I have code to set up saving to database here\r\n    \r\n        // Then I have code to set up an email template with ejs and send it with nodemailer here\r\n\r\n      }catch(err){\r\n        res.status(500).end();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut if the payment goes through and there is an error farther down the entire thing throws an error.  This is fine but the payment actually went through and I don&#39;t want the customer to think they just put in the wrong card info and try again.  So how would I handle this on the front end to let the customer know that the payment was successful but there was an error farther down either saving to database or sending a receipt.\r\n\r\nI thought about multiple try/catch blocks or using middleware but that would basically result in the same thing.  I could do checks along the way and send a successful response to the front end with an error message but this doesn&#39;t really seem right to me.\r\n\r\nI also thought about doing a step by step process on the front end but I think it would be a security risk.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how I should handle this step by step process.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509292/nodejs-handle-errors-for-step-by-step-payment-process","title":"NodeJs Handle Errors For Step By Step Payment Process"},{"tags":["google-apps-script","bit.ly"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":38512,"user_id":7108653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2EI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tanaike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571781064,"creation_date":1571781064,"answer_id":58512754,"question_id":58509286,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58512754","body_markdown":"How about this modification?\r\n\r\n### Modified script:\r\n\r\n\tfunction shortenUrl(longUrl){\r\n\t  var options = {\r\n\t    &#39;method&#39; : &#39;post&#39;,\r\n\t    &#39;contentType&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;,\r\n\t    &#39;payload&#39; : JSON.stringify({\r\n\t      &quot;long_url&quot;: longUrl,\r\n\t    }),\r\n\t    //  &#39;muteHttpExceptions&#39;: true,\r\n\t    &#39;headers&#39;: {&#39;Authorization&#39;: &#39;Bearer &#39; + BITLY_TOKEN} // Modified\r\n\t  };\r\n\r\n\t  return UrlFetchApp.fetch(&quot;https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/shorten&quot;, options).getContentText(); // Modified\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n- For above script, please confirm whether `BITLY_TOKEN` is declared, again.\r\n\r\n### References:\r\n- [Class UrlFetchApp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app)\r\n- [Bitly API (4.0.0)](https://dev.bitly.com/v4/)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509286/bit-ly-gives-404-from-google-apps-script/58512754#58512754","title":"Bit.ly gives 404 from Google Apps Script"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":1627783,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83ae3c09f873292512ca52a4bafe1697?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tim Freeman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1627783/tim-freeman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571781064,"creation_date":1571764342,"question_id":58509286,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58509286","body_markdown":"I am trying to shorten URLs from Google Apps Script, but I keep getting 404 errors and I don&#39;t know why.

The number of the heart I change is the same of the question: `${brokenPots + 1}`\r\n\r\nThis is the code in action:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const STORE = [\r\n          //Question 1\r\n          {\r\n                question: `Who is the Sage of Shadows in Ocarina of Time?`,\r\n                choices: [\r\n                    `Princess Zelda`, \r\n                    `Saria`, \r\n                    `Darunia`, \r\n                    `Impa`],\r\n                answer: `Impa`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 2            \r\n          {\r\n                question: `What is the fairies name that follows the Hero in Majora’s Mask?`,\r\n                choices: [\r\n                    `Tatl`, \r\n                    `Termina`, \r\n                    `Twinmold`, \r\n                    `Tael`],\r\n                answer: `Tatl`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 3            \r\n          {\r\n                question: `What is the first Zelda game that the Hero was an adult the whole game?`,\r\n                choices: [\r\n                    `Breath of the Wild`, \r\n                    `Ocarina of Time`, \r\n                    `Twilight Princess`, \r\n                    `Wind Waker`],\r\n                answer: `Twilight Princess`,\r\n                \r\n          },\r\n          //Question 4            \r\n          {\r\n                question: `Finish this quote: “Courage need not be remembered, …”`,\r\n                choices:[\r\n                    `for it is never lost.`, \r\n                    `for it is never forgotten.`, \r\n                    `because it is proven.`,\r\n                    `for it is always there.`],\r\n                answer:`for it is never forgotten.`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 5      \r\n          {\r\n                question: `The Legend of Zelda(NES) is known for being the first video game that…`,\r\n                choices:[\r\n                    `had music.`,\r\n                    `allowed saving.`, \r\n                    `had color.`, \r\n                    `was released on the NES.`],\r\n                answer: `allowed saving.`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 6\r\n          {\r\n                question: `Who is the main antagonist a majority of The Legend of Zelda series?`,\r\n                choices:[`Ganon`, \r\n                `Zant`, \r\n                `Ghirahim`, \r\n                `Majora`],\r\n                answer: `Ganon`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 7      \r\n          {\r\n                question: `Which of The Legend of Zelda games was the first to not have the usual main villain?`,\r\n                choices:[`Minish Cap`, `Skyward Sword`, `The Legend of Zelda II`, `Majora’ s Mask`],\r\n                answer: `The Legend of Zelda II`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 8\r\n          {\r\n                question:`What is the Hero’ s name ?`,\r\n                choices:[\r\n                    `Zelda`, \r\n                    `Link`, \r\n                    `Epona`, \r\n                    `Shiek`\r\n                ],\r\n                answer:`Link`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 9\r\n          {\r\n                question: `How many hearts do you need in Breath of the Wild to get the Master Sword?`,\r\n                choices:[`13`, `10`, `20`, `15`],\r\n                answer: `13`,\r\n          },\r\n          //Question 10                  \r\n          {\r\n                question: `Who develops the Legend of Zelda(series)?`,\r\n                choices:[`Sony`, `Microsoft`, `Sega`, `Nintendo`],\r\n                answer:`Nintendo`,\r\n          }\r\n        ];\r\n\r\n    const OUTCOMES = {\r\n        perfect: {\r\n           message: `You are worthy of holding the Master Sword at it&#39;s full power!`,\r\n           endImage: `images/fullpowermastersword.png`\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      great: {\r\n           message: `You are worthy of holding the Master Sword but it isn&#39;t at it&#39;s full potential.`,\r\n           endImage: `images/mastersword.png`\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      good: {\r\n           message: `You have drawn the Master Sword but it&#39;s damaged.

What I would like to do at the start is have 3 hearts show just as a homage to Zelda then erase and add 10 hearts. Every time a question is answered wrong it removes a heart and replaces it with an empty one. Problem is I cannot figure out how to get it to add in the 10 and do the replacements.

Where I am having issues, is rendering a JMapFrame to test the data is being passed.  I am trying to create and add a GridCoverageLayer of the cropped image.  I cannot get the JMapFrame to render the image, it appears to be stuck in a loop. I am suspecting the issue is setting the Style of the Layer to NULL.  If this is the issue, how do I create a raster based Style?

Since your class doesn&#39;t iterate over values, *b*&#39;s value won&#39;t update simply because the value of *a* was reassigned. You have to re-call the class to do that.\r\n\r\nIf you are manually assigning like you are in your post, you could do this:\r\n\r\n    class Tester():\r\n        def __init__(self,a):\r\n            self.a = a\r\n            self.b = a+5\r\n    \r\n    Hank = Tester(0)\r\n    print(Hank.a,Hank.b)\r\n    Hank = Tester(5)\r\n    print(Hank.a,Hank.b)\r\n\r\nReturn:\r\n\r\n    0 5\r\n    5 10\r\n\r\nOr more elegantly (of course needing to update based on the range/value/whatever you&#39;re seeking):\r\n\r\n    class Tester():\r\n        def __init__(self,a):\r\n            self.a = a\r\n            self.b = a+5\r\n    \r\n    i = 0\r\n    while i &lt;= 100:\r\n    \tHank = Tester(i)\r\n    \tprint(Hank.a, Hank.b)\r\n    \ti+=5\r\n\r\nReturn:\r\n\r\n    0 5\r\n    5 10\r\n    10 15\r\n    15 20\r\n    20 25\r\n    25 30\r\n    30 35\r\n    35 40\r\n    40 45\r\n    45 50\r\n    50 55\r\n    55 60\r\n    60 65\r\n    65 70\r\n    70 75\r\n    75 80\r\n    80 85\r\n    85 90\r\n    90 95\r\n    95 100\r\n    100 105\r\n\r\nLastly, you&#39;re not printing the commas like your post suggests.
