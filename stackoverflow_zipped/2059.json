Now, this is a single page application, so the form is redirected through javascript to an invisible iframe to be submitted.  When python is done processing the file, the iframe then calls functions in the parent document to change what is shown.\r\n\r\nJavascript function that redirects the form:\r\n\r\n    function redirect(elemid, tgt, sh1, sh2){\r\n            document.getElementById(elemid).target = tgt;\r\n            document.getElementById(elemid).submit();\r\n            \r\n            var callFunction;\r\n            callFunction = show_and_hide(sh1, sh2);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nFlask route that processes the submitted form:\r\n\r\n     @app.route(&#39;/upload&#39;, methods=[&#39;POST&#39;])\r\n     def upload_file():\r\n        #do something with file...    \r\n        return response\r\n\r\nTwo things are strange:  (1) This all works fine on localhost.  The form redirects to the iframe and submits, the file is processed, and the response triggers the parent document&#39;s actions.  Its just gae that doesn&#39;t seem to work with it.  (2) When I remove everything from the upload_file() function, so that it just returns &#39;hello world&#39;, still nothing happens.  I have a second function that hides the upload div and shows a loading screen, which works, but nothing after that.  \r\n\r\nI have worked with app engine before on a php site, which required my app.yaml to provide instructions for every file on my app, but since there is only one page to load, my app.yaml file only contains the following:\r\n\r\n    runtime: python37\r\n    \r\n    env_variables:\r\n      CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET: mybucket.appspot.com\r\n\r\nAlso, my requirements.txt is filled as follows:\r\n\r\n    Flask == 1.1.1\r\n    Flask-SQLAlchemy == 2.4.0\r\n    matplotlib == 3.1.1\r\n    NumPy == 1.17.2\r\n    SciPy == 1.3.1\r\n    \r\n    google-cloud-storage==1.13.2\r\n    gunicorn==19.9.0\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that this has something to do with app.yaml and the iframes, but I don&#39;t know what I would do to fix the issue (or if this even is the issue).  \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any help!  Thank you in advanced!\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI added a form to index.html that employs the same action and method but does not redirect to the iframe as a test.

When the method returns this stackframe is popped off the stack and any variables created within the stackframe are dereferenced unless you pass out an object reference so in answer to the question where does it go? - It&#39;s gone.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051746/initialization-and-declaration-of-variable-in-constructor-in-java/58051946#58051946","title":"Initialization and declaration of variable in Constructor in java"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8412942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3vaMr660KXw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFFo/1w2bmWb35nI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bhavya Khanna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8412942/bhavya-khanna"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8412942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3vaMr660KXw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFFo/1w2bmWb35nI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bhavya Khanna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8412942/bhavya-khanna"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1569176598,"creation_date":1569173461,"last_edit_date":1569176598,"question_id":58051746,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051746","body_markdown":"In the code below i am creating and assigning the value of a in the constructor.\r\n\r\nI know how to update the value of a.(by using a =2 instead of int a=2)\r\n\r\nwhat happens to this new value of a in the program and if i have to how to i access it?\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Consttest{\r\n    int a = 12;\r\n    Consttest(){\r\n        int a = 2;

It&#39;s better to set the values with the constructor? Courses in Java often teach you need to build getters and setters for all attributes, but it&#39;s not the best idea, and makes the code rather bloated. Only if absolutely required should they be implemented (in your case, changing itemQuantity is all that is needed, and maybe itemPrice for a coupon or something like that). Also, in Python you can return a tuple of all ItemToPurchase attributes, rather than have indivual getters:\r\n```\r\ndef getAttributes(self):\r\n    return (self.itemName, self.itemDescription, self.itemPrice, self.itemQuantity)\r\n```\r\nThen you don&#39;t need all these accesses back in your primary class / main function, you just assign to local variables and construct the ItemToPurchase that way. Then you have many fewer class accesses / function calls, it&#39;s a lot cleaner.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is how ShoppingCart is constructed.  While Python doesn&#39;t exactly have &#39;private&#39; attributes like Java or C++, you might want to make the cartItems list &#39;private&#39; (mangled, but hey, close enough) in \\_\\_init___ in that class, and build a retriever:\r\n```\r\n    self.__cartItems = []\r\n\r\ndef getCartSize():\r\n    return len(self.__cartItems)\r\n\r\ndef getCartItem(pos):\r\n    return self.__cartItems[pos].getAttributes()\r\n```\r\nThen to recover the attributes of the first ItemToPurchase in the ShoppingCart:\r\n```\r\nmyItem = getCartItem(0)  #returns a tuple of all the data about that ItemToPurchase\r\nprint(myItem[0])         #prints the name of that item in the cart\r\n```\r\nProbably the biggest difference between Python classes and Java classes is how the concept of &#39;private&#39; is implemented, and the greater flexibility of Python return statements.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051731/new-to-python-trying-to-print-objects-attributes-from-a-list/58052197#58052197","title":"New to Python: Trying to print objects attributes from a list"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11423874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/360ac4f4088426f086cfeb3e59fb4656?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zhubiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11423874/zhubiii"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11423874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/360ac4f4088426f086cfeb3e59fb4656?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zhubiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11423874/zhubiii"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569176539,"creation_date":1569173293,"last_edit_date":1569173802,"question_id":58051731,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051731","body_markdown":"    import ShoppingClass as SC\r\n    class ShoppingCartPrinter:\r\n        shoppingCart = SC.ShoppingCart()\r\n        while(True):\r\n            item = SC.ItemToPurchase()\r\n            item.setName(input(&#39;\\nEnter Name: &#39;))\r\n            item.setDescription(input(&#39;\\nSet Description: &#39;))\r\n            item.setPrice(input(&#39;\\nSet price: &#39;))\r\n            item.setQuantity(input(&#39;\\nSet Quantity: &#39;))\r\n        \r\n            shoppingCart.addItem(item)\r\n\r\n            for shoppingCart.cartItems.getName() in shoppingCart.cartItems:\r\n                print(shoppingCart.cartItems.getName())\r\n\r\n\r\nI am trying to teach myself python coming from java and wrote this simple program.

For internal services use Token Based Authentication (one of many methods).\r\n\r\n[Google Authentication Overview][1]\r\n[Getting Started with Authentication][2]\r\n\r\n&gt; But, we are not able to verify the application by DNS or other methods\r\n&gt; using Oauth2 public method. We believe this is because for each\r\n&gt; verification method, Google servers need access to the internal\r\n&gt; (government) environment. We are also not allowed to use the internal\r\n&gt; &quot;private&quot; method.\r\n\r\nWhat application are you referring to? Google servers do not access your internal servers. When using the User type of OAuth Flow, Google verifies the callback URL for your service. This means that Google needs to verify that you own/control the domain name. Since this is an internal private domain, this is not possible. However, you are using the wrong type of OAuth Flow so worrying about this is the wrong direction to take.\r\n\r\nFor an internal server to server authorization, there are many methods. Probably the best and easiest is to emulate how OAuth does it. Create a signed JWT with a certificate private key on one server and verify the signed JWT using the public key on the other service. You have now verified that the request is valid from a known source. Next embed in the JWT the identity, permissions/roles, etc. that you want to implement/control. The other side verifies that the permissions requested have been granted for the identity.\r\n\r\n[Introduction to JSON Web Tokens][3]\r\n[Token Based Authentication Made Easy][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/\r\n  [2]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started\r\n  [3]: https://jwt.io/introduction/\r\n  [4]: https://auth0.com/learn/token-based-authentication-made-easy/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051729/app-verification-for-oauth-2-0-for-server-to-server-applications/58053113#58053113","title":"App Verification for OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1257,"user_id":1801324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd461ffbf431f9f0d60b5be66736c08f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mickle Foretic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1801324/mickle-foretic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569185411,"post_id":58053126,"comment_id":102504508,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051729/app-verification-for-oauth-2-0-for-server-to-server-applications/58053126#comment102504508_58053126"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11717654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/826408834407593/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alsfyani Ali Sfyani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11717654/alsfyani-ali-sfyani"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1257,"user_id":1801324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd461ffbf431f9f0d60b5be66736c08f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mickle Foretic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1801324/mickle-foretic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569187446,"post_id":58053126,"comment_id":102504905,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051729/app-verification-for-oauth-2-0-for-server-to-server-applications/58053126#comment102504905_58053126"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11717654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/826408834407593/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alsfyani Ali Sfyani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11717654/alsfyani-ali-sfyani"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1257,"user_id":1801324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd461ffbf431f9f0d60b5be66736c08f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mickle Foretic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1801324/mickle-foretic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569187460,"post_id":58053126,"comment_id":102504914,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051729/app-verification-for-oauth-2-0-for-server-to-server-applications/58053126#comment102504914_58053126"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11717654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/826408834407593/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alsfyani Ali Sfyani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11717654/alsfyani-ali-sfyani"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1257,"user_id":1801324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd461ffbf431f9f0d60b5be66736c08f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mickle Foretic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1801324/mickle-foretic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569195444,"post_id":58053126,"comment_id":102506233,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051729/app-verification-for-oauth-2-0-for-server-to-server-applications/58053126#comment102506233_58053126"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11717654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/826408834407593/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alsfyani Ali Sfyani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11717654/alsfyani-ali-sfyani"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569183988,"creation_date":1569183988,"answer_id":58053126,"question_id":58051729,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58053126","body_markdown":"\r\n    curl -F &#39;client_id=CLIENT_ID&#39;

We have searched the [Google documentation][1] for OAuth 2.0 regarding Server to Server Applications and cannot determine is the application verification is required. The only sort of definitive answer is in this snippet from the Server to Server OAuth docs \r\n\r\n&gt; Your application calls Google APIs on behalf of the service account,\r\n&gt; so users aren&#39;t directly involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur application is hosted within a sub-government environment that blocks traffic originating from the outside. We have successfully demonstrated the read and write to the &quot;user public&quot; sensitive scope (because the OAUTH traffic is initiated from the inside) with Google API Client Library for JavaScript. \r\n\r\nBut, we are not able to verify the application by [DNS or other methods][2] using Oauth2 public method. We believe this is because for each verification method, Google servers need access to the internal (government) environment. We are also not allowed to use the internal &quot;private&quot; method. \r\n\r\nBelow is a simplistic drawing of a user being posed with an application verification dialog when trying to use the sensitive scope.

Second, singleton pattern is used if you want one object of that class, if you are going to retrieve data from the database you are going to be creating more than one object since you have multiple users. Check this:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-class-java/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAssuming you changed from singleton then apply the following to your code:\r\n\r\nThen first change the constructor to become `public Users(){}` (that is if you changed the name of the class to `Users`).\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, to retrieve the data from the database, first change the database structure to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsers\r\n   userId\r\n       mEmail : ...\r\n       mEventDate: ...\r\n       mEventLocation : ....\r\n       mPartnerName : ...\r\n       mUserName :   ....\r\n```\r\nSo in your database structure remove the node `UserDetails` because its a bit useless since you can use the `userId` to identify this user. Also dont use `password` in the database it is already encrypted in the firebase authenication. If you want to add it to the database then encrpyt it before adding it.\r\n\r\nThen change the code to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    users = db.getReference(&quot;Users&quot;);\r\n    public void loadUserDetailsData() {\r\n            ValueEventListener eventListener = new ValueEventListener() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {\r\n                       Users retrievedData = dataSnapshot.getValue(Users.class);\r\n                       String email        = retrievedData.getmEmail();\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onCancelled(@NonNull DatabaseError databaseError) {\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n        users.addListenerForSingleValueEvent(eventListener);\r\n

In particular, these two listeners are independent, that is to say: the actions that make one of them fire are guaranteed not make the other one fire. So, I do not have to do any synchronization or scheduling to resolve conflicts.\r\n\r\nMy question is: Are these three listener types independent of each other? \r\n\r\nThat is to say:\r\n\r\n1. For any given action, I am guaranteed that one, and at most one, of the three listeners will fire.\r\n2. Only ChildAdded fires when the listener is first established. The other two listener types do not.\r\n\r\n\r\nA note about the documentation, it would resolved ambiguity if the documentation for the ChildChanged would specify what it means by &quot;childChanged&quot;: does it include addition/removal/moving/editing of a child, or does it only focus on editing to an existing child?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/unity/class/firebase/database/query.html#class_firebase_1_1_database_1_1_query_1a71e2af7868312246b5da3024bb13204c","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051702/firebase-added-removed-changed-children-listener-using-swift","title":"Firebase added/removed/changed children listener using Swift"},{"tags":["sql-server","database-trigger"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569177296,"post_id":58051700,"comment_id":102502522,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051700/sql-trigger-is-sendng-emails-on-every-insertion-despite-condition#comment102502522_58051700"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12103491,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2fc5ca234c6834776340ef81251dcef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Student","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12103491/student"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569173034,"creation_date":1569173034,"question_id":58051700,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051700","body_markdown":"I have a trigger to alert for duplicate records when identified.

It also works for both if I do a search of just one subdirectory from its parent using Windows Explorer and drag from the resulting list of about 100 files.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I do a recursive search for these files from the parent directory of several of these subdirectories using Windows Explorer and get a list of 5,000 or even 50,000 files, if I try to drag even one file from the resulting list it still works perfectly to the desktop but when I drag over the RichTextBox the Copy effect does not display.  Instead I just get the circle with a slash through it.

[This][1] answer shows the same problem.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s happening is ```app.js``` is required first and starts processing.  The important thing to understand is that a file **pauses** execution while requiring a new file.\r\n\r\nSo when ```app.js``` requires ```./routes/index```, it has not finished processing, and has not reached ```module.exports = app```.  This means that when your routes file requires ```app.js```, it&#39;s requiring it in its current state, which is the default export ```{}```.\r\n\r\nThankfully there&#39;s a very simple fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// can be imported and tested separately from the app\r\nconst loadSiteSettings = function() { \r\n    return db.collection(&#39;settings&#39;).findOne();\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter.get(&#39;/reloadSettings&#39;, async function(req,res,next){\r\n    let settings = await loadSiteSettings();\r\n    req.app.locals.siteSettings = settings\r\n\r\n    res.send(200); // signal the response is successful\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n[This][2] explains the issue in a lot more depth in case you&#39;re interested\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24428181/8727490\r\n  [2]: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_cycles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051617/how-to-add-custom-function-to-express-module/58054585#58054585","title":"how to add custom function to express module"}],"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":3209130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04ca226e638b489f0a798e94f48d2e3a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3209130","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3209130/user3209130"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569258728,"creation_date":1569172502,"question_id":58051617,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051617","body_markdown":"I am trying to add a method\r\nloadSiteSettings to express module\r\n\r\n   \r\n```\r\n     In app.js\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        var express = require(&#39;express&#39;);\r\n        var path = require(&#39;path&#39;);\r\n        var mongoose = require(&#39;mongoose&#39;);\r\n        \r\n        //Set up default monggose connection for mongo db\r\n        var mongoDB = &#39;mongodb+srv://***:*****@cluste******j.mongodb.net/cms?retryWrites=true&amp;w=majority&#39;;\r\n        mongoose.connect(mongoDB,{useNewUrlParser: true});\r\n        //Get the default connection\r\n        var db = mongoose.connection;\r\n        \r\n        //Bind connection to error event (to get notification of connection errors)\r\n        db.on(&#39;error&#39;,console.error.bind(console, &#39;MongoDB connection error:&#39;));///????????\r\n        \r\n        var app = express();\r\n      \r\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n       var indexRouter = require(&#39;./routes/index&#39;);\r\n        \r\n        app.loadSiteSettings = async function()\r\n        { \r\n          let setting = await db.collection(&#39;settings&#39;).findOne();\r\n          app.locals.siteSettings = setting;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        app.loadSiteSettings();\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n        module.exports = app;\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndex.Js for router\r\n\r\nvar express = require(&#39;express&#39;);\r\nvar router = express.Router();\r\nvar app = require(&#39;../app&#39;);\r\nvar util = require(&#39;util&#39;);\r\n/* GET home page. */\r\nrouter.get(&#39;/&#39;, function(req, res, next) {\r\n  res.render(&#39;index&#39;);\r\n});\r\n///////////////////////////////////////////\r\nrouter.get(&#39;/reloadSettings&#39;, function(req,res,next){\r\n    app.loadSiteSettings();\r\n})\r\n///////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = router;\r\n```\r\n\r\nso problem lies here, when server start it calls app.loadSiteSettings() in app.js\r\nbut when i use route &#39;/reloadSettings&#39; it seems app is undefined in index.js\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051617/how-to-add-custom-function-to-express-module","title":"how to add custom function to express module"},{"tags":["swift","swift3"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12102044,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3172f021781efa7f3ce3c23ae0027e0d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sertaclinux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12102044/sertaclinux"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569172535,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569172474,"creation_date":1569172474,"question_id":58051612,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051612","body_markdown":"Hello i have one question, im downloaded [this][1] barcode reader example project from github \r\n but do you help me how to transfer barcode result to another class.

first thought I have is, do you really want to include ```cbind``` in\r\n```\r\nnames &lt;- cbind(c(&quot;w.one&quot;,&quot;w.two&quot;,&quot;w.three&quot;))\r\n```\r\n\r\nsince his turns ```names``` into a 3x1 matrix, so if ```BatchGetSymbols``` is generating vectors/lists of varying lengths you have a problem because they won&#39;t &#39;fit&#39; in the matrix?\r\n\r\nSuppose you removed ```cbind``` so that ```names``` is just a vector of the names you want, i.e.\r\n```\r\nnames &lt;- c(&quot;w.one&quot;,&quot;w.two&quot;,&quot;w.three&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can use ```assign``` inside the for loop to define the new variables using whatever variable names you&#39;ve defined in vector ```names```:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor(i in 1:length(names)){\r\n    assign(names[i], BatchGetSymbols( … ))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you type ```ls()``` you now see ```w.one```, ```w.two``` and ```w.three``` defined in your workspace...  \r\n\r\nI assume ```BatchGetSymbols( … )``` is generating lists?  If so, then these three new variables will also be defined as lists, but if vectors then you can use ```as.list(BatchGetSymbols(…))``` inside the for loop if you really want to force them to be lists.\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps a bit.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051589/how-to-loop-a-function-and-generate-3-separate-lists-in-r/58052434#58052434","title":"How to loop a function and generate 3 separate lists in R"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12079842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/344a19f278601c8e2dbbd0739ecaf8c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RNewbie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079842/rnewbie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569186324,"post_id":58052501,"comment_id":102504707,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051589/how-to-loop-a-function-and-generate-3-separate-lists-in-r/58052501#comment102504707_58052501"},{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":3286743,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4dc2f1d439265d626302a5a811c1a4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3286743/robert"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12079842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/344a19f278601c8e2dbbd0739ecaf8c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RNewbie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079842/rnewbie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569234044,"post_id":58052501,"comment_id":102517272,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051589/how-to-loop-a-function-and-generate-3-separate-lists-in-r/58052501#comment102517272_58052501"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":3286743,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4dc2f1d439265d626302a5a811c1a4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3286743/robert"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569178730,"creation_date":1569178730,"answer_id":58052501,"question_id":58051589,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58052501","body_markdown":"To accomplish this you can use the `assign` function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor(i in 1 : length(names)){\r\n    assign(names[i], BatchGetSymbols(tickers = &quot;FB&quot;, first.date = holdingperiod[i], last.date = holdingperiod[i+1], do.cache = FALSE, freq.data = &quot;daily&quot;))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it would be more helpful to have have a list (e.g. `w`) containing the three downloaded data sets:\r\n\r\n```\r\nw &lt;- lapply(\r\n    1:3, \r\n    function(i) {\r\n        BatchGetSymbols(tickers = &quot;FB&quot;, first.date = holdingperiod[i], last.date = holdingperiod[i+1], do.cache = FALSE, freq.data = &quot;daily)\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis makes it possible to `lapply`/`purrr` over `w`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051589/how-to-loop-a-function-and-generate-3-separate-lists-in-r/58052501#58052501","title":"How to loop a function and generate 3 separate lists in R"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12079842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/344a19f278601c8e2dbbd0739ecaf8c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RNewbie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079842/rnewbie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12079842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/344a19f278601c8e2dbbd0739ecaf8c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RNewbie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079842/rnewbie"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58052434,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569178730,"creation_date":1569172345,"last_edit_date":1569172831,"question_id":58051589,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051589","body_markdown":"I would like to download daily prices for three months with the BatchGetSymbols function.

Only if yes, you have two values of which not both are smaller or both are bigger than q. This is the prerequisite for your test, which one of both has the smaller distance to `q`.  \r\nNow, depending on which one is closer to `q`, the function returns `sum` or `sum - e`.\r\n\r\nNow that I use here the verb _return_ while using _yield_ in the code: it&#39;s not a usual function but a [_generator_](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators). The main clue about this type of functions is, when they _yield_ a value, you can think in a first step of the same like returning a value, with one important difference: the _function_ itself does not _return_ (i.e. does not end), but falls asleep, waiting for its next call, keeping its complete state including all the values calculated up to now, to then proceed right in the next line after _yield_, as if nothing happened before - until the next _yield_ keyword.\r\n\r\nIn short: IMO exactly what you need if you want to sum up _until whatever_ but do not really want to stop when _whatever_ is reached... :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051581/sum-of-the-elements-of-a-list-until-limit/58052893#58052893","title":"sum of the elements of a list until limit"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12097553,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2536604c5e51c9385af447ce543988bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LeLionJaune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097553/lelionjaune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569274656,"post_id":58058044,"comment_id":102536588,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051581/sum-of-the-elements-of-a-list-until-limit/58058044#comment102536588_58058044"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7348,"user_id":8300135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0eaa9ded8087b3af42dd463c95696733?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SpghttCd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8300135/spghttcd"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7348,"user_id":8300135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0eaa9ded8087b3af42dd463c95696733?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SpghttCd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8300135/spghttcd"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569256840,"last_edit_date":1569256840,"creation_date":1569225805,"answer_id":58058044,"question_id":58051581,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58058044","body_markdown":"Just my point of view to the problem, as stated in my comment below your question:\r\n\r\n_An algorithm, which calculates the number of needed orders of fixed quantities per order for every period, such that the demand is always covered.  \r\nAdditionally the rest of every order, which was not covered in a certain period, is considered, so that eventually the demand of the next period can be covered with one order less._\r\n\r\n    def calcOrder(demand, Q):\r\n        result = []\r\n        rest = 0\r\n        for i, e in enumerate(demand):\r\n            current = e - rest\r\n            order = np.ceil(current/Q)\r\n            result.append(int(order))\r\n            rest = order * Q - current\r\n        return result\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    np.random.seed(793)\r\n    \r\n    demand = np.random.randint(0, 51, 5)\r\n    Q = 12\r\n    \r\n    demand\r\n    # array([50, 20, 19, 48, 25])\r\n    \r\n    print(f&#39;demand\\tcurrent\\torder\\trest&#39;)\r\n    rest = 0\r\n    for i, e in enumerate(demand):\r\n        current = e - rest\r\n        order = int(np.ceil(current/Q))\r\n        rest = order * Q - current\r\n        print(f&#39;{e}\\t{current}\\t{order}\\t{rest}&#39;)\r\n\r\n    # demand  current order   rest\r\n    # 50      50      5       10\r\n    # 20      10      1       2\r\n    # 19      17      2       7\r\n    # 48      41      4       7\r\n    # 25      18      2       6\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051581/sum-of-the-elements-of-a-list-until-limit/58058044#58058044","title":"sum of the elements of a list until limit"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12097553,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2536604c5e51c9385af447ce543988bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LeLionJaune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097553/lelionjaune"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12097553,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2536604c5e51c9385af447ce543988bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LeLionJaune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097553/lelionjaune"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569273922,"creation_date":1569172303,"last_edit_date":1569273922,"question_id":58051581,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051581","body_markdown":"I am facing a problem where I need my code to add the element of a list until the sum gets as close as possible to a constant.

If you wish to test it if it really does, what it is supposed to do, you need to &#39;wrap&#39; it in a bigger device, to be able to send signals to your &#39;device under test&#39;.\r\nThis is often done with the use of testbenches - a vhdl code that uses your entity as a component and sends signals to it.\r\n\r\nNext thing to note is that any time specific commands (like &#39;AFTER&#39; in your case) are not synthesizable. However you can simulate behaviour of your design using software tools, like modelsim.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that you cannot assign values to input. Input ports receive data from &#39;outside world&#39;, you cannot alter the data your entity receives from within the entity itself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051560/error-10568-vhdl-error-at-questao1-vhd44-cant-write-to-interface-object/58079969#58079969","title":"Error (10568): VHDL error at Questao1.vhd(44): can&#39;t write to interface object &quot;dataa&quot; of mode IN"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11948655,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7mXEzHSGA8s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHfQ/PcdSb2TRU0Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Igor Bagio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11948655/igor-bagio"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1569326772,"creation_date":1569172183,"question_id":58051560,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58051560","body_markdown":"That&#39;s my code:\r\n\r\n    -- Insert library and use clauses\r\n    LIBRARY IEEE;\r\n    USE IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;\r\n    USE IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL;\r\n    \r\n    ENTITY Questao1 IS\r\n    \t-- Begin port declaration\r\n    \tPORT (  \r\n    \t\t-- Declare data inputs &quot;dataa&quot; and &quot;datab&quot;\r\n    \t\tdataa, datab : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (15 DOWNTO 0);\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\t-- Declare data output &quot;sum&quot;\r\n    \t\tsum : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (15 DOWNTO 0)\r\n    \t);\r\n    -- End entity \r\n    END ENTITY Questao1;\r\n    \r\n    --   Begin architecture \r\n    ARCHITECTURE logic OF Questao1 IS\r\n    BEGIN\r\n    \r\n    \tsum &lt;= x&quot;000A&quot; WHEN dataa = x&quot;0001&quot; ELSE x&quot;000B&quot; WHEN datab = x&quot;0001&quot; ELSE x&quot;000C&quot;;\r\n    \t\r\n    \r\n    \tdataa &lt;= x&quot;0001&quot;, x&quot;0000&quot; AFTER 20 NS, x&quot;000A&quot; AFTER 30 NS;\r\n    \tdatab &lt;= x&quot;0000&quot;, x&quot;0001&quot; AFTER 20 NS, x&quot;0005&quot; AFTER 30 NS;\r\n    \r\n    -- End architecture\r\n    END ARCHITECTURE logic;\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s my error:\r\n\r\nError (10568): VHDL error at Questao1.vhd(44): can&#39;t write to interface object &quot;dataa&quot; of mode IN\r\n\r\nSomeone can help?
