Why it is not just the thread dying but it also kills the main process (My guess is because of unhandled exception?). I searched for a ways to handle threading but it seems that the solutions I found do not work in my case ( the solution waw to put everything in try-except block).\r\n\r\n**Edit**:\r\nI found that the problem comes from exception thrown from c# iterator (yield). Apparently, send_signal method is using a c# lib that is added as reference.

Once the main thread running the `subprocess` receives a `returncode`, it exits the context manager, calling the `__exit__()` method of the `StreamLogger`, which is inherited from `IOBase` (source code [here][1]). And this calls `close()` which changes the `self._run` attribute to `False`. This causes the thread that is polling the pipe to stop looping, regardless of what is still coming through the pipe.\r\n\r\nThis works fine for most commands with small to moderate outputs to `stdout`, where there is no lag time between the `returncode` returning and the output being written. But in my case I&#39;m running a program through `subprocess` with a substantial amount of text written to `stdout`. So there&#39;s a kind of race against time to try and get the pipe cleared before the main thread tells the child thread to stop polling the pipe. \r\n\r\nThe two critical variables here are the size of the buffer being read from the pipe and the frequency at which the pipe is polled. I fixed my problem by increasing the buffer size in `os.read()` to 4096, and also removing the `time.sleep()` in the `while` loop in the `_flusher()` method. This maximizes the amount of data that can be read from the pipe and in my case ensures the output is fully logged before the logging loop stops.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://pythonhosted.org/experimentdb/_modules/io.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137972/truncated-output-log-files-when-logging-stdout-and-stderr-separately/58182905#58182905","title":"Truncated output log files when logging stdout and stderr separately"}],"owner":{"reputation":1055,"user_id":4844311,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/332eea05adde1e0fd9e1ece954f61b41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"berkelem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4844311/berkelem"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58182905,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569926099,"creation_date":1569600038,"question_id":58137972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137972","body_markdown":"I have set up a subprocess command within a context manager that pipes the stdout and stderr to separate files via my own logger. This is a variation on the answer given here:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/4838875/4844311\r\n\r\nMy code is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport logging\r\nimport subprocess\r\n\r\nwith StreamLogger(logging.DEBUG, my_out_logger) as out:\r\n    with StreamLogger(logging.ERROR, my_err_logger) as err:\r\n        p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=False, stdout=out, stderr=err)\r\n        p.communicate()\r\n        p.wait()\r\n```\r\nwhere `my_out_logger` and `my_err_logger` are logging objects with handles that log to files etc.\r\n\r\nThe StreamLogger code is similar to the code given at the link above:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport io\r\nimport os\r\nimport threading\r\nimport select\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nclass StreamLogger(io.IOBase):\r\n    def __init__(self, level, logger):\r\n        self.logger = logger\r\n        self.level = level\r\n        self.pipe = os.pipe()\r\n        self.thread = threading.Thread(target=self._flusher)\r\n        self.thread.start()\r\n\r\n    def _flusher(self):\r\n        self._run = True\r\n        buf = b&#39;&#39;\r\n        while self._run:\r\n            for fh in select.select([self.pipe[0]], [], [], 0)[0]:\r\n                buf += os.read(fh, 1024)\r\n                while b&#39;\\n&#39; in buf:\r\n                    data, buf = buf.split(b&#39;\\n&#39;, 1)\r\n                    self.write(data.decode())\r\n            time.sleep(0.01)\r\n        self._run = None\r\n\r\n    def write(self, data):\r\n        return self.logger.log(self.level, data)\r\n\r\n    def fileno(self):\r\n        return self.pipe[1]\r\n\r\n    def close(self):\r\n        if self._run:\r\n            self._run = False\r\n            while self._run is not None:\r\n                time.sleep(0.01)\r\n            os.close(self.pipe[0])\r\n            os.close(self.pipe[1])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only significant difference between my code and the code provided by the answer at the link above is that my code sends the logging message to a logger that redirects according to its handles rather than logging directly, as in the code at the link.\r\n\r\nThis code all works fine most of the time.\r\n\r\nBut I have noticed that every so often there is a truncated output logging file. It looks like the output file being written by a `FileHandler` in `my_out_logger` is being closed before all the stdout content has been written.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why this is happening or where to fix the code. For now I have just added a `time.sleep(0.3)` statement between `p.communicate()` and `p.wait()` and this reduced the frequency of truncated files, but it seems like an ugly solution.\r\n\r\nI would rather understand what is going wrong and fix it properly. I welcome any suggestions or insight.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137972/truncated-output-log-files-when-logging-stdout-and-stderr-separately","title":"Truncated output log files when logging stdout and stderr separately"},{"tags":["spring-boot","docker","kubernetes","localhost","portforwarding"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":26349,"user_id":10008173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3ea5d6d5d63e054acb8cfa95a39240d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David Maze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10008173/david-maze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569603903,"post_id":58137971,"comment_id":102664025,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137971/how-can-i-use-the-port-of-a-server-running-on-localhost-in-kubernetes-running-sp#comment102664025_58137971"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8148678,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KfNpa9dZyao/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJi0/zddkFoXeglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Suveen Kumar Vundavalli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8148678/suveen-kumar-vundavalli"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":26349,"user_id":10008173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3ea5d6d5d63e054acb8cfa95a39240d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David Maze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10008173/david-maze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569623570,"post_id":58137971,"comment_id":102669988,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137971/how-can-i-use-the-port-of-a-server-running-on-localhost-in-kubernetes-running-sp#comment102669988_58137971"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8148678,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KfNpa9dZyao/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJi0/zddkFoXeglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Suveen Kumar Vundavalli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8148678/suveen-kumar-vundavalli"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":26349,"user_id":10008173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3ea5d6d5d63e054acb8cfa95a39240d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David Maze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10008173/david-maze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569623746,"post_id":58137971,"comment_id":102670028,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137971/how-can-i-use-the-port-of-a-server-running-on-localhost-in-kubernetes-running-sp#comment102670028_58137971"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8148678,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KfNpa9dZyao/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJi0/zddkFoXeglQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Suveen Kumar Vundavalli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8148678/suveen-kumar-vundavalli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569623911,"post_id":58138526,"comment_id":102670058,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137971/how-can-i-use-the-port-of-a-server-running-on-localhost-in-kubernetes-running-sp/58138526#comment102670058_58138526"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4705,"user_id":4812170,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oHM1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"vaquar khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4812170/vaquar-khan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569602497,"creation_date":1569602497,"answer_id":58138526,"question_id":58137971,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58138526","body_markdown":"1) Inside your application.properties define \r\n\r\n     server.port=8000\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Create Dockerfile \r\n\r\n\r\n    # Start with a base image containing Java runtime (mine java 8)\r\n    FROM openjdk:8u212-jdk-slim\r\n    # Add Maintainer Info\r\n    LABEL maintainer=&quot;vaquar.khan@gmail.com&quot;\r\n    # Add a volume pointing to /tmp\r\n    VOLUME /tmp\r\n    # Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container\r\n    EXPOSE 8080\r\n    # The application&#39;s jar file (when packaged)\r\n    ARG JAR_FILE=target/codestatebkend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n    # Add the application&#39;s jar to the container\r\n    ADD ${JAR_FILE} codestatebkend.jar\r\n    # Run the jar file \r\n    ENTRYPOINT [&quot;java&quot;,&quot;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom&quot;,&quot;-jar&quot;,&quot;/codestatebkend.jar&quot;]\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Make sure docker is working fine \r\n\r\n           docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \r\n\r\n4) \r\n\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/\r\n\r\nuse following command to find the pod name\r\n\r\n     kubectl get pods \r\n\r\nthen\r\n  \r\n      kubectl port-forward &lt;pod-name&gt;

at a certain period. However, I found an issue of missing data on some of the source files, and I need to fix it.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s easier to explain this with an example:\r\n\r\nThe files are all imported into a single tibble that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    df.data %&gt;% head()\r\n    \r\n    ### A tibble: 6 x 2\r\n    ##  ID     REPORT_DATE\r\n    ##  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;       \r\n    ##1 9495   2019-08-14   \r\n    ##2 1678   2019-08-14   \r\n    ##3 0944   2019-08-14   \r\n    ##4 6046   2019-08-14   \r\n    ##5 7758   2019-08-14   \r\n    ##6 2403   2019-08-14   \r\n\r\nAfter importing, I create a pivot table that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    df.pivot &lt;- df.data %&gt;% select(ID, REPORT_DATE) %&gt;% \r\n      mutate(IN_REPORT=1) %&gt;% arrange(ID, REPORT_DATE) %&gt;% \r\n      spread(REPORT_DATE, IN_REPORT, fill=0) %&gt;% head()\r\n\r\n    print(df.pivot %&gt;% head)\r\n\r\n    ### A tibble: 6 x 8\r\n    ##  ID     `2019-08-14` `2019-08-21` `2019-08-28` `2019-09-04` `2019-09-11` `2019-09-18` `2019-09-25`\r\n    ##  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\r\n    ##1 8123            1            1            1            1            1            1            1\r\n    ##2 0236            1            1            1            1            1            1            1\r\n    ##3 0624            1            1            1            1            1            1            1\r\n    ##4 1278            1            1            1            1            1            1            1\r\n    ##5 2870            1            1            1            0            0            0            0\r\n    ##6 5469            1            1            1            1            1            1            1\r\n\r\nA value of `1` in a column implies that the ID is &quot;alive&quot;, and a value of `0` implies that the ID is &quot;not alive&quot; (either because it hasn&#39;t &quot;been born&quot; or because it has &quot;died&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would work like a charm if each &quot;alive&quot; `ID` was present in each report. However, I&#39;ve found that some IDs are missing, and they look like this:\r\n\r\n    print(df.pivot %&gt;% \r\n      filter(ID %in% c(&#39;3989&#39;, &#39;4188&#39;, &#39;9941&#39;, &#39;8996&#39;)))\r\n    \r\n    ### A tibble: 4 x 8\r\n    ##  ID    `2019-08-14` `2019-08-21` `2019-08-28` `2019-09-04` `2019-09-11` `2019-09-18` `2019-09-25`\r\n    ##  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\r\n    ##1 4188             1            1            0            0            1            1            1\r\n    ##2 9941             1            1            1            0            1            1            1\r\n    ##3 3989             1            0            0            1            1            1            1\r\n    ##4 8996             1            1            1            0            0            0            1\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s take ID `3989` for example: It&#39;s present in the `2019-08-14` report, it&#39;s missing the following two reports, and then it reapears in the reports from `2019-09-04` onwards.\r\n\r\nWhat I need, specifically, is, for each row:\r\n\r\n1.

I tried following the Codenvy git documentation, but they provided no info on what to fill into the `&lt;HOST_IP&gt;`, `&lt;SERVER_PORT&gt;`, `&lt;CHE_HOST_IP&gt;`, `yourClientSecret`, and `yourClientID` parameters. I have followed many online tutorials trying to connect my Codenvy App to GitHub, and none of them have been successful. I cannot seem to find one definitive way to do this.

Try to merge remote changes using pull, and then push again.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `git pull origin master` I get the following:\r\n\r\n    error: Pulling is not possible because you have unmerged files.\r\n    hint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use &#39;git add/rm &lt;file&gt;&#39;\r\n    hint: as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.`\r\n**Fix:**\r\nI ran the command `git reset --hard HEAD` and then `git push -u origin --all`.

   x = 1  OR  x = 2\r\n\r\nis turned into this by the Optimizer:\r\n\r\n    x IN (1,2)\r\n\r\nThe use of the `DATE()` function is unnecessary in `date(&#39;2019-08-01&#39;)`.  The string is fine by itself.

is a great Python package for interactive visualization. My feelings with this library is that it is great when it comes to structure data analysis but when it comes to unstructured data like images and videos it is not so great. \r\n\r\nAs a work around, if there is a need to show images when working with Dash, I use matplotlib library. I show the following example to make my point clear:\r\n\r\n          @app.callback([Output(&quot;id_badframe_video&quot;, &quot;children&quot;)],\r\n                          [Input(&quot;id_generate_badframe_video_button&quot;,&quot;n_clicks&quot;)],\r\n                          [State(&quot;id_dataset_name_list&quot;,&quot;value&quot;),\r\n                           State(&#39;id_video_name_list&#39;,&#39;value&#39;),\r\n    State(&#39;id_video_index_list&#39;, &#39;value&#39;])\r\n            def generate_bad_video(nclick, dataset_name, video_name, frame_index):\r\n                if nclick:\r\n                img = read_image(dataset_name, video_name, frame_index)\r\n                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n                plt.close()\r\n                fig, ax = plt.subplots(1) \r\n                ax.imshow(img, cmap=&#39;gray&#39;)\r\nIn the above code, I want to demonstrate an image based on the user&#39;s inputs: dataset name, video name and video index. Then when I press `Show Image` button, then the image will be shown in a separated window (not within http://127.0.0.1:8050/). At the beginning I thought it was a great idea, but then I found after showing several images the program will crash with the following error messages:\r\n\r\n    Error on request:\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;/home/lib/python2.7/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py&quot;, line 303, in run_wsgi\r\n        execute(self.server.app)\r\n      File &quot;/home/lib/python2.7/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py&quot;, line 294, in execute\r\n        write(data)\r\n      File &quot;/home/lib/python2.7/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py&quot;, line 257, in write\r\n        self.send_header(key, value)\r\n      File &quot;/home/lib/python2.7/BaseHTTPServer.py&quot;, line 412, in send_header\r\n        self.wfile.write(&quot;%s: %s\\r\\n&quot; % (keyword, value))\r\n    IOError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe\r\n    Tcl_AsyncDelete: cannot find async handler\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to solve this problem?

However, the details might shed some more light on the problem, so here I will include are the exact details of my current scenario:\r\n\r\nThe desired input to my script is actually the output stream from a utility called `fs_usage`, it&#39;s similar to utilities like `ps`, but provides a constant stream of system calls and filesystem operations. It tells you which files are being read from, written to, etc. in real time.\r\n\r\nFrom the manual:\r\n&gt; NAME  \r\n&gt;      `fs_usage` -- report system calls and page faults related to filesystem activity in real-time\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; DESCRIPTION  \r\n&gt;      The fs_usage utility presents an ongoing display of system call usage information pertaining to filesystem activity.  It requires root privileges due to the kernel tracing facility it uses to operate.  \r\n\r\n&gt;  By default, the activity monitored includes all system processes except for:  \r\n`fs_usage`, `Terminal.app`, `telnetd`, `telnet`, `sshd`, `rlogind`, `tcsh`, `csh`, `sh`, `zsh`.

have python classes which should be dynamically loaded during run-time.

when trying to `pop` from `validated_data`, in other words `validated_data` doesn&#39;t contain `racecars`.\r\n\r\nI can do the logic in the create method on the view, but this seems the more sensible place to do it and I want to know what I&#39;m doing wrong.\r\n\r\nThe setup is as follows:\r\n\r\n**models.py**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass Driver(models.Model):\r\n    name =

The Crystal Reports engine is very particular about the order of certain events, and this is one of those cases. In my original `PrepareReport()` method, I had the calls to the `.Refresh()` and `.VerifyDatabase()` methods executing last. This (apparently) effectively &quot;resets&quot; the parameters/data source, so everything I had above it was basically nullified.\r\n\r\nSo, I went back through some older code to look at how I&#39;ve worked with individual Crystal Reports in the past and found that calling the `.Refresh()` and `.VerifyDatabase()` methods prior to attempting to set parameter and/or formula values seems to work as expected, so I moved those two lines up in the `PrepareReport()` code and tried again. It all seemed to work correctly. Several tests later, and the order of execution appears to be the culprit here. Now my `PrepareReport()` method looks like this:\r\n\r\n```vb.net\r\nPrivate Sub PrepareReport()\r\n\tIf Not Me.CRReportFile Is Nothing Then\r\n\t\tMe.CrystalReport = New CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument\r\n\t\tMe.CrystalReport.Load(Me.CRReportFile.FullName)\r\n\t\tMe.CrystalReport.DataSourceConnections.Clear()\r\n\t\tSetReportConnectionInfo()\r\n\r\n        &#39;MOVED THIS UP IN THE EXECUTION ORDER\r\n\t\tMe.CrystalReport.Refresh()\r\n\t\tMe.CrystalReport.ReportClientDocument.VerifyDatabase()\r\n\r\n\t\tIf Me.ReportFormulas.Count &gt; 0 Then\r\n\t\t\tFor Each Formula As CRFormula In Me.ReportFormulas\r\n\t\t\t\tFormula.UpdateFormulaField(Me.CrystalReport)\r\n\t\t\tNext Formula\r\n\t\tEnd If\r\n\r\n\t\tIf Me.ReportParameters.Count &gt; 0 Then\r\n\t\t\tFor Each Parameter As CRParameter In Me.ReportParameters\r\n\t\t\t\tParameter.UpdateReportParameter(Me.CrystalReport)\r\n\t\t\tNext Parameter\r\n\t\tEnd If\r\n\r\n        &#39; THE REFRESH() &amp; VERIFYDATABASE() METHOD CALLS USED TO BE DOWN HERE\r\n\tEnd If\r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n### TL;DR VERSION FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL INFO\r\n*A couple of other things I tried while troubleshooting, none of which resulted in complete success, although some produced varying degrees:*\r\n\r\n* I tried disposing of the base object with `MyBase.Dispose()` (*Obviously this was a bad idea*). Of course, I couldn&#39;t instantiate a new base object without entirely recreating the `CRReport` object, which was what I was trying to avoid in the first place.\r\n* I removed the inheritance from the class and created a private variable for a `CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument` object that could be instantiated independently of my class. Even though it may seem unnecessary, this actually wasn&#39;t a *horrible* idea as I&#39;ll explain later.\r\n* I tried several other variations of code placement that failed in one way or another.\r\n\r\nSince everything seems to be working now with the revised `PrepareReport()` code, I&#39;ve done a bit of refactoring. Instead of calling this method multiple times (once at instantiation and once at report generation), I removed the calls from the constructors and put a single call to it in the `GenerateReport()` method.\r\n\r\n### A SLIGHT &quot;HICCUP&quot;\r\nI did some additional testing using the `ShowReport()` method (display it on the screen instead of printing it on paper), and there was some &quot;weirdness&quot;, so I had to make adjustments. In my calling method (the button click event), I tried to dispose of the `CRReport` object after generating all of the reports, but that caused me not to be able to switch pages after the reports were generated/displayed (I got a `NullReferenceException` - `Object reference not set to an instance of an object`). A minor tweak later, and I could get the reports to stay instantiated but, due to the data set being overridden by later iterations, it wasn&#39;t always showing the correct data in each window.\r\n\r\nThis is where my removing of the inheritance comes into play. I created a private `CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument` object for the class that could be reinstantiated and passed around a bit that would retain only the data associated with that particular instance of the report. I refactored the code for the `CRReport`, `CRParameter`, and `CRFormula` objects to use that new private variable instead, and everything looks like it&#39;s behaving exactly as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## HERE&#39;S THE FULL REVISED CODE\r\n*Please remember, not all of this has been fully tested. I&#39;ve yet to test the `ExportReport()` method b/c I need to clean up a couple of things there, and the `EmailReport()` method has a long way to go. I&#39;ve only tested it with the ADO.NET `DataSet` during this run, although the code used for XML and PostgreSQL has worked in the past.*\r\n\r\n### REPORT OBJECT (`CRReport`)\r\n```vb.net\r\nPublic

created a library in an attempt to handle all of the &quot;quirks&quot; of using Crystal Reports in a Visual Studio (VB.NET) project. I&#39;ve pulled together all the elements that have presented challenges to me in the past - setting/updating parameter and formula values, printing (including page ranges), and setting logon credentials - and put them into reusable methods that all seem to work well when I generate the reports individually. \r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;ve run into a scenario where I want to reuse the same report object in a loop to print multiple variations with different data sets/parameter(s) so that I can &quot;easily&quot; reuse the same printer settings and other options without re-prompting the user for each iteration. In this case, I&#39;m working with an internally built `DataSet` object (built by someone other than me) and my Crystal Report file&#39;s Data Source is pointing to the `.xsd` file for structure.\r\n\r\n***EDIT:** Forgot to mention that the report was created in CR Developer v11.5.12.1838 and the VB.NET library project is targetting the 4.7.2 .NET framework and using the v13.0.3500.0 (runtime v2.0.50727) of the Crystal libraries.*\r\n\r\nMy intent is/was to instantiate a new report object outside the loop, then just re-set and refresh the report&#39;s data source and parameter values on each iteration of the loop. Unfortunately, it seems that if I do it this way, the report won&#39;t correctly pick up either the parameter values, the updated data source, or both. I&#39;ve been trying several variations of code placement (because I know that the order in which things are done is *very* important to the Crystal Reports engine), but none of it seems to work the way I believe it should.\r\n\r\nIf I instantiate a new report object ***inside*** the loop, it will correctly generate the reports for each iteration with the correct data source and parameter values. Of course, it resets all of the internal properties of my class to &quot;default&quot;, which kinda defeats the purpose. (*Yes, I know I could pass additional/other parameters to a constructor to achieve the effect, but that seems an extremely &quot;brute-force&quot; solution, and I&#39;d much rather get it to work the way I have in mind*).\r\n\r\n---\r\n#**AND NOW FOR SOME CODE**\r\n\r\nHere is a pared-down/obfuscated version of the most recent iteration of the calling method (currently a part of a button click event handler). Every attempt I&#39;ve made to instantiate a reusable object seems to result in *some* sort of failure. In *this* version, it loads the report and correctly passes along the parameter value, but the data source is completely empty resulting in a blank report. In other variations (I&#39;ve discarded that code now), when I actually try to print/export/show the report, it fails with a COM exception: `Missing parameter values`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using the `.Refresh` and `.ReportClientDocument.VerifyDatabase` methods separately, but those don&#39;t make a difference. When I check the parameters at runtime, it *appears* that the CR parameter/value and query results have been populated, but any method that makes any changes after the initialization just seems to &quot;break&quot; the report.\r\n```vb.net\r\n        Dim ReportName As String = &quot;\\\\SERVERNAME\\Applications\\Reports\\ClientActiveCustomerSummary.rpt&quot;\r\n        Dim Report As Common.CRReport = Nothing\r\n\r\n        Try\r\n            ReportData = ClientDataSet.Tables(&quot;ActiveSummary&quot;).Copy\r\n            ReportData = GetClientActiveSummaryData\r\n        Catch ex As Exception\r\n            MessageBox.Show(ex.Message &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf &amp;\r\n                &quot;Error while retrieving client customer summary report data.&quot;,\r\n                &quot;ERROR&quot;, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error)\r\n        End Try\r\n\r\n       If ReportData.Rows.Count &gt; 0 Then\r\n            Report = New Common.CRReport(Common.CRReport.ReportSourceType.ADODataSet, New IO.FileInfo(ReportName), ClientDataSet)\r\n\r\n            For Each LVItem As ListViewItem In checkItemsMP\r\n                Dim ClientQuery = From ap In ReportData.AsEnumerable\r\n                               Where ap.Field(Of Object)(&quot;mp&quot;) = LVItem.SubItems(&quot;mp&quot;).Text\r\n                               Order By ap.Field(Of Object)(&quot;customername&quot;)\r\n                               Select ap\r\n\r\n                ClientDataSet.Tables(&quot;ActiveSummary&quot;).Merge(ClientQuery.CopyToDataTable)\r\n                Report.ReportParameters.Clear()\r\n                Report.AddReportParameter(&quot;ClientName&quot;, LVItem.SubItems(&quot;clientname&quot;).Text)\r\n                Report.GenerateReport()\r\n                ClientDataSet.Tables(&quot;ActiveSummary&quot;).Clear()\r\n                ClientQuery = Nothing\r\n            Next LVItem\r\n\r\n            For Each LVItem As ListViewItem In checkItemsBN\r\n                Dim BranchName As String = LVItem.SubItems(&quot;clientname&quot;).Text &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; LVItem.SubItems(&quot;branchname&quot;).Text\r\n                Dim BranchQuery = From ap In ReportData.AsEnumerable\r\n                               Where (ap.Field(Of Object)(&quot;clientname&quot;) &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; ap.Field(Of Object)(&quot;branchname&quot;)) = BranchName\r\n                               Order By ap.Field(Of Object)(&quot;customername&quot;)\r\n                               Select ap\r\n\r\n                ClientDataSet.Tables(&quot;ActiveSummary&quot;).Merge(BranchQuery.CopyToDataTable)\r\n                Report.ReportParameters.Clear()\r\n                Report.AddReportParameter(&quot;ClientName&quot;, BranchName)\r\n                Report.GenerateReport()\r\n                ClientDataSet.Tables(&quot;ActiveSummary&quot;).Clear()\r\n                BranchQuery = Nothing\r\n            Next LVItem\r\n        Else\r\n            MessageBox.Show(&quot;NO RECORDS FOUND&quot;, &quot;Information&quot;, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information)\r\n            ReportData.Dispose()\r\n            ReportData = Nothing\r\n        End If\r\n```\r\nObviously, in this case, I&#39;m passing in an ADO.NET `DataSet` object and using a value retrieved from a `ListView` on the form itself for the value of the report&#39;s single parameter. Again, if I instantiate a new `CRReport` object on each iteration of the loop, the report will create normally with the correct data and parameter value, but it prompts the user each time for the report creation options (print/show/export, then - if &quot;print&quot; is selected - again for which printer to use).\r\n\r\nAnd here is the reporting class.

faster, more efficient code.\r\n - Database data is obtained in two transactions.\r\n\t - 1) all the data on the spreadsheet (including both Column A and Column D), and \r\n\t - 2) Column A alone; this is to create a single array to use for matching.\r\n - Deco data is obtained once only - for Column D.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n - The values for Deco Column D and Database Column A are 2D arrays; in order to simplify matching, they are both &quot;flattened&quot; to 1D arrays.\r\n\t- a 2D value of `getValues()` might look like this:   \r\n[[r88], [g90], [h105], [i119], [j125], [k133], [l142], [m154], [n164]]\r\n\t- a 1D array, after &quot;flattening&quot;, would look like this:    \r\n[r88, g90, h105, i119, j125, k133, l142, m154, n164]\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n - There is a single loop based on values from Deco Column D.    \r\n  - Each value is compared to Database Column A. \r\n  - The `Indexof` method is used to find matches.\r\n  - The resulting value is the first index at which the value can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n - The relevant value from Database Column D is obtained and &quot;pushed&quot;

\r\nYou can both disable Health Checks or customize them:\r\n\r\nFor disabling you have to add the following to your `app.yaml`:\r\n\r\n`health_check:\r\n  enable_health_check: False`\r\n\r\nFor customize them you can take a look into the [Split health checks](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/reference/app-yaml#updated_health_checks). \r\n\r\nYou can customize [Liveness checks](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/reference/app-yaml#liveness_checks) request by adding an optional `liveness_check` section on you `app.yaml` file, for example:\r\n\r\n`liveness_check:\r\n    path: &quot;/liveness_check&quot;\r\n    check_interval_sec: 30\r\n    timeout_sec: 4\r\n    failure_threshold: 2\r\n    success_threshold: 2`\r\n  \r\nIn the documentation you can check the settings available for liveness checks.\r\n  \r\nIn addition, there are the [Readiness checks](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/reference/app-yaml#readiness_checks). In the same way, you can customize some settings, for example:\r\n  \r\n  `readiness_check:\r\n    path: &quot;/readiness_check&quot;\r\n    check_interval_sec: 5\r\n    timeout_sec: 4\r\n    failure_threshold: 2\r\n    success_threshold: 2\r\n    app_start_timeout_sec: 300`\r\n\r\nThe values above mentioned can be changed according to your needs. Check this values especially since App Engine Flexible takes some minutes to get the instance startup-ed, this is a remarkable difference to App Engine Standard and should not be taken lightly.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the `nginx.health_check` logs for your application, you might see health check polling happening more frequently than you have configured, due to the redundant health checkers that are also following your settings. These redundant health checkers are created automatically and you cannot configure them.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137805/app-engine-flex-deployment-health-check-fails/58140716#58140716","title":"App Engine Flex deployment health check fails"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10880133,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VU0lBMQyntQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAb0/UAD5vJCi5kA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alexander Gannouni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10880133/alexander-gannouni"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569614360,"creation_date":1569599419,"question_id":58137805,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137805","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve made a Python 3 Flask app to serve as an API proxy with gunicorn.

so you should start by changing your default `this.state` to \r\n\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      posts: []\r\n    }\r\n\r\nremember that you want to iterate over an array of data instead of iterate a string, that will throw an error if you do that, so better keep from the beginning the data type you want to use.\r\n\r\nThen you need to separate the responsibility for your `getPosts` method, maybe `getPostByType` is a better name for that, so you have\r\n\r\n    getPostByType(type) {\r\n      // if type is same as content.PostType then return it;\r\n      const nextPosts = this.state.posts.filter((content) =&gt; type === content.PostType);\r\n      this.setState({ posts: nextPosts });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand finally you can iterate over posts, like this\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n      // better use content.id if exists instead of index, this is for avoid problems \r\n      // with rerender when same index key is applied.\r\n      const posts = this.state.posts.map((content, index) =&gt; (\r\n        &lt;Col md={4} className=&quot;mb-4&quot; key={content.id ||&#160;index}&gt;\r\n          {content.title}\r\n        &lt;/Col&gt;\r\n

getting into the complexities of context and keys, a component requires a change in props or state to re-render. [To read more about state and component life-cycle, the docs have a great explanation for class components.][1]\r\n\r\nYour component does not re-render after the `onClick` event handler&#39;s call to `getPosts` because `getPosts` does not update internal component state. `getPosts` works within render because those values are being returned to React. By using `getPosts` as an `onClick` event handler, you are creating React elements and trying to return them to the window.\r\n\r\nWhat follows should be treated as psuedo code that shows how to trigger your component to render different posts:\r\n\r\n* Consider adding another key to state in your constructor,\r\n```\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n  super(props);\r\n  this.state = {\r\n    posts: &quot;&quot;,\r\n    type: null\r\n  };\r\n  this.getPosts = this.getPosts.bind(this);\r\n  this.onClick = this.onClick.bind(this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* and creating a click handler that doesn&#39;t try to return React elements\r\n```\r\nfunction onClick(evt) {\r\n  this.setState({ type: evt.target.value });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* and values to your buttons\r\n```\r\n&lt;button onClick={this.onClick} type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/button&gt;\r\n```\r\n* Now your button will update state with your new post type, causing your component to re-render:\r\n```\r\nrender() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;p&gt;\r\n        &lt;button onClick={this.onClick} type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;button onClick={this.onClick} type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;news&quot;&gt;news&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;/p&gt;\r\n      {this.getPosts()}\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content type being stored in state, you can now implement your `getPosts` call in any way that works for you. Good luck!\r\n\r\nIt strays from the question asked, but it is worth noting `componentWillMount` is being deprecated, and `componentDidMount` is a preferable life-cycle function for side-effects and asynchronous behavior.

I have a way that &quot;works&quot;, but I don&#39;t like it as I have to have some extra code on the Python side.  I have to believe this is possible.\r\n\r\nMy Python code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom ctypes import *\r\n\r\nstrarray = POINTER(c_char_p)\r\n\r\ngetStr = cdll.context.getStrings\r\ngetStr.argtypes = [c_char_p, strarray]\r\n\r\nfname = b&quot;test.ctx&quot;\r\n\r\nnames = strarray()\r\n\r\nint numStrs = getStr(fname, names)\r\n\r\nfor i in range(numStrs):\r\n    print(names[i])\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy C/C++ code:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint getStrings(char* fname, char **names)\r\n{\r\n    int count;\r\n    int strSize;\r\n    count = getNameCount();\r\n    names = (char**) malloc(sizeof(char*) * count);\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        std::string name = getName(i);\r\n        strsize = name.length() + 1;\r\n        *names = (char*) malloc(strsize *sizeof(char));\r\n        strcpy_s(*parts, strsize, name.c_str());\r\n        *names++;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return count;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to print out the `names` in Python, I get `ValueError: NULL pointer access`.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I have something that kind of works.  In the Python, if I don&#39;t use `POINTER(c_char_p)` but specify some amount of pointers like `c_char_p*4096` and remove the `malloc` from the C code, I can get the results just fine.  Ideally, though, I would like to allocate the memory on the C side.

They are presented in cells from AS to AW. Now I want every nubmer out of those 5 to be represented as an x and that previous x creates 5 xs below it and 2 xs below those as shown in the screenshot. I have been doing this by hand and it takes a lot of time, so I am wondering if this can be automated, so that when I add the next 5 numbers all the xs will just appear 2 rows under.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I need some xs turning green when a nubmer was selected that has been previously been cover by an x, and also it would be nice when the total number of the green xs would be shown in AQ cell.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDHR1.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137778/excel-formula-regarding-designating-cells-with-the-letter-x-and-green-colour-f","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"Excel formula regarding designating cells with the letter &quot;x&quot; and green colour from 5 numbers chosen out of a set consisting of 42 i a particular way"},{"tags":["angular7"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5150731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yWvgV_0F9eQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/cbriaX_jC34/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kunal kishor nirala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5150731/kunal-kishor-nirala"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571320819,"creation_date":1571320819,"answer_id":58434473,"question_id":58137776,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58434473","body_markdown":" formArrayName.at(ind).setValidators([Validators.required]);\r\n formArrayName.at(ind).updateValueAndValidity();\r\n\r\n\r\nformArrayName: is the form name.\r\nind: is the index of the particular filed, on which u want to apply the validation.\r\nupdateValueAndValidity: it is required, sometimes setValidators is reflecting, so","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137776/how-to-set-validator-in-formarary-like-formgroup/58434473#58434473","title":"how to set validator in formArary like formGroup?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5150731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yWvgV_0F9eQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/cbriaX_jC34/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kunal kishor nirala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5150731/kunal-kishor-nirala"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34301,"user_id":1647604,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":41,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de0a77110ab57284e2a8d57858f714a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"DeborahK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1647604/deborahk"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571320819,"creation_date":1569599291,"last_edit_date":1569625980,"question_id":58137776,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137776","body_markdown":"I have created a form using form array, and i want to set and clear the validation based on selecting particular value from dropdown.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137776/how-to-set-validator-in-formarary-like-formgroup","title":"how to set validator in formArary like formGroup?"},{"tags":["reactjs","webpack","react-router"],"owner":{"reputation":115,"user_id":1013518,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69f9d8b840ea19486772c69892e24b13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pingeyeg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1013518/pingeyeg"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569599269,"creation_date":1569599269,"question_id":58137771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137771","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on building a personal app to learn how to build without using the create-react-app tool, which has been pretty difficult, but I&#39;m there now.

through a DataFrame as much as possible. But because your sample is probably quite incomplete, this at least should be robust. You can use this same logic to extract the info you&#39;re looking for from the other patterns.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137763/duplicate-identify-certain-rows-in-a-pandas-dataframe/58171034#58171034","title":"Duplicate &amp;

Doing so may end up interfering with new HTML added in the future, like say, a list of navigation items.  Give each list item a specific class name, like `todoListItem` and select on that instead with `querySelectorAll(&#39;.todoListItem&#39;)`.  I also think this will be easier if you start with an empty list and populate it based on data.  In other words run everything through your addNewItem function.

All users are stored in a user table with the following informations : \r\n\r\n - login\r\n - password (NOT mandatory !)\r\n - authentication method (&#39;**LDAP**&#39; or &#39;**LOCAL**&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the authentication method is defined on &#39;LOCAL&#39;, we use the login/password define in the user table in order to authenticate it.

I am writing code to connect to a heroku web server for a chat room that allows the user to create messages and post them to a message board.  However, for some reason when I send a post request to the web server to create a new message to the database, I get an error.  \r\n\r\nHere is the code that handles the post request:\r\n```\r\n//POST
