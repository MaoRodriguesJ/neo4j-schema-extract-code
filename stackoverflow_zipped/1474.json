accessing Reuqest from other layers except the `Razor Page`, you could try `IHttpContextAccessor`.\r\n\r\nFor general way to handling user details from request, you could create a service like below:\r\n\r\n    public interface IUserService\r\n    {\r\n        IdentityUser GetUser();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class UserService:IUserService\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly

when you click on the submit button it would give you the values.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191403/how-to-get-values-from-react-fieldarray-in-formik-form-with-other-fields/58226753#58226753","title":"How to get values from react

For example, how many calls for service can I expect in a given time frame. \r\nThe function takes two parameters; a starting value of the number of ambulances in my system starting at 0 and ending at 100 ambulances. This will show the probability of zero calls for service, one call for service, three calls for service….up to 100 calls for service. Second parameter is an arrival rate number which is the past historical arrival rate in my system. \r\nThe function runs and prints out the result to my screen. I have checked the math and it appears to be correct. \r\n\r\nThis is Python 3.7 with the Anaconda distribution. \r\n\r\nMy question is this:\r\nI would like to process this data even further but I don’t know how to capture it and do more math. For example, I would like to take this list and accumulate the probability values. With an arrival rate of five, there is a cumulative probability of 61.56% of at least five calls for service, etc. \r\n\r\nA second example of how I would like to process this data is to format it as percentages and write out a text file \r\n\r\nA third example would be to process the cumulative probabilities and exclude any values higher than the 99% cumulative value (because these vanish into extremely small numbers). \r\n\r\nA fourth example would be to create a bar chart showing the probability of n calls for service.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the things I want to do with the queueing theory calculations. And there are a lot more. I am planning on writing a larger application. But I am stuck at this point. The function writes an output into my Python 3.7 console.

But I think your tables have following columns:\r\n\r\n&quot;raitings&quot; -&gt; &quot;id&quot;, &quot;description&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;, &quot;updated_at&quot;, &quot;deleted_at&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;raitingdetails&quot; -&gt; &quot;id&quot;, &quot;raiting_id&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, ...\r\n\r\nIn normal way, you need to create OneToMany relation for that 2 tables with foreign key. So in your &quot;raitingdetails&quot; migration you need to have something like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger(&#39;raiting_id&#39;)-&gt;nullable();\r\n&gt;     $table-&gt;foreign(&#39;raiting_id&#39;)-&gt;references(&#39;id&#39;)-&gt;on(&#39;raitings&#39;)-&gt;onUpdate(&#39;cascade&#39;)-&gt;onDelete(&#39;cascade&#39;);\r\n\r\nYour models are correct, but it not just cool now.. You can improve them by adding $fillable columns and FKs of relations (Note: if you&#39;re using traditional foreign key concept, like &quot;partents.id&quot;-&gt;&quot;childs.partent_id&quot;, then you can leave this part too).\r\n\r\n1. For getting all Rating details of 1 Rating, you can do this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     $rating = Rating::find($rating_id);\r\n&gt;     $rating_details_of_one = $rating-&gt;ratingdetails()-&gt;get()-&gt;toJson();\r\n\r\n2. If you want to have Rating Details for all actions, you can add Accessor in your Rating model and attach that to $appends like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     protected $appends = [ &#39;rating_details&#39; ]; public function\r\n&gt;     public function getRatingDetailsAttribute() {\r\n&gt;         return $this-&gt;ratingdetails;\r\n&gt;     }\r\n\r\nAnd in logic parts you can access like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     $ratings = Rating::find($rating_id); // this will get with their &quot;ratingdetails&quot; relation\r\nOr you can attach accessor on the fly without protected $appends and getRatingDetailsAttribute() function like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     $rating = Rating::find($rating_id);\r\n&gt;     $rating_details_of_one = $rating-&gt;setAppends([ &#39;rating_details&#39; ])-&gt;get()-&gt;toJSON();\r\n\r\n\r\n3. If you want to have some Ratings with their details, you can use something like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     $rating_details_of_many = Rating::where(&#39;description&#39;, &#39;fontawesome&#39;)-&gt;with(&#39;ratingdetails&#39;)-&gt;get()-&gt;toJson();\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191347/laravel-eloquent-one-to-many-relationship-not-working/58192138#58192138","title":"Laravel Eloquent one to many relationship not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":11037317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11f45d9750e802fc28786fa9b8ef85c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Laurent Kreps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11037317/laurent-kreps"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14067,"user_id":3965631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T7nII.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Lewis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3965631/tim-lewis"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58191836,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569963248,"creation_date":1569959068,"last_edit_date":1569959230,"question_id":58191347,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191347","body_markdown":"I&#39;m obviously missing something.

This is how I&#39;m trying to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThis is what I&#39;m doing:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndata(){\r\n    return{\r\n        users: [{\r\n        id: 1,\r\n        fname: &#39;Joe&#39;,\r\n        lname: &#39;Smith&#39;,\r\n        title: &#39;Super-Senior&#39;,\r\n        senior_id: 0,\r\n       }, {\r\n        id: 2,\r\n        fname: &#39;Bill&#39;,\r\n        lname: &#39;Simons&#39;,\r\n        title: &#39;Junior-1&#39;,\r\n        senior_id: 0,\r\n       }];\r\n    }\r\n},\r\nmethods: {\r\n  juniors(senior) {\r\n   return this.users.filter((user) =&gt;\r\n    user.senior_id == senior.id\r\n   );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the component tree:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n &lt;li v-for=&quot;chief in juniors(snr_chief)&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;child mx-1&quot;&gt;{{chief.lname}} {{chief.fname}}&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;{{chief.title}}&lt;/small&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;ul&gt;\r\n   &lt;li v-for=&quot;second in juniors(chief)&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;child mx-1&quot;&gt;{{second.lname}} {{second.fname}}&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;{{second.title}}&lt;/small&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;ul&gt;\r\n     &lt;li v-for=&quot;third in juniors(second)&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;child mx-1&quot;&gt;{{third.lname}} {{third.fname}}&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;{{third.title}}&lt;/small&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n     &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n   &lt;/li&gt;\r\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly, but of course goes as far as 3 levels down.\r\nI actually don&#39;t know how many levels deep the user may go.\r\n\r\nSo the idea is to have a recursive component but I don&#39;t know how to implement it.

On the statement `pb = *this;`, you are discarding the `B` object you created and taking ownership of the `A` object that `*this` returns.\r\n\r\nThus, inside of `main()`, `pB` ends up pointing at an invalid `B` object and tries to destruct that object when `main()` exits, which is why you end up crashing the `A` destructor.\r\n\r\nHad you used `dynamic_pointer_cast` instead of `static_pointer_cast` inside of `D::operator std::shared_ptr&lt;B&gt;()`, you would have ended up with a NULL pointer and likely crashed inside of `D::operator std::shared_ptr&lt;B&gt;()` when accessing `B::b`, instead of crashing in `main()`.\r\n\r\nYou need to fix your `operator std::shared_ptr&lt;B&gt;()` to operate on a valid instance of `B`, not on an instance of `A`.  For example:\r\n\r\n    operator std::shared_ptr&lt;B&gt;()\r\n    {\r\n        std::shared_ptr&lt;B&gt; pb = std::make_shared&lt;B&gt;();\r\n        std::shared_ptr&lt;A&gt; pa = *this;\r\n\r\n        *static_pointer_cast&lt;A&gt;(pb) = *pa; // &lt;-- copy pa-&gt;a to pb-&gt;a ...\r\n        // or: simply do this instead:\r\n        // pb-&gt;a = pa-&gt;a;\r\n\r\n        pb-&gt;b = this-&gt;x;\r\n        return pb;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191333/segmentation-fault-when-using-used-defined-conversion-operator/58191473#58191473","title":"Segmentation fault when

One issue I&#39;m running into though is each dash app appears to need its own port and create its own server. I see in creating the dash app there is the option url_base_pathname, where you can set the route. But as far as I can see you can still only host one app at a time per port.\r\n\r\nIf many people on my team have built many dashboards using dash, I&#39;d prefer for there to be one server per person at worst and preferably we&#39;d be able to code compartmentalized apps onto a single server and each would simply provide a unique route. Otherwise we could easily have 100+ servers listening on 100+ different ports which seems inefficient to say the least.\r\n\r\nThis has to be a common problem for data science teams, is this possible to do with dash? To clarify basically what I&#39;m looking for:\r\n\r\n- Person A creates a dashboard\r\n- person B creates a completely different dashboard with different data and probably a different business purpose\r\n\r\nI would want to be able to view them at [server]:[port]/dash_board_a and [server]:[port]/dash_board_b where server and port are the same for both.\r\n\r\nThank

With only one thread I currently do something like this: \r\n```\r\nint main() {\r\n  //Get random number generators\r\n  typedef std::mt19937 MyRNG;\r\n  std::random_device rd;\r\n\r\n  //seed generator\r\n  MyRNG rng;\r\n  rng.seed(rd());\r\n\r\n  //make my uniform distributions for each parameter\r\n  std::uniform_real_distribution&lt;&gt; param1(-1,1);\r\n  std::uniform_real_distribution&lt;&gt; param2(-1,1);\r\n\r\n  double x,y;\r\n  //Do my scan\r\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\r\n    x = param1(rng)\r\n    y = param2(rng)\r\n\r\n   //Do things with x and y*\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way I get a new x and y for every scan. Now I want to utilize multiple cores to do this in parallel. So I turn define a function ```void scan()``` which essentially has the same contents as my main function. I then create multiple threads and each have them run ```scan()```. But I&#39;m not sure if this is thread safe using std::thread. Will my random number generation in each thread as it currently is be independent? Can I save myself time by creating my RNGs outside of my ```void``` function?
