Actions are either conventionally routed or attribute routed. Placing a route on the controller or the action makes it attribute routed. Actions that define attribute routes cannot be reached through the conventional routes and vice-versa. **Any** route attribute on the controller makes all actions in the controller attribute routed.\r\n\r\nThe following call from your example configures a conventional routing template:\r\n\r\n&gt;     config.MapRoute(&quot;Api&quot;,&quot;api/{controller}/{action}/{id?}&quot;);\r\n\r\nHowever, you&#39;ve configured `GridFilterController` to use attribute routing by using a routing attribute (`[Route(...)]`):\r\n\r\n&gt;     [Route(&quot;api/[controller]&quot;)]\r\n    [ApiController]\r\n    public class GridFilterController : ControllerBase\r\n\r\nTo access the `ClearAllFilters` action from `/api/GridFilter/ClearAllFilters`, you have two general options:\r\n\r\n1. Change the attribute routing template to:\r\n\r\n        [Route(&quot;api/[controller]/[action]&quot;)]\r\n\r\n This means the name of the action will be included as part of the route, which is similar to the conventional routing template you&#39;ve set up.\r\n\r\n2. Remove the `[Route(...)]` attribute altogether. However, this isn&#39;t ideal, as you&#39;ll also have to remove the `[ApiController]` attribute because that [_requires_ attribute routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-3.0#attribute-routing-requirement).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147992/what-route-do-i-add-to-map-to-an-api-controller/58148094#58148094","title":"What route do I add to map to an API controller?"}],"owner":{"reputation":115,"user_id":7897881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10a69663429399cb2c423956b7de8c8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tnk479","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7897881/tnk479"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33460,"user_id":2630078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026ee7e928cc51cce92ab6e92c245ef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kirk Larkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630078/kirk-larkin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58148094,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569687586,"creation_date":1569686127,"last_edit_date":1569686921,"question_id":58147992,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147992","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve added an ApiController to my asp.net core 2.2 app and the async calls from the UI are not matching. \r\n\r\nHere are my routes in Startup.cs. \r\n\r\n    app.UseMvc(config =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        config.MapRoute(\r\n            &quot;Api&quot;,\r\n            &quot;api/{controller}/{action}/{id?}&quot;\r\n        );\r\n        \r\n        config.MapRoute(\r\n            &quot;Default&quot;, \r\n            &quot;{controller=App}/{action=Index}/{id?}&quot;\r\n        );\r\n    });\r\n\r\nHere is one of the javascript functions that&#39;s making various GET requests to the API controller. \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function clearAllFilters() {\r\n      $.get({\r\n        url: &quot;/api/GridFilter/ClearAllFilters&quot;,\r\n        contentType: &quot;application/json; charset=utf-8&quot;,\r\n        dataType: &quot;json&quot;,\r\n        success: function () {\r\n            console.log(&#39;filters cleared&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is the API controller: \r\n\r\n    [Route(&quot;api/[controller]&quot;)]\r\n    [ApiController]\r\n    public class GridFilterController : ControllerBase\r\n    {\r\n        private static readonly string[] FilterFields = {\r\n            // Bunch of strings, omitted for brevity\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        [HttpGet]\r\n        public IActionResult ClearAllFilters()\r\n        {\r\n            foreach (string column in FilterFields)\r\n            {\r\n                if (HttpContext.Session.TryGetValue(column, out byte[] savedJson))\r\n                {\r\n                    HttpContext.Session.Remove(column);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            return Ok(true);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nWhy doesn&#39;t asp.net match this?

question...trying to use CollectionView (*or I guess any other databinding control which supports selection changed commanding for items it is displaying*)...since the CollectionView has a selection mode and we can databind the selected item to a ViewModel&#39;s property (ViewModel being databound to the page in XAML), my initial thoughts were it was best to use selection command and pass in the selected item as a command parameter instead of using the selected items&#39;s property setter to initiate a push of a new model.\r\n\r\nHowever when I come back to the same page since the item is still selected (had to set the selection mode on the collection view to single) the same item can not be selected again (and you have to select another as it is selected already then come back from that one to select the first one again)...I know you could reset the selection in the ViewIsAppearing but is it the best to just use the setter of selected item to instantiate the push and would that always work better (as I think it would still be unable to repeat the same selection and the problem is back without in hacks the view model is appearing or code-behind even...)?\r\n\r\n**Is there a &quot;right&quot; way to use a collection view to make it push a new viewmodel and thus navigate to it, and then after returning back to that previous viewmodel via pop have it be selectable again, without reseting the selection in the view is appearing or code behind both of which feel like hacks to me?**\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\n    &lt;CollectionView x:Name=&quot;Menu&quot; ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding MenuItems}&quot; SelectedItem=&quot;{Binding SelectedItem}&quot; SelectionChangedCommandParameter=&quot;{Binding SelectedItem}&quot; SelectionMode=&quot;Single&quot; SelectionChangedCommand=&quot;{Binding ShowItemCommand}&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nand in the viewmodel I have:\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;MenuItemViewModel&gt; MenuItems { get; set; } \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n    public MenuItemViewModel SelectedItem { get; set; }\r\n\r\nalong with \r\n\r\n    public Command ShowItemCommand =&gt; new Command((item) =&gt; { await CoreMethods.PushPageModel&lt;MenuItemPageModel&gt;(item); });\r\n\r\n(code uses fody, so it databinds fine, but if you come back without reset same no)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147991/mvvm-way-of-setting-up-databinding-to-a-collectionview-for-page-view-model-nav","title":"MVVM way of setting up databinding to a

Then, multiply those windows with `B` for the final output. [More info on use of `as_strided` based `view_as_windows`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51890064/).\r\n\r\nHence, we will have one vectorized solution like so -\r\n\r\n    In [70]: from skimage.util.shape import view_as_windows\r\n    \r\n    In [71]: A1 = np.concatenate((A,A[:,:-1]),axis=1)\r\n    \r\n    In [74]: view_as_windows(A1,A.shape)[0]*B\r\n    Out[74]: \r\n    array([[[1, 0, 3],\r\n            [0, 0, 6]],\r\n    \r\n           [[2, 0, 1],\r\n            [0, 0, 4]],\r\n    \r\n           [[3, 0, 2],\r\n            [0, 0, 5]]])\r\n\r\nWe can also leverage `multi-cores` with [`numexpr` module](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) for the final step of `broadcasted-multiplication`, which should be better on larger arrays.

}\r\n    };\r\n#pragma warning restore\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat obviously works. Or, of course, the &quot;nullable reference types&quot;-specific version of the above:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n#nullable disable\r\n    new Program\r\n    {\r\n        NullableDictionary = { [&quot;key&quot;] = &quot;value&quot; }\r\n    };\r\n#nullable restore\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these temporarily and explicitly disable the warning in question. The null-forgiving operator does essentially this, except of course for just the specific expression it&#39;s applied to.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way to do exactly what you want. Normally the collection-initializer syntax is allowed only on actual variable declarations. The use of it in the object-initializer syntax context is a special case the language allows, based on the similarity of the scenarios, even though the generated code is very different from an actual variable initialization (and in particular, where you&#39;d in fact be initializing the variable&#39;s value at the same time as you initialize the collection).\r\n\r\nSo, by the time the compiler is dealing with your collection initializer syntax, all that the compiler has to go on is that it&#39;s generating a bunch of calls to the `Add()` method, and that these calls are being made to a reference value that might be null, according to your earlier declaration.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I find your attempt to use the null-forgiving operator there quite sensible. It would be nice if the compiler would interpret the use of the operator in that context by including that operator in each `Add()` call that it generates.\r\n\r\nYou might even be able to file a Git issue against the language and ask that that be added as a feature. It wouldn&#39;t be a breaking change, I think, since that syntax is currently just plain illegal, and allowing it wouldn&#39;t change the behavior of the compiler when you&#39;re not using that syntax.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147931/use-of-c-8-null-forgiving-operator-within-c-6-index-initializers/58176239#58176239","title":"Use of C# 8 null-forgiving operator within C# 6 index initializers"}],"owner":{"reputation":1039,"user_id":5755166,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c77d8378ae4eefe7c1a08a182f6c43ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mxscho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5755166/mxscho"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1039,"user_id":5755166,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c77d8378ae4eefe7c1a08a182f6c43ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mxscho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5755166/mxscho"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58176239,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569884464,"creation_date":1569685754,"last_edit_date":1569686321,"question_id":58147931,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147931","body_markdown":"When using an index initializer to fill a dictionary without recreating it before that, is there an option to specify the null-forgiving operator somewhere?\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n    public class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;?

All the features were the same shape as were the labels. I am simply building a prediction model for features that are one-hot encoded names such as\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;name1&quot; = [1,0,0]\r\n&quot;name2&quot; = [0,1,0]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith outcomes that are one-hot encoded too such as \r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;outcome1&quot; = [1,0,0]\r\n&quot;outcome2&quot; = [0,1,0]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked pretty well and I was able to build a lovely model that when tested worked quite well.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever once I wanted to do some feature engineering and use a numerically continuous piece of data I could not see how to combine the category and continuous data.\r\n\r\nWhat I am wanting to do is use an additional non category piece of variable data.

using these pieces of data together.\r\n\r\nInitially all my features were identically sized one hot encoded category names and my labels were one hot encoded outcomes that I wanted to predict.

Now a is { 0 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, the validity of an object is usually required for a destructor call (which cannot be avoided if the object has automatic storage duration).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147866/what-is-the-correct-way-to-call-a-move-constructors-on-the-derived-class/58160156#58160156","title":"What is the correct way to call a move constructors on the derived class?"}],"owner":{"reputation":235,"user_id":5021064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8317a437981ab0c212b7679db02eb943?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Denis Yaroshevskiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5021064/denis-yaroshevskiy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569802208,"creation_date":1569685136,"question_id":58147866,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147866","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing a piece of code that inherits from a user provided class (not for polymorphism reasons).\r\nI need to write an explicit move constructor/assignment for it because I store pointers to some internal data of my class.\r\nI don&#39;t know how to call move constructor well.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename UserType&gt;\r\n    class my_class : UserType  {\r\n      other_data data;\r\n     public:\r\n      my_class(my_class&amp;&amp;

And I want to use node as server side language. In php you just needed to write in the actual page, upload on the server and it dose what you ask..\r\n\r\nFirst we have to understand WHY PHP works like that. According to [TechTerms][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; PHP Stands for &quot;Hypertext Preprocessor.&quot; PHP is an HTML-embedded Web\r\n&gt; scripting language. This means PHP code can be inserted into the HTML\r\n&gt; of a Web page. When a PHP page is accessed, the PHP code is read or\r\n&gt; &quot;parsed&quot; by the server the page resides on. The output from the PHP\r\n&gt; functions on the page are typically returned as HTML code, which can\r\n&gt; be read by the browser. Because the PHP code is transformed into HTML\r\n&gt; before the page is loaded, users cannot view the PHP code on a page.\r\n\r\nThis of course, is the original purpose(and still is) of PHP, embedding server-side code in HTML without returning the source and only the intended output, thus it&#39;s name Hypertext **Pre**processor.&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe most classical example, is trying to return a custom message inside an HTML element:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: php --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;body&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;div&gt; Hey &lt;b&gt;&lt;?php echo $username ?&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, how are you today? &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\nThe output would look something like this:\r\n\r\n&gt; Hey **RavenMask**, how are you today?\r\n\r\nThis is PHP. There are of course, several frameworks available that do change the way you interact with PHP, like the MVC model that Laravel uses.\r\n\r\nBut now lets move on to **NodeJS**.&lt;br&gt;\r\nNode is very different from PHP, but still share equal concepts, like both being interpreted, and i believe this is where your confusion started, you probably thought that the code bellow was equivalent of PHP:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt; Hey\r\n        &lt;script&gt;\r\n          document.write(`&lt;b&gt;RavenMask&lt;/b&gt;`)\r\n        &lt;/script&gt;, how are you today? &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd in some ways, it is, for client side.&lt;br&gt;\r\nNodeJS is a server-side runtime enviroment, in a more simple-to-understand comparison, NodeJS works exactly like C, Java or C++(Node does not need a compiler like GCC thought, it works using a JIT compiler, but that&#39;s for another question).&lt;br&gt;\r\nWhile PHP is a language designed from the ground to run over a webserver and become easily embeeded on HTML, Node on the other hand is designed more like a traditional language, so, for achieving a result like PHP, a LOT of steps are required, just like you would need with C, C++, Java and any other language.\r\n\r\nIn Node, to achieve what PHP does, you would need:\r\n\r\n 1. Creating an HTTP Server.\r\n 2. Creating an templating engine to mimic what PHP does inside HTML.\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, all those steps have been already implemented in battle tested modules(and even in the native NodeJS default library!), so, the most barebones example that you can get is this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: javascript --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const http = require(&#39;http&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    // Here you&#39;re creating the HTTP server, like Apache\r\n    const server = http.createServer((request, response) =&gt; {\r\n      const username = &#39;RavenMask&#39;\r\n    \r\n      // Abuse templating strings!\r\n      // Respose.end means: Give this back to the client and end the cicle of the request\r\n      response.end(`\r\n        &lt;html&gt;\r\n            &lt;body&gt;\r\n                &lt;div&gt; Hey &lt;b&gt;${username}&lt;/b&gt;, how are you today? &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/body&gt;\r\n        &lt;/html&gt;\r\n      `)\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    // Here is where you create the event loop for the HTTP server\r\n    server.listen(3000, (err) =&gt; {\r\n      if (err) {\r\n        return console.log(&#39;something bad happened&#39;, err)\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      console.log(`server is listening`)\r\n    })\r\n\r\nGo on, save this file as index.js and on your terminal type:\r\n\r\n    node index.js\r\n\r\nThen go to localhost:3000 on your browser and voil&#225;!\r\n[![Output example on NodeJS][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThis of course, is NOT production ready, so be careful.\r\n\r\nTo wrap it up, if you&#39;re still interested in Node, the steps you need to take are:\r\n\r\n 1. Understand how Node works, including its architecture and the most important, the *event loop*.\r\n 2. Use and abuse frameworks and modules. The example i gave you above, if you tried to expand it, would cause a lot of suffering and pain due the way it&#39;s designed, but it&#39;s fine so you can learn. Using frameworks and modules, you get battle-tested, community contributed code that can make your life easier, safer and production-ready, one good example, is creating an HTTP server with the [Fastify Framework][3].\r\n 3. Don&#39;t give up: Learning a different language sure is hard, but can give you a lot of opportunities on the market and you can learn a LOT from looking things from a different angle, you usually end up acknowledging mistakes you do on another languages by looking on how things work from another.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://techterms.com/definition/php\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7EdVk.png\r\n  [3]: https://www.fastify.io/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147859/node-js-and-php-deployment/58150412#58150412","title":"Node.js and Php deployment"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11398821,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zq1wV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RavenMask","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11398821/ravenmask"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58150412,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569705807,"creation_date":1569685083,"question_id":58147859,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147859","body_markdown":"I have experience with Php from school.

The one you are asking about can be solved by understanding how to connect properly with PDO and what DSN is. For this I have to refer you to this awesome article https://phpdelusions.net/pdo#dsn\r\n\r\nTake this DSN for example:\r\n\r\n          mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test;port=3306;charset=utf8mb4\r\n    driver^    ^ colon         ^param=value pair    ^semicolon \r\n\r\nYou start by specifying which DB driver you would like to use: `mysql:`. After this comes a list of key-value pairs separated by a semicolon. The order should be host, DB name, and charset. You should specify all of these values. \r\n\r\nYour DSN is your first argument to [`PDO::__construct()`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php), the second and third is username and password respectively. The third one is an array of options.\r\n\r\nYour options array should contain at least two values. You need to enable error reporting and switch off emulated prepared statements. These are the recommended settings. \r\n\r\nYour connection should look at least similar to this:\r\n\r\n    $options = [\r\n    \t\\PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE =&gt; \\PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,\r\n    \t\\PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES =&gt; false,\r\n    ];\r\n    $this-&gt;pdo = new PDO(&#39;mysql:host=&#39;.$this-&gt;host.&#39;;dbname=&#39;.$this-&gt;database.&#39;;charset=utf8mb4&#39;, $this-&gt;user, $this-&gt;password, $options);\r\n\r\nHowever, please take note, that the constructor will be called once, and you do not need to put these values in private properties. They can simply be constants or hardcoded in the constructor. You will never need to reuse this values after opening connection. \r\n\r\nYour second main mistake is that you are referring in a lot of places to `$pdo`, but you should be using `$this-&gt;pdo`.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n- `die();` is going to end your whole script. Do not use it.\r\n- Do not catch exceptions, just to print out the error message. It defeats the whole purpose of the exceptions. \r\n- The method `bindQueryParams()` seems completely unnecessary. I would recommend you remove it. \r\n- `runQuery` is riddled with mistakes. `$pdo-&gt;execute()` takes in only one argument, which should be the array of values to be bound. There is no need for param type like in mysqli. The while loop is redundant and incorrect. \r\n- `num_rows` does not exist in PDO, and is not needed at all. \r\n- None of these method provide any benefit over just plain PDO. \r\n\r\nConclusion:  \r\nThe class you have written is completely unnecessary and only makes your code more difficult to understand and maintain. While it might have made more sense with mysqli, PDO is simpler to use and does not need to be wrapped in such class. Please read the article linked at the beginning carefully, it will help you a lot.

I figure I&#39;m able to code both the scaling and translation, probably not very efficiently, but I have no idea how to approach n-dimensional rotations.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m open to either the array format below or each &#39;coordinate&#39; having its own array where each element is a different dimension or anything really that&#39;ll make this work.\r\n\r\nFor example, an input array may look like ```[[1,2,3], [1,2,3]]``` which is 2 dimensional, and a transformation of such...\r\n\r\n   1. rotation of 90 degrees clockwise, center [2,2]\r\n   2. translation of ```[0, 1]``` (0 change in first dimension and 1 increase of all \r\n      values of second)\r\n   3. scaling of 2x, center ```[2,2]```\r\n\r\nwould result in ```[[1,2,3], [3,2,1]]``` from rotation\r\nthen ```[[1,2,3], [4,3,2]]``` from translation\r\nand finally ```[[0,2,4], [6,4,2]]``` from scaling.\r\n\r\nThe above is feasible with the mixing together of other 2d solutions online but when it comes to, for example, a 23 dimensional input with thousands of &#39;coordinates&#39; I don&#39;t know where to start, never mind how to implement this in an efficient manner. I was hoping for something like 10 dimensions and 1000 elements in a hundredth of a second, with CUDA some sort of consideration, but am waiting to be told this isn&#39;t possible. Thanks for any help or suggestions in advance - speed is priority while hopefully any sort of accuracy isn&#39;t sacrificed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147831/performing-transformations-on-n-dimensional-arrays-in-python","title":"Performing transformations on n-dimensional arrays in python"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31424,"user_id":740553,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/764d053af4d74ff8aef282c01a37166e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike &#39;Pomax&#39; Kamermans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/740553/mike-pomax-kamermans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569685298,"post_id":58147829,"comment_id":102679972,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147829/rangemax-min-what-does-this-exactly-mean#comment102679972_58147829"},{"owner":{"reputation":743,"user_id":8884381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WRNLHm93hTI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAATA/6LF5hhHs_S8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amit Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8884381/amit-gupta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569685998,"post_id":58147829,"comment_id":102680147,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147829/rangemax-min-what-does-this-exactly-mean#comment102680147_58147829"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":12079241,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b21f46390de77858e9d71baa533988c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Monsi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079241/monsi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569684859,"creation_date":1569684859,"question_id":58147829,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147829","body_markdown":"I am new in python and encountered the max and min function used within the range function.

what you are trying to, I am assuming that you are trying to add a force to the object that it has collided with.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you did:\r\n```\r\nif (myCollision.gameObject.name == &quot;Cube&quot;)\r\n  {\r\n    var = GameObject.Find(&quot;Cube&quot;);\r\n    var.AddForce(new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, power));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry to avoid `GameObject.Find(string)` method, as it is an expensive call.&lt;br&gt;\r\nIn fact, you don&#39;t even need to do that, since you actually have the game object you are colliding with already, that is what the `myCollision` for.\r\n\r\nYou can do this instead:\r\n```\r\nif (myCollision.gameObject.name == &quot;Cube&quot;)\r\n  {\r\n    var = myCollision.gameObject; // Aka the gameobject you have collided with.\r\n    var.AddForce(new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, power));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Going back to the question**, what you were trying to do is to add force to a rigidbody, but however `var` is of type `GameObject`, not `RigidBody`.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is to get the component of the `RigidBody` from the `GameObject`, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar.GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody&gt;().AddForce(...\r\n```\r\nNote that a null reference exception occurs if the GameObject does not have a Rigidbody component attached to it.&lt;br&gt;\r\nMake sure the cube you are colliding with has a RigidBody component in the Unity&#39;s Inspector.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nAlso, you might want to note that repeated `GetComponent()` calls can be expensive. You can consider caching it if possible.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147817/gameobject-does-not-contain-a-definition-for-addforce-unity3d/58148521#58148521","title":"GameObject&#39; does not contain a definition for &#39;AddForce&#39; || Unity3D"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12086490,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8YAV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"huh_again","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086490/huh-again"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4447,"user_id":1253136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78ed265f0b33e2208570927bc7b5dcb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"XenoRo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1253136/xenoro"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58148521,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569690089,"creation_date":1569684779,"last_edit_date":1569690055,"question_id":58147817,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147817","body_markdown":"I have an error:\r\n\r\n    &#39;GameObject&#39; does not contain a definition for &#39;AddForce&#39; and no accessible extension method\r\n    &#39;AddForce&#39; accepting a first argument of type &#39;GameObject&#39; could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n    public float power = 500.0f;\r\n    GameObject var;\r\n    \r\n    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision myCollision) {\r\n    if (myCollision.gameObject.name == &quot;Cube&quot;) {\r\n        var = GameObject.Find(&quot;Cube&quot;);\r\n        var.AddForce(new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, power));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI want change coords of current object, in a collision with other objects.

Server S implements some backend which handles incoming requests in a RESTful manner. \r\n\r\nThe backend S has a shelf. The goal of users A and B is to make S create and place numbered boxes on that shelf. A unique constraint is that no two boxes can have the same number. Once a box is created, S should return that box (JSON, or xml...) back to A and B with its allocated number.\r\n\r\nThe problem boils down to concurrency, as A and B&#39;s POST (&quot;create-numbered-box&quot;) transactions may arrive at the exact same time at the database - hence get cancelled (?). I remind, there is a unique constraint - no two boxes are allowed to have a same number.\r\n\r\nWhat are possible ways to solve this problem? I wouldn&#39;t like to lock the database, so I am looking for alternatives of that. You are allowed to imagine that between the database and the backend layer calling the database we may have an extra layer of abstraction, e.g. a microservice, messaging queue... whatever or nothing at all - a direct backend - db exec. query call. If you think a postgres database is not a good choice to say a graph one, or document one, key-value one - feel free to substitute it. \r\nThe goal is in the end given concurrent writes users A and B to get responses to their create (POST) requests and each of them have a box on that shared shelf with a unique number, with no &quot;Oops, something went wrong. Please retry&quot; type of server response.\r\n\r\nI described a simple world with users A and B but that can in theory go up to 10 000 users writing, not just 2. \r\nAs a secondary question, I&#39;d like to ask, is there a way to test conflicting concurrent transactions in postgres?\r\n\r\nI will go first.\r\nMy idea is, let A and B send requests and fail. Once they fail, have retries with random timeouts in some interval. Let&#39;s say up to 3 retries. This way for A and B I will try to separate the requested writes to the db and this would allow for some degree of successful resolution of the scenario. However, I don&#39;t think this is a clean solution and I am looking for alternatives you can think of. Just, please keep in mind the constraints and freedoms I mentioned above.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147808/concurrent-writes-to-a-shared-network-resource","title":"Concurrent writes to a shared network resource"},{"tags":["powerbi"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5800,"user_id":8649393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MMPbq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrey Nikolov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8649393/andrey-nikolov"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569695226,"creation_date":1569695226,"answer_id":58149181,"question_id":58147807,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58149181","body_markdown":"Refreshing data 8/48 times a day is applicable when you **import** data in Power BI dataset. But if you want &quot;more recent&quot; data, you can connect to your data source using [DirectQuery][1] mode. DirectQuery sends queries to your data source when rendering the report. If you apply a filter, the database will get a new query, and so on. Not every data source supports DirectQuery, e.g. you can&#39;t use it for flat files (obviously). You may want to take a look at [Data refresh in Power BI][2] article.\r\n\r\nFor embedding iframes in Power BI report you can use [HTML Viewer][3] custom visual.\r\n\r\nBy default when using DirectQuery mode, tiles pinned to a dashboard refresh automatically hourly ([Datasets in DirectQuery/LiveConnect mode][4]), but you can reduce this time down to 15 minutes:\r\n\r\n&gt; A tile is a report visual pinned to a dashboard, and dashboard tile refreshes happen **about every hour** so that the tiles show recent results. **You can change the schedule** in the dataset settings, as in the screenshot below, or force a dashboard update manually by using the Refresh Now option.\r\n\r\nHowever if you want to display real-time data in Power BI dashboard, it will be better to use push or streaming datasets. With push datasets you can programatically [push data to the dataset][5] and the data will be stored and you can use them in reports. Streaming datasets are similar to push, but they will keep only the last hour of data pushed to them and can&#39;t be used in report, only pinned to a dashboard. There are also other options, like using [PubNub][6] or [Microsoft Flow][7].

The 4 statements &quot;You&#39;re in a large dark room&quot; is wrong.  They should be the descriptions of the rooms adjacent to the starting room.  Instead the 4 descriptions come from the room in position 0.  The expected code should print the description of the adjacent room if there is one.  \r\n\r\nThe lines were printed in the main of the Game.java class.  The Game.java class initiates the game by creating the an instance of the controller class.  When the controller class is initiated, the rooms are created within the controller class.  The controller class controls the room list by creating the rooms.  The player class contains the information about the room that the player is currently in.  The game class controls the loop which the turns take place.  \r\n\r\nThis snippet is Right at the start of the game.  It initiallizes the controller and then places a starting room.  Right after that I wanted to call the adjacent rooms to the starting room to check if they existed.  \r\nIn my code, there is a random starting room.  I tried having a set starting room, so I would know what the available adjacent rooms were.  That didn&#39;t work.  No matter what I tried, each time I tried accessing an adjacent room, I recieved the same room.  The 4 numbers after true/false indicate accessible rooms.  0-3 represent North, East, South, West respectively.  -1 means there is no connection in that room.  So for example the first room states a description &quot;You&#39;re in a large darm room&quot; and the room connects to Room-1 to the North and to the Room-2 to the South.  So my four lines of repetitive code are a definition of each connecting room.  It should describe the room connecting from the North, East, South, and West.  \r\nEach of the adjacent rooms seem to be returned having the value of the room in the 0 position.  \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tScanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\t\tString thisName;\r\n\t\t// Dungeon: 4 rooms (0 through 3)\r\n\t\tString[] rooms = {\r\n\t\t\t\t&quot;|You&#39;re in a large dark room| false 1 -1 -1 2 &quot;, \r\n\t\t\t\t&quot;|You&#39;re in a dark large room| false -1 0 -1 -1 &quot;,\r\n\t\t\t\t&quot;|You&#39;re in a large room, very dark| false 0 0 3 0 &quot;,\r\n\t\t\t\t&quot;|You&#39;re in a dark room, very small| true 0 0 0 0 &quot;\r\n\t\t};\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// Set the dungeon up according to the input\r\n\t\tController c = new Controller(rooms.length);\r\n\t\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; rooms.length; i++) {\r\n\t\t\tc.buildRoom(i, rooms[i]);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tSystem.out.print(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;);\r\n\t\tthisName = scnr.next();\r\n\t\t// Create and position player\r\n\t\tplayer = new Player(thisName);\r\n\t\tplayer.setCurrent(c.getStartRoom());\r\n\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(player.getCurrent().getAdjacent(0).getDescription());\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(player.getCurrent().getAdjacent(1).getDescription());\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(player.getCurrent().getAdjacent(2).getDescription());\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(player.getCurrent().getAdjacent(3).getDescription());\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147803/room-change-doesnt-update-the-current-room-it-just-stays-in-the-same-room","title":"Room change doesn&#39;t update the current room, it just stays in the same room"},{"tags":["java","arrays","multithreading","recursion","bubble-sort"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":552699,"user_id":139985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/147c5a9cc1feec049c50da791ac7d144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/139985/stephen-c"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569686866,"post_id":58147800,"comment_id":102680351,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147800/modified-recursive-bubble-sort-with-threads#comment102680351_58147800"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10363819,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d994bb170f2ce54a1785d4e4472af49f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"teachMe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10363819/teachme"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":552699,"user_id":139985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/147c5a9cc1feec049c50da791ac7d144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/139985/stephen-c"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569757451,"post_id":58147800,"comment_id":102692646,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147800/modified-recursive-bubble-sort-with-threads#comment102692646_58147800"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10363819,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d994bb170f2ce54a1785d4e4472af49f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"teachMe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10363819/teachme"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10363819,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d994bb170f2ce54a1785d4e4472af49f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"teachMe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10363819/teachme"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570834530,"creation_date":1569684673,"last_edit_date":1570834530,"question_id":58147800,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147800","body_markdown":"I have to make a sort for university that splits an array in two and starts a thread for each half.

The search path is (in order): (i)\r\n&gt; Sys.getenv(&quot;R_ENVIRON_USER&quot;), (ii) ./.Renviron, and (iii) ~/.Renviron.\r\n&gt; The format of this file is one ENV_VAR=VALUE statement per line, cf.\r\n&gt; ?.Renviron. NOTE: Some environment variables must be set already in\r\n&gt; this step in order to be acknowledged by R, i.e. it is too late to set\r\n&gt; some of them in Step 2 and Step 3 below.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The first .Rprofile file found on the R startup search path is\r\n&gt; processed. The search path is (in order): (i)\r\n&gt; Sys.getenv(&quot;R_PROFILE_USER&quot;), (ii) ./.Rprofile, and (iii) ~/.Rprofile.\r\n&gt; The format of this file must be a valid R script (with a trailing\r\n&gt; newline), cf. ?.Rprofile.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If the .Rprofile file (in Step 2) calls startup::startup() then the\r\n&gt; following will also take place:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; a. The first .Renviron.d directory on the R startup search path is\r\n&gt; processed.

NOTE: Some environment variables must be set already in\r\n&gt; Step 1 above in order to be acknowledged by R.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; b. A set of handy R options that can be use in Step 3c are set. Their\r\n&gt; names are prefixed startup.session. - see\r\n&gt; ?startup::startup_session_options for details.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; c.

To fix this, pass `-lc` to the linker to add the C library during linking:\r\n\r\n    ld -o function function.o -lc\r\n\r\nIt is very important that `-lc` goes last, otherwise the link might not work.  This is because the linker picks functions from libraries in the order you specify them.  When you specify `-lc` before `function.o`, it ignores the library as it doesn&#39;t need anything from it right now.  Then it sees `function.o` with an undefined `atol` and doesn&#39;t find a definition, causing the link to fail.\r\n\r\nLastly, when you use the C library, you should start your program from the `main` function (i.e. rename `_start` to `main`) like a normal C program and link through the C compiler:\r\n\r\n    clang -g -o function function.s\r\n\r\nThis causes the C library to be linked in automatically and makes initialises it correctly, preventing some weird bugs.  If you use any IO functions like `printf` from the C library, you should also end your program by calling `exit` so the standard IO streams are flushed correctly.\r\n\r\nNote that the `stdlib.h` file is a red herring.  Header files are not needed for programming in assembly.  Their purpose is to tell the C compiler what the type of some functions are.  This is not needed if you do not use the C compiler.  The `.file` directive does not do what you expect it does.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147796/using-stdlib-h-functions-directly-in-assembly/58148082#58148082","title":"Using stdlib.h functions directly in assembly"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569739815,"post_id":58152766,"comment_id":102689232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147796/using-stdlib-h-functions-directly-in-assembly/58152766#comment102689232_58152766"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":362,"user_id":3649174,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXoD5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Febriyanto Nugroho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3649174/febriyanto-nugroho"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569737584,"creation_date":1569737584,"answer_id":58152766,"question_id":58147796,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58152766","body_markdown":"Maybe you can use `extern`, example : `extern printf` or whatever you want in `stdlib.h` library\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s work on `nasm` or `masm` assembler.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58147796/using-stdlib-h-functions-directly-in-assembly/58152766#58152766","title":"Using stdlib.h functions directly in assembly"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12135443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4mFSK_Hgnrc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc2yWPksn33sCSOtpiTg1yr24_lfA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"juanpbm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135443/juanpbm"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12135443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4mFSK_Hgnrc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc2yWPksn33sCSOtpiTg1yr24_lfA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"juanpbm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135443/juanpbm"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58148082,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569845965,"creation_date":1569684620,"last_edit_date":1569845965,"question_id":58147796,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58147796","body_markdown":"I have to do an assembly (x86) program that takes 2 long numbers from user input, adds them using a function and then prints the result.
