The problem I&#39;m running into is that once values have been entered, the value of the most recently updated input is updated with the previous value (including the calculation). For example, User enters 60 months &gt; years is populated with the value of 5 &gt; user changes months to a value of 72 &gt; years is populated with a value of 6 &gt; months is automatically populated with a value of 60 (years remains at a value of 6)\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the JS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst loan = () =&gt; {\r\n    let principal = document.getElementById(&#39;principal&#39;)\r\n    let interestRate = document.getElementById(&#39;interestRate&#39;)\r\n    let terms = document.getElementById(&#39;terms&#39;)\r\n    let termsInYears = document.getElementById(&#39;termsInYears&#39;)\r\n    let payment = document.getElementById(&#39;payment&#39;)\r\n    let total = document.getElementById(&#39;total&#39;)\r\n    let totalInterest = document.getElementById(&#39;totalInterest&#39;)\r\n    let closingCosts = document.getElementById(&#39;closingCosts&#39;)\r\n    let netAfterFees = document.getElementById(&#39;netAfterFees&#39;)\r\n    let totalFeesAndInterest = document.getElementById(&#39;totalFeesAndInterest&#39;)\r\n    let trueCost = document.getElementById(&#39;trueCost&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    let amount = parseFloat(principal.value)\r\n    let interest = parseFloat(interestRate.value) / 100 / 12\r\n    let payments = parseFloat(terms.value)\r\n    let fees = parseFloat(closingCosts.value)\r\n\r\n    if(!fees) {\r\n        closingCosts.value = 0\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [terms.value, termsInYears.value] = [termsInYears.value*12, terms.value/12]\r\n\r\n\r\n    let x = Math.pow(1 + interest, payments)\r\n    let monthly = (amount * x * interest) / (x-1)\r\n    let totalPay = (monthly * payments)\r\n\r\n    if (isFinite(monthly) &amp;&amp; payment) {\r\n        payment.innerHTML = monthly.toFixed(2).replace(/\\d(?=(\\d{3})+\\.)/g, &#39;$&amp;,&#39;)\r\n        netAfterFees.innerHTML = (amount - fees).toFixed(2).replace(/\\d(?=(\\d{3})+\\.)/g, &#39;$&amp;,&#39;)\r\n        total.innerHTML = (totalPay).toFixed(2).replace(/\\d(?=(\\d{3})+\\.)/g, &#39;$&amp;,&#39;)\r\n        totalInterest.innerHTML = ((monthly * payments) - amount).toFixed(2).replace(/\\d(?=(\\d{3})+\\.)/g, &#39;$&amp;,&#39;)\r\n        totalFeesAndInterest.innerHTML = (totalPay - amount + fees).toFixed(2).replace(/\\d(?=(\\d{3})+\\.)/g, &#39;$&amp;,&#39;)\r\n        trueCost.innerHTML = (((totalPay - amount + fees) / amount)*100).toFixed(2)\r\n    } else {\r\n        payment.innerHTML = &#39;0&#39;\r\n        netAfterFees.innerHTML = &#39;0&#39;\r\n        total.innerHTML = &#39;0&#39;\r\n        totalInterest.innerHTML = &#39;0&#39;\r\n        totalFeesAndInterest.innerHTML = &#39;0&#39;\r\n        trueCost.innerHTML = &#39;0&#39;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t speak on the quality of the working calculator given my experience level. However, it does work. I&#39;m just having one heck of a time getting past this [likely silly] input exchange.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!

You can use a self-signed certificate but you will have even more browser issues. Not recommended.\r\n\r\n**Possible Options:**\r\n\r\n 1. Use your domain name (or purchase one) and use Let&#39;s Encrypt for SSL which is free and is one of your better options.\r\n 2. Use a different service such as Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Firebase or App Engine which offers SSL and does not require a domain name that you own as you can use Google&#39;s endpoint.\r\n 3. Attach a Google Load Balancer in front of your Compute Engine instance and configure a front end with a Google Managed SSL certificate. However, this will require a domain name.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to use your own domain name, then option #2 is your only choice.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017762/rest-api-over-https-in-google-compute-engine/58041808#58041808","title":"REST API over https in Google Compute Engine"}],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":3364179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/477d90935817c749c440581da72a5703?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jani_r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3364179/jani-r"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58041808,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569936165,"creation_date":1568920951,"question_id":58017762,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017762","body_markdown":"Does anyone know how to easily setup https for a rest api in google compute engine ?

You&#39;ll hear that everything is passed by reference in Python, but since integers are immutable, when you edit the value of `val`, you&#39;re actually creating a new object and your thread still holds a reference to the integer with a value of 10. \r\n\r\nTo get around this, I wrote a simple wrapper class for an integer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass IntegerHolder():\r\n    def __init__(self, n):\r\n        self.value = n\r\n        \r\n    def set_value(self, n):\r\n        self.value = n\r\n    \r\n    def get_value(self):\r\n        return self.value\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, instead of `var = 10`, I did `i = IntegerHolder(10)`, and after the `sleep(5)` call, I simply did `i.set_value(5)`, which updates the wrapper object. The thread still has the same reference to the IntegerHolder object i, and when `i.get_value()` is called in the thread, it will return 5, as required.\r\n\r\n[You can also do this with a Python list][1], since lists are objects — it&#39;s just that this implementation makes it clearer what&#39;s going on. You&#39;d just do `var = [10]` and do `var[0] = 5`, which would work since your thread should still keep a reference to the same list object as the main thread. \r\n\r\nTwo more errors: \r\n\r\n 1. Instead of `Thread(target=loop(var))`, you need to do `Thread(target=loop, args=(i,))`. This is because `target` is supposed to be a callable object, which is basically a function. Doing `loop(var)` will cause the Thread constructor to loop forever waiting for the function to return (and then set target to the return value), so the thread never actually gets created. You can verify this with your favorite Python debugger, or print statements. \r\n\r\n 2. Setting `nt.daemon = True` allows `main.py` to exit before the thread finishes. This means that as soon as `i.set_value(5)` is called, the main program terminates and your integer wrapper object ceases to exist. This makes your thread very confused when it tries to access the wrapper object, and by very confused, I mean it throws an exception and dies because threads do that. You can verify this by catching the exit code of the thread. Deleting that line fixes things (`nt.daemon = False` by default), but it&#39;s probably safer to do a `nt.join()` call in the main thread, which waits for a thread to finish execution. \r\n\r\nAnd one warning, because programming wouldn&#39;t be complete without warnings:\r\n\r\n1. Whenever different threads try to access a value, if AT LEAST ONE thread is modifying the value, this can cause a race condition. This means that all accesses at that point should be wrapped in a lock/mutex to prevent this.

The [doc][1] says that\r\n\r\n&gt; This is useful for scaling easily across multiple cores. For example\r\n&gt; you might have a web-server verticle to deploy and multiple cores on\r\n&gt; your machine, so you want to deploy multiple instances to utilise all\r\n&gt; the cores.\r\n\r\nOk fine, I have 2 cores in my intel processor and so I `setInstances(2)` for scaling.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSay that I wake up tomorrow and I want to add a verticle to manage database and other logic. I still have 2 cores. Which is the correct code?\r\n\r\n**v1**\r\n\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void start() throws Exception {\r\n        //2 instances of http server verticle\r\n        vertx.deployVerticle(StringName, new DeploymentOptions().setInstances(2));\r\n        //2 instances of database verticle\r\n        vertx.deployVerticle(StringName, new DeploymentOptions().setInstances(2));\r\n      }\r\n\r\n**v2**\r\n\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void start() throws Exception {\r\n        //1 instance of http server verticle\r\n        vertx.deployVerticle(StringName, new DeploymentOptions().setInstances(1));\r\n        //1 instance of database verticle\r\n        vertx.deployVerticle(StringName, new DeploymentOptions().setInstances(1));\r\n      }\r\n\r\nSo in other words I am asking this.

The command line arguments needed by the console app are sent via the ProcessStartInfo.Arguments Property. The individual arguments sometimes include spaces and I do surround those with quotes.\r\n\r\nNow, up until a day or so ago this has been working fine. The front end sends the command line arguments, the console application receives the arguments via &quot;argc&quot; and &quot;argv&quot;, and console application does its thing. However, now the parsing of the command line arguments appears to have broken. The quotes are ignored and spaces in an argument break up what should be a single argument into multiple ones.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a command line argument that is no longer parsed correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    &quot;&quot;C:\\Projects\\Mini\\2019-07 Identification Issues\\PER700 Masked Images&quot;&quot; XCAT110042B_136_detection_id_PER700 png\r\n\r\nIn this example, `C:\\Projects\\Mini\\2019-07` is treated as the argv[1], `Identification` is treated as argv[2], `Issues\\PER700` is treated as argv[3], etc.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\n 1. This has just recently started happening (the last couple of days)\r\n 2. I only see this when running the application within Visual Studio. If I publish the application everything works fine.\r\n 3. I have tried running the C++ app in debug mode with a single double quote around the arguments and two double quotes around the arguments.\r\n 4. I have a number of these &quot;VB front end/C++ back end&quot; Visual Studio solutions and I am seeing similar behavior in the others. (i.e. it is not just this solution)\r\n 5. I have NOT updated Visual Studio recently prior to this phenomenon appearing.\r\n 6. I am just a mechanical engineer who can (sometimes) write code, not a professional developer. (i.e. please have mercy on me)\r\n\r\nAny ideas on where I might start looking to resolve this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017674/visual-c-console-application-no-longer-parsing-command-line-parameters-correct","title":"Visual C++ console application no longer parsing command line parameters correctly"},{"tags":["pseudocode"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13131,"user_id":6243352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/715f60f9edc65642a6805752cfeebb27?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ggorlen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6243352/ggorlen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568920907,"post_id":58017671,"comment_id":102438962,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017671/gas-compute-and-display-the-price-a-person-will-pay-for-gas-at-the-gas-station#comment102438962_58017671"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10378019,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wjvlumkguUo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/APUIFaNrVCQldRpa-5i3nd9I68AFhbr_tw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kanghwi lee mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10378019/kanghwi-lee-mike"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":155,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568920575,"creation_date":1568920575,"question_id":58017671,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017671","body_markdown":"Gas.

want to identify misreported values from a school district. There are 10,000 school districts, and I&#39;ve collected 14 years worth of school districts and the average amount they spend per student each year. If the preceding five years, the values are within a range of 6 - $9000, but then in the following year, 2013, that school district (and its corresponding city) report a per student spending of $15,000; there&#39;s a good chance, for whatever reason, that that value is misreported. There are ways of tracking down the correct value, but that $15000 is likely misrepresentative and shouldn&#39;t be used.\r\n\r\nI have created a large dataset to look at education expenditure (how much a school district spends per student) and crime rate, so I have repeating values of city, county, school district over a 14-year period. I’ve looked at the max/min for the dataset for school district per student spending (and have looked at scatterplots), and have identified anomalies. This made me realize that there could be misreported school district expenditures that aren’t extreme for the dataset (though they are extreme among that particular school district).\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to flag values as misreported based on standard deviation, I could use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nflags&lt;-\r\n  dat%&gt;%\r\n    group_by(full_district_id)%&gt;%\r\n    mutate(sd.district_id = sd(EXPENDITURE_PER_STUDENT, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    flag = ifelse(full_district_id &gt; 2* sd.district_id, &quot;greater&quot;,\r\n    ifelse(full_district_id&lt; 2 * sd.district_id, &quot;smaller&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot;))%&gt;%\r\n    ungroup()%&gt;%\r\n    filter(flag == &quot;greater&quot;|flag == &quot;smaller&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I think it would be better to look at the preceding year (or something like the five preceding years) to see whether that particular year is an anomaly. So if a value is greater that $4000 more than any of the preceding five years then that value would be flagged. I’m uncertain how to write a conditional that would say something like if over $4000 from the previous x years of school district expenditure, then flag this value. And then I review these values and look for their correct values.\r\n\r\nI googled various things but none were really what I was looking for.\r\n\r\nHere is a small chunk of my dataset, so you can

Although the `.pause()` approach in my answer below worked for going to/from background we also have a use-case where we move to offline render mode to export audio. That process definitely *does* require us to stop the engine (in order to switch modes), and we&#39;re getting the same SynthOne-related crash when handling the first event after `AudioKit.start()`. Does anybody understand why we&#39;d hit an `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` when returning?

I can see the extension properties on User being done as long as I comment out all the navigation properties.\r\n\r\nWith the navigation properties present, I get an error on the base configuration class. after concrete implementation called base.Configure(builder);\r\n\r\nI get the following error message on **builder.HasKey(t =&gt; t.Id);** and for the above sample code it would be on...\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public abstract class UserRoleConfiguration&lt;T&gt; : IEntityTypeConfiguration&lt;T&gt;\r\n        where T : UserRoleBase\r\n    {\r\n        public virtual void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder&lt;T&gt; builder)\r\n        {\r\n            // Primary Key\r\n            builder.HasKey(t =&gt; t.Id);\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\n&gt; System.InvalidOperationException: &#39;A key cannot be configured on &#39;UserRole&#39; because it is a derived type. The key must be configured on the root type &#39;UserRoleBase&#39;. If you did not intend for &#39;UserRoleBase&#39; to be included in the model, ensure that it is not included in a DbSet property on your context, referenced in a configuration call to ModelBuilder, or referenced from a navigation property on a type that is included in the model.&#39;\r\n\r\nIs there a way in which I can keep these relational configuration in the abstract base class so that I would not need to replicate it in each concrete implementation of the base classes?  Or is there a different approach that can be followed to overcome this issue?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017611/is-there-a-nice-pattern-for-implementing-an-abstract-dbcontext-in-ef7-net-cor","title":"Is there a nice pattern for implementing an abstract DbContext in EF7 / .Net Core 3 to avoid duplication of shared entities / config across projects?"},{"tags":["r","data.table"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":93,"user_id":8834335,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYWmE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sinnombre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8834335/sinnombre"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25763,"user_id":7128934,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oI2SB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"d.b","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128934/d-b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568925655,"post_id":58017609,"comment_id":102440854,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017609/using-data-table-in-r-can-i-select-a-vector-of-variable-columns-from-a-table#comment102440854_58017609"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":93,"user_id":8834335,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYWmE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sinnombre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8834335/sinnombre"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568925762,"post_id":58017639,"comment_id":102440889,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017609/using-data-table-in-r-can-i-select-a-vector-of-variable-columns-from-a-table/58017639#comment102440889_58017639"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568922973,"last_edit_date":1568922973,"creation_date":1568920394,"answer_id":58017639,"question_id":58017609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58017639","body_markdown":"A vectorized way of subsetting the elements is by providing the row index and column index as a matrix\r\n\r\n    as.data.frame(A)[cbind(seq_len(nrow(A)), 1:3)]\r\n    #[1] 1 5 9\r\n\r\nOr convert the `.SD` to `matrix` or `data.frame` and use the row/column index\r\n\r\n    A[, as.matrix(.SD)[cbind(1:3, 1:3)]]\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOr in `data.table`, pass the `i`, `j` index in a loop and extract the elements\r\n\r\n    A[, unlist(Map(function(i, j) .SD[i, j, with = FALSE], 1:3, 1:3), \r\n              use.names = FALSE)]","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017609/using-data-table-in-r-can-i-select-a-vector-of-variable-columns-from-a-table/58017639#58017639","title":"Using data.table in R, can I select a vector of variable columns from a table?"}],"owner":{"reputation":93,"user_id":8834335,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYWmE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sinnombre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8834335/sinnombre"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58017639,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568922973,"creation_date":1568920279,"question_id":58017609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017609","body_markdown":"Suppose I have a table like:\r\n\r\n    &gt; A = data.table(c(1,2,3),c(4,5,6),c(7,8,9))\r\n    &gt; A\r\n        V1 V2 V3\r\n    1:  1  4  7\r\n    2:  2  5  8\r\n    3:  3  6  9\r\n\r\nI want to select the first column of the first row, second of the second row and third of the third row, getting the result:\r\n\r\n    &gt; B\r\n    [1] 1 5 9\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried something like:\r\n\r\n    B = A[,c(1,2,3)]\r\n\r\nBut that does not work.

The next pair passed to the block by `enum2` is `[[1, 2], 1]`.

I have reached quite far, and realized that my code is not working for all test cases, **usually for larger inputs**. \r\n\r\nI know I write bad code, but this is how I will learn. So here is my algorithm for this: \r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Take i = len(a)-1\r\n    2. Check whether the last element is at place or not a[i] not equals len(a)(which is anyway the nth element)\r\n    3. Find how far it is from it&#39;s actual place\r\n    4. If the value is more than 2, then Chaotic and exit\r\n    5. Else if the value is positive, which means the guy has to move to the right and bribe would be taken into consideration, else not valuable\r\n    6. Add the number of value the element has\r\n    7. Swap the values using normal swapping \r\n    8. Print the statement according to the situation \r\n\r\n\r\n**My Code:**\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef minimumBribes(a):\r\n  min_bribe = 0\r\n  isChaotic = False\r\n  i = len(a)-1\r\n  #for chaos check\r\n  while i &gt;= 0:\r\n    posVal = 0\r\n    if a[i] != len(a):\r\n      #if the value comes more than two with respect to any position then chaotic\r\n      posVal = i - a.index(i+1)\r\n      if abs(posVal) &gt; 2:\r\n        isChaotic = True\r\n        break\r\n      elif posVal &gt; 0:\r\n        min_bribe += posVal\r\n        #swapping them to their place original place\r\n        temp = i+1\r\n        a[a.index(i+1)] = a[i]\r\n        a[i] = temp\r\n            \r\n     i -= 1\r\n    print(&quot;Too Chaotic&quot; if isChaotic else min_bribe-1, end=&quot;&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for some test cases my algorithm works totally fine like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n1. [2 1 5 3 4]\r\n2. [2 5 1 3 4]\r\n3. [5 1 2 3 7 8 6 4]\r\n4. [1 2 5 3 7 8 6 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Error Caught in one of the test cases like this:** [Input][2]\r\n\r\n**Expected Output:** 966 but my code did not run through it. Took a lot of time.\r\n\r\n**Failures of my Algorithm:**\r\n\r\n&gt;1. Time Consuming for large inputs\r\n&gt;2. Space Consumptions \r\n\r\nAny help which will tell me:\r\n\r\n&gt;1. Efficient code for the solution or error rectification of my code\r\n&gt;2. How you think of this solution, and what it will take me to get to this level. \r\n\r\nI am a learner and I will learn. I am fascinated by people who can really code smoothly and comes with brilliant logics. Please guide me as well.

It only makes sense to run Chromatic once\r\n&gt; per PR, so we suggest disabling Chromatic on pr builds for internal\r\n&gt; PRs (i.e. PRs that aren’t from forks). You should make sure that you\r\n&gt; have push builds turned on, and add the following code: [[THE CODE ABOVE]]\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; For external PRs (PRs from forks of your repo), the above code will\r\n&gt; ensure Chromatic does run on the pr build, because Travis does not\r\n&gt; trigger push builds in such cases.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Note: We recommend running Chromatic on push builds as pr builds can&#39;t\r\n&gt; always run and fall out of the normal git ancestry.

I think I will prepare a shortened version. \r\n\r\n    &lt;table id=&quot;my-table&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;tbody id=&quot;my-tbody&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;tr&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;Example text&lt;/td&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;input-text&quot; onkeydown=&quot;keyDown()&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;Example text&lt;/td&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;&lt;button id=&quot;check-btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; \r\n          onclick=&quot;checkInput()&quot;&gt;check&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n     &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n    \r\nAs you can see, the buttons inside the tds, as well as the input field, all have their own individual functions. Now, I would like to deep copy the entire tbody on a button click and make it appear here:\r\n\r\n    &lt;table id=&quot;my-table2&gt;\r\n    &lt;tr&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nI used this to shallow copy the tbody:\r\n\r\n    &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;duplicate()&quot;&gt;example-btn&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    \r\n    function duplicate() {\r\n    var itm = document.getElementById(&quot;my-tbody&quot;);\r\n    var cln = itm.cloneNode(true);\r\n    document.getElementById(&quot;my-table2&quot;).appendChild(cln);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n... and it works fine, the problem is, the cloned buttons affect the original cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike I said, I have downloaded `lodash` and would like to utilize the `_.cloneDeep()` function, but I have no clue how to do that. Some questions:\r\n\r\n1) Is it possible to deep clone using just pure JS?\r\n2) Can I use `_.cloneDeep() ` on a button click? If yes, how could I achieve that?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and replies. This is really important for my project! :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017583/how-to-do-a-deep-copy-of-an-entire-tbody-append-it-under-a-different-table-and","title":"How to do a

We are slowly refactoring everything to follow modern standards, but for now we have to make do with the original code base.\r\n\r\nHow do I inject the Service into my Action class without introducing a dependency container?\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage com.example.action;\r\n\r\nimport com.example.service.ExampleService;\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.struts.action.Action;\r\nimport org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm;\r\nimport org.apache.struts.action.ActionForward;\r\nimport org.apache.struts.action.ActionMapping;\r\n\r\nimport javax.servlet.ServletOutputStream;\r\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\r\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\r\n\r\npublic final class ExampleAction extends Action {\r\n    private ExampleService exampleService;\r\n\r\n    // This Action cannot be instantiated by Struts because of its dependency! :(\r\n    public ExampleAction(ExampleService exampleService) {\r\n        this.exampleService = exampleService;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\r\n        // ...\r\n\r\n        exampleService.doSomething();\r\n\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found a lot of information on how to integrate the Spring container with Struts 1, but I could not find anything on how to manipulate Strut&#39;s Action instantiation process manually. I really don&#39;t want to refactor more than I have to to get the new feature working, so I would prefer a quick and dirty solution where I simply interfere with Strut&#39;s Action instantiation process to inject my Service manually.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017574/struts-1-how-to-inject-dependencies-into-action-classes-without-using-a-di-cont","title":"Struts 1: How to inject dependencies into Action classes without using a DI container?"},{"tags":["pandas","python-3.7","hdf5","pytables","hdfstore"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":777,"user_id":4129091,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f8076e78a95ed50b9ffbed42849d80e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tsorn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4129091/tsorn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569239097,"creation_date":1569239097,"answer_id":58061743,"question_id":58017573,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58061743","body_markdown":"HDF stores strings in UTF-8, and thus you need to encode the strings as UTF-8 and then find the maximum length.\r\n```\r\na_pandas_string_series.str.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;).str.len().max()\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017573/pandas-hdfstore-append-fails-when-min-itemsize-is-set-to-the-maximum-of-the-str/58061743#58061743","title":"Pandas HDFStore: append fails when min_itemsize is set to the maximum of the string column"}],"owner":{"reputation":777,"user_id":4129091,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f8076e78a95ed50b9ffbed42849d80e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tsorn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4129091/tsorn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":777,"user_id":4129091,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f8076e78a95ed50b9ffbed42849d80e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tsorn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4129091/tsorn"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58061743,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569239097,"creation_date":1568920098,"last_edit_date":1568920597,"question_id":58017573,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017573","body_markdown":"I&#39;m detecting the maximum lengths of all string columns of multiple dataframes, then attempting to build a HDFStore:\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n# Detect max string length for each column across all DataFrames\r\nmax_lens = {}\r\nfor df_path in paths:\r\n    df = pd.read_pickle(df_path)\r\n    for col in df.columns:\r\n        ser = df[col]\r\n        if ser.dtype == &#39;object&#39;

Just create the required source folder through the terminal and then add the folder entry in the below maven plugin. \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;project&gt;\r\n  ...\r\n  &lt;build&gt;\r\n    &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n      &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;build-helper-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;3.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;executions&gt;\r\n          &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;add-source&lt;/id&gt;\r\n            &lt;phase&gt;generate-sources&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n            &lt;goals&gt;\r\n              &lt;goal&gt;add-source&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n              &lt;sources&gt;\r\n                &lt;source&gt;**some source directory you prefer**&lt;/source&gt;\r\n                ...\r\n              &lt;/sources&gt;\r\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n          &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n        &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n      &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n    &lt;/plugins&gt;\r\n  &lt;/build&gt;\r\n&lt;/project&gt;\r\n```\r\n[for more about the plugin][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.mojohaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/usage.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017544/how-to-set-a-build-path-from-terminal/58017972#58017972","title":"How to set a build path from terminal"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":4996175,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a80ec2356487bdb538ca4ef91cdbd7c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thehydrogen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4996175/thehydrogen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15510,"user_id":27905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f54c977d97a90429c73f3323dc59532a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nitind","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/27905/nitind"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568922006,"creation_date":1568919950,"last_edit_date":1568921964,"question_id":58017544,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017544","body_markdown":"In Eclipse, I can right click on the project and then click on `Build Path` and `Use as a source folder`.

As well as slotting, we will also use something called a router-link which renders as an `&lt;a&gt;` tag, which you can also read about [here](https://router.vuejs.org/api/).\r\n\r\nWhat I would suggest doing, is create a new component called something along the lines of `ImageButton`. Inside of that component we will use what was mentioned earlier:\r\n```\r\n&lt;template&gt;\r\n    &lt;router-link :to=&quot;route&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;slot name=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/router-link&gt;\r\n&lt;/template&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nexport default {\r\n    name: &#39;ImageButton&#39;,\r\n    props: {\r\n        route: { type: [String, Object], default: &#39;&#39; }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, once we have this we will need another component for your modal - I&#39;ll leave you to figure this one out. Then once you&#39;ve got the proper route going with the `router-link` and the `modal` you&#39;ll be able to simply call it like this in your `Carousel.vue`:\r\n```\r\n&lt;image-button v-slot:image :route=&quot;&#39;to_your_modal&#39;&quot;&gt;\r\n     &lt;img :src=&quot;&#39;image&#39;&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/image-button&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any other questions, the Vue docs go into much further detail which can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017541/vue-js-i-want-to-make-image-1-pop-up-when-i-click-on-image-1-and-i-want-image/58021244#58021244","title":"(Vue.js) I want to make image 1 pop up when I click on image 1, and I want image 2 to pop up when I click on image 2"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4127,"user_id":9541423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f816e0659e0cf40bbe0ef7224a3a56a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sovalina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9541423/sovalina"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568964428,"creation_date":1568964428,"answer_id":58023701,"question_id":58017541,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023701","body_markdown":"You can build a new data from your `items` prop and inject a new property `show: false` for each image.\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need 2 `v-for` loops this way.
