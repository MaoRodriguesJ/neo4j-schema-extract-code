How can I achieve this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187899/passing-parents-props-to-slot-in-vue-js","title":"Passing parents props to slot in Vue,js"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","rails-routing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3328,"user_id":6535997,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156345016155058/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6535997/mark"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569943895,"post_id":58187898,"comment_id":102755935,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187898/rails-naked-domain-with-nested-path-redirects-to-the-root-domain#comment102755935_58187898"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11804843,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Lv1IKYQFisU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAH5E/_CDhuZ9Wj1c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Friedl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11804843/david-friedl"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569943092,"creation_date":1569943092,"question_id":58187898,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187898","body_markdown":"I am facing the following problem which I can&#39;t solve or figure out its cause.\r\n\r\n`example.com/terms` -&gt; **works** and redirects to `https://www.example.com/terms`\r\n\r\n`example.com/r/route/...` -&gt; **does not work** and redirects back to the root path `https://www.example.com` and NOT to `https://www.example.com/r/route...`\r\n\r\nThis is only the case with the naked domain.

I expect the server program to unpack these values and  extract them to the appropriate fields. While it seems to be doing this when I print `data` I am getting a traceback error as well as the struct.error which I mentioned in the question title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutput:\r\n\r\n    The server is ready to receive on port:  9999\r\n    host1.student.test A IN 3600 192.168.10.1\r\n    host2.student.test A IN 3600 192.168.20.2\r\n    host3.student.test A IN 3600 192.168.30.3\r\n    host99.student.test A IN 3600 192.168.90.9\r\n    host123.student.test A IN 3600 192.168.120.123\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;C:/Users/Adam/Documents/NJIT/6.

Note also when I print `len(data)` on the server-side, it gets printed twice, and gets two different values each time.

I would like to know if this is okay or if there is any standard way to handle this in SLURM. \r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nNjobs=1000\r\n\r\n# Read the configuration variables\r\n# Each training should have a difference config\r\nCONFIG=experiments/model.cfg\r\nsource $CONFIG\r\n\r\n# Submit first job - no dependencies\r\nj0=$(sbatch run-debug.slurm $CONFIG)\r\necho &quot;ID of the first job: $j0&quot;\r\n\r\n# add first job to the list of jobs\r\njIDs+=($j0)\r\n\r\n# for loop: submit Njobs: where job (i+1) is dependent on job i.\r\n# and job (i+1) (i.e. new_job) resume from the checkpoint of job i\r\nfor i in $(seq 0 $Njobs); do\r\n    # Submit job (i+1) with dependency (&#39;afterok:&#39;) on job i\r\n    RESUME_CHECKPOINT=$OUTPUTPATH/$EXPNAME/${jIDs[$i - 1 ]}/checkpoint.pkl\r\n    new_job=$(sbatch  --dependency=afterok:${jIDs[$i - 1 ]} run-debug.slurm $CONFIG $RESUME_CHECKPOINT)\r\n    echo &quot;Submitted job $new_job that will be executed once job ${jIDs[$i - 1 ]} has completed with success.&quot;\r\n    echo &quot;This task will resume training from $RESUME_CHECKPOINT.&quot;\r\n    jIDs+=($new_job)\r\n    echo &quot;List of jobs that have been submitted: $jIDs&quot;\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance for your help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187865/submit-n-sequential-jobs-in-slurm","title":"Submit N sequential jobs in SLURM"},{"tags":["qt","visual-studio-2019"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3099,"user_id":7478455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vUjsA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mohammad A Kanan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7478455/mohammad-a-kanan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569994546,"post_id":58187864,"comment_id":102769862,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187864/qt-tools-tab-is-missing-in-vs-2019#comment102769862_58187864"},{"owner":{"reputation":2822,"user_id":2386113,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/82njB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"skm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2386113/skm"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3099,"user_id":7478455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vUjsA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mohammad A Kanan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7478455/mohammad-a-kanan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570000674,"post_id":58187864,"comment_id":102771960,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187864/qt-tools-tab-is-missing-in-vs-2019#comment102771960_58187864"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6033,"user_id":1951488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIsyf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zlatomir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1951488/zlatomir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6033,"user_id":1951488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIsyf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zlatomir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1951488/zlatomir"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570352350,"last_edit_date":1570352350,"creation_date":1570352018,"answer_id":58255694,"question_id":58187864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58255694","body_markdown":"In Visual Studio 2019 the`Qt VS Tools` menu is a sub-menu in the `Extensions` menu.\r\n\r\nNote: the binaries created with VS2013 are not compatible with VS2019, for it to work you need Qt build with Visual Studio 2015 or 2017.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187864/qt-tools-tab-is-missing-in-vs-2019/58255694#58255694","title":"QT Tools Tab is missing in VS 2019"}],"owner":{"reputation":2822,"user_id":2386113,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/82njB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"skm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2386113/skm"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58255694,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570352350,"creation_date":1569942968,"question_id":58187864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187864","body_markdown":"I had been using VS2013 for some time and a Qt Tools tab was present (as shown in the screenshot below) after installing ***Qt Visual Studio Tools***\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**PROBLEM:** Now I have installed VS 2019 Community edition.

Could you please explain me why this works in the other servers?\r\n\r\nIn order for [the deadlock][1] to occur, there are three necessary parts:\r\n\r\n 1. A one-thread-at-a-time context, which all servers would have (the pre-Core ASP.NET context).\r\n 2. An `await` (without `ConfigureAwait(false)`) that [acts asynchronously][2].\r\n 3. Code elsewhere that blocks a thread inside that context, waiting for the `async` method to finish. All servers also have this.\r\n\r\nMost likely, the difference in behavior is due to the second part: an `await` that acts asynchronously. [`await` first examines its awaitable (e.g., the `Task` passed to it), and if that awaitable is complete, then it continues executing the `async` method *synchronously*][2].\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this would happen if the `Task&lt;NameDTO&gt;` returned from `GetAsync` completed *before* the calling code hit the `.Result`. This would have to be extremely fast, but it&#39;s possible depending on caching, how fast your network hop is, how much the code is slowed down by load/neighbors/anti-virus, etc.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html\r\n  [2]: https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187861/deadlock-when-calling-an-async-method-inside-a-non-async-action/58189221#58189221","title":"Deadlock when calling an async method inside a non async action"}],"owner":{"reputation":610,"user_id":2265410,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVAzq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bilel Chaouadi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2265410/bilel-chaouadi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":610,"user_id":2265410,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVAzq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bilel Chaouadi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2265410/bilel-chaouadi"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":92,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570196739,"creation_date":1569942946,"last_edit_date":1570196739,"question_id":58187861,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187861","body_markdown":"We have a web application which consists of a Web API consumed by our UI.

Look at the example below:\r\n\r\n    scala&gt; val sampleRDD = sc.parallelize(Seq(1,2,3,4,5))\r\n    sampleRDD: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[Int] = ParallelCollectionRDD[0] at parallelize at

*(1) SerializeFromObject [input[0, int, false] AS value#2]\r\n    +- Scan[obj#1]\r\n\r\n&gt; You can see that in the query execution plan, the DataFrame object is\r\n&gt; represented by ExternalRDD and the physical plan contains a ***scan\r\n&gt; operation which is resolved to ExternalRDDScan (ExternalRDDScanExec)***\r\n&gt; during its execution.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for a spark Dataset as well.\r\n\r\n    scala&gt; val sampleRDD = sc.parallelize(Seq(1,2,3,4,5))\r\n    sampleRDD: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[Int] = ParallelCollectionRDD[0] at parallelize at &lt;console&gt;:24\r\n    \r\n

have a use case to migrate a large angularjs application and I want to start by doing this process in a small application first. So for that reason, I&#39;ve took the tour of heroes angularjs webapp and I started to add angular to it ( by creating a new project with the angular-cli ) and then adding the NgUpgrade module. \r\n\r\nThe problem that I have now is that the angularjs webapp runs pretty well inside the angular 8 application but the components that belong to angular 8 they are not rendered. \r\n\r\nI have the impression that my angular components are not bootstrapped since I&#39;ve bootsraped manually angularjs  but I&#39;m not sure ... when I add explicitly the bootstrap property inside the @NgModules it works only for the angular components  but not for angularjs (it makes sense ).

command you propose will not work as you expect. Imagine you have two lines like:\r\n\r\n    a b c d 12 13 1\r\n    x y z d 1 21 31\r\n\r\nBoth lines will be considered duplicates as the key, used in the array `_` is for both `d12131`.\r\n\r\nThis is probably what you are interested in:\r\n\r\n    $ history | awk &#39;{t=$0;$1=$2=$3=&quot;&quot;;k=$0;$0=t}!_[k]++&#39;\r\n\r\nHere we store the original record in the variable `t`. Remove the first three fields of the record by assigning empty values to it. This will redefine the record `$0` and store it in the key `k`. Then we reset the record to the value of `t`. We do the check with the key `k` which now holds all fields except the first 3.\r\n\r\n**note:** setting the field separtor as `-F&quot; &quot;` will not set it to a single space, but to any seqence of blanks (spaces and tabs). This is also the default behaviour.

the `while` loop, the generator will continue to yield values forever. Without, it&#39;s just once.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a need for some sequence (say, multiples of 7), a function like that can easily supply such a sequence to a consumer that imposes its own limits on how many values it needs.\r\n\r\nGenerators provide an extremely powerful way of structuring code, and have a way of permeating a design in some cases. They&#39;re particularly useful in the context of media generation, like `p5.js`, where there&#39;s lots of interacting iteration. Generators provide a particularly nice way to encapsulate that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187782/why-to-use-while-when-it-is-always-true/58187816#58187816","title":"Why to use while when it is always true?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12046601,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c13c2f050be2b91429e83030b5075621?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gulcy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046601/gulcy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569944964,"post_id":58188056,"comment_id":102756476,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187782/why-to-use-while-when-it-is-always-true/58188056#comment102756476_58188056"},{"owner":{"reputation":3559,"user_id":1331040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/o46p2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Harun Yilmaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1331040/harun-yilmaz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12046601,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c13c2f050be2b91429e83030b5075621?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gulcy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046601/gulcy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570104264,"post_id":58188056,"comment_id":102813306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187782/why-to-use-while-when-it-is-always-true/58188056#comment102813306_58188056"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3559,"user_id":1331040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/o46p2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Harun Yilmaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1331040/harun-yilmaz"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569943717,"creation_date":1569943717,"answer_id":58188056,"question_id":58187782,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58188056","body_markdown":"[Generators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-3.html) returns an `Iterator`.\r\n\r\nWhen you call `next()` on the iterator, it produces the return value and if the function comes to end, it will generate an undefined value and gets done.\r\n\r\nCheck the below snippet.

terms of your example as-is, it&#39;s not immediately obvious as to what is causing the component to re-render. However, the [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-dispatch) seem to suggest that it&#39;s not a guarantee that a re-render won&#39;t occur when you don&#39;t mutate the state:\r\n\r\n&gt; **Note that React may still need to render that specific component again before bailing out.** That shouldn’t be a concern because React won’t unnecessarily go “deeper” into the tree. If you’re doing expensive calculations while rendering, you can optimize them with useMemo.\r\n\r\nThis is why it&#39;s generally recommended that you run code that potentially has side effects in `useEffect` e.g.\r\n\r\n    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(someReducer, 0);\r\n    ...\r\n    useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n      if (state === 0) {\r\n        dispatch({ type: &#39;SOME ACTION&#39; });\r\n      }\r\n    }, [state]);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187760/usereducer-dispatch-causes-rerender-even-if-state-is-not-changed/58188135#58188135","title":"useReducer: dispatch causes rerender even if state is not changed"}],"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":10556917,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bLZD8nF8L8o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbC5I-HHQp7WrJ3k5bGH5Cq6gxgwdg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michał Kaczanowicz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10556917/micha%c5%82-kaczanowicz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":99,"user_id":10556917,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bLZD8nF8L8o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbC5I-HHQp7WrJ3k5bGH5Cq6gxgwdg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michał Kaczanowicz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10556917/micha%c5%82-kaczanowicz"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58188135,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569944948,"creation_date":1569942586,"last_edit_date":1569942891,"question_id":58187760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187760","body_markdown":"I noticed that if I dispatch an action that happens to not to modify the state, the component is re-rendered anyway.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```javascript\r\n// for simplicity sake, we simply pass state on (no mutation)\r\nconst someReducer = (state, action) =&gt; state\r\n\r\nconst App = () =&gt; {\r\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(someReducer, 0)\r\n\r\n  // in my use case, I want to dispatch an action if some specific condition in state occurs\r\n  if(state === 0) {\r\n    dispatch({ type: &#39;SOME ACTION&#39; })  // type doesn&#39;t matter\r\n  }\r\n  // return some JSX\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n```\r\nError in app.js (16929:26)\r\nToo many re-renders.

I *could* use a single `Rect` attribute in my `Thing` class, but it stores position in integers, and I&#39;m looking to store it in floats (a `Thing` might need to move less than one pixel per frame).\r\n\r\nThis I what I had in mind.\r\n``` lang-py\r\nclass Thing:\r\n    def __init__(self, pos, size):\r\n        self.x: float = pos[0]\r\n        self.y: float = pos[1]\r\n        self.size = size\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def rect(self):\r\n        return pygame.Rect((self.x, self.y), self.size)\r\n\r\n    @rect.setter\r\n    def rect(self, var: pygame.Rect):\r\n        self.x = var.x\r\n        self.y = var.y\r\n        self.size = var.size\r\n```\r\nThis would allow me to get and set the `Thing`&#39;s `Rect`, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to use the `Rect`&#39;s built-in setters as desired:\r\n``` lang-py\r\nfoo = Thing((10, 10), (20, 20))\r\nfoo.draw(win)\r\n\r\nfoo.x += 100\r\nfoo.draw(win)\r\n\r\n# This has no effect\r\nfoo.rect.y += 100\r\nfoo.draw(win)\r\n\r\ntemp = foo.rect\r\ntemp.x -= 100\r\nfoo.rect = temp\r\nfoo.draw(win)\r\n```\r\n[![Actual Behavior][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7iJm.gif\r\n\r\nThe desired behavior for the above code would be to have the square move right, *down*, then left.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to either:\r\n\r\n - Have a `Rect` as a `Thing` attribute, but update `x` and `y` whenever it&#39;s changed? \r\n - Apply methods to `Rect` property\r\n - Some other solution you can think of\r\n\r\nTL;DR: If I have a `Rect` as a property, I can&#39;t do `self.rect.center = (500,500)`\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187740/how-to-apply-class-methods-to-my-own-class-property-in-python","title":"How to apply class methods to my own class&#39; property in Python"},{"tags":["python","django","apache","amazon-ec2","mod-wsgi"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":202753,"user_id":113962,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b80ae1d65878cf68a4b1a00848467527?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alasdair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/113962/alasdair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569944638,"post_id":58187739,"comment_id":102756311,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187739/how-fix-importerror-cannot-import-name-mysql-in-django-2-2-5#comment102756311_58187739"},{"owner":{"reputation":202753,"user_id":113962,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b80ae1d65878cf68a4b1a00848467527?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alasdair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/113962/alasdair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569944713,"post_id":58187739,"comment_id":102756354,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187739/how-fix-importerror-cannot-import-name-mysql-in-django-2-2-5#comment102756354_58187739"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":401400,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aa475bfac8a336b93b56eb096b4b330c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Xenetrix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/401400/xenetrix"},"last_editor":{"reputation":202753,"user_id":113962,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b80ae1d65878cf68a4b1a00848467527?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alasdair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/113962/alasdair"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569944656,"creation_date":1569942501,"last_edit_date":1569944656,"question_id":58187739,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187739","body_markdown":"I&#39;m Deploying a Django Application on an AWS instance (amazon2 64-bit, Linux/4.14.128-112.105.amzn2.x86_64).
