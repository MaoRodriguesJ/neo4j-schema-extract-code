I have noted throughout the code some of the problems I saw with your code as posted.\r\n\r\nSome things I noticed:\r\n\r\nNot handling cases of where something is not found e.g. &#39;PARIS-SAINT-GERMAIN-FOOTBALL&#39; will fail whereas &#39;PARIS SAINT GERMAIN FOOTBALL&#39; as a search term will not\r\n\r\nOpportunities for simplification missed e.g. creating a dataframe by looping `tr` then `td` when could just use `read_html` on `table`; Using find_all when a single `table` or `a` tag is needed\r\n\r\nOverwriting variables in loops as well as typos e.g.\r\n\r\n    for tr in table_rows:\r\n        td = tr.find_all(&#39;td&#39;)\r\n        row = row = [tr.text.strip() for tr in td]  # presumable a typo with row = row\r\n\r\nNot testing if a dataframe is empty\r\n\r\nRisking generating incorrect urls by using `&#39;https://www.verif.com/&#39;` as the next part you concatenate on starts with &quot;/&quot; as well\r\n\r\nInconsistent variable naming e.g. what is `single_item`? The function I see is called `single_text`.\r\n\r\nThese are just some observations and there is certainly still room for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    import requests, time\r\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def searchsport(terme):\r\n        url = f&#39;https://www.verif.com/recherche/{terme}/1/ca/d/?ville=null&#39;\r\n        response = requests.get(url, headers = {&#39;User-Agent&#39;:&#39;Mozilla/5.0&#39;})\r\n        response.raise_for_status()\r\n        return terme, response.text\r\n    \r\n        \r\n    def crawl(keyword):      \r\n        try:\r\n            keyword, html = searchsport(keyword)\r\n            soup = bs(html,&#39;lxml&#39;)\r\n            a_tag = soup.select_one(&#39;td.verif_col1 a[href]&#39;) \r\n            # your code before when looping tds would just overwrite truelink if more than one found.

Any help would really be appreciated, \r\nI will kindly credit you for any effort/involvement, thank you in advance!\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n***Output spits this out?**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n        TypeError: Error #2007: Parameter hitTestObject must be non-null.\r\n        \tat flash.display::DisplayObject/_hitTest()\r\n        \tat flash.display::DisplayObject/hitTestObject()\r\n        \tat pokemongameexperiment/keyDownHandler()\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n***The Code in Question...**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import flash.display.MovieClip;\r\n    import flash.events.KeyboardEvent;\r\n    import flash.ui.Keyboard;\r\n    import flash.events.Event;\r\n    import flash.display.Stage;\r\n    import flash.events.MouseEvent;\r\n\r\n\r\n    mc.gotoAndStop(&quot;standingRight&quot;);\r\n    toggle_btn.stop();\r\n    hide_text.stop();\r\n    stop();\r\n    //backenvironment.kamiHouse.stop();\r\n\r\n\r\n    var keyCodeToListenForDown = &#39;40&#39;;

I am retrieving data from an online source and saving the data locally. \r\n\r\nThe List of children changes in all ways as the parent goes through it&#39;s lifespan. Children get added, removed or edited.\r\n\r\n**Step 1:**\r\nIn my scenario I get a parent with children 1 - 2. I create that parent/children using:\r\n\r\n    Parent p = new Parent();\r\n\r\n    Child c1 = new Child ();\r\n    c1.Name = &quot;Test1&quot;;\r\n\r\n    Child c2 = new Child ();\r\n    c2.Name = &quot;Test2&quot;;\r\n\r\n    p.Children.Add(c1);\r\n    p.Children.Add(c2);\r\n\r\n    context.AddToParents(p);\r\n    context.SaveChanges();\r\n\r\n**Step 2:**\r\nThe next time I update child #2 is no longer there. In this case I have queried my online source and received a list of Children that does not contain the child &quot;Test2&quot;. I am SIMULATING this (because the code is in no way reproducable) by using linq to remove the child from the parent.Children list.\r\n\r\nChildren is defined as (in Parent):\r\n\r\n    ObjectSet&lt;Child&gt; Children\r\n\r\nI remove child #2 like so:\r\n\r\n    var parent = (from p in context.Parents\r\n        where p.Name == &quot;Parent&quot;\r\n        select p).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n    string childNameToRemove = &quot;Test2&quot;;\r\n\r\n    var child = (from c in context.Children\r\n        where c.Name == childNameToRemove\r\n        select c).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n    parent.Children.Remove(child);\r\n    context.SaveChanges();\r\n\r\nWhen this happens the child is not removed from the table but the parent key is nulled.\r\n\r\n**Step 3:**\r\nLater when I get an update from the online source child #2 is now one of the children again. When I go to add that back in I get a Key violation because that record is still in the table. \r\n\r\n    var parent = (from p in context.Parents\r\n        where p.Name == &quot;Parent&quot;\r\n        select p).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n    Child child = new Child();\r\n    child.Name = &quot;Test2&quot;;\r\n\r\n    parent.Children.Add(child);\r\n    context.SaveChanges();\r\n\r\nI get this error:\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint &#39;PK_Slave&#39;. Cannot insert duplicate key in object &#39;dbo.Child&#39;. The duplicate key value is (Test2).\\r\\nThe statement has been terminated.&quot;\r\n\r\nI am guessing that I need to either delete the orphaned child from the table after I update the parent with new data (in step 2) -or- check for an existing child record with a null pointer to parent first and reuse that record instead of adding a new child record. Or perhaps both?\r\n\r\nIs there a better design pattern for this? I have been looking most the afternoon and the answer is evading me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441466/managing-orphan-children-in-a-one-to-many-relationship","title":"Managing

there is a way to prevent service from being injected outside its original module.\r\n\r\nFirst you&#39;ll have to create a module for your service i.e ``ProjectServiceModule``\r\n\r\nLater , register your service with the newly created ``ProjectServiceModule`` like below:\r\n\r\n    @Injectable({\r\n        providedIn: ProjectsServiceModule\r\n    })\r\n    export class ProjectsService {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nNow include the `ProjectServiceModule` in your NgModule : \r\n\r\n    @NgModule({\r\n     imports :[ProjectServiceModule]\r\n    })\r\n    export class ProjectsStoreModule {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solution will remove your circular dependency errors while building the application and also solve your problem as this module is imported only in the

there anyways to prevent a service from being injected outside of its original module?\r\n\r\nSay that we&#39;re loading the `projects.module.ts` lazily and `ProjectsModule` is importing the `ProjectsStoreModule`. I have a service defined in `ProjectsStoreModule` that I don&#39;t want to be injected in the `ProjectsModule`, but it&#39;s ok to be injected anywhere inside the `ProjectsStoreModule`. I was wondering if there&#39;s a way to achieve this?\r\n\r\n**Note:** `ProjectsStoreModule` does not have any Components so I can&#39;t provide the service to a component. The service that I want to be isolated is going to be injected in an Ngrx Effect which is a service.\r\n\r\n**What I did:**\r\n\r\nI registered the `ProjectsService`:\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({\r\n    providedIn: ProjectsStoreModule\r\n})\r\nexport class ProjectsService {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nProjectsModule:\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    ...\r\n})\r\nexport class ProjectsModule {\r\n    ...\r\n    imports: [ProjectsStoreModule] \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis approach obviously caused so many `Circular dependency` warnings.\r\n\r\nThen I tried to register the `ProjectsService` in the `@NgModule` decorator:\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    ...\r\n    providers: [ProjectsService]\r\n})\r\nexport class ProjectsStoreModule {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow the problem is that, by importing the `ProjectsStoreModule` into the `ProjectsModule`, the service that I wanted to be an internal service will be available in the `ProjectsModule`.\r\n\r\nAny help would be highly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441461/how-to-define-an-angular-internal-service-and-make-it-not-injectable-outside-of","title":"How to define an Angular internal service

Without a virtual destructor the object pointed at by `a` will be destroyed as an `A`, not as a `B`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fix for that is to give `A` a virtual destructor to allow it to destroy the correct instance.\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nclass A {\r\n  public:\r\n    virtual ~A() = default;\r\n    virtual int foo() {\r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n  private:\r\n    std::string my_string;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no need to modify `B` because once a function is declared `virtual`, it stays `virtual` for its children.

It seems .NET 4.8 is getting that wrong most of the time (some times things draw right; other times they don&#39;t).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what&#39;s really going on under the covers for DPI Unaware apps or apps when the user has set &quot;Fix scaling for apps&quot; is set &quot;Off&quot;??  Is it intended to impact all Graphics  object usage by the app?  If not, how do they distinguish which Graphics drawing commands to manipulate?  Or is there some other explanation for why our Images are getting cropped based on the users&#39; Scaling settings when &quot;Fix scaling for apps&quot; is turned off??","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441453/windows-10-or-net-4-8-breaking-change-turning-off-fix-scaling-for-apps-cause","title":"Windows 10 or .NET 4.8 breaking change?

I have used the **rgb2gray()** function from **scikit-image** to convert the main image into grayscale. Then I have sent both of them to the function I previously mentioned. I have written this code. \r\n\r\n    grayscale = rgb2gray(img)\r\n    \r\n    draw_image(img, &quot;Original&quot;, 5, 5)\r\n    draw_image(grayscale, &quot;Grayscale&quot;, 5, 5)\r\n\r\nBut surprisingly this produces the following images.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]        [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not what I expected.

the captured packets it can be seen that the server is requesting a certificate from the client (`Certificate Request`). From the the detailed images included in the question it can also be seen that no certificates are sent by the client (`Certificate` record with `Certificate Length` 0). \r\n\r\nWhat can also be seen is that the server complains with an Alert after the client has send the (possible empty) certificate so it likely does not like what the client has sent. So it is for sure not a problem of agreeing to a cipher (server agreed on one already) and not a problem that the client does not like the servers certificate (alert is send by server not client).\r\n\r\nBased on your code you are trying to do something with client certificates but based on the pcap it looks like you don&#39;t succeed in using one.

[&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;]]]\n\nMy current method is:\n\n    mylist2 = []\n    for a in mylist[0]:\n        for b in mylist[1]:\n            for c in mylist[2]:\n                mylist2.append([a,b,c])\n\nHowever this is very long, especially since in my actual code it goes on up to `for x in mylist[35]`\n\nIs there a better way for me to write this code?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441405/python-finding-combinations","title":"Python: Finding

I assumed that the TaskExecutorPartitionHandler is &#39;assigning&#39; Threads per partition aka per file. But it looks that the ExcelItemReader.read() is accessed randomly and i can&#39;t rely on state of the private members. Mostly the rowIterator. Any ideas and thoughts appreciated.

Finally, we need to match the comma, because of your requirement.\r\n\r\n[Here it is on Regex101](https://regex101.com/r/bJeE8g/3)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58442150#58442150","title":"I am trying to write a regex to capture the name string before the comma excluding the Jr.|Sr. and Roman numbers"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12234847,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/388b3667536f1ee162cd5d44753d3170?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theaugustboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234847/theaugustboy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414765,"post_id":58442465,"comment_id":103246371,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58442465#comment103246371_58442465"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3010,"user_id":1552534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8838a22cdb160d55264fb2cc0d0e9ebe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WJS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552534/wjs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3010,"user_id":1552534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8838a22cdb160d55264fb2cc0d0e9ebe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WJS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552534/wjs"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571415680,"last_edit_date":1571415680,"creation_date":1571359339,"answer_id":58442465,"question_id":58441378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58442465","body_markdown":"You didn&#39;t specify a language so I used a regex in the `replaceAll()` String method of `Java`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n\t  String[] names = {\r\n\t        &quot;O&#39;Kefe,Shiley&quot;, &quot;Folenza,Mitchel V&quot;, &quot;Briscoe Jr.,Sanford Ray&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;Andade-Alarenga,Blnca&quot;, &quot;De La Cru,Feando&quot;, &quot;Carone,Letca Jo&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;O&#39;Conor,Mole K&quot;, &quot;Daeron III,Lawence P&quot;, &quot;Randall,Jason L&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;Esquel Mendez,Mara D&quot;, &quot;Dinle III,Jams E&quot;, &quot;Coras Sr.,Cleybr E&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;Hsieh-Krnk,Caolyn E&quot;, &quot;Graves II,Theodore R&quot;\r\n\r\n\t  };\r\n\r\n\t  for (String name : names) {\r\n\t\t System.out.println(name + &quot; -&gt; &quot;\r\n\t\t       + name.replaceAll(&quot;(I{1,3},|((Sr|Jr)\\\\.,)|,).*&quot;, &quot;&quot;));\r\n\t  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a python solution using `re.sub`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n    import re\r\n    names = [&quot;O&#39;Kefe,Shiley&quot;, &quot;Folenza,Mitchel V&quot;, &quot;Briscoe Jr.,Sanford Ray&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Andade-Alarenga,Blnca&quot;, &quot;De La Cru,Feando&quot;, &quot;Carone,Letca Jo&quot;,\r\n                &quot;O&#39;Conor,Mole K&quot;, &quot;Daeron III,Lawence P&quot;, &quot;Randall,Jason L&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Esquel Mendez,Mara D&quot;, &quot;Dinle III,Jams E&quot;, &quot;Coras Sr.,Cleybr E&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Hsieh-Krnk,Caolyn E&quot;, &quot;Graves II,Theodore R&quot;]\r\n    \r\n    for name in names:   \r\n        print(name, &quot;-&gt;&quot;, re.sub(&quot;(I{1,3},|((Sr|Jr)\\\\.,)|,).*&quot;,&quot;&quot;,name))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58442465#58442465","title":"I am trying to write a regex to capture the name string before the comma excluding the Jr.|Sr. and Roman numbers"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":43558,"user_id":5424988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0b4f91c20dcd87cbd58dd351455198c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The fourth bird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5424988/the-fourth-bird"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571739787,"post_id":58455358,"comment_id":103332900,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58455358#comment103332900_58455358"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":365176,"user_id":3832970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64323e6cf08401474da3bf770ea13b58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wiktor Stribiżew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832970/wiktor-stribi%c5%bcew"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571418495,"creation_date":1571418495,"answer_id":58455358,"question_id":58441378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455358","body_markdown":"You may use\r\n\r\n    ^(?:(?![JS]r\\.|\\b(?:[XVICMD]+)\\b)[^,])+\\b(?&lt;!\\s)\r\n\r\nSee the [regex demo][1]\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n \r\n -

I haven&#39;t tried that specifically, but I have run Flutter inside WSL and also connected a VS Code Remoting session to an Android emulator in the cloud, so I would expect this to work.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll need to make sure you set up the Flutter SDK inside WSL (so you can run `flutter` commands inside WSL - it should be the Linux version of the Flutter SDK and not the Windows one if you&#39;re using the zip).\r\n\r\nTo have your emulator show up in `flutter devices` from inside WSL, you will likely need to run `adb tcpip 5555` from the Windows side (this means you need an Android SDK in Windows) - this will tell your phone to listen on TCP port 5555. Then you&#39;ll need to run `adb connect [phone ip]:5555` from inside WSL (this means you&#39;ll need an Android SDK in Linux). If all goes well, the phone should then show up in `adb devices` and also be picked up by the device selector in VS Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; I tried creating a test Flutter-project on the \\\\wsl$ network mount, which didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not clear what went wrong here, though my first guess would be that maybe the UNC path isn&#39;t supported - if you map a drive letter to it does it make a difference?\r\n\r\nWhile this isn&#39;t an officially supported setup, feel free to raise issues in the Dart-Code repository on GitHub with any issues you have. It&#39;s not a priority, but I would like for VS Code Remoting (including WSL and Docker) to generally work for Dart and Flutter dev.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441350/developing-flutter-with-vscode-and-wsl2/58475904#58475904","title":"Developing Flutter with VSCode and WSL2"}],"owner":{"reputation":856,"user_id":1568059,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dafb4b165e44efe5781b0668f318118a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ad_on_is","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1568059/ad-on-is"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571595375,"creation_date":1571350123,"question_id":58441350,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441350","body_markdown":"Since I mostly develop Web, using nginx, PHP and MySQL, I have ported my WebDev-environment entirely to WSL2. \r\nSince performance is very important, all my web-related projects reside on the WSL2-vhdx file `/home/user/Projects/Web`.

The first thing I tried was putting a url check in an if statement like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif ($url ~ /path/to/file/upload) {\r\n    content_max_body_size 200M;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t work as nginx says &quot;content_max_body_size&quot; directive not allowed here.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I tried was a nested location block like so:\r\n\r\n```nginx\r\nlocation ~ ^(mypatterns)$ {\r\n    # do stuff\r\n\r\n    location ~ ^/path/for/file/upload$ {\r\n        client_max_body_size 200M;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    # do stuff\r\n    proxy_pass whatever;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesnt work, though. I get an error like:\r\n```\r\n*14941 open() &quot;/.../path/for/file/upload&quot; failed (2: No such file or directory), ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that the nested location tries to find a file to serve instead of passing through to the rest of the outer location block.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I set an empty `content_by_lua_block {}` directive in the nested location, it works fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocation ~ ^(mypatterns)$ {\r\n    # do stuff\r\n\r\n    location ~ ^/path/for/file/upload$ {\r\n        client_max_body_size 200M;\r\n        content_by_lua_block {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    # do stuff\r\n    proxy_pass whatever;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow,\r\n\r\n1. only the `/path/for/file/uploads` is allowed a large body size\r\n2. requests that match that path also &quot;pass through&quot; to the rest of the stuff and the `proxy_pass`\r\n\r\nIt does what I want, but *why*?

The brief code for that is here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    mx = my = mh = -10000\r\n    m_confident = False\r\n\r\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\r\n\r\n    while not m_confident:\r\n        (mx, my, mh, m_confident) = await update_robot(robot, camera_settings)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, `mx`, `my`, and `mh` converge to the actual location of the robot by running some code in an async function (`update_robot`). However, the while loop doesn&#39;t wait for the function to return and rather calls the function again in another iteration of the loop. This messes up the values of `mx`, `my`, and `mh`. I was wondering if there is anyway to make the while loop wait for the function to return before continuing.\r\n\r\nI have tried adding `update_robot` to the current async function&#39;s call using `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` but with no success. \r\n\r\nAnyone run into something similar and know how to fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441326/how-do-i-pause-a-loop-while-i-await-for-an-async-function-to-return","title":"How do I pause a loop while I await for an async function to return?"},{"tags":["android-studio","flutter","dart"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":798,"user_id":4266182,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dX8OD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael Yuwono","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4266182/michael-yuwono"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571354970,"creation_date":1571354970,"answer_id":58441972,"question_id":58441322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58441972","body_markdown":"`result` stores a list of `Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt;`\r\n\r\n    final parsed = data[&#39;result&#39;] as List&lt;Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt;&gt;;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58441972#58441972","title":"Dart Map and Parsing JSON"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12233238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2607399026010572/picture?type=large","display_name":"fifilota","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12233238/fifilota"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571402038,"post_id":58443665,"comment_id":103239589,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58443665#comment103239589_58443665"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12233238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2607399026010572/picture?type=large","display_name":"fifilota","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12233238/fifilota"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571402041,"post_id":58443665,"comment_id":103239592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58443665#comment103239592_58443665"},{"owner":{"reputation":2897,"user_id":2179571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fcad62ab1dbdbe21b0956c80fdffa2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chunhunghan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2179571/chunhunghan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12233238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2607399026010572/picture?type=large","display_name":"fifilota","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12233238/fifilota"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571619022,"post_id":58443665,"comment_id":103289407,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58443665#comment103289407_58443665"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2897,"user_id":2179571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fcad62ab1dbdbe21b0956c80fdffa2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chunhunghan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2179571/chunhunghan"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571370400,"creation_date":1571370400,"answer_id":58443665,"question_id":58441322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443665","body_markdown":"You can parse json string with the following structure and code&lt;br&gt;\r\nYou can see picture display correct result name &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\ncode snippet \r\n\r\n    var payload = payloadFromJson(jsonStr);\r\n    print(&#39;${payload.result[0].name}&#39;);\r\n\r\nrelated class\r\n\r\n\t// To parse this JSON data, do\r\n\t//\r\n\t//     final payload = payloadFromJson(jsonString);\r\n\r\n\timport &#39;dart:convert&#39;;\r\n\r\n\tPayload payloadFromJson(String str) =&gt; Payload.fromJson(json.decode(str));\r\n\r\n\tString payloadToJson(Payload data) =&gt; json.encode(data.toJson());\r\n\r\n\tclass Payload {\r\n\t\tString error;\r\n\t\tString errorNumber;\r\n\t\tint responseCode;\r\n\t\tList&lt;Result&gt; result;\r\n\r\n\t\tPayload({\r\n\t\t\tthis.error,\r\n\t\t\tthis.errorNumber,\r\n\t\t\tthis.responseCode,\r\n\t\t\tthis.result,\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\tfactory Payload.fromJson(Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt; json) =&gt; Payload(\r\n\t\t\terror: json[&quot;error&quot;] == null ?

I read in the second article that I should do an additional cast to `trend_details` but it did not work as I expected. Obviously `data[&#39;result&#39;]` is an array but how to cast it properly?

ansible-playbook run.\r\n&gt; ```yaml\r\n&gt; - set_fact:\r\n&gt;     one_fact: something\r\n&gt;     other_fact: &quot;{{ local_var * 2 }}&quot;\r\n&gt;     another_fact: &quot;{{ some_registered_var.results | map(attribute=&#39;ansible_facts.some_fact&#39;) | list }}&quot;\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\n[when](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#the-when-statement):\r\n\r\n&gt;Sometimes you will want to skip a particular step on a particular host. This could be something as simple as not installing a certain package if the operating system is a particular version, or it could be something like performing some cleanup steps if a filesystem is getting full.\r\n\r\n&gt; This is easy to do in Ansible with the when clause, which contains a raw Jinja2 expression without double curly braces (see group_by – Create Ansible groups based on facts). It’s actually pretty simple:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```yaml\r\n&gt; tasks:\r\n&gt;   - name: &quot;shut down Debian flavored systems&quot;\r\n&gt;     command: /sbin/shutdown -t now\r\n&gt;     when: ansible_facts[&#39;os_family&#39;] == &quot;Debian&quot;\r\n&gt; ```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441304/populate-variables-based-on-met-condition-ansible/58441663#58441663","title":"Populate variables based on met condition Ansible"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":3696106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n8lni.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rafael Ruales","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3696106/rafael-ruales"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571407243,"post_id":58451671,"comment_id":103242472,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441304/populate-variables-based-on-met-condition-ansible/58451671#comment103242472_58451671"},{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":3696106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n8lni.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rafael Ruales","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3696106/rafael-ruales"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571420546,"post_id":58451671,"comment_id":103248734,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441304/populate-variables-based-on-met-condition-ansible/58451671#comment103248734_58451671"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8196,"user_id":6482561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cd2b0768a40f668d90cf6f2b8b17caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vladimir Botka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6482561/vladimir-botka"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8196,"user_id":6482561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cd2b0768a40f668d90cf6f2b8b17caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vladimir Botka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6482561/vladimir-botka"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571404898,"last_edit_date":1571404898,"creation_date":1571404434,"answer_id":58451671,"question_id":58441304,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58451671","body_markdown":"&gt;Q: *&quot;Populate owner: &quot;x&quot; ... when the machine is named XXX.

I&#39;m running these plays with\r\n```python\r\nPopen(command, shell=False, cwd=[directory], stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)\r\n```\r\nwhere `command` is something like `[&#39;ansible-playbook&#39;, &#39;-i&#39;, &#39;hosts.yml&#39;, &#39;playbook.yml&#39;]`. The pipe goes to a file where I use regex to look at the results and output.\r\n\r\nMy regexes are breaking because on the machine I&#39;ve deployed this, there seems to be a Unicode problem: for tasks where I iterate over a list of objects and use properties of the current object in the play, I get a printout like this:\r\n\r\n```changed: [0.0.0.0] =&gt; (item={uprocess: upython, unumber: u4})```\r\n\r\nI expect what I get on my development machine:\r\n\r\n```changed: [0.0.0.0] =&gt; (item={process: python, number: 4})```\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t a problem for plays where I iterate over a flat list.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n- adding ```ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3``` as an &quot;all&quot; variable in the hostfile\r\n\r\n- all manner of shenanigans with ```tojson```, ```to_json```, ```safe```, etc. in the Jinja portion of the loop. ```{{ obj_list | list }}}``` is the original loop that works perfectly on one machine and not the other; I&#39;ve put those filters both before and after ```list``` and the results have either been the same or an entirely new error because the output isn&#39;t a valid list.\r\n\r\n- setting Python3 to be the default version of Python on the production machine. The prod machine is running Ubuntu 18.04 and the default Python version is 3.6.8. Compare the dev machine, which is running Ubuntu 16.04.6 and where the default Python version is 3.7.3. The project runs in a Python 3.7 virtualenv anyway.\r\n\r\nSince the &quot;u&quot; prefix remains but not the quotes, I&#39;m inclined to believe this is an issue with subprocess. However, running a test script containing only\r\n```\r\nimport subprocess, sys\r\n\r\nsubprocess.run([&#39;python&#39;])\r\n```\r\nproduces a Python3 console. I&#39;m unsure how to use [related][1] [solutions][2] because I&#39;m not running a Python script. Why is the Unicode prefix appearing and how do I make it stop? I know how to get around it with regexes but this may be a recurring problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis example covers each element of what I&#39;m doing, and produces the problem on the prod machine and not the dev machine:\r\n\r\nhosts.yml:\r\n```yaml\r\nall:\r\n  hosts:\r\n    127.0.0.1:\r\n      objects:\r\n      - number: &#39;1&#39;\r\n        name: one\r\n        type: 1\r\n      - number: &#39;2&#39;\r\n        name: two\r\n        type: 2\r\n  vars:\r\n    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3\r\n```\r\ntest.yml:\r\n```\r\n---\r\n- hosts: all\r\n  tasks:\r\n  - name: print objects\r\n    ignore_errors: true\r\n    shell: echo {{ item.number }} &amp;&amp;

If this is not the case, there is a little more work required, but the priciple stays the same.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58442298#58442298","title":"Renaming JSON files based on their contents"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571441298,"post_id":58459042,"comment_id":103255170,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58459042#comment103255170_58459042"},{"owner":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571441361,"post_id":58459042,"comment_id":103255184,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58459042#comment103255184_58459042"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7209881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db7ba4bbc5d5fcabf1dd61ff28ece342?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kiasari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7209881/kiasari"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571444179,"post_id":58459042,"comment_id":103255620,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58459042#comment103255620_58459042"},{"owner":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571446078,"post_id":58459042,"comment_id":103255885,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58459042#comment103255885_58459042"},{"owner":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571446229,"post_id":58459042,"comment_id":103255900,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58459042#comment103255900_58459042"},{"owner":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571446365,"post_id":58459042,"comment_id":103255921,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58459042#comment103255921_58459042"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7209881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db7ba4bbc5d5fcabf1dd61ff28ece342?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kiasari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7209881/kiasari"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":105657,"user_id":2836621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suHg4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Setchell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2836621/mark-setchell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571498906,"post_id":58459042,"comment_id":103265317,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441271/renaming-json-files-based-on-their-contents/58459042#comment103265317_58459042"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7209881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db7ba4bbc5d5fcabf1dd61ff28ece342?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kiasari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7209881/kiasari"},"comment_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571439222,"creation_date":1571439222,"answer_id":58459042,"question_id":58441271,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58459042","body_markdown":"Following Andrew&#39;s code, I concluded:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    \r\n    for file in *.json;

email addresses is a complicated task, and writing code to do all the validation up front would be pretty tricky. If you check the **`Remarks`** section of the `MailAddress` class [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.mail.mailaddress?view=netframework-4.8), you&#39;ll see that there are lots of strings that are considered a valid email address (including comments, bracketed domain names, and embedded quotes).\r\n\r\nAnd since the source code is available, check out the `ParseAddress` method [here](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System/R/87b2cacf203ba13e.html), and you&#39;ll get an idea of the code you&#39;d have to write to validate an email address yourself. It&#39;s a shame there&#39;s no public `TryParse` method we could use to avoid the exception being thrown.\r\n\r\nSo it&#39;s probably best to just do some simple validation first - ensure that it contains the minimum requirements for an email address (which literally appears to be `user@domain`, where `domain` does not have to contain a `&#39;.&#39;` character), and then let the exception handling take care of the rest:\r\n\r\n    foreach (var userID in recipientUserIds)\r\n    {\r\n        var userInfo = GetUserInfo(userID);\r\n\r\n        // Basic validation on length\r\n        var email = userInfo?.Email1?.Trim();\r\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(email) || email.Length &lt; 3) continue;\r\n\r\n        // Basic validation on &#39;@&#39; character position\r\n        var atIndex = email.IndexOf(&#39;@&#39;);\r\n        if (atIndex &lt; 1 || atIndex == email.Length - 1) continue;\r\n\r\n        // Let try/catch handle the rest, because email addresses are complicated\r\n        MailAddress to;\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            to = new MailAddress(email, $&quot;{userInfo.FirstName} {userInfo.LastName}&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (FormatException)\r\n        {\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        using (MailMessage message = new MailMessage(from, to))\r\n        {\r\n            // populate message and send email here\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441258/best-way-to-validate-email-address-format-in-c/58441793#58441793","title":"Best way to validate email address format in C#"}],"owner":{"reputation":839,"user_id":773527,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c2a70dfc0683157944f2ea7927bd7a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Naphstor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/773527/naphstor"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23820,"user_id":2052655,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mWqp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rufus L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2052655/rufus-l"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571354507,"creation_date":1571349481,"last_edit_date":1571350212,"question_id":58441258,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441258","body_markdown":"Hi I am working on a bulk email sending feature. Below is my loop that validates email and sends them to each recipient:\r\n\r\n    foreach (var userID in recipientUserIds)\r\n    {\r\n        var userInfo = //getting from database using userID.\r\n\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            to = new MailAddress(userInfo.Email1, userInfo.FirstName + &quot; &quot; + userInfo.LastName);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (System.FormatException fe)\r\n        {\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        using (MailMessage message = new MailMessage(from, to))\r\n        {\r\n            //populate message and send email.\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSince the recipientUserIds is always more than 2000, using try-catch seems to be very expensive for each user in this case just to validate the email address format.

I have noted throughout the code some of the problems I saw with your code as posted.\r\n\r\nSome things I noticed:\r\n\r\nNot handling cases of where something is not found e.g. &#39;PARIS-SAINT-GERMAIN-FOOTBALL&#39; will fail whereas &#39;PARIS SAINT GERMAIN FOOTBALL&#39; as a search term will not\r\n\r\nOpportunities for simplification missed e.g. creating a dataframe by looping `tr` then `td` when could just use `read_html` on `table`; Using find_all when a single `table` or `a` tag is needed\r\n\r\nOverwriting variables in loops as well as typos e.g.\r\n\r\n    for tr in table_rows:\r\n        td = tr.find_all(&#39;td&#39;)\r\n        row = row = [tr.text.strip() for tr in td]  # presumable a typo with row = row\r\n\r\nNot testing if a dataframe is empty\r\n\r\nRisking generating incorrect urls by using `&#39;https://www.verif.com/&#39;` as the next part you concatenate on starts with &quot;/&quot; as well\r\n\r\nInconsistent variable naming e.g. what is `single_item`? The function I see is called `single_text`.\r\n\r\nThese are just some observations and there is certainly still room for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    import requests, time\r\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def searchsport(terme):\r\n        url = f&#39;https://www.verif.com/recherche/{terme}/1/ca/d/?ville=null&#39;\r\n        response = requests.get(url, headers = {&#39;User-Agent&#39;:&#39;Mozilla/5.0&#39;})\r\n        response.raise_for_status()\r\n        return terme, response.text\r\n    \r\n        \r\n    def crawl(keyword):      \r\n        try:\r\n            keyword, html = searchsport(keyword)\r\n            soup = bs(html,&#39;lxml&#39;)\r\n            a_tag = soup.select_one(&#39;td.verif_col1 a[href]&#39;) \r\n            # your code before when looping tds would just overwrite truelink if more than one found.

Any help would really be appreciated, \r\nI will kindly credit you for any effort/involvement, thank you in advance!\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n***Output spits this out?**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n        TypeError: Error #2007: Parameter hitTestObject must be non-null.\r\n        \tat flash.display::DisplayObject/_hitTest()\r\n        \tat flash.display::DisplayObject/hitTestObject()\r\n        \tat pokemongameexperiment/keyDownHandler()\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n***The Code in Question...**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import flash.display.MovieClip;\r\n    import flash.events.KeyboardEvent;\r\n    import flash.ui.Keyboard;\r\n    import flash.events.Event;\r\n    import flash.display.Stage;\r\n    import flash.events.MouseEvent;\r\n\r\n\r\n    mc.gotoAndStop(&quot;standingRight&quot;);\r\n    toggle_btn.stop();\r\n    hide_text.stop();\r\n    stop();\r\n    //backenvironment.kamiHouse.stop();\r\n\r\n\r\n    var keyCodeToListenForDown = &#39;40&#39;;

I am retrieving data from an online source and saving the data locally. \r\n\r\nThe List of children changes in all ways as the parent goes through it&#39;s lifespan. Children get added, removed or edited.\r\n\r\n**Step 1:**\r\nIn my scenario I get a parent with children 1 - 2. I create that parent/children using:\r\n\r\n    Parent p = new Parent();\r\n\r\n    Child c1 = new Child ();\r\n    c1.Name = &quot;Test1&quot;;\r\n\r\n    Child c2 = new Child ();\r\n    c2.Name = &quot;Test2&quot;;\r\n\r\n    p.Children.Add(c1);\r\n    p.Children.Add(c2);\r\n\r\n    context.AddToParents(p);\r\n    context.SaveChanges();\r\n\r\n**Step 2:**\r\nThe next time I update child #2 is no longer there. In this case I have queried my online source and received a list of Children that does not contain the child &quot;Test2&quot;. I am SIMULATING this (because the code is in no way reproducable) by using linq to remove the child from the parent.Children list.\r\n\r\nChildren is defined as (in Parent):\r\n\r\n    ObjectSet&lt;Child&gt; Children\r\n\r\nI remove child #2 like so:\r\n\r\n    var parent = (from p in context.Parents\r\n        where p.Name == &quot;Parent&quot;\r\n        select p).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n    string childNameToRemove = &quot;Test2&quot;;\r\n\r\n    var child = (from c in context.Children\r\n        where c.Name == childNameToRemove\r\n        select c).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n    parent.Children.Remove(child);\r\n    context.SaveChanges();\r\n\r\nWhen this happens the child is not removed from the table but the parent key is nulled.\r\n\r\n**Step 3:**\r\nLater when I get an update from the online source child #2 is now one of the children again. When I go to add that back in I get a Key violation because that record is still in the table. \r\n\r\n    var parent = (from p in context.Parents\r\n        where p.Name == &quot;Parent&quot;\r\n        select p).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n    Child child = new Child();\r\n    child.Name = &quot;Test2&quot;;\r\n\r\n    parent.Children.Add(child);\r\n    context.SaveChanges();\r\n\r\nI get this error:\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint &#39;PK_Slave&#39;. Cannot insert duplicate key in object &#39;dbo.Child&#39;. The duplicate key value is (Test2).\\r\\nThe statement has been terminated.&quot;\r\n\r\nI am guessing that I need to either delete the orphaned child from the table after I update the parent with new data (in step 2) -or- check for an existing child record with a null pointer to parent first and reuse that record instead of adding a new child record. Or perhaps both?\r\n\r\nIs there a better design pattern for this? I have been looking most the afternoon and the answer is evading me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441466/managing-orphan-children-in-a-one-to-many-relationship","title":"Managing

there is a way to prevent service from being injected outside its original module.\r\n\r\nFirst you&#39;ll have to create a module for your service i.e ``ProjectServiceModule``\r\n\r\nLater , register your service with the newly created ``ProjectServiceModule`` like below:\r\n\r\n    @Injectable({\r\n        providedIn: ProjectsServiceModule\r\n    })\r\n    export class ProjectsService {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nNow include the `ProjectServiceModule` in your NgModule : \r\n\r\n    @NgModule({\r\n     imports :[ProjectServiceModule]\r\n    })\r\n    export class ProjectsStoreModule {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solution will remove your circular dependency errors while building the application and also solve your problem as this module is imported only in the

there anyways to prevent a service from being injected outside of its original module?\r\n\r\nSay that we&#39;re loading the `projects.module.ts` lazily and `ProjectsModule` is importing the `ProjectsStoreModule`. I have a service defined in `ProjectsStoreModule` that I don&#39;t want to be injected in the `ProjectsModule`, but it&#39;s ok to be injected anywhere inside the `ProjectsStoreModule`. I was wondering if there&#39;s a way to achieve this?\r\n\r\n**Note:** `ProjectsStoreModule` does not have any Components so I can&#39;t provide the service to a component. The service that I want to be isolated is going to be injected in an Ngrx Effect which is a service.\r\n\r\n**What I did:**\r\n\r\nI registered the `ProjectsService`:\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({\r\n    providedIn: ProjectsStoreModule\r\n})\r\nexport class ProjectsService {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nProjectsModule:\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    ...\r\n})\r\nexport class ProjectsModule {\r\n    ...\r\n    imports: [ProjectsStoreModule] \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis approach obviously caused so many `Circular dependency` warnings.\r\n\r\nThen I tried to register the `ProjectsService` in the `@NgModule` decorator:\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    ...\r\n    providers: [ProjectsService]\r\n})\r\nexport class ProjectsStoreModule {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow the problem is that, by importing the `ProjectsStoreModule` into the `ProjectsModule`, the service that I wanted to be an internal service will be available in the `ProjectsModule`.\r\n\r\nAny help would be highly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441461/how-to-define-an-angular-internal-service-and-make-it-not-injectable-outside-of","title":"How to define an Angular internal service

Without a virtual destructor the object pointed at by `a` will be destroyed as an `A`, not as a `B`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fix for that is to give `A` a virtual destructor to allow it to destroy the correct instance.\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nclass A {\r\n  public:\r\n    virtual ~A() = default;\r\n    virtual int foo() {\r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n  private:\r\n    std::string my_string;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no need to modify `B` because once a function is declared `virtual`, it stays `virtual` for its children.

It seems .NET 4.8 is getting that wrong most of the time (some times things draw right; other times they don&#39;t).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what&#39;s really going on under the covers for DPI Unaware apps or apps when the user has set &quot;Fix scaling for apps&quot; is set &quot;Off&quot;??  Is it intended to impact all Graphics  object usage by the app?  If not, how do they distinguish which Graphics drawing commands to manipulate?  Or is there some other explanation for why our Images are getting cropped based on the users&#39; Scaling settings when &quot;Fix scaling for apps&quot; is turned off??","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441453/windows-10-or-net-4-8-breaking-change-turning-off-fix-scaling-for-apps-cause","title":"Windows 10 or .NET 4.8 breaking change?

I have used the **rgb2gray()** function from **scikit-image** to convert the main image into grayscale. Then I have sent both of them to the function I previously mentioned. I have written this code. \r\n\r\n    grayscale = rgb2gray(img)\r\n    \r\n    draw_image(img, &quot;Original&quot;, 5, 5)\r\n    draw_image(grayscale, &quot;Grayscale&quot;, 5, 5)\r\n\r\nBut surprisingly this produces the following images.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]        [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not what I expected.

the captured packets it can be seen that the server is requesting a certificate from the client (`Certificate Request`). From the the detailed images included in the question it can also be seen that no certificates are sent by the client (`Certificate` record with `Certificate Length` 0). \r\n\r\nWhat can also be seen is that the server complains with an Alert after the client has send the (possible empty) certificate so it likely does not like what the client has sent. So it is for sure not a problem of agreeing to a cipher (server agreed on one already) and not a problem that the client does not like the servers certificate (alert is send by server not client).\r\n\r\nBased on your code you are trying to do something with client certificates but based on the pcap it looks like you don&#39;t succeed in using one.

[&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;]]]\n\nMy current method is:\n\n    mylist2 = []\n    for a in mylist[0]:\n        for b in mylist[1]:\n            for c in mylist[2]:\n                mylist2.append([a,b,c])\n\nHowever this is very long, especially since in my actual code it goes on up to `for x in mylist[35]`\n\nIs there a better way for me to write this code?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441405/python-finding-combinations","title":"Python: Finding

I assumed that the TaskExecutorPartitionHandler is &#39;assigning&#39; Threads per partition aka per file. But it looks that the ExcelItemReader.read() is accessed randomly and i can&#39;t rely on state of the private members. Mostly the rowIterator. Any ideas and thoughts appreciated.

Finally, we need to match the comma, because of your requirement.\r\n\r\n[Here it is on Regex101](https://regex101.com/r/bJeE8g/3)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58442150#58442150","title":"I am trying to write a regex to capture the name string before the comma excluding the Jr.|Sr. and Roman numbers"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12234847,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/388b3667536f1ee162cd5d44753d3170?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theaugustboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234847/theaugustboy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414765,"post_id":58442465,"comment_id":103246371,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58442465#comment103246371_58442465"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3010,"user_id":1552534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8838a22cdb160d55264fb2cc0d0e9ebe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WJS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552534/wjs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3010,"user_id":1552534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8838a22cdb160d55264fb2cc0d0e9ebe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WJS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552534/wjs"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571415680,"last_edit_date":1571415680,"creation_date":1571359339,"answer_id":58442465,"question_id":58441378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58442465","body_markdown":"You didn&#39;t specify a language so I used a regex in the `replaceAll()` String method of `Java`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n\t  String[] names = {\r\n\t        &quot;O&#39;Kefe,Shiley&quot;, &quot;Folenza,Mitchel V&quot;, &quot;Briscoe Jr.,Sanford Ray&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;Andade-Alarenga,Blnca&quot;, &quot;De La Cru,Feando&quot;, &quot;Carone,Letca Jo&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;O&#39;Conor,Mole K&quot;, &quot;Daeron III,Lawence P&quot;, &quot;Randall,Jason L&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;Esquel Mendez,Mara D&quot;, &quot;Dinle III,Jams E&quot;, &quot;Coras Sr.,Cleybr E&quot;,\r\n\t        &quot;Hsieh-Krnk,Caolyn E&quot;, &quot;Graves II,Theodore R&quot;\r\n\r\n\t  };\r\n\r\n\t  for (String name : names) {\r\n\t\t System.out.println(name + &quot; -&gt; &quot;\r\n\t\t       + name.replaceAll(&quot;(I{1,3},|((Sr|Jr)\\\\.,)|,).*&quot;, &quot;&quot;));\r\n\t  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a python solution using `re.sub`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n    import re\r\n    names = [&quot;O&#39;Kefe,Shiley&quot;, &quot;Folenza,Mitchel V&quot;, &quot;Briscoe Jr.,Sanford Ray&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Andade-Alarenga,Blnca&quot;, &quot;De La Cru,Feando&quot;, &quot;Carone,Letca Jo&quot;,\r\n                &quot;O&#39;Conor,Mole K&quot;, &quot;Daeron III,Lawence P&quot;, &quot;Randall,Jason L&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Esquel Mendez,Mara D&quot;, &quot;Dinle III,Jams E&quot;, &quot;Coras Sr.,Cleybr E&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Hsieh-Krnk,Caolyn E&quot;, &quot;Graves II,Theodore R&quot;]\r\n    \r\n    for name in names:   \r\n        print(name, &quot;-&gt;&quot;, re.sub(&quot;(I{1,3},|((Sr|Jr)\\\\.,)|,).*&quot;,&quot;&quot;,name))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58442465#58442465","title":"I am trying to write a regex to capture the name string before the comma excluding the Jr.|Sr. and Roman numbers"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":43558,"user_id":5424988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0b4f91c20dcd87cbd58dd351455198c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The fourth bird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5424988/the-fourth-bird"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571739787,"post_id":58455358,"comment_id":103332900,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441378/i-am-trying-to-write-a-regex-to-capture-the-name-string-before-the-comma-excludi/58455358#comment103332900_58455358"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":365176,"user_id":3832970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64323e6cf08401474da3bf770ea13b58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wiktor Stribiżew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832970/wiktor-stribi%c5%bcew"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571418495,"creation_date":1571418495,"answer_id":58455358,"question_id":58441378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455358","body_markdown":"You may use\r\n\r\n    ^(?:(?![JS]r\\.|\\b(?:[XVICMD]+)\\b)[^,])+\\b(?&lt;!\\s)\r\n\r\nSee the [regex demo][1]\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n \r\n -

I haven&#39;t tried that specifically, but I have run Flutter inside WSL and also connected a VS Code Remoting session to an Android emulator in the cloud, so I would expect this to work.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll need to make sure you set up the Flutter SDK inside WSL (so you can run `flutter` commands inside WSL - it should be the Linux version of the Flutter SDK and not the Windows one if you&#39;re using the zip).\r\n\r\nTo have your emulator show up in `flutter devices` from inside WSL, you will likely need to run `adb tcpip 5555` from the Windows side (this means you need an Android SDK in Windows) - this will tell your phone to listen on TCP port 5555. Then you&#39;ll need to run `adb connect [phone ip]:5555` from inside WSL (this means you&#39;ll need an Android SDK in Linux). If all goes well, the phone should then show up in `adb devices` and also be picked up by the device selector in VS Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; I tried creating a test Flutter-project on the \\\\wsl$ network mount, which didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not clear what went wrong here, though my first guess would be that maybe the UNC path isn&#39;t supported - if you map a drive letter to it does it make a difference?\r\n\r\nWhile this isn&#39;t an officially supported setup, feel free to raise issues in the Dart-Code repository on GitHub with any issues you have. It&#39;s not a priority, but I would like for VS Code Remoting (including WSL and Docker) to generally work for Dart and Flutter dev.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441350/developing-flutter-with-vscode-and-wsl2/58475904#58475904","title":"Developing Flutter with VSCode and WSL2"}],"owner":{"reputation":856,"user_id":1568059,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dafb4b165e44efe5781b0668f318118a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ad_on_is","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1568059/ad-on-is"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571595375,"creation_date":1571350123,"question_id":58441350,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441350","body_markdown":"Since I mostly develop Web, using nginx, PHP and MySQL, I have ported my WebDev-environment entirely to WSL2. \r\nSince performance is very important, all my web-related projects reside on the WSL2-vhdx file `/home/user/Projects/Web`.

The first thing I tried was putting a url check in an if statement like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif ($url ~ /path/to/file/upload) {\r\n    content_max_body_size 200M;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t work as nginx says &quot;content_max_body_size&quot; directive not allowed here.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I tried was a nested location block like so:\r\n\r\n```nginx\r\nlocation ~ ^(mypatterns)$ {\r\n    # do stuff\r\n\r\n    location ~ ^/path/for/file/upload$ {\r\n        client_max_body_size 200M;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    # do stuff\r\n    proxy_pass whatever;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesnt work, though. I get an error like:\r\n```\r\n*14941 open() &quot;/.../path/for/file/upload&quot; failed (2: No such file or directory), ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that the nested location tries to find a file to serve instead of passing through to the rest of the outer location block.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I set an empty `content_by_lua_block {}` directive in the nested location, it works fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocation ~ ^(mypatterns)$ {\r\n    # do stuff\r\n\r\n    location ~ ^/path/for/file/upload$ {\r\n        client_max_body_size 200M;\r\n        content_by_lua_block {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    # do stuff\r\n    proxy_pass whatever;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow,\r\n\r\n1. only the `/path/for/file/uploads` is allowed a large body size\r\n2. requests that match that path also &quot;pass through&quot; to the rest of the stuff and the `proxy_pass`\r\n\r\nIt does what I want, but *why*?

The brief code for that is here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    mx = my = mh = -10000\r\n    m_confident = False\r\n\r\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\r\n\r\n    while not m_confident:\r\n        (mx, my, mh, m_confident) = await update_robot(robot, camera_settings)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, `mx`, `my`, and `mh` converge to the actual location of the robot by running some code in an async function (`update_robot`). However, the while loop doesn&#39;t wait for the function to return and rather calls the function again in another iteration of the loop. This messes up the values of `mx`, `my`, and `mh`. I was wondering if there is anyway to make the while loop wait for the function to return before continuing.\r\n\r\nI have tried adding `update_robot` to the current async function&#39;s call using `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` but with no success. \r\n\r\nAnyone run into something similar and know how to fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441326/how-do-i-pause-a-loop-while-i-await-for-an-async-function-to-return","title":"How do I pause a loop while I await for an async function to return?"},{"tags":["android-studio","flutter","dart"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":798,"user_id":4266182,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dX8OD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael Yuwono","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4266182/michael-yuwono"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571354970,"creation_date":1571354970,"answer_id":58441972,"question_id":58441322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58441972","body_markdown":"`result` stores a list of `Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt;`\r\n\r\n    final parsed = data[&#39;result&#39;] as List&lt;Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt;&gt;;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58441972#58441972","title":"Dart Map and Parsing JSON"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12233238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2607399026010572/picture?type=large","display_name":"fifilota","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12233238/fifilota"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571402038,"post_id":58443665,"comment_id":103239589,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58443665#comment103239589_58443665"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12233238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2607399026010572/picture?type=large","display_name":"fifilota","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12233238/fifilota"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571402041,"post_id":58443665,"comment_id":103239592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58443665#comment103239592_58443665"},{"owner":{"reputation":2897,"user_id":2179571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fcad62ab1dbdbe21b0956c80fdffa2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chunhunghan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2179571/chunhunghan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12233238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2607399026010572/picture?type=large","display_name":"fifilota","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12233238/fifilota"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571619022,"post_id":58443665,"comment_id":103289407,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441322/dart-map-and-parsing-json/58443665#comment103289407_58443665"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2897,"user_id":2179571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fcad62ab1dbdbe21b0956c80fdffa2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chunhunghan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2179571/chunhunghan"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571370400,"creation_date":1571370400,"answer_id":58443665,"question_id":58441322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443665","body_markdown":"You can parse json string with the following structure and code&lt;br&gt;\r\nYou can see picture display correct result name &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\ncode snippet \r\n\r\n    var payload = payloadFromJson(jsonStr);\r\n    print(&#39;${payload.result[0].name}&#39;);\r\n\r\nrelated class\r\n\r\n\t// To parse this JSON data, do\r\n\t//\r\n\t//     final payload = payloadFromJson(jsonString);\r\n\r\n\timport &#39;dart:convert&#39;;\r\n\r\n\tPayload payloadFromJson(String str) =&gt; Payload.fromJson(json.decode(str));\r\n\r\n\tString payloadToJson(Payload data) =&gt; json.encode(data.toJson());\r\n\r\n\tclass Payload {\r\n\t\tString error;\r\n\t\tString errorNumber;\r\n\t\tint responseCode;\r\n\t\tList&lt;Result&gt; result;\r\n\r\n\t\tPayload({\r\n\t\t\tthis.error,\r\n\t\t\tthis.errorNumber,\r\n\t\t\tthis.responseCode,\r\n\t\t\tthis.result,\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\tfactory Payload.fromJson(Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt; json) =&gt; Payload(\r\n\t\t\terror: json[&quot;error&quot;] == null ?

I read in the second article that I should do an additional cast to `trend_details` but it did not work as I expected. Obviously `data[&#39;result&#39;]` is an array but how to cast it properly?

ansible-playbook run.\r\n&gt; ```yaml\r\n&gt; - set_fact:\r\n&gt;     one_fact: something\r\n&gt;     other_fact: &quot;{{ local_var * 2 }}&quot;\r\n&gt;     another_fact: &quot;{{ some_registered_var.results | map(attribute=&#39;ansible_facts.some_fact&#39;) | list }}&quot;\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\n[when](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#the-when-statement):\r\n\r\n&gt;Sometimes you will want to skip a particular step on a particular host. This could be something as simple as not installing a certain package if the operating system is a particular version, or it could be something like performing some cleanup steps if a filesystem is getting full.\r\n\r\n&gt; This is easy to do in Ansible with the when clause, which contains a raw Jinja2 expression without double curly braces (see group_by – Create Ansible groups based on facts). It’s actually pretty simple:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```yaml\r\n&gt; tasks:\r\n&gt;   - name: &quot;shut down Debian flavored systems&quot;\r\n&gt;     command: /sbin/shutdown -t now\r\n&gt;     when: ansible_facts[&#39;os_family&#39;] == &quot;Debian&quot;\r\n&gt; ```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441304/populate-variables-based-on-met-condition-ansible/58441663#58441663","title":"Populate variables based on met condition Ansible"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":3696106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n8lni.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rafael Ruales","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3696106/rafael-ruales"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571407243,"post_id":58451671,"comment_id":103242472,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441304/populate-variables-based-on-met-condition-ansible/58451671#comment103242472_58451671"},{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":3696106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n8lni.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rafael Ruales","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3696106/rafael-ruales"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571420546,"post_id":58451671,"comment_id":103248734,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441304/populate-variables-based-on-met-condition-ansible/58451671#comment103248734_58451671"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8196,"user_id":6482561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cd2b0768a40f668d90cf6f2b8b17caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vladimir Botka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6482561/vladimir-botka"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8196,"user_id":6482561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cd2b0768a40f668d90cf6f2b8b17caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vladimir Botka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6482561/vladimir-botka"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571404898,"last_edit_date":1571404898,"creation_date":1571404434,"answer_id":58451671,"question_id":58441304,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58451671","body_markdown":"&gt;Q: *&quot;Populate owner: &quot;x&quot; ... when the machine is named XXX.

I&#39;m running these plays with\r\n```python\r\nPopen(command, shell=False, cwd=[directory], stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)\r\n```\r\nwhere `command` is something like `[&#39;ansible-playbook&#39;, &#39;-i&#39;, &#39;hosts.yml&#39;, &#39;playbook.yml&#39;]`. The pipe goes to a file where I use regex to look at the results and output.\r\n\r\nMy regexes are breaking because on the machine I&#39;ve deployed this, there seems to be a Unicode problem: for tasks where I iterate over a list of objects and use properties of the current object in the play, I get a printout like this:\r\n\r\n```changed: [0.0.0.0] =&gt; (item={uprocess: upython, unumber: u4})```\r\n\r\nI expect what I get on my development machine:\r\n\r\n```changed: [0.0.0.0] =&gt; (item={process: python, number: 4})```\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t a problem for plays where I iterate over a flat list.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n- adding ```ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3``` as an &quot;all&quot; variable in the hostfile\r\n\r\n- all manner of shenanigans with ```tojson```, ```to_json```, ```safe```, etc. in the Jinja portion of the loop. ```{{ obj_list | list }}}``` is the original loop that works perfectly on one machine and not the other; I&#39;ve put those filters both before and after ```list``` and the results have either been the same or an entirely new error because the output isn&#39;t a valid list.\r\n\r\n- setting Python3 to be the default version of Python on the production machine. The prod machine is running Ubuntu 18.04 and the default Python version is 3.6.8. Compare the dev machine, which is running Ubuntu 16.04.6 and where the default Python version is 3.7.3. The project runs in a Python 3.7 virtualenv anyway.\r\n\r\nSince the &quot;u&quot; prefix remains but not the quotes, I&#39;m inclined to believe this is an issue with subprocess. However, running a test script containing only\r\n```\r\nimport subprocess, sys\r\n\r\nsubprocess.run([&#39;python&#39;])\r\n```\r\nproduces a Python3 console. I&#39;m unsure how to use [related][1] [solutions][2] because I&#39;m not running a Python script. Why is the Unicode prefix appearing and how do I make it stop? I know how to get around it with regexes but this may be a recurring problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis example covers each element of what I&#39;m doing, and produces the problem on the prod machine and not the dev machine:\r\n\r\nhosts.yml:\r\n```yaml\r\nall:\r\n  hosts:\r\n    127.0.0.1:\r\n      objects:\r\n      - number: &#39;1&#39;\r\n        name: one\r\n        type: 1\r\n      - number: &#39;2&#39;\r\n        name: two\r\n        type: 2\r\n  vars:\r\n    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3\r\n```\r\ntest.yml:\r\n```\r\n---\r\n- hosts: all\r\n  tasks:\r\n  - name: print objects\r\n    ignore_errors: true\r\n    shell: echo {{ item.number }} &amp;&amp;

This will\r\n    allow for multiple agents to be selected based on user response without\r\n    having to create multiple separate functions\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    def __init__(self, project_id, language_code, session_id):\r\n        self.project_id = project_id\r\n        self.language_code = language_code\r\n        self.session_id = session_id\r\n\r\n    def detect_intent_response(self, text):\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns the result of detect intent with texts as inputs.\r\n        Using the same `session_id` between requests allows continuation\r\n        of the conversation.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n        session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()\r\n        session = session_client.session_path(self.project_id, self.session_id)\r\n\r\n        text_input = dialogflow.types.TextInput(\r\n            text=text, language_code=self.language_code)\r\n\r\n        query_input = dialogflow.types.QueryInput(text=text_input)\r\n\r\n        response = session_client.detect_intent(\r\n            session=session, query_input=query_input)\r\n\r\n        return_text = response.query_result.fulfillment_messages\r\n\r\n        return str(return_text)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen building the object and calling the detect_intent_response method, the object returned is a google.protobuf.pyext._message.RepeatedCompositeContainer: \r\n\r\n`\r\n[text {\r\n  text: &quot;Foo&quot;\r\n}\r\n, text {\r\n  text: &quot;Bar&quot;\r\n}\r\n, text {\r\n  text: &quot;Char&quot;\r\n}\r\n]\r\n`\r\n\r\nAfter several hours of searching, I discovered the google.protobuf library has a Module &quot;json_format&quot; that allows serializing to JSON or converting to a python dictionary, so I modified the class in the following manner: \r\n\r\n```\r\nresponse = session_client.detect_intent(\r\n            session=session, query_input=query_input)\r\n\r\n        responses = MessageToDict(response, preserving_proto_field_name=True)\r\n        desired_response = responses[&#39;query_result&#39;]\r\n\r\n        return str(desired_response.get(&#39;fulfillment_messages&#39;, {}))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich returns a complex list with nested dictionaries. \r\n\r\n`\r\n[{&#39;text&#39;: {&#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Foo&#39;]}}, {&#39;text&#39;: {&#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Bar&#39;]}}, {&#39;text&#39;: {&#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Char&#39;]}}]\r\n` \r\n\r\nThe desired result would return the following in a string format\r\n\r\n`\r\nFoo\r\nBar\r\nChar\r\n`\r\n\r\nHow can I accomplish this?
