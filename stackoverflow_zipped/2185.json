(Support is the set over which a density is nonzero.) A kernel density estimate is just a linear combination of kernels, so the k.d.e. will also have unbounded support if the kernels do.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to just construct a truncated density which is restricted to the known allowable range for the data. A truncated density is defined to be zero outside the allowable range, and proportional to the original, non-truncated density within the allowable range. The constant of proportionality is just 1 - (mass excluded from the allowable range).\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know if pandas or sk-learn has anything built in to handle truncated densities, but it&#39;s not any big deal to implement it yourself.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if your data are actually integers, and variable of interest can&#39;t actually be a noninteger, you can&#39;t do any better than just making a histogram which has one bin per integer in the range 1 to 13. \r\n\r\nThis is a good question, but probably more suitable for stats.stackexchange.com.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020899/fitting-kde-with-scikitlearn-and-pandas-to-plot-however-distributions-lie-outs/58035715#58035715","title":"Fitting KDE with scikitlearn and pandas to plot.

You should probably look into a XML parser.\r\n\r\nIf you are not parsing XML and want to exclude the slashes anywhere in the captured text (i.e., not just right after the `&lt;`), you could do a Java text replacement like `result.replace(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;&quot;);`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020865/how-to-match-all-characters-between-and-except/58020944#58020944","title":"How to match all characters between `&lt;` and `&gt;` except `/`?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12093188,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_2dpUIqVB8U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd0VCh4sCsp8eLERa7oYKUZFYkS7w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ajay singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093188/ajay-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11580,"user_id":4642212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dS8ne.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sebastian Simon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4642212/sebastian-simon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58020944,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568990365,"creation_date":1568945099,"last_edit_date":1568945270,"question_id":58020865,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020865","body_markdown":"I want to extract all characters between `&lt;` and `&gt;` except `/`.

So I don&#39;t know why it can not work for the vim syntax config.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020850/vim-highlight-cannot-match-regular-expression-lookbehind","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"vim-highlight: cannot match regular expression lookbehind"},{"tags":["c++","c++11","std"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":3022449,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSXRZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3022449/daniel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568945373,"post_id":58020849,"comment_id":102444973,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020849/no-matching-call-to-stdfind-although-other-find-statements-work-and-have-in#comment102444973_58020849"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8172489,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tb7NXafAdOo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApo/girUi0nAMkM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alex Karwowski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8172489/alex-karwowski"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":141,"user_id":3022449,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSXRZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3022449/daniel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568945569,"post_id":58020849,"comment_id":102445013,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020849/no-matching-call-to-stdfind-although-other-find-statements-work-and-have-in#comment102445013_58020849"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":110679,"user_id":2079303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cf7f63e49a75376e0f761c8abeb6d5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"eerorika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2079303/eerorika"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568945677,"creation_date":1568945677,"answer_id":58020932,"question_id":58020849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58020932","body_markdown":"&gt; the following lines are the culprit\r\n\r\n&gt;     std::vector&lt;char&gt;&amp; pc\r\n\r\n&gt; But in other functions the same exact statement compiles eg...\r\n\r\n&gt;     std::vector&lt;char&gt;::iterator&amp; pc\r\n\r\nCan you spot the difference?\r\n\r\nThe error message also explains this at the very beginning:\r\n\r\n&gt; error: no matching function for call to ‘find(**std::vector&amp;**, std::vector::iterator, char)’ ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020849/no-matching-call-to-stdfind-although-other-find-statements-work-and-have-in/58020932#58020932","title":"No matching call to std::find() although other find statements work, and have included &lt;algorithm&gt;"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8172489,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tb7NXafAdOo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApo/girUi0nAMkM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alex Karwowski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8172489/alex-karwowski"},"last_editor":{"reputation":737,"user_id":12014856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e4290d1d269bdf7cbc8a4c42da43ade?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Enthus3d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12014856/enthus3d"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58020932,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568959996,"creation_date":1568944937,"last_edit_date":1568959996,"question_id":58020849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020849","body_markdown":"I am writing function for a school project parsing XML.

In fact, `IContainerProvider` and `IContainerRegistry` aren&#39;t registered themselves for this reason, to make it impossible to inject them.\r\n\r\nA factory is easy though:\r\n\r\n    public class ProjectViewModel : BindableBase\r\n    {\r\n        private UnitOfWork unitOfWork;\r\n        private Func&lt;UnitOfWork&gt; unitOfWorkFactory;\r\n        private IEventAggregator eventAggregator;\r\n        #region Constructor\r\n        public ProjectViewModel(Func&lt;UnitOfWork&gt; unitOfWorkFactory, IEventAggregator ea) // no need to inject a unit of work\r\n        {\r\n            _unitOfWorkFactory = unitOfWorkFactory;\r\n            eventAggregator = ea;\r\n            ea.GetEvent&lt;SendReloadDataEvents&gt;().Subscribe(Reload); // prefer the parameter\r\n            Reload();\r\n        }\r\n        #endregion\r\n\r\n        private void Reload()\r\n        {\r\n            this.unitOfWork = _unitOfWorkFactory(); // create a new one here (the container does the work but is hidden)\r\n            Projects = new ObservableCollection&lt;Projects&gt;(unitOfWork.ProjectRepo.GetAll()); // I&#39;d rather update the existing collection\r\n            Customers = new ObservableCollection&lt;Customers&gt;(unitOfWork.CustomerRepo.Find(x =&gt; x.Projects.Count &gt; 0)); // same here, or probably, it could just be IEnumerable\r\n            SelectedProjectType = null;\r\n        }\r\n    //Other logic continues\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that this `Func&lt;&gt;` factory is ok only for the most simple cases. If you need parameters passed into the product constructor, you have to code it yourself as described [in this answer][1].

a single line of input with &#39;n&#39; arguments which are space delimited. The input arguments themselves are variable. The input is given through an external file.\r\n\r\nI want to move specific elements to variables depending on regular expressions. As such, I was  thinking of declaring a pointer variable first to keep track of where on the line I am. In addition, the assignment to variable is independent of numerical order, and depending on input some variables may be skipped entirely.\r\n \r\nMy current method is to use \r\n```awk &#39;{print $1}&#39; file.txt```\r\nHowever, not all elements are fixed and I need to account for elements that may be absent, or may have multiple entries. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: I found another method. \r\n```\r\nfile=$(cat /file.txt)\r\nfor i in ${file[@]}; do \r\n   echo $i &gt;&gt; split.txt; \r\ndone\r\n```\r\nWith this way, instead of a single line with multiple arguments, we get multiple lines with a single argument. as such, we can now use ```var#=(grep --regexp=&quot;[pattern]&quot; split.txt```. Now I just need to figure out how best to use regular expressions to filter this mess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me take an example.\r\n\r\nMy input strings are: \r\n```\r\nRON KKND 1534Z AUTO 253985G 034SRT 134OVC 04/32\r\n\r\nRON KKND 5256Z 143623G72K 034OVC 074OVC 134SRT 145PRT 13/00\r\n\r\nRON KKND 2234Z CON 342523G CLS 01/M12 RMK\r\n```\r\nSo the variable assignment for each of the above would be:\r\n```\r\nvar1=RON var2=KKND var3=1534Z var4=TRUE var5=FALSE var6=253985G varC=2 varC1=034SRT varC2=134OVC var7=04/32\r\n\r\nvar1=RON var2=KKND var3=5256Z var4=FALSE var5=FALSE var6=143623G72K varC=4 varC1=034OVC varC2=074OVC varC3=134SRT varC4=145PRT var7=13/00\r\n\r\nvar1=RON var2=KKND var3=2234Z var4=FALSE var5=TRUE var6=342523G varC=0  var7=01/M12\r\n```\r\nSo, the fourth argument might be var4, var5, or var6. \r\nThe fifth argument might be var5, var6, or match another criteria. \r\nThe sixth argument may or may not be var6. Between var6 and var7 can be determined by matching each argument with ```*/*``` \r\n\r\nBoiling this down even more, The positions on the input of var1, var2 and var3 are fixed but after that I need to compare, order, and assign. In addition, the arguments themselves can vary in character length. The relative position of each section to be divided is fixed in relation to its neighbors. var7 will never be before var6 in the input for example, and if var4 and var5 are true, then the 4th and 5th argument would always be &#39;AUTO CON&#39; Some segments will always be one argument, and others more than one. The relative position of each is known. As for each pattern, some have a specific character in a specific location, and others may not have any flag on what it is aside from its position in the sequence.\r\n\r\nSo I need awk to recognize a pointer variable as every argument needs to be checked until a specific match is found \r\n```\r\n#Check to see if var4 or var5 exists. if so, flag and increment pointer\r\npointer=4\r\nif (awk &#39;{print $$pointer}&#39; file.txt) == &quot;AUTO&quot; ; then\r\n   var4=&quot;TRUE&quot;\r\n   pointer=$pointer+1\r\nelse\r\n   var4=&quot;FALSE&quot;\r\nfi\r\nif (awk &#39;{print $$pointer}&#39; file.txt) == &quot;CON&quot; ; then\r\n   var5=&quot;TRUE&quot;\r\n   pointer=$pointer+1\r\nelse\r\n   var5=&quot;FALSE&quot;\r\nfi\r\n\r\n#position of var6 is fixed once var4 and var5 are determined\r\nvar6=$(awk &#39;{print $$pointer}&#39; file.txt)\r\npointer=$pointer+1\r\n\r\n#Count the arguments between var6 and var7 (there may be up to ten)\r\n#and separate each to decode later. varC[0-9] is always three upcase \r\n# letters followed by three numbers. Use this counter later when decoding.\r\nvarC=0\r\n\r\nuntil (awk &#39;{print $$pointer}&#39; file.txt) == &quot;*/*&quot; ; do\r\n\r\n   varC($varC+1)=(awk &#39;{print $$pointer}&#39; file.txt)\r\n   varC=$varC+1\r\n   pointer=$pointer+1\r\ndone\r\n#position of var7 is fixed after all arguments of varC are handled\r\nvar7=$(awk &#39;{print $$pointer}&#39; file.txt)\r\npointer=$pointer+1\r\n\r\n```\r\nI know the above syntax is incorrect. The question is how do I fix it.\r\n\r\nvar7 is not always at the end of the input line. Arguments after var7 however do not need to be processed.\r\n\r\nActually interpreting the patterns I haven&#39;t gotten to yet. I intend to handle that using case statements comparing the variables with regular expressions to compare against. I don&#39;t want to use awk to interpret the patterns directly as that would get very messy. I have contemplated using ``` for n in $string ```, but to do that would mean comparing every argument to every possible combination directly (And there are multiple segments each with multiple patterns) and is such impractical. I&#39;m trying to make this a two step process.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020836/processing-a-delimited-line-in-bash","title":"Processing a delimited line in

You don&#39;t get automatic lowercase versions of your names... but then, neither do the F# built-in types: in `FSharp.Core/prim-types.fs` in the F# source code, there&#39;s a definition `type &#39;a list = List&lt;&#39;a&gt;`, which is why you can write `int list` rather than `List&lt;int&gt;`.\r\n\r\nAnd you can use either `Foo&lt;&#39;a&gt;` or `&#39;a Foo` (or `&#39;a foo`) when you define your type, too. The only rule is that you must match the casing style you used when defining the type. Here&#39;s an F# Interactive session to demonstrate:\r\n\r\n    &gt; type Foo&lt;&#39;a&gt; = &#39;a list ;;\r\n    type Foo&lt;&#39;a&gt; = &#39;a list\r\n    \r\n    &gt; type &#39;a bar = &#39;a list ;;\r\n    type &#39;a bar = &#39;a list\r\n    \r\n    &gt; let x : int Foo = [] ;;\r\n    val x : Foo&lt;int&gt; = []\r\n    \r\n    &gt; let y : Foo&lt;int&gt; = [] ;;\r\n    val y : Foo&lt;int&gt; = []\r\n    \r\n    &gt; let z : int bar = [] ;;\r\n    val z : int bar = []\r\n    \r\n    &gt; let w : bar&lt;int&gt; = [] ;;\r\n    val w : int bar = []\r\n\r\nBut you must match the casing of the type you defined:\r\n\r\n    &gt; let x : int foo = [] ;;\r\n    \r\n      let x : int foo = [] ;;\r\n      ------------^^^\r\n    \r\n    error FS0039: The type &#39;foo&#39; is not defined.

Maybe you want one of the following:\r\n       bar\r\n       bar`1\r\n\r\nNote that we got `Foo&lt;int&gt;` as the type listed in F# Interactive responses whether we defined our type as `int Foo` or `Foo&lt;int&gt;`. This is not based on the case (upper or lower) we used to define the type, but rather on the prefix/postfix order we used:\r\n\r\n    &gt; type foo&lt;&#39;a&gt; = &#39;a list ;;\r\n    type foo&lt;&#39;a&gt; = &#39;a list\r\n    \r\n    &gt; type &#39;a bar = &#39;a list ;;\r\n    type &#39;a bar = &#39;a list\r\n    \r\n    &gt; let x : &#39;a foo = [] ;;\r\n    val x : foo&lt;&#39;a&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &gt; let y : &#39;a bar = [] ;;\r\n    val y : &#39;a bar\r\n\r\nSo there you go. You can use this syntax for your own types without doing anything special. The only rule is that the type must take exactly *one* generic parameter: you can&#39;t do `type d = int,string Dictionary`. For types that take two or more generic parameters, you must define them with the `Dictionary&lt;int,string&gt;` style.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020822/f-postfix-keywords-for-type/58021009#58021009","title":"F# postfix keywords for type"}],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":8620481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efcbdf49fa9d450de8a98109b35ee0f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Massimiliano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620481/massimiliano"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58021009,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568946545,"creation_date":1568944638,"question_id":58020822,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020822","body_markdown":"To my knowledge, there&#39;s a special notation for the Option and List type in F#.

It&#39;s mostly working as I expected, except I&#39;m having trouble making proper use of it, which might be caused by some misunderstanding of mine. My problem is as follows:\r\n\r\nIf a leaf node takes a long time to finish, for instance, an action that makes a game unit follow a specific path, that means the leaf node is currently at the &quot;running&quot; state. However, if I return the state, I can no longer run the rest of the function, which means I can&#39;t reach my destination.\r\n\r\nSo my question is: what is the proper way to tell my tree that a leaf node is running?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I got on my ActionNode class:\r\n\r\n    public class ActionNode : BTNode\r\n    {\r\n        public delegate NodeStates ActionNodeDelegate();\r\n        protected ActionNodeDelegate nodeAction;\r\n    \r\n        public ActionNode(ActionNodeDelegate action)\r\n        {\r\n            nodeAction = action;\r\n        }\r\n        public override NodeStates Evaluate()\r\n        {\r\n            switch (nodeAction())\r\n            {\r\n                case NodeStates.FAILURE:\r\n                    currentNodeState = NodeStates.FAILURE;\r\n                    return currentNodeState;\r\n                case NodeStates.SUCESS:\r\n                    currentNodeState = NodeStates.SUCESS;\r\n                    return currentNodeState;\r\n                case NodeStates.RUNNING:\r\n                    currentNodeState = NodeStates.RUNNING;\r\n                    return currentNodeState;\r\n                default:\r\n                    currentNodeState = NodeStates.FAILURE;\r\n                    return currentNodeState;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you need to check the other classes, it&#39;s all based on [this article](https://hub.packtpub.com/building-your-own-basic-behavior-tree-tutorial/). Linking it for the sake of keeping the thread cleaner.\r\n\r\nAs for an action example, consider this:\r\n\r\n    private NodeStates FollowPath() {        \r\n        bool targetReached;\r\n        if (targetReachable)\r\n            targetReached = WalkToTarget();\r\n        if (targetReached)\r\n            return NodeStates.SUCESS;\r\n        else\r\n            return NodeStates.FAILURE;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m wondering is, if WalkToTarget takes a long time, how do I return a &quot;running&quot; state?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve read many different articles on the subject, but I can&#39;t seem to grasp the exact concept behind these states. I understand how I can, for instance, tell that a Sequence or Selector node is running.\r\n\r\nThe only idea that crossed my mind is that I&#39;d store the remaining path inside a variable at my enemy class and call the method every game update tick, but I feel like that&#39;s just poor coding.\r\n\r\nAre leaf nodes supposed to return &quot;running&quot; at any given moment?

In theory, if `R` was getting a new memory location every time it was being declared in the function it shouldn&#39;t be affected by the recursive calls to the multiply function at all (where I am echo&#39;ing `UBound(R)`), but it is.

The client should receive these JSONs and do something with them. However, the problem is that large JSONs writes are chunked such that the client will receive the JSON in pieces. This breaks `JSON.parse(data)` and now the client doesn&#39;t know how to process the server payloads. I can&#39;t rely on `res.on(&#39;end&#39;)` to detect the the completion of a chunked write because this is a keep-alive request that should stay open forever.\r\n\r\nI want to avoid designing my own protocol for combining JSON chunks because of it&#39;s complexity. It&#39;s not as simple as concatenating the strings since I could have interleaved JSON chunks if the server sends 2 large JSON payloads at the same time.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to force the server to write the entire JSON as 1 chunk in the stream? How can I setup my client such that it establishes a &quot;forever&quot; connection with my server and listens for complete JSON payloads?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020746/how-to-consume-multiple-jsons-from-a-https-keep-alive-request","title":"How to consume multiple JSONs from a HTTPs keep-alive request?"},{"tags":["java","jar","decompiler","jd-gui"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":472,"user_id":9070798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af67c0a12fba6333ee05a4d1a8e5e900?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9070798/patrick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568944267,"post_id":58020740,"comment_id":102444780,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020740/using-java-decompiler-jd-gui-on-a-class-file-gives-me-multiple-errors-on-src#comment102444780_58020740"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":29054,"user_id":1420279,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c799e8b3d14c4f149ce71455109f17eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Antimony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1420279/antimony"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568945611,"creation_date":1568945611,"answer_id":58020916,"question_id":58020740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58020916","body_markdown":"Compilation is a lossy process, so decompilation is always a &quot;best effort&quot; endeavor.

So it can be seen as something like this:\r\n```\r\n              objects                    choosen objects\r\n    +-------------------------+    +-------------------------+\r\n    | objID   | image| ...    |    | objID   | date | ...    |\r\n    +-------------------------+    +-------------------------+\r\n    | 1       | ...  | ...    |    | 2       | ...  | ...    |\r\n    | 2       | ...  | ...    |    | 3       | ...  | ...    |\r\n    | 3       | ...  | ...    |    | 5       | ...  | ...    |\r\n    +-------------------------+    +-------------------------+\r\n```\r\nNow in my php file I access all the choosen objects with following query:\r\n```\r\n$con = mysqli_connect(&#39;localhost&#39;,&#39;root&#39;,&#39;root&#39;, &#39;objects&#39;)or die(&#39;not connecting&#39;);\r\n$sql=&quot;SELECT * FROM choosen;&quot;;\r\n$result = mysqli_query($con,$sql);\r\n$id=array();\r\nwhile($row=mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)){\r\n    array_push($id,$row[&quot;objID&quot;]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis way I want to use the objects ids from choosen objects table to reference those objects with same id in order to show on screen the object&#180;s image as other details contained in the objects table. So for that I get the following code:\r\n```\r\n$con = mysqli_connect(&#39;localhost&#39;,&#39;root&#39;,&#39;root&#39;, &#39;objects&#39;)or die(&#39;not connecting&#39;);\r\nforeach($array_id as $i){\r\n    $sql=&quot;SELECT * FROM objects WHERE objID=&quot;.$id.&quot;;&quot;;\r\n    $result = mysqli_query($con,$sql);\r\n    $row=mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\r\n    display($row);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNevertheless  I&#180;m afraid that the fact of having to call multiple query requests for looping the choosen objects and retrieving their details as their images would cause an uneffective and slow data retrieving. I wonder if there is a most effective way to retrieve data from objects table which would be more time and query cost saving, or if on the other hand it would be preferable to duplicate and spread the image and further objects data to the choosen objects table when created, sacrificing memory cost in exchange for time and query saving. I would like to hear your advantages of any decision and recommendations.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020718/most-efficient-way-to-retrieve-data-from-a-set-of-matching-id","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"Most efficient way to retrieve data from a set of matching id?"},{"tags":["go"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":249,"user_id":1406186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efcdbad6895719edb74597d135ecbb91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1406186","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1406186/user1406186"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568944280,"post_id":58020767,"comment_id":102444782,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020714/how-to-use-standard-library-types/58020767#comment102444782_58020767"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11484375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ci0LH8WkltQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfXUaM9_bZrD__rzBzJESn9PAQB_w/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"polo xue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11484375/polo-xue"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568944030,"creation_date":1568944030,"answer_id":58020767,"question_id":58020714,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58020767","body_markdown":"The `url` here is a variable, not a type. \r\n\r\nAnd please modify `Values` to `url.Values`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020714/how-to-use-standard-library-types/58020767#58020767","title":"How to use standard library types"}],"owner":{"reputation":249,"user_id":1406186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efcdbad6895719edb74597d135ecbb91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1406186","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1406186/user1406186"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568962933,"accepted_answer_id":58020767,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568963638,"creation_date":1568943490,"question_id":58020714,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020714","body_markdown":"How can I use the standard library type Values found here https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#Values\r\n\r\nI try to import net/url and use Values but go fmt automatically deletes it when i save it.\r\n\r\n    func test(url string) (string, Values) {\r\n    \r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020714/how-to-use-standard-library-types","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How to use standard library types"},{"tags":["mips","modulo"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18489,"user_id":995714,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1393.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"phuclv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/995714/phuclv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568957852,"post_id":58020713,"comment_id":102447404,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020713/mips-instruction-modulo#comment102447404_58020713"},{"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":11685063,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39a7ec189882f7ec028bfaf59036bcbf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11685063/mason"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":18489,"user_id":995714,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1393.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"phuclv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/995714/phuclv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568979015,"post_id":58020713,"comment_id":102457263,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020713/mips-instruction-modulo#comment102457263_58020713"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18489,"user_id":995714,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1393.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"phuclv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/995714/phuclv"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568957839,"creation_date":1568957839,"answer_id":58022346,"question_id":58020713,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58022346","body_markdown":"The remainder when dividing any number by `b` is in the range [0, b-1].

could use AJAX to post data to your PHP script, which will then run.\r\n\r\nNote that jQuery and AJAX are not alternatives for each other.\r\n\r\nAJAX is an asynchronous HTTP request (which is what you want).\r\n\r\njQuery is a javascript library which you can use to make AJAX calls.\r\n\r\nI would take a look at https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/\r\n\r\nThis is a shorthand function for making an ajax POST request. E.g.:\r\n\r\n    function triggerMyPhpScript(data) {\r\n        $.post(&quot;http://localhost/.../script.php&quot;, data, function(responseData) {\r\n            // do something with the response of your script\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI also like the Fetch answer from Koala Yeung. This will also work fine on modern browsers. Keep in mind that if you want to support ancient browsers (e.g. internet explorer), you need to implement feature detection and a fallback in case fetch is not supported by the browser.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020712/how-to-make-post-request-with-javascript-in-a-chrome-extension/58026552#58026552","title":"How to make POST request with javascript in a Chrome Extension?"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":10852854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f16b80608dc288f67b65cee202475ac0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Anon0441","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10852854/anon0441"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3724,"user_id":372172,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e3e64f71bb0a748cffdf0baec8b95cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Koala Yeung","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372172/koala-yeung"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568976167,"creation_date":1568943481,"last_edit_date":1568976167,"question_id":58020712,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020712","body_markdown":"I was wondering if there is anyway to make this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;form action=&quot;http[://localhost/.../script.php&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\na regular call.

y == 0.0\r\n        1.0\r\n    else\r\n        Base.:(/)(x, y)\r\n    end \r\nend\r\n```\r\nAt the repl:\r\n```\r\njulia&gt; 1 / 2\r\n0.5\r\n\r\njulia&gt; 10.0 / 0.0\r\nInf\r\n\r\njulia&gt; 0.0 / 0.0\r\n1.0\r\n```\r\nWhat this does is *shadows* the built in `/` function and replaces it with your own custom version that falls back on the built-in one. This shadowing is local to only the current module you&#39;re in and won&#39;t leak outside unless someone explicitly asks for your version.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother (perhaps preferable) option is to make a new infix division function via unicode operators. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n```julia\r\nfunction /̂(x, y) # /̂ is typed /\\hat&lt;TAB&gt; at the REPL\r\n    if x == 0 &amp;&amp; y == 0\r\n        one(promote_type(typeof(x), typeof(y)))\r\n    else\r\n        x / y\r\n    end \r\nend\r\n```\r\nAt the REPL:\r\n```\r\njulia&gt; 0 /̂ 0.0\r\n1.0\r\n\r\njulia&gt; 1 /̂ 2\r\n0.5\r\n\r\njulia&gt; 0 / 0\r\nNaN\r\n```\r\nThis works because anytime you apply a unicode modifier like `\\hat` or a superscript or whatever to an infix function symbol (like `/` or `*` or whatever) you make a new infix operator with the same precedence. This is nice because we get to keep the old `/` definition around and we have a visual marker on our division operator that something peculiar is happening.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________\r\n\r\n[1]: Functions from Base are only actually pulled into your namespace the first time you use them, so if you have not yet used `/` in your current scope, you are free to shadow it. Otherwise, you&#39;ll have to introduce a new scope via a `let` block and only have `/` shadowed there.
