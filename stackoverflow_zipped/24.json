the `[regex]::matches` method on your string (you have to provide a regular expression to match on) then check the returned array for each specific match in the string. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n    $myString = &quot;The quick brown fox&quot;\r\n    $myMatches = [regex]::matches($myString, &quot;\\w+&quot;)\r\n    $myMatches.Value\r\n\r\nThe example above looks for words in the string. The `matches` method matches multiple times, whereas the `-match` operator doesn&#39;t have a global match option (that I could find, would love to be proven wrong here). The `.Value` property contains the actual match, though there are also other useful members you can use on the `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match` object as well.\r\n\r\n# EDIT\r\n\r\nYour question was a bit ambiguous:\r\n\r\n- I am trying to extract an unknown string between two known words.\r\n- I just want to extract update unique id\r\n\r\nI missed the second part, so let me address that here. Since you want to pick a known pattern (a unique ID) from a string, you ***can*** use the `-match` operator for this:\r\n\r\n    $fails | Foreach-Object {\r\n      if( $_ -match &#39;[a-z0-9]{8}-([a-z0-9]{4}-){3}[a-z0-9]{12}&#39;) ){\r\n        $matches[0]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`$matches` is a special array that, when a match is made with the `-match` operator, the match is placed into the 0 index of `$matches`. Each index past that indicates a capturing group match, but you don&#39;t need that here.\r\n\r\nThe expression I provided is for a well-formed UUID, should work with both the MS regex engine as well as PCRE and Javascript.

I have two tables which I would like to have in Spring memory to query. \r\nI have successfully managed to model the &#39;Drugs&#39; table in an entiry called Medicine, however now need to model the &#39;drugInteraction&#39; table - which will have the combination of drug_id(PK called id in medicine table), and the drug_name in the drugInteraction table, as a combined primary key.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchemas as used in python:\r\n```\r\ncursor.execute(&quot;CREATE TABLE drugs(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), description TEXT, toxicity

I only have a basic understanding of the async/await mechanism and tasks usage. I am thus a bit puzzled when it comes to running some program on the background and echo its standard output to the Visual Studio output pane.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I have written a small wrapper around the IVsOutputWindowPane object and the IDE recommends to add ThreadHelper.ThrowIfNotOnUIThread() or ThreadHelper.JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync() calls when writing to the Visual Studio output pane.

Moreover, I am not confident it will not crash also in other situations.\r\n\r\nWhat are the best practices / patterns for writing a background program&#39;s standard output (which is obviously NOT on the UI thread) to the Visual Studio output pane (which obviously IS on the UI thread)?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58527108/how-to-write-to-output-pane-from-a-background-task","title":"How to write to output pane from a background

I set a default value, then use conditionals like this:\r\n\r\n    Expression&lt;Func&lt;Report_Data, TResult&gt;&gt; grouping = g =&gt; new {g.Month, Option1 = g.prop1, Option2 = g.prop2};\r\n\r\n    if (userParameter == &quot;X&quot;){\r\n        grouping = g =&gt; new {g.Month, Option1 = g.prop3, Option2 = g.prop4};\r\n    } else if (userParameter == &quot;Y&quot;) {\r\n        grouping = g =&gt; new {g.Month, Option1 = g.prop5, Option2 = g.prop6};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen I&#39;m passing `grouping` into the querty above. The problem is that I have an anonymous type in the grouping and `Expression&lt;Func&lt;Report_Data, TResult&gt;&gt;` errors when I use `TResult` as the Result Type. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to use this expression delegate format and specify a generic or anonymous result type? (preferably without having to create a class for every result type)\r\nOr should I be allowing different groupings by some other mechanism?

can use [`itertools.product`][1] just fine, but you need to define your input iterables correctly. You want to iterate over each upper/lowercase pair twice. For a 2x2 example, you would want something like\r\n\r\n    itertools.product(&#39;Aa&#39;, &#39;Aa&#39;, &#39;Bb&#39;, &#39;Bb&#39;)\r\n\r\nSince this is a genetics problem, you can think of it as loops over the possibilities for each gene, repeated for each gene for each parent. The advantage of phrasing it like that is that if one parent has different genotypes (not heterozygous), you can express that very easily. For example, something like:\r\n\r\n    itertools.product(&#39;AA&#39;, &#39;Aa&#39;, &#39;BB&#39;, &#39;bb&#39;)\r\n\r\nRunning a [`collections.Counter`][2] on the result of that will help you compute the statistics for the genotypes of the offspring.\r\n\r\nBut the question remains as to how to do this using [`itertools`][3]. [Repeating the elements of an iterable N times][4] can be achieved with [`itertools.chain.from_iterable`][5] and [`itertools.repeat`][6]:\r\n\r\n    itertools.chain.from_iterable(itertools.repeat(x, 2) for x in (&#39;Aa&#39;, &#39;Bb&#39;))\r\n\r\nThe resulting iterator can be passed into `itertools.product` directly:\r\n\r\n    from itertools import chain, product, repeat\r\n\r\n    def table_entries(genes):\r\n        possibilities = product(*chain.from_iterable(repeat((g.upper(), g.lower()), 2) for g in genes))\r\n        return [&#39;&#39;.join(possibility) for possibility in possibilities]\r\n\r\nThis works for arbitrary numbers of genes, regardless of your original capitalization:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;

However, in Visual Studio 2017, they appear as `&lt;&lt;Exp&gt;&gt;`.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to show the actual expression in the design view?  I do not want to have to click on every `&lt;&lt;Exp&gt;&gt;`, open it in the Expression editor just to see it, and selecting an expression and waiting for the pop-over is slow and cumbersome when your report has many expressions.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what Visual Studio 2005 would show in a field of the design view:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=Floor((Sum(Fields!internal_talk_duration.Value) + Sum(Fields!internal_received_talk_duration.Value) + Sum(Fields!inbound_talk_duration.Value)) / 3600) &amp; &quot;:&quot; &amp; Format(DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, (Sum(Fields!internal_talk_duration.Value) + Sum(Fields!internal_received_talk_duration.Value) + Sum(Fields!inbound_talk_duration.Value)), &quot;00:00&quot;), &quot;mm:ss&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what Visual Studio 2017 now shows in that same field:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;&lt;Exp&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom my reading, Microsoft says Complex Expressions display as `&lt;&lt;&lt;Exp&gt;&gt;&gt;`, but they do not offer a way that I could find to show it the old way.

Drag a Prompt activity from the NumberGuessWorkflowActivities section of the Toolbox, drop it below the Assign activity from the previous step, and connect the Prompt activity to the Assign activity. There are three ways to connect the two activities. The first way is to connect them as you drop the Prompt activity on the workflow. As you are dragging the Prompt activity to the workflow, hover it over the Assign activity and drop it onto one of the four triangles that appear when the Prompt activity is over the Assign activity. The second way is to drop the Prompt activity onto the workflow at the desired location. Then, hover the mouse over the Assign activity and drag one of the rectangles that appears down to the Prompt activity. Drag the mouse so that the connecting line from the Assign activity connects to one of the rectangles of the Prompt activity, and then release the mouse button. The third way is very similar to the first way, except that instead of dragging the Prompt activity from the Toolbox, you drag it from its location on the workflow design surface, hover it over the Assign activity, and drop it onto one of the triangles that appears.\r\n\r\nbut when i drag this &quot;Prompt&quot; activiti im getting an error\r\n\r\n&gt; Unable to create a &quot;prompt&quot; instance\r\nan exception occurred in the invocation destination\r\n\r\nidont know what causing the error. someone can tell me how display more details about the error.\r\n\r\n&gt; the error ocurrer in Design time \r\n\r\n[![Drag an drop &quot;Prompt&quot; activity causing an error][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nto create the &quot;Prompt activity&quot; i follow the instruccions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-an-activity)  and this is the result:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\ni dont understend in the step 15:\r\n\r\n&gt; - 15 Drag a WriteLine activity from the Primitives section of the Toolbox and drop it onto the Drop activity here label of the Sequence activity.\r\n\r\nwhat does it mean **&quot;DROP IT ONTO&quot;**. it means drop it inside or just drop it wherever you want. if i drop it out side the &quot;Prompt Activity&quot; i get this design\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nbut looks bad!!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nsorry for my bad english i dont speak!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSLkY.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKIo4.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/msGMj.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58527003/net-windows-workflow-fundation-vs2017-error-in-designer-an-exception-occurred","title":".net Windows Workflow Fundation VS2017 error in designer &quot;an exception occurred in the invocation destination&quot;"},{"tags":["asp.net-core","model-view-controller"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1267,"user_id":1836461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHYf4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"computercarguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836461/computercarguy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571846972,"post_id":58527001,"comment_id":103378365,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58527001/net-core-select-dropdown-is-very-slow#comment103378365_58527001"}],"owner":{"reputation":310,"user_id":7520496,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38921ee45c9659c0abccb7f3cf624d13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AliAzra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7520496/aliazra"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571846790,"creation_date":1571846790,"question_id":58527001,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58527001","body_markdown":"In my website, I have got 2 select dropdown list Client and Staff. \r\nI have got roughly 100 Clients and 350 Staffs.\r\n \r\nPopulating dropdown list is very slow. for example for the staff dropdown list takes around 40sec and little less for Client. basically it takes 1 minuted to load the page.\r\n\r\nFirst I used ViewData\r\n\r\n     ViewData[&quot;EmployeeList&quot;] = new SelectList(employeeRepository.Employees.,&quot;EmployeeID&quot;, &quot;FullName&quot;);\r\n\r\ncshtm\r\n\r\n     &lt;select asp-for=&quot;EmployeeID&quot; class=&quot;form-control col-sm-12&quot; asp-items=&quot;ViewBag.EmployeeList&quot;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\r\n\r\nThen I changed it to ViewModel \r\n\r\n    EmplSelectList = new SelectList(employeeRepository.Employees, &quot;EmployeeID&quot;, &quot;FullName&quot;)\r\n\r\ncshtml\r\n     \r\n     &lt;select asp-for=&quot;ClientID&quot; class=&quot;form-control col-sm-12&quot; asp-items=&quot;Model.ClientSelectList&quot;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\r\n\r\nThis didn&#39;t improve much. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know a better way to solve this issue?

Than you can fake an empty array with an empty array.\r\n\r\nThat said, what you want is directly accomplished by `$rs = new PDOStatement();`\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58526986/manually-create-an-empty-pdo-recordset/58527417#58527417","title":"Manually create an empty PDO recordset"}],"owner":{"reputation":1291,"user_id":339440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f153033aad728fcf498fb72956c93eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/339440/stephen-r"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58527417,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571848510,"creation_date":1571846762,"question_id":58526986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58526986","body_markdown":"I have pages where I output a bunch of records in a table.

(In practice, &quot;objects&quot; are graphs and I am looking for sets of non-isomorphic graphs in very large sets of graphs.) \r\n\r\nHere is some pseudo code:  \r\n\r\n    from itertools import combinations\r\n    from multiprocessing import Pool\r\n\r\n    p = Pool(number_of_threads)\r\n\r\n    def find_nonequivalent_objects(n,m):\r\n        list_of_objects = []\r\n        # LOOP 1: many billions of combinations\r\n        for c in combinations(n,m): \r\n            new_obj  = generate_object_from_combination(c)\r\n            if not len(list_of_objects)==0:\r\n                compare_to_new_obj = lambda old_obj: check_equivalence(new_obj, \r\n                                                                       old_obj)\r\n                # MAP 1: a few hundred comparisons\r\n                if not np.any(map(compare_to_new_obj, list_of_objects)):\r\n                    list_of_objects = list_of_objects + [new_obj]\r\n            else:\r\n                list_of_objects = [new_obj]\r\n\r\n        # return a list of a few hundred objects\r\n        return list_of_objects \r\n\r\nI first tried to use `p.map` for MAP 1 (replacing the lambda function with `functools.partial`), but the added overhead overcompensated for the speed-up, so the overall runtime increased. It seems that the better approach would be split LOOP 1 into chunks. This would require something like this:\r\n\r\n    list_of_lists_of_objects = pool.map(LOOP1_function, combinations(n,m))\r\n\r\n    # compare list_of_objects from different chunks\r\n    for i in range(1, number_of_threads):\r\n        for new_obj in list_of_lists_of_objects[i]:\r\n            compare_to_new_obj = lambda old_obj: check_equivalence(new_obj, old_obj)\r\n            if not np.any(map(compare_to_new_obj, list_of_lists_of_objects[0])):\r\n                list_of_lists_of_objects[0] = list_of_lists_of_objects[0] + [new_obj]\r\n\r\n    list_of_objects = list_of_lists_of_objects[0]\r\n\r\nThis leads me to two problems:\r\n\r\n1. As far as I understand, using `p.map` on LOOP 1 means that I am asking the machine to create a list of `itertools.combinations(n,m)`. That would lead to memory problems.\r\n\r\n2. Every worker or chunk needs to have its own `list_of_objects`.

goes to Robert Longson and Toni Michel Caubet for helping me piece this together but I figured it&#39;d be best to post the solution I came up with here since the discussion was mainly in the comment thread.\r\n\r\nFirst I will address my errors:\r\n\r\n1. Invalid ViewBox\r\n\r\nAs Robert pointed out, I misunderstood how to use viewBox and as a consequence used incorrect values. To help resolve my issue, I set my viewBox to `0 0 380 380` and adjusted height and width accordingly\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\n    &lt;svg\r\n      width=&quot;380px&quot;\r\n      height=&quot;380px&quot;\r\n      viewbox=&quot;0 0 380 380&quot;\r\n      fill=&quot;none&quot;\r\n      xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;\r\n      className={`globe-svg ${classActive}`}\r\n    &gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. HTML, Body reset for App 100% height\r\n\r\nThis is necessary for the app to be at 100% height and have an effect on the rest of the element&#39;s CSS.\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\nhtml,\r\nbody {\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMain Changes to App and Svg CSS\r\n\r\nTo actually center the SVG after making these key changes, I used a combination of flexbox and `transform:translate()`. I tried this earlier before posting, but due to the not having made two changes I needed to do above at that time period, it could not work properly as a solution beforehand.\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n\r\n.App {\r\n  font-family: sans-serif;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  align-items: center;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.globe-svg {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  left: 50%;\r\n  top: 50%;\r\n  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you again for your help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58526959/svg-react-component-will-not-center/58529416#58529416","title":"SVG React Component will not center"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":10188923,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1lUQiNPW9YE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7rdIePFX4RL0-VPq8rs4usShb2xOw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"A-Bro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10188923/a-bro"},"last_editor":{"reputation":48,"user_id":10188923,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1lUQiNPW9YE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7rdIePFX4RL0-VPq8rs4usShb2xOw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"A-Bro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10188923/a-bro"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571857725,"creation_date":1571846652,"last_edit_date":1571854653,"question_id":58526959,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58526959","body_markdown":"I have an svg in my site that I wanted to animate, so I changed the tag from img to svg for the animation to work.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this led me to the issue of properly centering my SVG in my window.

In this handler you get a PaintEventArgs object, and from there a Graphic object where drawing can be done. I need to do the same in UWP, but I haven’t found I way to get a Graphic object in UWP.\r\n\r\nFor what I have seen, you can only create custom controls in UWP by composing other controls that the platform provides and by setting their parameters. But this is not enough for my app.  I need a Graphics object to do precise drawing.  Is there a way of getting this Graphics object in UWP?.  I know that with the MSIX package tool you can create an installer for the Windows Store  from a Windows Forms app, but I would like my app to be directly in UWP.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know that in Android, even if it is also XAML based, it is possible to extend the View class in java and override the OnDraw method.  Is  there something equivalent in Window UWP?\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Visual Studio, an example of the C# windos form code is:\r\n\r\n\r\n    partial class MyCustomButton\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        private void InitializeComponent()\r\n        {           \r\n            ...\r\n            this.Paint += new System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler(this.MyCustomButton_Paint);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n     }\r\n\r\n    public partial class MyCustomButton : Button\r\n    {\r\n        public MyCustomButton()\r\n        {\r\n            InitializeComponent();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private void MyCustomButton_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            Graphics g = e.Graphics;\r\n            \r\n            ...\r\n\r\n            /// Drawing on g\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nCan something similar be done in UWL, even if it is XAML based?  Can a Graphics object be obtained? (I know that in Android I is possible).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58526952/need-help-converting-custom-c-windows-forms-controls-to-custom-c-universal-win","title":"Need help converting custom C# Windows forms controls to custom C# Universal Windows Platform controls"},{"tags":["jquery","alert","toast"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12046,"user_id":973552,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wz2OO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Darren Sweeney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/973552/darren-sweeney"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571846740,"post_id":58526951,"comment_id":103378240,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58526951/toast-warning-when-page-loads-jquery#comment103378240_58526951"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9579663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4MOnqpDw1sA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/__HOn84cHkg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anıl&#199;ağatay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9579663/an%c4%b1l%c3%87a%c4%9fatay"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12046,"user_id":973552,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wz2OO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Darren Sweeney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/973552/darren-sweeney"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571846967,"post_id":58526951,"comment_id":103378363,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58526951/toast-warning-when-page-loads-jquery#comment103378363_58526951"},{"owner":{"reputation":14715,"user_id":2181514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pS2Yo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"freedomn-m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2181514/freedomn-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571848364,"post_id":58526951,"comment_id":103379042,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58526951/toast-warning-when-page-loads-jquery#comment103379042_58526951"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9579663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4MOnqpDw1sA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/__HOn84cHkg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anıl&#199;ağatay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9579663/an%c4%b1l%c3%87a%c4%9fatay"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14715,"user_id":2181514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pS2Yo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"freedomn-m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2181514/freedomn-m"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571848336,"creation_date":1571846623,"last_edit_date":1571848336,"question_id":58526951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58526951","body_markdown":"How do I get a toast message when the page loads?\r\n\r\nJquery:\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n        $(&quot;#type-success&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;,function() { \r\n            toastr.success(&quot;Have fun storming the castle!&quot;,&quot;Miracle Max Says&quot;);\r\n        })\r\n    });\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58526951/toast-warning-when-page-loads-jquery","title":"toast warning when page loads jquery"},{"tags":["javascript","angular","ngx-datatable"],"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":4718409,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c83ca35e490844da65821c30c48642d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DN0300","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4718409/dn0300"},"last_editor":{"reputation":309,"user_id":4718409,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c83ca35e490844da65821c30c48642d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DN0300","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4718409/dn0300"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571847053,"creation_date":1571846618,"last_edit_date":1571847053,"question_id":58526949,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58526949","body_markdown":"At the moment I am using the below logic to match row content to the correct column, but it seems to be slow and because of that sometimes rows don&#39;t render.
