In this case - why not you register MockService istelf as singleton? :)\r\n\r\nCorrect way for background task is to capture `IServiceScopeFactory` instance, and call CreateScope() before any real job, and obtain any scoped services from it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060673/is-it-safe-putting-a-task-with-scoped-service-dependencies-in-a-singleton-queu/58065929#58065929","title":"Is it safe putting a Task, with scoped service dependencies, in a Singleton queue?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":6862974,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73d695b8e5d802f6d076b632913b6796?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shimii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6862974/shimii"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":6862974,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73d695b8e5d802f6d076b632913b6796?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shimii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6862974/shimii"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58065929,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569253454,"creation_date":1569235408,"last_edit_date":1569247203,"question_id":58060673,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060673","body_markdown":"I am pretty much using the example provided in Microsoft docs for [queuing background tasks][1].\r\n\r\nIn this queue I am adding a ```Func&lt;Task&gt;```, to be executed later by ```QueuedHostedService```.\r\n\r\n\r\nController - HTTP POST\r\n```\r\n...\r\nFunc&lt;Task&gt; workItem = () =&gt; _mockService.DoWorkAsync(guid);\r\n_queue.QueueBackgroundWorkItem(workItem);\r\nreturn Ok();\r\n```\r\nMockService.DoWorkAsync\r\n```\r\nvar data = await _insideMockService.GetAsync();\r\nawait _anotherService.Notify(data);\r\n```\r\nBackgroundTaskQueue.QueueBackgroundWorkItem\r\n```\r\nprivate ConcurrentQueue&lt;Func&lt;Task&gt;&gt; _workItems\r\nprivate SemaphoreSlim _signal = new SemaphoreSlim(0);\r\npublic void QueueBackgroundWorkItem(Func&lt;Task&gt; workItem)\r\n{\r\n    if (workItem == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(workItem));\r\n    }\r\n    _workItems.Enqueue(workItem);\r\n    _signal.Release();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nQueuedHostedService.ExecuteAsync\r\n```\r\n_currentTask = await _queue.DequeueAsync(cancellationToken);\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    await _currentTask();\r\n...\r\n```\r\nBackgroundTaskQueue.DequeueAsync\r\n```\r\npublic async Task&lt;Func&lt;Task&gt;&gt; DequeueAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n{\r\n    await _signal.WaitAsync(cancellationToken);\r\n    _workItemsById.TryDequeue(out var workItem);\r\n    return workItem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nStartup.ConfigureServices\r\n```\r\nservices.AddScoped&lt;IMockService, MockService&gt;(); // Implements DoWorkAsync\r\nservices.AddScoped&lt;IInsideMockService, InsideMockService&gt;(); // DoWorkAsync requires this dependency \r\nservices.AddScoped&lt;IAnotherService, AnotherService&gt;(); // DoWorkAsync requires this dependency \r\nservices.AddHostedService&lt;QueuedHostedService&gt;();\r\nservices.AddSingleton&lt;IBackgroundTaskQueue, BackgroundTaskQueue&gt;();\r\n```\r\n\r\n```IMockService.DoWorkAsync``` method use ```scoped``` services.

It is primarily used in the context of eCommerce, where sessions are usually short, but its pricing model also accomodates long user sessions: in that case, credits are spent for each 10 minute period spent in the viewer. \r\n\r\nOn average, this means that the cost of users playing with a tool based on ShapeDiver amounts to 30 cents per hour. You can also prepay credits at a lower price to reduce the bills further.\r\n\r\nOf course, the price will grow with your user base, but as you will see below there might not be a cheaper and flexible option to implement the tool you need at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\n\r\nDepending on which modifications you want the users to be able to make, there are several routes you could go. If it&#39;s just about smoothing, it should be possible to find or have someone implement a solution, using [Laplacian smoothing][2] for example, directly in WebGL. If you need more variety of modifications and/or complex operations, you could give a try to online tools like [Vectary][3] (subdivision modelling) or [Onshape][4] (full online CAD system), but you will hit a pricing roadblock again, and it is not clear that you can use such tools to easily build user-friendly interfaces.\r\n\r\nI guess you should start by defining with more precision what you and your users need to do before making an informed decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://app.shapediver.com/\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_smoothing\r\n  [3]: https://www.vectary.com/\r\n  [4]: https://www.onshape.com/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060658/online-3d-object-editor/58075346#58075346","title":"Online 3D object editor"}],"owner":{"reputation":1159,"user_id":1829048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/suzXe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Coskun Ozogul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1829048/coskun-ozogul"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569310829,"creation_date":1569235359,"question_id":58060658,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060658","body_markdown":"Is there an online 3D object (.stl or .obj) viewer/editor (free or not) which gives to the user the possiblity of uploading a 3D object and making some modifications like smoothing etc ? \r\n\r\nAfter my searchs, I found ShapeDiver which is the perfect tool but, their price policy is not adapted, you can pay a fortune in just one day if a client want to play with 3D models.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.shapediver.com/\r\n\r\nI finally found this but too slow : \r\n\r\nhttps://makeprintable.com/\r\n\r\nCould someone please advice me a web tool which can make the work ? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060658/online-3d-object-editor","title":"Online 3D object editor"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12106338,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-S4-U-l9O_Eo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdyZ__0E5lAQlCoF98DHkzmrMf9xQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ANTONIO VIVI","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106338/antonio-vivi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569310612,"post_id":58064136,"comment_id":102545406,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060657/ggplot-axis-position-and-minor-ticks/58064136#comment102545406_58064136"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1049,"user_id":11741943,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLPzb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zhiqiang Wang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11741943/zhiqiang-wang"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1049,"user_id":11741943,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLPzb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zhiqiang Wang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11741943/zhiqiang-wang"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569247541,"last_edit_date":1569247541,"creation_date":1569247070,"answer_id":58064136,"question_id":58060657,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58064136","body_markdown":"I know very little about your code, but I think I have identified the place \r\nwhere your problem is.

This is a viable (but not the only) option for adding (or refining) properties too, so here&#39;s one way you&#39;d do it:\r\n\r\n    function modifyProperty&lt;T, K extends keyof T, U&gt;(\r\n      obj: T,\r\n      key: K,\r\n      modify: (oldValue: T[K]) =&gt; U\r\n    ) {\r\n      let ret = obj as any;\r\n      ret[key] = modify(obj[key]);\r\n      return ret as { [P in keyof T]: P extends K ? U : T[P] };\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nThe function `modifyProperty(obj, key, modify)` takes an object `obj` and one of its keys `key`, and a `modify` callback that converts the old value to the new value.  Here&#39;s how one might use it:\r\n\r\n    const principalLegal1 = modifyProperty(principalLegal, &quot;address1&quot;, a =&gt;\r\n      Object.assign(a, address)\r\n    );\r\n    principalLegal1.address1.country; // okay\r\n    \r\n    const principalLegal2 = modifyProperty(principalLegal1, &quot;address2&quot;, a =&gt;\r\n      Object.assign(a, address)\r\n    );\r\n    principalLegal2.address1.country; // okay\r\n    principalLegal2.address2.country; // okay\r\n\r\nNotice how after each mutation with `modifyProperty` you throw away your existing `principalLegal` variable and use the returned value instead.  This is possibly clunky, but it is consistent with a static type system in which the type of a variable cannot change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow luckily for you, you are not changing the type of `principalLegal` *arbitrarily*... instead you are *narrowing* it by adding subproperties.  And TypeScript does have the ability to use [control flow analysis](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What&#39;s-new-in-TypeScript#control-flow-based-type-analysis) to narrow the types of variables.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately there&#39;s currently no built-in way in TypeScript for a function call to just narrow the type of one of its arguments (although this is slated to change in TS3.7 with the [`asserts` type predicate modifier](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/32695)).  So there&#39;s no direct way to say that `Object.assign(foo, bar)` will narrow `foo` itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n#UPDATE#\r\n\r\nThe `asserts` modifier just got merged to master so the nightly builds support it now.  If you install `typescript@next` locally, you can do something like this and see that it works:\r\n\r\n    function assign&lt;T, U&gt;(target: T, source: U): asserts target is T &amp; U {\r\n      Object.assign(target, source);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    assign(principalLegal.address1, address);\r\n    principalLegal.address1.country; // okay\r\n    \r\n    assign(principalLegal.address2, address);\r\n    principalLegal.address1.country; // okay\r\n    principalLegal.address2.country; // okay\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now, you can use a [user-defined type guard](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards) that does the assignment and returns `true`.  When you then check the return value and `throw` if it is not `true`, the compiler will understand that the type of the variable has been unconditionally narrowed.  It&#39;s a bit of an abuse of type guards, and the `asserts` modifier should hopefully fix this soon.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the function:\r\n\r\n    function assign&lt;T, U&gt;(x: T, y: U): x is T &amp; U {\r\n      Object.assign(x, y);\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s how we&#39;d use it:\r\n        \r\n    if (!assign(principalLegal.address1, address)) throw new Error();\r\n    principalLegal.address1.country; // okay\r\n    \r\n    if (!assign(principalLegal.address2, address)) throw new Error();\r\n    principalLegal.address1.country; // okay\r\n    principalLegal.address2.country; // okay\r\n\r\nThis is a bit annoying but probably less annoying than discarding variables; it&#39;s up to you, I guess.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, hope that helps; good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play//?ts=Nightly#code/MYewdgzgLgBAhgEwQJwKYQjAvDA3gKBhgEswFUAPALj0KJIRoCJTyKmAaOoqSqZgJJlKTOgF8uRUAFcwUZAE8aBeg2Yy5iztxi8K-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-XT3qzwJSphEk6vKVwYN0ADyZtQrJpcAwxByYH1cEPYIwAbD0Q31Vyc6vz7ONI05iRDAdhuEqcAKOO4CTh+WRfoE4ILg6-LIIKwr5jBW6nDue4YMih7HkQZ6mheUBXjed4Pk+-wQK+AbvnCm5weCP7Uac-6mJoqbAfYIBgRBGFMSxiLMQBihASBvHgTETIsmyHLXhAt5gBKUp6vq1CalKNragGNAUCQmDijAABkA4RkRJFkYpFEUFpdF0OWla6MgnrRNY+C8jA+oAIQKUp64MZ+tRCfuVGIgGQaeChADuwyoLFACiyAocg+r2QJwU4X+olcRJfExJ5Pl+RRGUZCFuFhScEW6B4MVxYlyUgKl6WBbBmW-mxOXiTx+WlYE5VIuxZhidxoHgUAA)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060616/how-do-i-object-assign-to-sub-property-of-an-object-in-typescript/58066293#58066293","title":"How do I Object.assign to sub-property of an object in Typescript?"}],"owner":{"reputation":786,"user_id":4507580,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f40bdb58f4ea441a226cb1ceab86ae2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"avalanche1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4507580/avalanche1"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569504181,"creation_date":1569235251,"question_id":58060616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060616","body_markdown":"At 1st I create an object `principalLegal`, then I add to it&#39;s `address#` properties all of the properties of `address` constant.  \r\nI do this because I don&#39;t want to manually declare many times over all the `address` properties inside of `principalLegal.address#`.\r\n\r\n    const address = {\r\n      index: {\r\n        id: &quot;index&quot;,\r\n        text: &quot;Index&quot;,\r\n      },\r\n      country: {\r\n        id: &quot;country&quot;,\r\n        text: &quot;Country&quot;,\r\n      },\r\n      // Many other fields here\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    const principalLegal = {\r\n      _id: &quot;principalLegalData&quot;,\r\n      text: &quot;Principal Data&quot;\r\n      name: {\r\n        id: &quot;principalName&quot;,\r\n        text: &quot;Principal name&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      address1: {\r\n        _id: &quot;principalAddress1&quot;,\r\n        text: &quot;Principal Address 1&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      address2: {\r\n        _id: &quot;principalAddress2&quot;,\r\n        text: &quot;Principal Address 2&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      // address3 and so on..\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    Object.assign(principalLegal.address1, address);\r\n    Object.assign(principalLegal.address2, address);\r\n\r\nBut, when I try to access `principalLegal.address1.country`, Typescript says  \r\n`Property &#39;country&#39;

It would probably need a custom type converter and custom UITypeEditor control etc.\r\n\r\nI checked the above links on MSDN and on cryotek website. There were examples of how to implement a simple PickList control that gets populated (by overriding GetStandardValues() in your TypeConverter class etc) at runtime inside the Property Grid.

User will make the necessary edits and then the DateTimePicker control will collapse and the string in the property grid will be updated to something like: &quot;2018-03-07 05:30:00 -04:30&quot;. (Additionally, apart from DateTimePicker, an additional dropdown to take timezone value also will be great but that&#39;s for later).\r\n\r\nI am a .Net newbie and if I can get some sample code or examples or help/guidance in this, it will be of great help to me.

This is how I create my clients, set their user context and create my tokenClient instances:\r\n```\r\nconst adminClient = new Fabric_Client();\r\nconst admin = await adminClient.createUser(user_opts);\r\nadminClient.setUserContext(admin, true);\r\nlet adminConfig = {\r\n\tadmin: admin,\r\n\tadminClient: adminClient,\r\n\tadminTokenClient: adminClient.newTokenClient(channel)\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst server = await serverClient.createUser(server_opts); \r\nserverClient.setUserContext(server, true);\r\nlet serverConfig = {\r\n    server: server,\r\n    serverClient: serverClient,\r\n    serverTokenClient: serverClient.newTokenClient(channel)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLater on, I&#39;m using these ```config``` objects to issue some tokens to different users. How I issue tokens to my server account from my issuer (admin) account:\r\n```\r\nconst txId = adminConfig.adminClient.newTransactionID();\r\nlet issueQuery = {\r\n\ttokenClient: adminConfig.adminTokenClient,\r\n\ttxId: txId,\r\n\tchannel: channel,\r\n\tparams: []\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor(let i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {\r\n\tlet param = {\r\n\t\towner: serverConfig.server.getIdentity().serialize(),\r\n\t\ttype: &#39;test&#39;,\r\n\t\tquantity: &#39;1&#39;\r\n\t}\r\n\tissueQuery.params.push(param);\r\n}\r\nlet issueTx = await waitForIssue(issueQuery);\r\n```\r\nThis successfully issue three tokens to the server as expected. The problem is that when I try to access to the tokens of my server like the example they provide using a similar code:\r\n```\r\nlet server_tokens = await serverConfig.serverTokenClient.list();\r\nfor (let server_token of server_tokens) {\r\n\tconsole.log(server_token.id);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult is just empty and I don&#39;t get any error messages. However, when I check the transaction using ```queryTransaction(txId)``` for the  token issue transaction I generate, I can see that owner of the issued tokens in that transaction is the server and that&#39;s how I can be sure that I can successfully issue the tokens to the server. Is there any other way to check the tokens of my server? Or shouldn&#39;t I use a different client and user context per each user as they suggest? Because, previously I was able to see the tokens of the server when I used a single client and single user context to issue and list tokens. But this approach caused me problems when I was trying to transfer my tokens asynchronously.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060587/hyperledger-fabric-2-0-cant-access-fabtokens-of-users-using-node-js-sdk","title":"Hyperledger Fabric 2.0, Can&#39;t Access Fabtokens of Users Using Node.js SDK"},{"tags":["angular8","angular-material-6"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8080,"user_id":9226213,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d9b1e59fd7fb8bc106b44b337ce5d83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"G.

Either you will have to come up with a hacky solution that will probably break in the future (see below), or use something other than a list.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nSwiftUI tends to have two types of Views\r\n\r\n1. Those designed to be easily modifiable and composable, providing unlimited customizability for a unique look and feel.\r\n2. Those designed to provide a standard, consistent feel to some type of interaction, regardless of what app they are used in.\r\n\r\nAn example of type 1 would be Text. You can change font size, weight, typeface, color, background, padding, etc. It is designed for you to modify it.\r\n\r\nAn example of type 2 would be List. You are not in direct control of row height, you can&#39;t change the padding around views, you can&#39;t tell it to show only so many rows, etc. They don&#39;t want it to be very customizable, because then each app&#39;s lists would behave differently, defeating the purpose of a standard control.\r\n\r\n*List is designed to fill the entire parent View with as many rows as possible, even if they are empty or only partially on screen (and scroll if there are too many to show at once).*\r\n\r\n**Your issue**\r\n\r\nThe problem you are having comes about because the size of the List does not affect the size of its rows in any way. SwiftUI doesn&#39;t care if there are too many or too few rows to fit in your preferred size; it will happily size its rows according to content, even if it means they don&#39;t all show or there are empty rows shown.\r\n\r\nIf you really need rows to resize according to the size of their parent, you should use a VStack. If it needs to scroll, you will need to wrap the VStack in a ScrollView.\r\n\r\n**Hacky solution**\r\n\r\nIf you still insist on using a list, you will have to do something like the following:\r\n\r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n\r\n        @State private var textHeight: Double = 20\r\n        let listRowPadding: Double = 5 // This is a guess\r\n        let listRowMinHeight: Double = 45 // This is a guess\r\n        var listRowHeight: Double {\r\n            max(listRowMinHeight, textHeight + 2 * listRowPadding)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var strings: [String] = [&quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;]\r\n\r\n        var body: some View {\r\n            VStack {\r\n                HStack {\r\n                    Text(String(format: &quot;%2.0f&quot;, textHeight as Double))\r\n                    Slider(value: $textHeight, in: 20...60)\r\n                }\r\n                    VStack(spacing: 0) {\r\n                        Color.red\r\n                        List {\r\n                            ForEach(strings, id: \\.self) { item in\r\n                                Text(item)\r\n                                    .font(.custom(&quot;Avenir Next Regular&quot;, size: 12))\r\n                                    .frame(height: CGFloat(self.textHeight))\r\n                                    .background(Color(white: 0.5))\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                        // Comment out the following line to see how List is expected to work\r\n                        .frame(height: CGFloat(strings.count) * CGFloat(self.listRowHeight))\r\n                        Color.red\r\n                }.layoutPriority(1)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe slider is there to show how the list row heights change with the height of their child view. You would have to manually pick `listRowPadding` and `listRowMinHeight` to get the appearance that best matches your expectation. If Apple ever changes how a List looks (changes padding, minimum row heights, etc.) you will have to remember to come back and adjust these values manually.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060530/swiftui-resizable-list-height-that-dependent-on-an-element-count/58065245#58065245","title":"SwiftUI - Resizable List height that dependent on an element count"}],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":10667562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WCJs1RPOxok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAErw/ZHEJmPOSSvE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abjox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10667562/abjox"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":92,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58065245,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569251013,"creation_date":1569234959,"question_id":58060530,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060530","body_markdown":"I have some troubles with dynamically changing List height that dependent on elements count.\r\n\r\nI tried this solution but it didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nList {\r\n    ForEach(searchService.searchResult, id: \\.self) { item in\r\n        Text(item)\r\n        .font(.custom(&quot;Avenir Next Regular&quot;, size: 12))\r\n    }\r\n}.frame(height: CGFloat(searchService.searchResult.count * 20))\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060530/swiftui-resizable-list-height-that-dependent-on-an-element-count","title":"SwiftUI - Resizable List height that dependent on an element count"},{"tags":["basic"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6115,"user_id":6083222,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/io3di.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeff Zeitlin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6083222/jeff-zeitlin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569236855,"post_id":58060529,"comment_id":102518724,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060529/basic-dialect-what-language-is-this#comment102518724_58060529"},{"owner":{"reputation":984,"user_id":3670607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c0ac3a4aac38bc184c7b6c1e45e98e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Xypron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3670607/xypron"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569531181,"post_id":58060529,"comment_id":102637669,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060529/basic-dialect-what-language-is-this#comment102637669_58060529"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":1743846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed077dc7d1c5ee92fc510d8c55b68115?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"firat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1743846/firat"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569234957,"creation_date":1569234957,"question_id":58060529,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060529","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using Concerto post processing app from AVL and I&#39;m having hard time with scripting language we use here.

For application gateway, where you are trying to pull data through\r\n    REST, you can use Azure functions and then you use Cosmos DB or any\r\n    storage to save data. I see , after getting device data from Partner\r\n    network, you are routing it to IoT-Hub (I would not say, its\r\n    incorrect), however once we pull data through Rest, we can directly\r\n    put into DB. So my Answer is to use Azure functions to pull data\r\n    from Partner solutions and put into DB.\r\n 2. If partner device is capable of running Azure IoT sdks or can be\r\n    provisioned to send data to IoT Hub directly, this will ease lot of\r\n    things and you would be able to send D2C and C2D messages easily.\r\n    further, here you can route data to DB by using configuration from\r\n    IoT Hub.\r\n 3. For your devices you can use IoT Hub Directly or can use Azure\r\n    IoT Edge (device gateway as you pointed ), both are fine , depends\r\n    on use case and also if we want to do some edge computation or\r\n    analytics at device side. And one important suggestions, use Azure\r\n    functions where ever you find that you have to integrate devices\r\n    data through Rest. Most cost effective in such scenarios.\r\n\r\nLet me know if it clears your doubts.

In this case, we will not be using the gateway made in 1 anymore.\r\n\r\n3- Finally, we will have our own devices connected to our IoT Hub, the partner&#39;s devices will always be connected to our

As that methods returns an `IEnumerable` which is never null you might need to adapt your assertion to test `valueDate.Any()` is true.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060507/using-xpathevaluate-with-if-then-else/58061132#58061132","title":"Using XPathEvaluate with If Then Else"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":6018541,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd86ef743bdd11418a50f1e1f75f44d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CasqueOuille","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6018541/casqueouille"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7540,"user_id":3396821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOipg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MLavoie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3396821/mlavoie"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569238206,"creation_date":1569234838,"last_edit_date":1569236397,"question_id":58060507,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060507","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get the result of an xPath expression in C#.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the code :\r\n\r\n    const string xml = &quot;&lt;ROOT&gt;&lt;NODE&gt;VALUE1&lt;/NODE&gt;&lt;/ROOT&gt;&quot;;\r\n    using (var textReader = new StringReader(xml))\r\n    {\r\n         var xmlDoc = XDocument.Load(textReader);\r\n         var valueDate = xmlDoc.XPathEvaluate(@&quot;if(boolean(//NAMEDNODE)) then //ANYNODE else //NODE &quot;);\r\n         Assert.IsNotNull(valueDate);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen I execute this code, I get an XPathException `invalid token`.\r\n\r\nBut when I test the xPath in an xPath tester, I get no error.\r\n\r\nDo you have an idea about the reason?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060507/using-xpathevaluate-with-if-then-else","title":"Using XPathEvaluate with If Then Else"},{"tags":["qt","qml","qt5","qchart"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1632,"user_id":1138455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5ba55670fdb3f3ef96ddae4d245bc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Herr von Wurst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1138455/herr-von-wurst"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569250805,"post_id":58060503,"comment_id":102526701,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060503/where-is-the-empty-space-coming-from#comment102526701_58060503"}],"owner":{"reputation":1632,"user_id":1138455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5ba55670fdb3f3ef96ddae4d245bc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Herr von Wurst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1138455/herr-von-wurst"},"last_editor":{"reputation":112790,"user_id":6622587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAYS0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"eyllanesc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6622587/eyllanesc"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569446510,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569251277,"creation_date":1569234830,"last_edit_date":1569251277,"question_id":58060503,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060503","body_markdown":"I am trying to layout a ChartView which is behaving strangely.

applied but edgeAgent log rotation is not applied. I check the log rotation settings in the \r\n/var/lib/docker/containers/{container_id}/hostconfig.json file. \r\n\r\n**What I have done so far:**\r\n\r\nRemoved the image through `sudo docker rmi sudo docker rmi mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0` and removed all the containers including the edgeAgent container and restarted the edge environment by `sudo systemctl restart iotedge`. The log rotation is still not applied to the new container created by the edge run time. I am not sure, what am I missing ? Any help is appreciated. **Please note**, I don&#39;t want to apply log rotation by creating a daemon.json file and placing it in the edge run time folder. I need to do it through the container options specified in the deployment.template.json file.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060489/log-rotation-on-iot-edge-agent","title":"Log rotation on IoT Edge Agent"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10465,"user_id":5325862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cF7Mi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"camille","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5325862/camille"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569254081,"post_id":58060485,"comment_id":102528390,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060485/how-to-get-scroll-up-vs-down-in-r#comment102528390_58060485"},{"owner":{"reputation":222780,"user_id":1855677,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SASvH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"42-","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1855677/42"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569281359,"post_id":58060485,"comment_id":102538108,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060485/how-to-get-scroll-up-vs-down-in-r#comment102538108_58060485"}],"owner":{"reputation":3160,"user_id":1174052,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9d393fa6677ad9c4ed9f1f160a24a1e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cmbarbu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1174052/cmbarbu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3160,"user_id":1174052,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9d393fa6677ad9c4ed9f1f160a24a1e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cmbarbu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1174052/cmbarbu"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569831020,"creation_date":1569234782,"last_edit_date":1569831020,"question_id":58060485,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060485","body_markdown":"I am using `getGraphicsEventEnv` to get events over an R plot.

So, let&#39;s suppose I&#39;ve got this .json file:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t&quot;fieldConfs&quot; : \r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t&quot;Object1&quot; : {&quot;origin&quot; : &quot;IdArticulo&quot;\t, &quot;destinationTable&quot; : &quot;Articulos&quot;, &quot;destinationField&quot; : &quot;IdArticulo&quot;, &quot;dataType&quot; : &quot;nvarchar&quot;},\r\n\t\t\t&quot;Object2&quot; : {&quot;origin&quot; : &quot;Nombre&quot;\t, &quot;destinationTable&quot; : &quot;Articulos&quot;, &quot;destinationField&quot; : &quot;Descrip&quot;, &quot;dataType&quot; : &quot;nvarchar&quot;}\r\n\t\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd I want to deserialize it into a list of Objects, so each Object inside &quot;fieldConfs&quot; (Object1, object2) will go into a List.\r\n\r\nMy code so far is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing Newtonsoft.Json;\r\n\r\nnamespace modules.dataProcessing.ConfManager\r\n{\r\n    public class Field\r\n    {\r\n        public string Origin { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public string DestinationTable { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public string DestinationField { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public string DataType { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class FieldConfs\r\n    {\r\n        public string Id\r\n        {\r\n            get; set;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public IList&lt;Field&gt; Fields\r\n        {\r\n            get; set;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class JsonTools\r\n    {\r\n        public static List&lt;FieldConfs&gt; loadConf(string json)\r\n        {\r\n            List&lt;FieldConfs&gt; fC = new List&lt;FieldConfs&gt;();\r\n            fC = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;FieldConfs&gt;&gt;(json);\r\n            return fC;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I call it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;FieldConfs&gt; confs = new List&lt;FieldConfs&gt;();\r\nconfs = JsonTools.loadConf(json);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know I&#39;m lacking something, but I&#39;m new to C# and to Json as well and I don&#39;t know what it is that I&#39;m missing. Any hint or help would be appreciate it. Thank you all beforehand.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** For a little more clarification, what I&#39;m really asking is for advice on how should I do this, since I&#39;m new.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to be able to deserialize the json into a list so I can later do in code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nforeach (List&lt;FieldConfs&gt; list in confs) {\r\n\r\n     // Code for each list where list would be Object1... Object2... \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo maybe I&#39;m not structuring well my Json... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m explaining myself well...
