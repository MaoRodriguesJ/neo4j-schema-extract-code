I have been studying the new IPV6 addressing system...\r\n\r\nIPv6 is hardly new; it dates back to 1995, when _[RFC 1883, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1883)_ was published.\r\n\r\n&gt; Can a specific IPV6 address be trusted to tie back to a specific\r\n&gt; unique Device Packet, at a forensic quality level?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not completely sure what you mean. IPv6 restores the IP end-to-end paradigm, where every host has a unique IP address, but there are non-standard techniques that can disrupt that.\r\n\r\n&gt; I understand that the MAC address of the originating Device is\r\n&gt; included in the IPV6 and it remains with the message at all stages in\r\n&gt; its existence.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure where you got that idea. IP (both IPv4 and IPv6) have nothing to do with the data-link protocol used to carry them. IP can be carried by any number of data-link protocols, and only the IEEE protocols (ethernet, Wi-Fi, token ring, etc.) use MAC addressing. Other data link protocols (frame relay, PPP, ATM, HDLC, etc.), including common residential WAN protocols (PPPoA) do not use MAC addressing. The data-link addressing is only valid on the data-link LAN.\r\n\r\n&gt; Packets are never broken up anywhere in its travel and hence one would\r\n&gt; assume that any &#39;packet capture&#39; software could, in essence, have the\r\n&gt; Unique MAC address and could be tracked to one Device and one only. Is\r\n&gt; this true or not?\r\n\r\nMAC addresses are data-link addresses, and they are not valid or seen beyond the local LAN.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478692/ipv6-and-mac-addresses/58479022#58479022","title":"IPV6 and MAC Addresses"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":5232971,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10649de014c929e2180dd16ebef075be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"robertdaleweir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5232971/robertdaleweir"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571696761,"creation_date":1571620782,"question_id":58478692,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478692","body_markdown":"I have been studying the new IPV6 addressing system and I have one question that I feel was not answered anywhere in the IPV6 specification, which I have read extensively.

Generally it works great but we regularly receive queries from customers confused about similar things and would like to provide an FAQ.  I&#39;m referring to issues like:\r\n\r\n- unsure which login details to use, since they&#39;re unfamiliar with SSO and don&#39;t realise they can just use their own O365 / Microsoft accounts, which many already have\r\n- surprised/suspicious when our application asks them for permission to access their account\r\n- have set Outlook etc to remember their password, haven&#39;t had to use it in years and don&#39;t know what it is, and we can&#39;t reset it since the account is in *their own directory*\r\n\r\nNot asking for help with the specific issues above, my question is about the best way to provide easy access to some kind of FAQ page **during** the AAD sign-in process. The issue is that once they start the process (which is the part they struggle with), they only get redirected back to the application upon successful auth, and Microsoft doesn&#39;t give much control over the UI.\r\n\r\nA perfect solution would be to have an FAQ or help link on all the AAD sign-in pages, but I can&#39;t see any way to do this, even on our own company branded sign-in pages. The only relevant option is &quot;Sign-in page text&quot;, which isn&#39;t really sufficient.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the best-practice way to help non-technical users with these kinds of problems?

Trust me on this.\r\n\r\nCurrently have tabs with static content, but using &lt;a href=&quot;#tab-id&quot; ...&gt; generates a relative address, which gets prepended with the base href, so that doesn&#39;t work.  Adding the current URL works, with the unpleasant side effect of regenerating the entire page, so it really doesn&#39;t &quot;work.&quot;  The only viable solution I can see is to use Ajax for each tab.  Not so bad except that some of the data used for the tab headings is derived from the database, so a little duplication (as I stated, the tabs contained static-ish data).\r\n\r\nAny better ideas out there (like how to tell a browser to  that the anchor tag really is on the current page?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478665/using-jquery-tabs-with-a-base-tag","title":"using jquery tabs with a base tag"},{"tags":["java","javafx","gridpane"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":58620,"user_id":2991525,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/497fb92ca5e55e1eee47b1c4c7043586?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fabian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2991525/fabian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571677762,"post_id":58478664,"comment_id":103312247,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478664/how-to-fix-labels-on-gridpane-stacking-on-index-0-0-it-seems-to-be-ignoring-m#comment103312247_58478664"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7812,"user_id":2423906,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/515124652/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sedrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2423906/sedrick"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571622937,"creation_date":1571622937,"answer_id":58478900,"question_id":58478664,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58478900","body_markdown":"You are using `GridPane.setConstraints();` incorrectly.

When reviewing the code in the template, they use a generic `IDataStore&lt;T&gt;` interface to define the following method: \r\n\r\n    public interface IDataStore&lt;T&gt; {\r\n    Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt; GetItemsAsync(bool forceRefresh = false); }\r\n\r\nThen they define the `MockDataStore` class which implements the `IDataStore&lt;Item&gt;` interface in the following way:\r\n\r\n    public class MockDataStore : IDataStore&lt;Item&gt; {\r\n        readonly List&lt;Item&gt; items;\r\n    \r\n        public MockDataStore() {\r\n            items = new List&lt;Item&gt;() { \r\n                new Item { Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), Text = &quot;First item&quot;, Description=&quot;This is an item description.&quot; },\r\n                new Item { Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), Text = &quot;Second item&quot;, Description=&quot;This is an item description.&quot; } } \r\n    };\r\n\r\n        public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Item&gt;&gt; GetItemsAsync(bool forceRefresh = false) =&gt; await Task.FromResult(items);\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the `forceRefresh` parameter is doing.  I know they call `GetItemsAsync` with an empty parameter list and call it once with `true` as a parameter.  I can&#39;t find any documentation on MSDN regarding the `forceRefresh` used in the `Task.FromResults` method.\r\n\r\nThe `Item` class is nothing special, it&#39;s a standard public class with three public string auto-implemented get/set properties named `Id`, `Text`, and `Description`.\r\n\r\nThis is a Xamarin Forms template so they register the `MockDataStore` class as a Dependency Service when they start the app, and they only reference the methods through a public get-only instance of the `IDataStore&lt;Item&gt;` like so:\r\n\r\n    public class BaseViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged {\r\n        public IDataStore&lt;Item&gt; DataStore =&gt; DependencyService.Get&lt;IDataStore&lt;Item&gt;&gt;(); \r\n\r\nThen in a load command method they reference the `GetItemsAsync` call:\r\n\r\n    var items = await DataStore.GetItemsAsync(true);\r\n\r\nMy guess is that if `forceRefresh` is false, the call to get the items won&#39;t actually occur if certain circumstances are true, like if the items passed to `Task.FromResult(items)` is not null, for example.  I don&#39;t know if the `forceRefresh` relates to the mobile phone&#39;s refresh indicator for the list view, or if it&#39;s only referring to refreshing the items list itself.\r\n\r\nAny clarification or references that someone could provide would be helpful. And if you need any additional information from me to help find an answer (which I expect you will, as this is my first posting), I will be happy to edit the question and provide that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478657/what-does-the-forcerefresh-parameter-do-in-a-method-that-only-calls-await-task-f","title":"What does the forceRefresh parameter do in a method that only calls await Task.FromResult(items)?"},{"tags":["dart"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1080,"user_id":1953515,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50b08d90afd96271299a4dc0fcf672f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"julemand101","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1953515/julemand101"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571637159,"creation_date":1571637159,"answer_id":58480459,"question_id":58478654,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58480459","body_markdown":"First, the error you got has nothing to do with using types as keys but are before you never initialize the hand variable. So you need to do this:\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;Piece, int&gt; hand = {};\r\n\r\nNow, you will not get the exception but your code will properly not work as expected since `hand.containsKey(Piece(5))` will return false and `print(&#39;${hand[Piece(5)]}&#39;)` will return `null`.\r\n\r\nThis is because the map `Map&lt;Piece, int&gt;` are not using the Type as key but instead objects of the type `Piece`. So if we take your code here:\r\n\r\n      Map&lt;Piece, int&gt; hand = {};\r\n      hand[Piece(5)] = 5;\r\n    \r\n      if (hand.containsKey(Piece(5))) {\r\n        print(&quot;contains&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      print(&#39;${hand[Piece(5)]}&#39;);\r\n\r\nYou are here creating a new object instance of the Piece type each type you are writing &quot;Piece(5)&quot;. Since each of this objects will be a separate instance of a Piece then you will not receive the value 5 you have saved because the value 5 has been saved for a different object than you are requesting.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple solutions for that and I don&#39;t know which one are the best for you. But the simple solution in this case is to either only creating one instance of Piece and reuse that:\r\n\r\n    void main() {\r\n      Map&lt;Piece, int&gt; hand = {};\r\n      final piece = Piece(5);\r\n      hand[piece] = 5;\r\n    \r\n      if (hand.containsKey(piece)) {\r\n        print(&quot;contains&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      print(&#39;${hand[piece]}&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr make a const constructor for your Piece class so instances with the same arguments are made into the same object. This solution requires that the `int type` are final since you cannot edit a const constructed object (since it is constant):\r\n\r\n    class Piece {\r\n      final int type;\r\n    \r\n      const Piece(this.type);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void main() {\r\n      Map&lt;Piece, int&gt; hand = {};\r\n      hand[const Piece(5)] = 5;\r\n    \r\n      if (hand.containsKey(const Piece(5))) {\r\n        print(&quot;contains&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      print(&#39;${hand[const Piece(5)]}&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that you need to prefix you object instantiation with `const` like &quot;const Piece(5)&quot; each time you want a instance where you are sure it will returns the same object for the same arguments.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478654/how-can-i-use-class-as-maps-key/58480459#58480459","title":"How can I use `class` as Map&#39;s key?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10114094,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1jZ13.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tukushiari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10114094/tukushiari"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58480459,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571637159,"creation_date":1571620356,"question_id":58478654,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478654","body_markdown":"I use `Piece class` as Map&#39;s key.\r\n\r\nBut when this code ran,  error occured `Uncaught exception:\r\nC.JSNull_methods.$indexSet is not a function`.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nclass Piece {\r\n  int type;\r\n\r\n  Piece(this.type);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  Map&lt;Piece, int&gt;

The particular problem I met is how to associate errors from the rails server with inputs on the svelte side\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, I tuned up error responses from the server; in general, they look like this:\r\n\r\n    { errors: \r\n      { generic: [&lt;messages without association with particular field&gt;], \r\n        email: [&quot;Already taken&quot;, &lt;msg_2&gt;, ...], \r\n        password: [&quot;Too short&quot;, ...],\r\n        field_N: [...]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*generic* errors can be &quot;Invalid Login Credentials&quot;, &quot;Your account is locked&quot;, &quot;Internal Server Error&quot;, etc. \r\nOther errors must be related to the form fields and must be displayed next to them.\r\n\r\nHere is my current approach **signup.svelte**:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    let email;\r\n    let password;\r\n    function registerRequest() {\r\n      let regURL = baseURL+&#39;/api/users/&#39;;\r\n      let data = {&quot;user&quot;: {&quot;email&quot;: email, &quot;password&quot;: password}};\r\n      fetch(regURL, {\r\n        method: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n        body: JSON.stringify(data),\r\n        headers: {\r\n          &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n      .then(function(response) {\r\n        if (!response.ok) {\r\n          return response.json()\r\n        } \r\n      })\r\n      // if errors present then iterate through errors object\r\n      .then(function(error) {\r\n        // find id of the message field and insert actual messages\r\n        for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(error.errors)) {\r\n     document.getElementById(key).insertAdjacentHTML(&#39;beforeend&#39;,value);\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;style&gt; .errormessage { color: red; } &lt;/style&gt;\r\n      \r\n    &lt;form class=&quot;col-sm-12 col-lg-6&quot; on:submit|preventDefault={registerRequest}&gt;\r\n      &lt;!-- here I need to create errormessage container for each field. --&gt;\r\n      &lt;!-- first one is generic to display generic errors --&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;errormessage&quot; id=&quot;generic&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;label for=&quot;UserEmail&quot;&gt;Email address&lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;UserEmail&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;emailHelp&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter your email here...&quot; bind:value={email}&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;errormessage&quot; id=&quot;email&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;label for=&quot;UserPassword&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;UserPassword&quot; placeholder=&quot;...and your password here&quot; bind:value={password}&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;errormessage&quot; id=&quot;password&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  \r\n      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n     \r\n\r\nI want to unify the code above with frontend validation. If the `errors` object is presented - show messages next to the fields with errors. It seems to me that using `getElementById` is overkill. Why should I use it if my DOM never reloading? Every time on `input` it will search for ids. Maybe it should be listener that listens changes of the errors object? I tried to bind the custom `event` with Svelte\r\n`import { createEventDispatcher } from &#39;svelte&#39;;`, but with no luck.\r\n\r\nPlease help and share your thoughts.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478635/proper-error-handling-with-svelte-from-api-rails","title":"Proper error handling with Svelte from API

I cant figure out how to bind each of the dropdown option to the corresponding JSON object. I have seen the use of this below, which I have tried but I cant get it to work for me:\r\n```\r\n&lt;mat-option *ngFor=&quot;let i of Industry.industry&quot; [value]=i&gt;{{i.name}}&lt;/mat-option&gt;\r\n```\r\nIdeally I need to be able to select an object (either linked to the list by value of name or something) and have the json load when create is clicked.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m just starting out so any help is appreciated.

While the `indent` feature is implemented in the `startElement` scope. Also the indent will add a blank line in document.\r\n\r\nThe invoke stack is **different** in java 8 between java 9:\r\n\r\nIn Java 8: `ToStream#startElement-&gt; ToStream#indent(IfNecessary)`\r\n\r\nIn Java 9: `ToStream#startElement-&gt;ToStream#flushCharactersBuffer(IfNecessary)-&gt;ToStream#indent(IfNecessary)`\r\n\r\nWhile the `flushCharactersBuffer` also do indent when we open the indent feature like: `transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, &quot;yes&quot;);`  Also the condition to invoke method: `flushCharactersBuffer` and method: `indent` almost same. \r\n\r\nThat means in Java 9, this would add two new line for each need indented element, result to blank lines appeared.\r\n

I&#39;m trying to develop some code with Java 9 and `javax.xml` libraries (both mandatory for my task) that edits an XML file and I&#39;m having some weird issues adding child nodes.\r\n\r\nThis is the XML file:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;users&gt;\r\n&lt;/users&gt;\r\n```\r\nand I want to edit it build something like this:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;users&gt;\r\n    &lt;user&gt;\r\n        &lt;name&gt;A name&lt;/name&gt;\r\n        &lt;last-name&gt;Last Name&lt;/last-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;username&gt;username&lt;/username&gt;\r\n    &lt;/user&gt;\r\n&lt;/users&gt;\r\n```\r\nNow, the first run of the code adds a single blank line before the `&lt;user&gt;` node. When it runs for a second time fills with more blank lines:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;users&gt;\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    &lt;user&gt;\r\n                \r\n        &lt;name&gt;name&lt;/name&gt;\r\n                \r\n        &lt;last-name&gt;lastname&lt;/last-name&gt;\r\n                \r\n        &lt;username&gt;username&lt;/username&gt;\r\n            \r\n    &lt;/user&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;user&gt;\r\n        &lt;name&gt;name&lt;/name&gt;\r\n        &lt;last-name&gt;lastname&lt;/last-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;username&gt;username&lt;/username&gt;\r\n    &lt;/user&gt;\r\n&lt;/users&gt;\r\n```\r\nThis is the XML generated after running the program 2 times. As you can see, it adds blank lines before the `&lt;user&gt;` nodes and between the other nodes, exactly n-1 blank lines between nodes being n the times the code was executed.  \r\n\r\nWondering what is the content of those nodes before updating the file I wrote the next code:\r\n```java\r\nint i=0;\r\nwhile (root.getChildNodes().item(i)!=null){\r\n  Node aux = root.getChildNodes().item(i);\r\n  System.out.println(&quot;Node text content: &quot;.concat(aux.getTextContent()));\r\n  i++;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1st execution:\r\n```txt\r\nNode text content: \r\n\r\nNode text content: namelastnameusername\r\n```\r\n2nd execution:\r\n```txt\r\nNode text content: \r\n    \r\n    \r\nNode text content: \r\n        name\r\n        lastname\r\n        username\r\n    \r\nNode text content: \r\n\r\nNode text content: namelastnameusername\r\n```\r\n3rd execution\r\n```\r\nNode text content: \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\nNode text content: \r\n                \r\n        name\r\n                \r\n        lastname\r\n                \r\n        username\r\n            \r\n    \r\nNode text content: \r\n    \r\n    \r\nNode text content: \r\n        name\r\n        lastname\r\n        username\r\n    \r\nNode text content: \r\n\r\nNode text content: namelastnameusername\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, this is the Java code:\r\n```java\r\nprivate static void saveUser(String firstName, String lastName, String username){\r\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\r\n    try {\r\n      DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\r\n      Document doc = builder.parse(new File(databaseFile));\r\n      Element root = doc.getDocumentElement();\r\n      root.normalize();\r\n\r\n      // build user node\r\n      Element userNode = doc.createElement(&quot;user&quot;);\r\n      Element nameNode =  doc.createElement(&quot;name&quot;);\r\n      Element lastNameNode = doc.createElement(&quot;last-name&quot;);\r\n      Element usernameNode = doc.createElement(&quot;username&quot;);\r\n\r\n      //build structure\r\n      nameNode.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(firstName));\r\n      lastNameNode.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(lastName));\r\n      usernameNode.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(username));\r\n\r\n      userNode.appendChild(nameNode);\r\n      userNode.appendChild(lastNameNode);\r\n      userNode.appendChild(usernameNode);\r\n      root.appendChild(userNode);\r\n\r\n      //write the updated document to file or console\r\n      TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();\r\n      Transformer transformer = transformerFactory.newTransformer();\r\n      DOMSource source = new DOMSource(doc);\r\n      StreamResult result = new StreamResult(new File(databaseFile));\r\n      transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.ENCODING, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n      transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, &quot;yes&quot;);\r\n      transformer.transform(source, result);\r\n    }catch (SAXException | ParserConfigurationException | IOException | TransformerException e1) {\r\n      e1.printStackTrace();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe only solution I could find is to delete blank lines after XML generation, but I think it&#39;s not a proper solution and I would like to find some alternatives first.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how to tackle this problem?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478632/how-to-avoid-extra-blank-lines-in-xml-generation-with-java","title":"How to avoid extra blank lines in XML generation with

am stuck on a programming problem and looking for some second eyes on my code. I have searched through the site and have yet found a working solution. At a basic level I want a user to press a button and pull all their &quot;Open&quot; positions into the userform for them to analyze. \r\n\r\nAt a technical level, I have a Userform with a Frame and a command button that when pressed will search through Column 3 (named &quot;Status&quot;) on a spreadsheet and find the word &quot;Open&quot;. Once this word is found then I want textboxes to be automatically created inside the frame with the data from the &quot;found&quot; row for columns 4 - 10. So if 1 row is found with &quot;Open&quot; then I would expect 7 textboxes to be created on the userform. From the picture below I would expect 28 textboxes. \r\n\r\nI have not yet been able to figure out how to have vba automatically create the textboxes. When I press the command button nothing happens - no errors - nothing. I tried to use the breakpoints to troubleshoot but nothing was revealed to me to take action on. I am not &quot;seeing&quot; why it is not working here. \r\n\r\nI tried moving the code outside the userform and into a module and calling the function but that didn&#39;t do anything. I also tried setting the rows I want as constants and creating a separate &quot;AddBox&quot; function to call within the main code but that didn&#39;t work but I also didn&#39;t quite understand that code as much as I do the one I am posting now.

This application&#39;s main window has a `NavigationView`, with list items bound to a fetch request, and selecting any of these items populates the detail view. The navigation view goes kind of like this:\r\n\r\n\tNavigationView {\r\n\t\tVStack(spacing: 0) {\r\n\t\t\tList(fetchRequest) { DetailRow(model: $0) }\r\n\t\t\t\t.listStyle(SidebarListStyle())\r\n\r\n\t\t\tHStack {\r\n\t\t\t\tButton(action: add) { Text(&quot;+&quot;) }\r\n\t\t\t\tButton(action: remove) { Text(&quot;-&quot;) }\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tText(&quot;Select a model object&quot;)\r\n\t}.navigationViewStyle(DoubleColumnNavigationViewStyle())\r\n\r\n`DetailRow` is a `NavigationLink` that also defines the detail view:\r\n\r\n\tNavigationLink(destination: ModelDetail(model: model)) {\r\n\t\tText(model.name)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nI believe that the contents of `ModelDetail` isn&#39;t very important; either way, I&#39;m fairly flexible with it.\r\n\r\nIn the navigation view, the &quot;-&quot; button, which calls the `remove` method, should delete the currently-selected model object and return to the default, empty detail view. Unfortunately, I&#39;m struggling to come up with the right way to do this. I believe that I need the following interactions to happen:\r\n\r\n1. subview communicates to navigation view which model object is currently selected\r\n2. user clicks &quot;-&quot; button, navigation view&#39;s `remove` method deletes currently selected object\r\n3. subview notices that its model object is being deleted\r\n4. → subview calls `PresentationMode.dismiss()`\r\n\r\nStep 3 is the one I&#39;m struggling with. Everything is working out alright so far without using view-model classes on top of the Core Data classes, but I feel stuck trying to figure out how to get the subview to call `dismiss()`. This needs to happen from the detail view, because it gets the `PresentationMode` from the environment, and the `NavigationView` changes it.\r\n\r\nWhile I can get a `Binding` to the model&#39;s `isDeleted` property through `@ObservedObject`, I don&#39;t know how I can actually react to that change; `Binding` appears to use publishers under the hood, but they don&#39;t expose a publisher that I could hook up to with `onPublish`, for instance.\r\n\r\nKVO over `isDeleted` might be possible, but listening from a value type isn&#39;t great; there&#39;s no good place to remove the observer, which could become problematic were the app to run for too long.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the guidance for this type of problem?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478604/dismiss-navigation-view-when-core-data-object-is-deleted","title":"Dismiss navigation view when Core Data object is deleted"},{"tags":["system","operation"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12248827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5d5dde95570cd55eef522ab717905a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Strugglingperson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12248827/strugglingperson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571619803,"creation_date":1571619803,"question_id":58478603,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478603","body_markdown":"Many operation systems textbooks mention that the PSW and PC are pushed onto a stack during an interrupt.

I have a base population of several thousand cases in which work item D was always the last event. However, in this population, the 2nd to last work item could be A, B, or C. I need to measure, on average, the time between the end of work item A, B, or C and the end of work item item D.  What would this code look like?\r\n\r\nSupplementary information: The pertinent tables I would join:\r\n\r\n1. Database.workitems (identifies work item a b c d)\r\n\r\n2. Database.workitemstatus (show possible statuses - open, in progress, complete - of work items)\r\n\r\n3.

Docker Compose will [automatically create a &quot;user-defined bridge network&quot;](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/) and so **`links:` are never necessary in `docker-compose.yml` files**.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that `links:` acts exactly like [`depends_on:`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on).  If you run `docker-compose up app`, it will also start `dbc` for you.  Compose will start starting the database before it starts starting your application, but it has no way to know that the database is done starting; typically you use a script like [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) to ensure the database is ready, or set a [`restart:`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#restart) policy and just crash if the database isn&#39;t accessible yet.\r\n\r\nFor a container `a` to reach a container `b` in the same `docker-compose.yml` file, the only requirement is that they be on the same network.  The easiest way to accomplish this is for neither to have a `networks:` block at all.  If they both do, they must have some name in common, and if only one does, it must contain `default`.  The service names (in your example, `app` and `dbc`) will be usable as ordinary hostnames, with no further configuration required by you.  Setting `hostname:` has no effect on networking; `container_name:` will provide an additional name for the container; neither option is necessary.\r\n\r\nRegardless of any other settings, inter-container communications always use whatever port the server process inside the container is listening on.  Neither `ports:` nor `expose:` are required; if you have `ports:` and the two port numbers are different, you&#39;ll connect to the _second_ port number.  For the `mysql:5.6` image you show, you will always connect to port 3306 (exposing a different port number has no effect).\r\n\r\nIn most cases, you should never specify `links:`, `expose:`, `hostname:` or `container_name:`; they&#39;re unnecessary for networking and don&#39;t set useful properties of the containers.  I&#39;d also recommend just using the default network setup, and never specifying `networks:` anywhere in the file.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478593/how-links-instruction-work-in-docker-compose/58478813#58478813","title":"How &quot;links&quot; instruction work in docker-compose?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4384,"user_id":3317808,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c8272382fcd9841919bc1f8709d25a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"overexchange","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3317808/overexchange"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571622003,"creation_date":1571619650,"question_id":58478593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478593","body_markdown":"In the below `docker-compose.yml` file:\r\n\r\n    app:\r\n      build: ../../\r\n      dockerfile: docker/release/Dockerfile\r\n      links:\r\n        - dbc\r\n      volumes_from:\r\n        - webroot\r\n      environment:\r\n        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: someapp.settings.release\r\n        MYSQL_HOST: db\r\n        MYSQL_USER: user1\r\n        MYSQL_PASSWORD: passwd\r\n      command:\r\n        - uwsgi\r\n        - &quot;--socket /var/www/someapp/someapp.sock&quot;\r\n        - &quot;--chmod-socket=666&quot;\r\n        - &quot;--module someapp.wsgi&quot;\r\n        - &quot;--master&quot;\r\n        - &quot;--die-on-term&quot;\r\n    \r\n    dbc:\r\n      image: mysql:5.6\r\n      hostname: db\r\n      expose:\r\n        - &quot;3386&quot;\r\n      environment:\r\n        MYSQL_DATABASE: someapp\r\n        MYSQL_USER: user1\r\n        MYSQL_PASSWORD: passwd\r\n        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: passwd\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nthere is dependency of `app` service on `dbc` service.\r\n\r\n      links:\r\n        - dbc\r\n\r\nBut, app cannot connect to database, with the above syntax.\r\n\r\nWe had written a ansible probe as a separate container service, that does:\r\n\r\n    wait_for host={{ probe_host }}\r\n          port={{ probe_port }}\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat does `links` exactly ensure?\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478593/how-links-instruction-work-in-docker-compose","title":"How &quot;links&quot; instruction work in docker-compose?"},{"tags":["flutter"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":4128781,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A5G2K8k6pCo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAUjM/DmICwlhPMdA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"smark91","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4128781/smark91"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571625342,"post_id":58478993,"comment_id":103290481,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478590/custom-listtile-inherit-theme/58478993#comment103290481_58478993"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4077,"user_id":884522,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b06d01e141676a2fbe165ede9303a7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jacob Phillips","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/884522/jacob-phillips"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571623895,"creation_date":1571623895,"answer_id":58478993,"question_id":58478590,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58478993","body_markdown":"I think `null` does use the default.

You can find the issue report [here](http://issuetracker.google.com/issues/143065963) and you can click the ☆ in the top left to let Google know that you are experiencing the issue too.\r\n\r\n###Workaround:\r\nFor now, as long as your dates are all of the same format, you can convert the date into a format that is defined in the Date Constructor of the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date):\r\n```lang-js\r\nfunction parseDate(date) {\r\n  var parts = date.split(&quot;

Why does this happen?\r\nIts a 5 rounds dice game.\r\n\r\nI already tried many ways to solve the problem, but I don&#39;t get it\r\n\r\nWhat I need is to add the odd numbers that come out of the dice roll and then store them in an array.\r\nI created a for loop to do the sum but it results in 0.\r\n\r\n    function ronda_1() {\r\n        turno_j1();\r\n\r\n        for (i=0; i&lt;puntos_j1.length;i++) {\r\n            sumaj1+=puntos_j1[i];\r\n            sumaRonda1_j1.push(sumaj1);\r\n        }\r\n\t\t\r\n        for (i=0; i&lt;puntos_j2.length;i++) {\r\n\t\t    sumaj2+=puntos_j2[i];\r\n\t\t\tsumaRonda1_j2.push(sumaj2);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThe function from where the dice roll numbers are taken is as follows:\r\n\r\n    function primerTiro_j1() {\r\n\r\n        document.datos.tiro2j1.disabled=false;\r\n\r\n        for (i=1; i&lt;=1; i++) {\r\n            numero[0] = Math.floor((Math.random() * 6) + 1);\r\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById(&quot;bd1&quot;).src = &quot;img/&quot;+numero[0]+&quot;.png&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tnumero[1] = Math.floor((Math.random() * 6) + 1);\r\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById(&quot;bd2&quot;).src = &quot;img/&quot;+numero[1]+&quot;.png&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tnumero[2] = Math.floor((Math.random() * 6) + 1);\r\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById(&quot;bd3&quot;).src = &quot;img/&quot;+numero[2]+&quot;.png&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\tif (numero[0] % 2 == 1)\t{\r\n\t\t    puntos_j1.push(numero[0]);\r\n\t\t} \r\n\r\n        if (numero[1] % 2 == 1) {\r\n\t\t    puntos_j1.push(numero[1]);\r\n\t\t} \r\n        \r\n        if (numero[2] % 2 == 1) {\r\n\t\t    puntos_j1.push(numero[2]);\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThe numbers are stored correctly in the array points_j1 () but I cannot add them","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478577/i-cant-save-numbers-in-array-js","title":"I can&#39;t save numbers in array - JS"},{"tags":["python-2.7","tensorflow","nlp","summarization"],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":5591878,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8d0fdc3c3cee4f19c981f3939b48881?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alannaC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5591878/alannac"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571619385,"creation_date":1571619385,"question_id":58478576,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478576","body_markdown":"I am working with a text summarization problem, and I am trying to use the following architecture [Pointer Generator] (https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator).

I have decided to not go down the pretrained model+ fine tuning route and instead want to experiment with &quot;co training&quot; the model from scratch on CNN/Daily Mail data and my dataset since these two are structurally same. My dataset also involves condensing large text into one or two sentences, while introducing novel words not present in the input. \r\n\r\nI am thinking of using 10% of my data and 90% of CNN/DM data in the first epoch and going down, use 100% of my data.

And incrementing the percentage of my dataset within this &quot;combined&quot; dataset by 10% in each epoch, I&#39;d have a total of 11 epochs. I am confused if this is a feasible way to go about it.

I haven&#39;t updated my graphics drivers because the last time I did that, I had to restore to a previous image.  \r\n\r\nHas anyone discovered any other work arounds?  Is there anything else I can try?  This worked fine - perfectly - 2 months ago.  I don&#39;t know what happened, but it is infuriatingly frustrating.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJess[![gephi config image][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3k37d.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478538/gephi-cannot-find-java-1-8-or-higher","title":"gephi cannot find java 1.8 or higher"},{"tags":["typescript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":50986,"user_id":2887218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WL57j.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jcalz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2887218/jcalz"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571620888,"post_id":58478537,"comment_id":103289683,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478537/subtypes-and-assignment-compatibility-in-typescript-when-s-extends-t#comment103289683_58478537"},{"owner":{"reputation":433,"user_id":1907159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/I8Xqc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LearningMath","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1907159/learningmath"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":50986,"user_id":2887218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WL57j.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jcalz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2887218/jcalz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571621649,"post_id":58478537,"comment_id":103289810,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478537/subtypes-and-assignment-compatibility-in-typescript-when-s-extends-t#comment103289810_58478537"}],"owner":{"reputation":433,"user_id":1907159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/I8Xqc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LearningMath","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1907159/learningmath"},"last_editor":{"reputation":433,"user_id":1907159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/I8Xqc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LearningMath","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1907159/learningmath"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571619376,"creation_date":1571618847,"last_edit_date":1571619376,"question_id":58478537,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478537","body_markdown":"Quoting the [Assignment compatibility][1]\r\nand [Subtypes and Supertypes][2] from the Typescript spec:\r\n&gt;S is **assignable** to a type T, and T is **assignable from** S, if S has no excess properties with respect to T ([3.11.5][3]) and one of the following is true:\r\n\r\n&gt;...\r\n\r\n&gt; S is an object type, an intersection type, an enum type, or the Number, Boolean, or String primitive type, T is an object type, and for each member M in T, one of the following is true:\r\n\r\n&gt;...\r\n\r\nAccording to this definition, `S` is allowed to be `Number`,`Boolean` or `String` and `T` to be an object type.
