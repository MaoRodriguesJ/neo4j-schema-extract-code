Please tell me what changes should be made to my current code.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using &quot;from phonenumber_field.formfields import PhoneNumberField&quot; for the phone number validation and it validates the number I&#39;ve entered, the only problem is that the users will have to type their country code and I cannot have that. I&#39;m using just the phonenumbers package so that users will not have to enter the country code.\r\n\r\n    /* forms.py */\r\n    import phonenumbers\r\n    from django import forms\r\n    from django.contrib.auth.models import User\r\n    from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\r\n    from validate_email import validate_email\r\n    from phonenumber_field.formfields import PhoneNumberField\r\n\r\n\r\n    class UserRegisterForm(UserCreationForm):\r\n        email = forms.EmailField()\r\n        # phone_number = PhoneNumberField()\r\n        phone_number = forms.IntegerField(required=True)\r\n\r\n        class Meta:\r\n            model = User\r\n            fields = [&#39;username&#39;, &#39;email&#39;, &#39;phone_number&#39;]\r\n\r\n        def clean_email(self):\r\n            email = self.cleaned_data.get(&quot;email&quot;)\r\n            if not validate_email(email, verify=True):\r\n                raise forms.ValidationError(&quot;Invalid email&quot;)\r\n            return email\r\n\r\n        def clean_phone(self):\r\n            phone_number = self.cleaned_data.get(&quot;phone_number&quot;)\r\n            z = phonenumbers.parse(phone_number, &quot;SG&quot;)\r\n            if not phonenumbers.is_valid_number(z):\r\n                raise forms.ValidationError(&quot;Number not in SG format&quot;)\r\n            return phone_number\r\n\r\n    /* views.py */\r\n    from django.shortcuts import render, redirect\r\n    from django.contrib import messages\r\n    from .forms import UserRegisterForm\r\n\r\n\r\n    def register(request):\r\n        if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;:\r\n            form = UserRegisterForm(request.POST)\r\n            if form.is_valid():\r\n                # user = form.save()\r\n                # phone_number = form.cleaned_data[&#39;phone&#39;]\r\n                # do something with phone number??\r\n                user = form.save()\r\n                user.refresh_from_db()\r\n                phone = form.cleaned_data.get(&#39;phone_number&#39;)\r\n                user.Meta.phone_number = phone\r\n                user.save()\r\n                username = form.cleaned_data.get(&#39;username&#39;)\r\n                messages.success(request, f&#39;Account created for {username}!&#39;)\r\n                return redirect(&#39;blog-home&#39;)\r\n        else:\r\n            form = UserRegisterForm()\r\n        return render(request, &#39;users/register.html&#39;, {&#39;form&#39;: form})\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect the output to validate the entered phone number in the phone field without its country code and only 8 digits and raise an error if that number does not exist.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006706/how-to-validate-phone-number-in-django","title":"How to validate phone number in django?"},{"tags":["nginx"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":153,"user_id":6204064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/233265043727921/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mikel Tawfik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6204064/mikel-tawfik"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568885708,"creation_date":1568885708,"answer_id":58007992,"question_id":58006703,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58007992","body_markdown":"you will use if file found .\r\n\r\n set file before your technical work .\r\n\r\nif found , use redirect to anther page \r\n\r\n\r\n        location / {\r\n        \r\n            set $cacheFile /www/technical.work;\r\n        \r\n            if (-f $cacheFile) {\r\n    \r\n    return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;\r\n    \r\n            }\r\n        \r\n        }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006703/how-to-display-another-page-during-technical-work/58007992#58007992","title":"How to display another page during technical work?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12089159,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cc28ca0fc9c45cadb8fd3182811e819?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12089159","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12089159/user12089159"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568885708,"creation_date":1568881327,"question_id":58006703,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006703","body_markdown":"When  need to stop nginx in order to make some changes,  need to display a page with a message that technical work is underway.

The region being plotted in both graphs is (0,200)x(0,200). However, there is so much overlap in both that the defined circles that you can see are the simply the last ones being plotted. Clearly the concentric blue and green circles around (190, 60) is the easiest shared feature to identify in the two plots. But let&#39;s look at some more:\r\n\r\n - Dark green circle at (70, 180)\r\n - Light green circle at (47, 2)\r\n - Blue circle at (110, 140)\r\n - Blue circle at (190, 160)\r\n\r\nWhat appears to be happening here is that you&#39;ve taken a plot and forced it into an area less than 1/9 the size of the original area, but you haven&#39;t scaled the actual elements of the graph any differently.

are victim of the [XY Problem][1] here.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start with the Y problem.\r\n**Your spin lock does not lock.**\r\nTo understand why  you spin lock does not work, you need to examine how a GPU handles the situation you are creating. You issue a warp, made of one or more thread-groups, each of which made by many threads. The execution of the warp is fast as long as the execution is parallel, that means that all the threads that make a warp (wavefront if you prefer), must execute *the same instruction* at *the same time*. Every time you insert a condition (like the `while` loop in your algo), some of your threads must take a route, and some the other. This is called *divergence* of the threads. The problem is that you cannot execute *different instructions* in parallel. \r\n\r\nIn this case the GPU can take one of two routes:\r\n\r\n1. *Dynamic branching* which means that the wavefront (the warp) takes one of the 2 routes, and deactivates the threads that should take the other. Then, it rolls back to pick up the sleeping threads where they were left.\r\n2. *Flat branching* which means that all threads execute both branches, then each thread discards the unwanted result and keeps the correct one.\r\n\r\nNow the funny part:\r\n\r\n**There is no cast rule stating how a GPU is supposed to handle branching.**\r\n\r\nYou have no way to predict whether the GPU will use one approach or the other, and in case of dynamic branching there is no way to know in advance if the GPU will put to sleep the straight route, the other, the branch with less threads or the one with more. There is no way to know in advance, and different GPUs might execute the code differently (and will). The same GPU might even change its execution with different driver versions. \r\n\r\nIn case of your spinlock, your GPU (and its driver, and the compiler version you are currently using) most probably go for the flat branching strategy. This means that both branches are executed by all threads of a warp, so there basically is no lock at all.\r\n\r\nIf you change the code (or add the `[branch]` attribute before the loop) you can force the dynamic branching flow. But this would not solve your issues. In the particular case of a spinlock, what you are asking the GPU to do is to shut off *all threads but one*. And this is not exactly what the GPU will want to do. The GPU will try to do the opposite, and shut the only thread that evaluates the condition differently. This will indeed lead to less *divergence* and increase performance…but in your case it will shut off *the only thread that is not in an endless loop*. So, you might get a full wavefront of threads locked in an endless loop, because the only one that might unlock the loop...is sleeping. Your **spinlock** has effectively become a **deadlock**.\r\n\r\nNow, in your particular machine, the program might even run fine. But you have exactly **zero guarantees** that the program will run on other machines, or even with different driver versions. You update the driver and boom, you program suddenly hits a GPU Timeout and crashes.\r\n\r\nThe best suggestion about spinlocks in GPUs is….don&#39;t use them. Ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s get back to you **Y problem**.\r\n\r\nWhat you really need is a way to *compute a sum of data in a large 2 dimensions array*.\r\nSo what you are really looking for is a good *reduction algorithm*. There are some on the internet, or you can code your own, depending on your needs.\r\n\r\nI will just add a few links to get you started, if you need them.\r\n\r\n[A Digression on Divergence][2]\r\n\r\n[NVIDIA - GPU Technology Conference 2010 Slides][3]\r\n\r\n[Goddeke - Introductory tutorial][4]\r\n\r\n[Donovan - GPU Parallel Scan][5]\r\n\r\n[Barlas - Multicore and GPU programming][6]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://xyproblem.info/\r\n  [2]: https://tangentvector.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/a-digression-on-divergence/\r\n  [3]: http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2010/presentations/S12312-DirectCompute-Pre-Conference-Tutorial.pdf\r\n  [4]: https://www.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~goeddeke/gpgpu/tutorial2.html\r\n  [5]: http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~ramani/cmsc828e_gpusci/ScanTalk.pdf\r\n  [6]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/reduction-algorithm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006663/implementing-a-spinlock-in-a-hlsl-directcompute-shader/58064256#58064256","title":"Implementing a SpinLock in a HLSL DirectCompute shader"}],"owner":{"reputation":1292,"user_id":189103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xuly6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"fpiette","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/189103/fpiette"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1292,"user_id":189103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xuly6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"fpiette","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/189103/fpiette"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58064256,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569352591,"creation_date":1568881158,"last_edit_date":1568881676,"question_id":58006663,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006663","body_markdown":"I try to implement a spin lock in a compute shader. But my implementation it doesn&#39;t seems to lock anything.\r\n\r\nHere is how I implement the spin lock:\r\n\r\n    void LockAcquire()\r\n    {\r\n        uint Value = 1;\r\n    \r\n        [allow_uav_condition]\r\n        while (Value) {\r\n            InterlockedCompareExchange(DataOutBuffer[0].Lock, 0, 1, Value);\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void LockRelease()\r\n    {\r\n        uint Value;\r\n        InterlockedExchange(DataOutBuffer[0].Lock, 0, Value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBackground: I need a spin lock because I have to compute a sum of data in a large 2 dimensions array. The sum is a double. Computing the sum with a single thread and a double loop produce the correct result. Computing the sum with multithreading produce the wrong result, even when introducing the spin lock to avoid conflict when computing the sum.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t use InterLockedAdd because the sum doesn&#39;t fit into a 32 bits integer and I&#39;m using a shader model 5 (Compiler 47).\r\n\r\nHere is the single thread version, producing the correct result:\r\n\r\n    [numthreads(1, 1, 1)]\r\n    void CSGrayAutoComputeSumSqr(\r\n        uint3 Gid  : SV_GroupID,\r\n        uint3 DTid : SV_DispatchThreadID, // Coordinates in RawImage window\r\n        uint3 GTid : SV_GroupThreadID,\r\n        uint  GI   : SV_GroupIndex)\r\n    {\r\n        if ((DTid.x == 0) &amp;&amp; (DTid.y == 0)) {\r\n            uint2 XY;\r\n            int   Mean = (int)round(DataOutBuffer[0].GrayAutoResultMean);\r\n            for (XY.x = 0; XY.x &lt; (uint)RawImageSize.x; XY.x++) {\r\n                for (XY.y = 0; XY.y &lt; (uint)RawImageSize.y; XY.y++) {\r\n                    int  Value  = GetPixel16BitGrayFromRawImage(RawImage, rawImageSize, XY);\r\n                    uint UValue = (Mean - Value) * (Mean - Value);\r\n                    DataOutBuffer[0].GrayAutoResultSumSqr += UValue;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand below is the multithreaded version. This version produce similar but different result on each execution which IMO is caused by the not functioning lock.\r\n\r\n    [numthreads(1, 1, 1)]\r\n    void CSGrayAutoComputeSumSqr(\r\n        uint3 Gid  : SV_GroupID,\r\n        uint3 DTid : SV_DispatchThreadID, // Coordinates in RawImage window\r\n        uint3 GTid : SV_GroupThreadID,\r\n        uint  GI   : SV_GroupIndex)\r\n    {\r\n        int  Value  = GetPixel16BitGrayFromRawImage(RawImage, RawImageSize, DTid.xy);\r\n        int  Mean   = (int)round(DataOutBuffer[0].GrayAutoResultMean);\r\n        uint UValue = (Mean - Value) * (Mean - Value);\r\n        LockAcquire();\r\n        DataOutBuffer[0].GrayAutoResultSumSqr += UValue;\r\n        LockRelease();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nData used:\r\n\r\n    cbuffer TImageParams : register(b0)\r\n    {\r\n        int2   RawImageSize;       // Actual image size in RawImage\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    struct TDataOutBuffer\r\n    {\r\n        uint   Lock;                             // Use for SpinLock\r\n        double GrayAutoResultMean;\r\n        double GrayAutoResultSumSqr;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    ByteAddressBuffer                  RawImage       : register(t0);\r\n    RWStructuredBuffer&lt;TDataOutBuffer&gt; DataOutBuffer  : register(u4);\r\n\r\nDispatch code:\r\n\r\n    FImmediateContext-&gt;CSSetShader(FComputeShaderGrayAutoComputeSumSqr, NULL, 0);\r\n    FImmediateContext-&gt;Dispatch(FImageParams.RawImageSize.X, FImageParams.RawImageSize.Y, 1);\r\n\r\nThe function GetPixel16BitGrayFromRawImage access RawImage byte address buffer to fetch 16 bit pixel value from a gray scale image.

But the build process is very complicated and is not working for me i am not being able to build the code.\r\n\r\nThe error that VSCode is giving is that it is not being able to find the imports\r\n\r\n#import “ESP8266.h”\r\n\r\nAlthough i cloned the library and added it to include search path in the c++ extension.\r\n\r\nSo my question is is there a way to either compile the cloned library into a usable sdk that i could import in VSCode?\r\n\r\nOr is there some other way i could import the library and include it in my program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006658/c-iot-framework-setup-on-vscode","title":"C++ iot framework setup on VSCode"},{"tags":["unity-container"],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":2139746,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0F4Ct.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andy Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2139746/andy-reed"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569838226,"creation_date":1568881117,"question_id":58006655,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006655","body_markdown":"I&#39;m upgrading my existing application from Unity 4.0.1 to 5.11.1.

you are using a Gradle multi-project layout and you like to use the Flyway plugin, I guess you can just configure the migration folder directly. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nflyway {\r\n  locations = [&quot;filesystem:$rootDir/data/migrations&quot;]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using stand-alone projects, you can package your migrations into a jar file using the `java` plugin, publish it to a Maven repository and make a normal dependency to that. If you don&#39;t want to put your migrations on the application classpath, you can put the dependency in a custom configuration. And if you have a non-standard folder structure, you can configure that through a `classpath:` value in the `locations` parameter. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nconfigurations {\r\n    flywayMigration\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n    flywayMigration &quot;com.group:database-project:1.0&quot; // Jar file containing your migration scripts\r\n}\r\n\r\nflyway {\r\n    configurations = [&quot;flywayMigration&quot;]\r\n    locations = [&quot;classpath:db/migrations&quot;]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless I misunderstand your requirements, you don&#39;t need a third party project for applying the migrations. (Though you still can if you want, of cause.) In my project, we are in a similar situation, and we have all our Spring Boot applications bundle the migrations scripts with them, and then on start-up we problematically apply the migrations to the database. In this scenario, on a clean database, the first application will perform all migrations, and all subsequent ones will just verify that everything is OK. Flyway supports parallel migrations as well, so there should not be any concurrency issues. You can achieve a similar thing using applying the Flyway plugin to all Boot projects and then make a task dependency from bootRun to flywayMigrate.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006651/how-to-run-flyway-migrations-from-a-gradle-dependency/58010425#58010425","title":"How to run Flyway migrations from a Gradle dependency?"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":1638190,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d677b13956d6c2b56efc7d4f0b60ceac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kjerins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1638190/kjerins"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568893980,"creation_date":1568881096,"question_id":58006651,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006651","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve got two Spring Boot webservices that must both use the same database, same schema and same tables - one service reads from the tables, the other writes to them.

Anything Git does automatically you can easily fix up afterwards if you like.  Either run the merge `--no-commit` and `git checkout @ path/to/submodule` before committing, or if you forget do `git checkout @~ path/to/submodule` and `git commit --amend`.  Lots of custom workflows can be automated through config settings or hooks, but I think this one is oddball enough you&#39;re going to have to script it if you want automation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006649/how-to-merge-submodules-and-always-keep-ours/58042668#58042668","title":"How to merge submodules and always keep &quot;ours&quot;?"}],"owner":{"reputation":166466,"user_id":4323,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqgFU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Zwinck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4323/john-zwinck"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":101,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569087691,"creation_date":1568881088,"question_id":58006649,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006649","body_markdown":"I have a git repo with a second repo as a submodule.

find it hard to exactly tell what the problem is(as I don&#39;t know how Angular handles this behind the scenes), but I think it boils down to how a stream that emits errors can be handled.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst obsErr$ = throwError(&#39;err&#39;);\r\n\r\nfunction intercept (src) {  \r\n  return src\r\n    .pipe(\r\n      catchError(v =&gt; {\r\n        return of(&#39;err caught in int1: &#39; + v);\r\n      })\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction intercept2 (src) {\r\n  return src\r\n    .pipe(\r\n      catchError(v =&gt; {\r\n        return of(&#39;err caught in int2: &#39; + v);\r\n      })\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Case 1\r\n```typescript\r\nobsErr$\r\n  .pipe(\r\n    intercept,\r\n    intercept2,\r\n  )\r\n  .subscribe(console.log) // err caught in int1: err\r\n```\r\nThe error will be caught only **once**, in the first interceptor.\r\n\r\n### Case 2\r\n```typescript\r\nobsErr$.pipe(intercept)\r\n  .subscribe(v =&gt; console.log(&#39;i1&#39;, v))\r\n\r\nobsErr$.pipe(intercept2)\r\n  .subscribe(v =&gt; console.log(&#39;i2&#39;, v))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the each interceptor will have its own source and also its own error to catch.\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful in some way.\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/catching-errors?file=index.ts).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006638/skipping-modal-window-from-httperrorhandle-in-authinterceptor/58008322#58008322","title":"Skipping

If `P` is a function parameter pack,\r\n&gt; the type `A` of each remaining parameter type of the argument template\r\n&gt; is compared with the type `P` of the *declarator-id* of the function\r\n&gt; parameter pack. Each comparison deduces template arguments for\r\n&gt; subsequent positions in the template parameter packs expanded by the\r\n&gt; function parameter pack. Similarly, if `A` was transformed from a\r\n&gt; function parameter pack, it is compared with each remaining parameter\r\n&gt; type of the parameter template. If deduction succeeds for a given\r\n&gt; type, the type from the argument template is considered to be at least\r\n&gt; as specialized as the type from the parameter template.\r\n\r\nWhen the parameter template is `#1` and the argument template is `#2`, the *declarator-id* `Args` (which is a type) from `#2` is compared with each of the remaining parameters in `#1` (there&#39;s none).  Therefore, `#2` is at least as specialized as `#1`.\r\n\r\nWhen the parameter template is `#2` and the argument template is `#1`, the *declarator-id* `Args` (which is a type) from `#2` is compared with each of the remaining parameters in `#1` (there&#39;s none).

successfully.\r\n\r\nThen the deducing #2 from #1, with `T` as A and `T, Args...` as P, also successfully results in `T = T, Args... = {}`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, according to the partial ordering rules, when call `call(10)`, the compiler should be giving the ambiguous error, but in fact all compiler called #1, why is this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006552/function-overloading-empty-parameter-list-vs-parameter-pack","title":"Function overloading: empty parameter list vs parameter

by observers in Fragment (because update from viewmodel coming each second (i have timer in viewModel)), but i&#39;m unregistering from observers in ```onPause```, so that solution don&#39;t work for me or i&#39;m did something wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the goalsis to fix animation\r\n\r\nThanks for helping, i&#39;m trying to fix this issues fot a week.

}\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe typical entry of my db is something like this\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n  \t&quot;bags&quot;: \r\n  \t{\r\n  \t\t&quot;integerValue&quot;: &quot;2&quot;\r\n  \t},\r\n    &quot;location&quot;: \r\n    {\r\n      &quot;geoPointValue&quot;: \r\n      {\r\n        &quot;latitude&quot;: 52.3696,\r\n        &quot;longitude&quot;: 4.86561111\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I add entries to firestore manually through google firestore web console, my app receives correct updates.\r\n\r\nWhen I add entries to firestore through the Rest API, my app receives correct updates.\r\n\r\nWhen I add entries to firestore using python&#39;s firestore-admin module, my app receives an empty update. NOTICE: only the real-time update received at entry creation is empty! If I just reload my app and query the db again, I get a correct entry! The db entry written by python is correct from every point of view.\r\n\r\nHere is what I mean for &quot;correct update&quot; (taken from chrome console):\r\n\r\n```\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: Object\r\n                              bags: 2\r\n                              location: GeoPoint&#160;{_lat: 52.3696, _long: 4.86561111}\r\n                              __proto__: Object\r\n```\r\nThis is instead the &quot;emtpy&quot;, wrong update:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: Object\r\n                              __proto__: Object\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have already tried to subscribe to snapshotChanges() instead of valueChanges(). The metadata are indeed present, but there is no .data() method to get the fields. Empty as well.\r\n\r\nThis is how I add entries to firestore in Python (simplified):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass MyPoint(object):\r\n    def __init__(self, bags, lat, long):\r\n        self.bags = bags\r\n        self.location = GeoPoint(lat, long)\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def from_dict(source):\r\n        # ...\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def to_dict(self):\r\n        # ...\r\n        return {\r\n            &#39;bags&#39;: self.bags,\r\n            &#39;location&#39;: self.location\r\n        }\r\n\r\nclass MyDatabase(object):\r\n\r\n    _firebaseConfig = {\r\n        [...]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        # Use the application default credentials\r\n        cred = credentials.ApplicationDefault()\r\n        firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, self._firebaseConfig)\r\n        self.db = firestore.client()\r\n\r\n    def send(self, point): \r\n        self.db.collection(u&#39;mycollection&#39;).add(point.to_dict())\r\n\r\npoint = MyPoint(1,0.0,0.0)\r\ndb = MyDatabase()\r\ndb.send(point)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong? Is it possible that firestore-admin performs entry creation in two steps, first creating an empty record and then settings value for it? That would explain it? \r\n\r\nI hope this is clear, thanks for any help, really a newbie with this.\r\n\r\n## Update ##\r\nI&#39;ve logged more accurately what happens when I subscribe to DocumentChangeAction Observables and I&#39;m even more confused.\r\n\r\nIn the following log, &quot;Doc&quot; represents the DocumentChangeAction, while &quot;data&quot; represents the actual .payload.doc.data() document body.\r\n\r\nStarting from an empty db, this is the updates I receive when I add the first point:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntab2.page.ts:49 Current Doc: {type: &quot;added&quot;, payload: {…}}\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: {}\r\ntab2.page.ts:49 Current Doc: {type: &quot;modified&quot;, payload: {…}}\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: {bags: 1, location: GeoPoint}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndeed, an empty &quot;add&quot; and a subsequent &quot;modify&quot;. I could deal with this.\r\n\r\nBut this is what I get when I add the second point (the &quot;bags=8&quot; one):\r\n\r\n```\r\ntab2.page.ts:49 Current Doc: {type: &quot;modified&quot;, payload: {…}}\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: {bags: 1, location: GeoPoint}\r\ntab2.page.ts:49 Current Doc: {type: &quot;added&quot;, payload: {…}}\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: {}\r\ntab2.page.ts:49 Current Doc: {type: &quot;modified&quot;, payload: {…}}\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: {bags: 1, location: GeoPoint}\r\ntab2.page.ts:49 Current Doc: {type: &quot;modified&quot;, payload: {…}}\r\ntab2.page.ts:50 Current data: {bags: 8, location: GeoPoint}\r\n```\r\nThis is too much: 4 updates.\r\n\r\n1. The *previous* entry is modified for some reason. Metadata maybe, not the fields\r\n2. The empty add is performed\r\n3. The *previous* entry is sent again (?)\r\n4. Finally the update for the new entry is sent, with data\r\n\r\nIs it just me or is this really unnecessarily complicated?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006524/empty-document-updates-on-angularfire-only-when-doc-is-added-through-python-fire","title":"Empty document updates on angularfire only when doc is added through python firebase SDK"},{"tags":["android","week-number","calendarview"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":2115815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nFyad.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2115815/ale"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568880582,"creation_date":1568880582,"question_id":58006521,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006521","body_markdown":"I need to implment a calendar showing week number according to ISO standard (first week of the year is the one containing January the 4th).\r\nOfficial documentation of CalendarView shows a deprecated method (setShowWeekNumber) which is not affecting at all view representation: passing either true or false to the method does not change calendar representation and week numbers are never shown on the right side.\r\n\r\nI would like to target at least API 15 to 29.\r\n\r\nIs there any other view capable of showing days in one month with week number on one side?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006521/showing-week-number-in-android-calendarview","title":"Showing week number in Android CalendarView"},{"tags":["java","tomcat","remote-debugging"],"owner":{"reputation":324,"user_id":4332916,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a5c5abdf6040aa245e99d0e15783eb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"flixe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4332916/flixe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568880582,"creation_date":1568880582,"question_id":58006520,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006520","body_markdown":"When i wanted to remote debug a Tomcat 9 Windows Service from my IDE i used to add these arguments to the JVM Options: `-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=*:8000,server=y,suspend=n`\r\n\r\nHowever this does not seem to work anymore with OpenJDK 12.0.2.

Apart from the many different types having the exact same format (`&quot;date-time&quot;`) making a mapping impossible, certain types have unfortunate definitions. A `DateInterval` results in an array of `&quot;date&quot;`, since it&#39;s an enumerable of `LocalDate`, but a simple start/end date format would work much better. Other methods are created with a `$ref` to very elaborate objects containing fields of absolutely no interest. Be aware that all of these should be serialized as simple strings (arguably not the intervals).\r\n\r\nI am able to create my own Type Mappers and adding them to a `AspNetCoreToSwaggerGeneratorSettings` like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: c# --&gt;\r\n\r\n\tvar nodaTimeTypeMappers = new[]\r\n\t{\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(DateInterval), &quot;date-interval&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(DateTimeZone), &quot;date-time-zone&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(Duration), &quot;duration&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(Instant), &quot;instant&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(Interval), &quot;interval&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(IsoDayOfWeek), &quot;iso-day-of-week&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(LocalDate), &quot;local-date&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(LocalDateTime), &quot;local-date-time&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(LocalTime), &quot;local-time&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(Offset), &quot;offset&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(OffsetDate), &quot;offset-date&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(OffsetDateTime), &quot;offset-date-time&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(OffsetTime), &quot;offset-time&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(Period), &quot;period&quot;),\r\n\t    CreateTypeMapper(typeof(ZonedDateTime), &quot;zoned-date-time&quot;),\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tforeach (var typeMapper in nodaTimeTypeMappers)\r\n\t{\r\n\t    settings.TypeMappers.Add(typeMapper);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tPrimitiveTypeMapper CreateTypeMapper(Type type, string name)\r\n\t{\r\n\t    return new PrimitiveTypeMapper(type, s =&gt;\r\n\t    {\r\n\t        s.Type = JsonObjectType.String;\r\n\t        s.Format = &quot;noda-time-&quot; + name;\r\n\t    });\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nto get something like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: js --&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&quot;NodaTimeRequest&quot;: {\r\n\t  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\r\n\t  &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: false,\r\n\t  &quot;required&quot;: [\r\n\t    &quot;dateTime&quot;, &quot;duration&quot;, &quot;instant&quot;, &quot;interval&quot;, &quot;isoDayOfWeek&quot;, &quot;localDate&quot;, &quot;localDateTime&quot;,\r\n\t    &quot;localTime&quot;, &quot;offset&quot;, &quot;offsetDate&quot;, &quot;offsetDateTime&quot;, &quot;offsetTime&quot;, &quot;zonedDateTime&quot;\r\n\t  ],\r\n\t  &quot;properties&quot;: {\r\n\t    &quot;dateTime&quot;:       { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date-time&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;dateInterval&quot;:   { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-date-interval&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;dateTimeZone&quot;:   { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-date-time-zone&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;duration&quot;:       { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-duration&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;instant&quot;:        { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-instant&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;interval&quot;:       { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-interval&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;isoDayOfWeek&quot;:   { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-iso-day-of-week&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;localDate&quot;:      { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-local-date&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;localDateTime&quot;:  { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-local-date-time&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;localTime&quot;:      { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-local-time&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;offset&quot;:         { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-offset&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;offsetDate&quot;:     { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-offset-date&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;offsetDateTime&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-offset-date-time&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;offsetTime&quot;:     { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-offset-time&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;period&quot;:         { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-period&quot; },\r\n\t    &quot;zonedDateTime&quot;:  { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;noda-time-zoned-date-time&quot; }\r\n\t  }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThis allows the formats to be used just like the existing formats (`&quot;date-time&quot;`, `&quot;date&quot;`, `&quot;time&quot;`, `&quot;time-span&quot;`), but I can&#39;t for the love of God figure out how to make the `swagger2csclient` use those formats to properly convert back to the corresponding Noda Time types.
