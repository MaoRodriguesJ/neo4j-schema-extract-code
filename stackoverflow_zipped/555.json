The other approach is to send something that *represents* the operation, but in a parseable form - then *parse it* at the client. This could be some kind of simple expression - there are lots of expression parsers/compilers available - or you could run the whole thing through Roslyn and send it as C# (for example).\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s also `MethodInfo.GetMethodBody` and `MethodBuilder.CreateMethodBody` - which work on a `byte[]` of raw IL, but those are *very advanced topics*, and again: frankly I think it would be the wrong way to do this.

entirely unrelated to your question: injecting an entity manager into an entity indicates a bad design and is not intended in symfony/doctrine&#39;s orm. \r\n\r\nwhat is causing your problem is, that the [user is serialized by symfony&#39;s session management][1] and when it tries to serialize a sufficiently complex object/service, it&#39;ll probably fail to do so. It is recommended to implement the Serializable interface to only serialize stuff that is actually needed (see same link). Which will solve this and other possible problems you might get. It also reduces the size of the session, which might get larger the bigger your application grows and attaches to the user object. Since the user object is loaded on every request anyway, serializing anything more than the mentioned properties (same link again) is simply wasteful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/user_provider.html#understanding-how-users-are-refreshed-from-the-session","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408426/why-injecting-entitymanagerinterface-return-me-a-cannot-serialize-phpfilesadapte/58411980#58411980","title":"Why injecting EntityManagerInterface return me a Cannot serialize PhpFilesAdapter error"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12225014,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBacJYR-NLrZuoZpDU-JrlTqgv9DrXm7hpErDpJ=k-s128","display_name":"Mike Devresse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12225014/mike-devresse"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58411980,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571247357,"creation_date":1571212663,"last_edit_date":1571247357,"question_id":58408426,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408426","body_markdown":"I have a problem that I&#39;ve never encountered before even if I&#39;ve done this on an other project.

your actual problems has simple solutions to avoid heavy stack consumption, so please don&#39;t mind adding details. However, without more knowledge about your particular code, here is a general approach to reduce the stack consumption in a recursive programs, based on trampolines and continuations.\r\n\r\n### Walker\r\n\r\nHere is a typical recursive function that is not trivially tail-recursive, written in Common Lisp because I don&#39;t know F#:\r\n\r\n    (defun walk (form transform join)\r\n      (typecase form\r\n        (cons (funcall join\r\n                       (walk (car form) transform join)\r\n                       (walk (cdr form) transform join)))\r\n        (t (funcall transform form))))\r\n\r\nThe code is however quite simple, hopefully, and walks a tree made of cons cells:\r\n\r\n1. if the form is a cons-cell, recursively walk on the car (resp. cdr) and join the results\r\n2. Otherwise, apply a transform on the value\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    (walk &#39;(a (b c d) 3 2 (a 2 1) 0)\r\n          (lambda (u) (and (numberp u) u))\r\n          (lambda (a b) (if a (cons a b) (or a b))))\r\n\r\n    =&gt; (3 2 (2 1) 0)\r\n\r\nThe code walks the form, and retain only numbers, but preserves (non-empty) nesting.\r\n\r\nCalling `trace` on `walk` with the above example shows a maximal depth of 8 nested calls.\r\n\r\n### Continuations and trampoline\r\n\r\nHere is an adapted version, called\r\n`walk/then`, that walks a form as previously, and when a result is\r\navailable, calls `then` on it. Here `then` is a **continuation**.\r\n\r\nThe function also returns a *thunk*, i.e. a parameterless closure.\r\nWhat happens is that when we return the closure, the stack is unwound, \r\nand when we apply the *thunk* it will \r\nstart from a fresh stack, but having advanced in the computation\r\n(I usually picture someone walking up an escalator that goes down).\r\nThe fact that we return a thunk to reduce the number of stack frames is part of the **trampoline**.\r\n\r\nThe `then` function takes a value, namely \r\nthe result that the current walk eventually will return.\r\nThe result is thus passed *down* the stack, and what is\r\nreturned at each step is a thunk function.\r\n\r\nNesting continuations allows to capture the complex behaviour of `transform`/`join`, by pushing the remaining parts of the computation in nested continuations.\r\n\r\n    (defun walk/then (form transform join then)\r\n      (typecase form\r\n        (cons (lambda ()\r\n                (walk/then (car form) transform join\r\n                           (lambda (v)\r\n                             (walk/then (cdr form) transform join\r\n                                        (lambda (w)\r\n                                          (funcall then (funcall join v w))))))))\r\n        (t (funcall then (funcall transform form)))))\r\n\r\nFor example, `(walk/then (car form) transform join (lambda (v) ...))` reads as follows: *walk the car of form with \r\narguments `transform` and `join`, and eventually call `(lambda (v) ...)` on the result; namely, walk down the cdr, and then join both results; eventually, call the input `then` on the joined result*.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing is a way to continually call the returned thunk until exhaustion; here is it \r\nwith a loop, but this could easily be a tail-recursive function:\r\n\r\n    (loop for res = \r\n         (walk/then &#39;(a (b c d) 3 2 (a 2 1) 0)\r\n                    (lambda (u) (and (numberp u) u))\r\n                    (lambda (a b) (if a (cons a b) (or a b)))\r\n                    #&#39;identity)\r\n       then (typecase res (function (funcall res)) (t res))\r\n       while (functionp res)\r\n       finally (return res))\r\n\r\nThe above returns `(3 2 (2 1) 0)`, and the depth of the trace never goes over 2 when tracing `walk/then`.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee [Eli Bendersky&#39;s article](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/on-recursion-continuations-and-trampolines/) for another take at this, in Python.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408410/how-to-avoid-stack-overflow-during-cps-conversion/58422638#58422638","title":"How to avoid stack overflow during CPS conversion?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":6584126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/311bc5dbfd35d55a2e2a9a8a24a0e833?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hanik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6584126/hanik"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571330218,"creation_date":1571330218,"answer_id":58437204,"question_id":58408410,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58437204","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve converted algorithm to trampoline form.

Kalmbachnet][1]\r\n - `QueryThreadCycleTime` also depends on implementation. (and also counts in sleep, as i tested) see for more: [What\r\n   does QueryThreadCycleTime actually count?

But it&#39;s not the `#include` lines which are the issue here.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s one correct way to write this program:\r\n\r\n    %option main\r\n    /* The %{ and %} delimiters must be at the beginning of the line.\r\n       Lines between %{ and %} are copied verbatim into the generated\r\n       file, near to the beginning.\r\n    */\r\n    %{ \r\n      #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; \r\n      #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n    %} \r\n    %%\r\n      /* These lines must be indented. Indented lines after the %% and\r\n       * before the first rule are inserted verbatim into the generated\r\n       * lexer right at the beginning of the definition of the function\r\n       * yylex. This lets you declare local variables, like nwords.\r\n       */\r\n      int nwords = 0;\r\n    ([a-zA-Z0-9])+    { ++nwords; }\r\n      /* Other rules go here. Every possible input should be matched by\r\n       * some rule.\r\n       */\r\n\r\n      /* At a minimum, you can ignore all unmatched characters\r\n       * using the following fall back (which should be the last rule).\r\n       */\r\n    .|\\n              ;\r\n\r\n    &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;           { printf(&quot;%d words found.\\n&quot;, nwords); }\r\n\r\nThe `&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;` rule is needed here to print out the number of words, because `nwords` will not be available outside of `yylex`. An alternative is to make `nwords` a global variable, but global variables are usually considered a bad idea. (And anyway you are using `%option main`, which means that you&#39;re not going to write the `main()` function so there is no other logical place to report the word count.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to make `nwords` global, you would declare `nwords` in the `%{...%}` block, so that it is declared outside of any function.\r\n\r\nFlex lets you leave out `%{` and `%}` as long as the code to be inserted is indented. But that&#39;s quite fragile and will confuse many people reading your code; it&#39;s definitely recommended that you use the delimiters, and then you don&#39;t have to worry about whether the inserted code is indented or not.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408369/difference-between-writing-statements-in-definitions-and-in-rules-parts-in-lex/58421716#58421716","title":"Difference between writing statements in definitions and in rules parts in lex"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":12222101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/febe71820b5a8a2dce4bc8aa0e8f714f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"borakur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12222101/borakur"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4539,"user_id":4370109,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UcQgO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Tompsett - 汤莱恩","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4370109/brian-tompsett-%e6%b1%a4%e8%8e%b1%e6%81%a9"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571305201,"creation_date":1571212422,"last_edit_date":1571305201,"question_id":58408369,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408369","body_markdown":"I am new to lex.

In the codes of creating edges I tried to figure out the reason (see the commented part), I found that in the entire loop, the addresses of n1 and n2 always retain the same. Still have no idea why this is happening.

What&#39;s wrong with this one?\r\n\r\nSimply put, there is no problem with this behavior. Firefox&#39;s behavior is also correct based on the specifications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the `::first-line` pseudo-element when the first line is the ` ::before`, `::after` pseudo-element is selectively shown in the specification&lt;sup&gt;[\\[1\\]][1]&lt;/sup&gt;. So it&#39;s no wonder that all browsers don&#39;t behave consistently.\r\n\r\n&gt; ## &#167; 4.1. Generated Content Pseudo-elements: ::before and ::after&lt;sup&gt;[\\[1\\]][1]&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n&gt; As with the content of regular elements, the generated content of `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements may be included in any `::first-line` and `::first-letter` pseudo-elements applied to its originating element.\r\n\r\nAlso, the behavior when applying the style is as written in Selectors Level 3, which matches the behavior of Google Chrome&lt;sup&gt;[\\[2\\]][2]&lt;/sup&gt;. And if you don&#39;t apply styles to the matching elements, it works like Firefox.\r\n\r\n&gt; ### 7.4. The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements&lt;sup&gt;[\\[2\\]][2]&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n&gt; The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements can be used to describe generated content before or after an element’s content. They are explained in CSS 2.1 [CSS21].\r\n\r\n&gt; When the `::first-letter` and `::first-line` pseudo-elements are applied to an element having content generated using `::before` or `::after`, they apply to the first letter or line of the element including the generated content. \r\n\r\nAs an example, Google Chrome and Firefox differ in whether the `::first-line` pseudo-element decoration is applied to the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.\r\n\r\n**Question code behavior in Google Chrome**\r\n\r\n[![It turns out that the part which hits the first line among the characters shown in the question sentence turns red.][3]][3]\r\n\r\n**Question code behavior in Firefox**\r\n\r\n[![It can be seen that the part corresponding to the first line of the characters shown in the question sentence is not red.][4]][4]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo do the same with Google Chrome in Firefox, you can apply the `color` property to the `::before` pseudo-element, as [@Ravi wrote in the comment][5] in the question text.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    p::before {\r\n      content: &#39;Red text&#39;;\r\n      display: block;\r\n      color: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This text should be red&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-pseudo-4/#generated-content\r\n  [2]: https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-3/#gen-content\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQ0BU.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KxNGN.png\r\n  [5]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408341/before-and-first-line-dont-work-right-correctly#comment103160608_58408341","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408341/before-and-first-line-dont-work-right-correctly/58409789#58409789","title":"::before and ::first-line don&#39;t work right correctly"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":5942560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b6da8eacb13e7df21967e119cb7af68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dimitry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5942560/dimitry"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5,"user_id":5942560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b6da8eacb13e7df21967e119cb7af68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dimitry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5942560/dimitry"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58409789,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571217602,"creation_date":1571212300,"last_edit_date":1571212750,"question_id":58408341,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408341","body_markdown":"MDN says:\r\n&gt; The ::first-line CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first line of a block-level element.\r\n\r\nBut when i write this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    p::before {content: &#39;Red text&#39;; display: block;}\r\n    p::first-line {color: red;}\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This text shouldn&#39;t be red&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nit doesn&#39;t work in Firefox (word &#39;Hello&#39; isn&#39;t red).

In this specific case, I am tying to validate user&#39;s credentials for log in. My idea is this:\r\n\r\nAuthController.php:\r\n\r\n   \t\tv::with(&#39;app\\\\Validators\\\\&#39;);\r\n\t\t$userValidation = v::notBlank()-&gt;email()-&gt;length(null, 255)-&gt;EmailExists()-&gt;setName(&#39;email&#39;);\r\n\r\n`EmailExists()` is my custom rule.\r\n\r\nEmailExists.php:\r\n\r\n    namespace app\\Validators;\r\n    \r\n    use PDO;\r\n    use Respect\\Validation\\Rules\\AbstractRule;\r\n    \r\n    class EmailExists extends AbstractRule\r\n    {\r\n    \tprotected $pdo;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic function __construct(PDO $pdo)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t$this-&gt;pdo = $pdo;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic function validate($input, $id = null)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t// a PDO query that checks if the email exists in database\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut I get an error of `Too few arguments to function app\\Validators\\EmailExists::__construct(), 0 passed and exactly 1 expected`, which is somewhat expected since the `AbstractRule` does not have a PDO injected and my class extends it.\r\n\r\nSo how to inject the PDO interface so that I can use it in my custom rules?\r\n\r\nAre you guys using another approach in validating this kind of data? Do note that I am writing an API, so the database validation is somewhat a must and after Googling for past two days, I have no solutions at hand.\r\n\r\nI am also using a `PHP-DI` where I create PDO interface.

But there are few difference between both of them.\r\n\r\n* An array of style/script files to add to the global context of the project if you add it in `angular.json` file will also be included in the bundle while build, where as if you define file/CDN in `index.html` this will load separately.\r\n\r\n* As per my understanding, assets that load via index file will not get copied in the bundle, but rather, it will show in the network tab.\r\n\r\n* Assets defined via `angular.json` file will have more features, such as -\r\n\r\n1. glob: A node-glob using input as base directory.\r\n2. input: A path relative to the workspace root.\r\n3. output: A path relative to outDir (default is dist/project-name). Because of the security implications, the CLI never writes files outside of the project output path.\r\n4. ignore: A list of globs to exclude.\r\n\r\nFor example - \r\n\r\n    { &quot;glob&quot;: &quot;**/*&quot;, &quot;input&quot;: &quot;src/assets/&quot;, &quot;output&quot;: &quot;/assets/&quot; },\r\nor \r\n\r\n    { &quot;input&quot;: &quot;src/external-module/styles.scss&quot;, &quot;inject&quot;: false, &quot;bundleName&quot;: &quot;external-module&quot; }\r\n\r\nFor more information, I strongly recommend you to read this -\r\n\r\n* https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408300/should-scripts-be-put-into-angular-json-or-into-index-html/58408538#58408538","title":"Should scripts be put into angular.json or into index.html?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7357,"user_id":3022127,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":27,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0OvV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"bersling","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3022127/bersling"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571216176,"creation_date":1571212127,"question_id":58408300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408300","body_markdown":"With Angular you have two options to load scripts (js and css):\r\n\r\n 1.

There some common programming principles that you can apply here: \r\n\r\nOne principle is DRY (Don&#39;t repeat yourself), which you can use for your `document.getElementById(id).innerHTML` that you use at several places. You should create a seperate function that does this: `setInnerHTMLById(id, message)`. This makes your lines shorter, easier to read and more maintainable.\r\n\r\nAnother thing here is how you use your `if` statement: The computer can make only one choice, so instead of using 3 `if` statements, consider using `if` and `else if` statements, or a `switch` (especially when you want to add lizard and spock). This makes your code faster because it will not have to check not unneccessary &#236;f`s (e.g. when the first `if` statement was already true, it will not check the second and third)   \r\n\r\nWith a `switch` statement implementing the new choices will be a piece of cake","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408289/i-need-to-make-rock-paper-scissors-for-computer-science-but-i-need-to-add-lizard/58408776#58408776","title":"I need to make Rock,Paper scissors for computer science but i need to add lizard and spock"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":951,"user_id":3433538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zoihC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kevinSpaceyIsKeyserS&#246;ze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3433538/kevinspaceyiskeysers%c3%b6ze"},"last_editor":{"reputation":951,"user_id":3433538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zoihC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kevinSpaceyIsKeyserS&#246;ze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3433538/kevinspaceyiskeysers%c3%b6ze"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571235151,"last_edit_date":1571235151,"creation_date":1571234099,"answer_id":58415061,"question_id":58408289,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415061","body_markdown":"I have changed your code a bit.

This work consists of several different things to do, which are defined in their own functions and are independent of each other.\r\n\r\n    void myFunction() {\r\n        foo();\r\n        bar();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, these functions run one after the other (just as I coded it), which is not necessary here and makes the whole function run longer than necessary. Running both functions in its own thread requires significantly more code:\r\n\r\n    void myFunction() {\r\n        UncaughtExceptionHandler eh = (th, t) -&gt; { throw new UndeclaredThrowableException(t);

I think I am missing some subtleties of when and how css is applied as well as how page loading, combined with asynchronous javascript, calls works.\r\n\r\n**This is working:**\r\nI have a css only modal which displays when the id of my modal (`view`) matches the hash in the url (`#view`). I use it to display images (it is the same modal div for all images and the actual image src is updated via event listeners added to links to the modals&#39; anchor). This is working fine.\r\n\r\n**This is working:**\r\nI wanted to extend this so I could directly link to an already open popup by providing the url as a hash parameter. I.e. `example.com/#view=imageUrl`. Just opening this will not make the css selector `:target` match, since it now contains the view, but if I split this off by checking `var hash = window.location.hash.substr(1);` I can separate the url from the anchor and if I then use:\r\n\r\n    window.history.pushState(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, window.location.href.split(&#39;=&#39;)[0]);\r\n    updateModal(imageUrl)\r\n\r\nwhere `updateModal` sets the source of the image to the split off url. All is fine, too, i.e. the site opens with the modal open and the image from the url in there.\r\n\r\n**This is not working:**\r\nNow I thought, it is possible that the image provided as hash parameter does not exist anymore, so I only want to show the modal if there is a valid image provided, otherwise go to the main page. I created a dummy image element, try loading the image from `imageUrl` and move the splitting and updating bits to the onload method of the dummy image, like so:\r\n\r\n    dummyImage.onload = function () {\r\n        window.history.pushState(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, window.location.href.split(&#39;=&#39;)[0])\r\n        updateModal(imageUrl)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf I do this, the modal does not show. The css does not get applied, why is this?\r\n\r\nI also tried changing the visibility of the modal myself:\r\n\r\n    dummyImage.onload = function () {\r\n        window.history.pushState(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, window.location.href.split(&#39;=&#39;)[0])\r\n        updateModal(imageUrl)\r\n        var myModal = document.getElementById(&#39;view&#39;)\r\n        myModal.style.display = &#39;flex&#39;\r\n        myModal.style.visibility = &#39;visible&#39;\r\n    }\r\nWhich makes the modal appear, but seems to add a style that cannot be overridden by the css anymore. Specifically, when I click the close link of the modal which just goes to a different anchor `#noname` the url changes, the css `:target` selector should not match anymore, but the modal does not close anymore. Why would the css not apply anymore?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408264/problems-when-combining-css-target-selector-with-url-hash-parameters-for-showin","title":"Problems when combining css :target selector with url hash parameters for showing a modal"},{"tags":["java","android"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":348,"user_id":9845929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pva40.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SebastienRieu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9845929/sebastienrieu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571212642,"post_id":58408263,"comment_id":103160648,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408263/how-to-make-toolbar-searchview#comment103160648_58408263"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11077518,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc41c5a2387db5f7eb473b6699d496d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11077518/max"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571212737,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571212021,"creation_date":1571212021,"question_id":58408263,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408263","body_markdown":"I have tablayout fragment wich has two fragments and in fragments recycler view.
