The parameter is `x`. The member `x`&#39;s full name is `abc::x`. \r\n\r\nPoint 2: The compiler is smart. \r\n\r\nWhen he&#39;s the only John around, you can call John Smith John and those around you can usually figure out who you&#39;re referring to. In a room full of Johns, you might need to use his full name. In the event of multiple John Smiths, you may need to go a step further and use John Paul Smith.\r\n\r\nIn a large room you could get away with calling John Paul Smith John if the other Johns are further away. Everyone nearby will assume you are referring to the the closest John. If they are wrong, you, the communicator, would have to be more explicit.\r\n\r\nThe compiler&#39;s doing the same thing. The default behaviour is to use the closest `x`, the one with the narrowest visible scope. That would be parameter `x`. If you want to use an `x` that is further away, you use an unambiguous name.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhile this case is easily avoidable and an easy source of bugs, making it a poor decision, you&#39;ll find you need to more fully qualify identifiers from time to time, for example when you want to call a member function of a base class from a derived class after the derived class has overridden the function.\r\n\r\nRelated, this is one of the reasons `using namespace std;` is [usually a bad idea][1]. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465449/how-to-access-class-variable-inside-a-constructor-to-assign-them-without-using-t/58465818#58465818","title":"how to access class variable inside a constructor to assign them without using this pointer in C++"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10575434,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FR_g2vzXslc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbD1_P6MPcSQ2Np5CikyJZzapT6mqg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SDK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10575434/sdk"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4412,"user_id":9837301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9414V.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JaMiT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9837301/jamit"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58465818,"answer_count":4,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571556234,"creation_date":1571500676,"last_edit_date":1571503988,"question_id":58465449,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465449","body_markdown":"How is it possible to access a class variable to assign its value when both the class variable and a parameter have the same name, without using the `this` pointer?

Also, the `onpageshow` event occurs every time the page is loaded, whereas the onload event does not occur when the page is loaded from the cache. \r\n\r\nSo, this is a working solution to your problem using `onpageshow` event listener on `newWindow` instead of `onload`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar newWindow = window.open(&quot;replaceWindow.html&quot;, &quot;newWindow&quot;, &quot;width=500,height=500&quot;);\r\n  \r\nnewWindow.onpageshow = () =&gt; {\r\n    let newDiv =  newWindow.document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);\r\n    newDiv.className = &quot;card-body&quot;;\r\n    newWindow.document.getElementsByClassName(&#39;contain&#39;).item(0).appendChild(newDiv);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ev_onpageshow.asp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465446/trying-to-open-a-new-window-and-create-elements-inside-it/58467013#58467013","title":"Trying to open a new window and create elements inside it"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":11981087,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBGDgfS1H5WBFFzwOIwHyoFXRsS6gcKeYYmBvNjcQ=k-s128","display_name":"SahiBalata","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11981087/sahibalata"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1715,"user_id":7014431,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRbPp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rashed Hasan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7014431/rashed-hasan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571512119,"creation_date":1571500646,"last_edit_date":1571504262,"question_id":58465446,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465446","body_markdown":"So what I&#39;ve been trying to do is open a new small window that its size is 500x500 and create new divs with JS/ Jquery inside it.\r\n\r\nhtml:\r\n```\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;contain &quot;&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nnewWindow = window.open(&quot;replaceWindow.html&quot;, &quot;newWindow&quot;, &quot;width=500,height=500&quot;);\r\n  \r\nnewWindow.onload = () =&gt;{\r\n  let newDiv =  newWindow.document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);\r\n  newDiv.className = &quot;card-body&quot;\r\n  newWindow.document.getElementByClassName(&#39;contain&#39;).appendChild(newDiv);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nStill `contain` doesn&#39;t append `newDiv`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465446/trying-to-open-a-new-window-and-create-elements-inside-it","title":"Trying to open a new window and create elements inside it"},{"tags":["r","r-package","roxygen2","roxygen"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2801,"user_id":5783745,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/771408fddf5d2117fc8d0c60629edd2a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user5783745","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5783745/user5783745"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571501245,"creation_date":1571501245,"answer_id":58465522,"question_id":58465445,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58465522","body_markdown":"Double the `@` symbol.

Is there any case when passing by const &amp; is not optimal for strings?\r\n\r\nIn cases where the caller doesn&#39;t have a `std::string` object in the first place, creating one in order to pass a reference is non optimal. `std::string_view` argument covers these cases, as well as most cases where string reference is optimal. \r\n\r\n&gt; what could be such a case, where passing a string by (const) value is better than passing it by const &amp;, if there is any?\r\n\r\nThe text that you quote describes such case:\r\n\r\n&gt; &gt; ... Especially if you frequently read from it in the function.\r\n\r\nTo explain *why*: Copying into an argument occurs only once per function call, while indirection through a reference (or string view) occurs on every access within the function. Given that neither is free, there must be some number of indirections that are more expensive than the copy.\r\n\r\nWhether that number is ever reached in your program is another matter. The number is heavily influenced by the capabilities of the system, and length of the input string. If you measure that passing by value is statistically faster (with a reasonable p-value) in your program on your target system, then it may be worth it. But this is quite rare case, which is why the reference (or string view) is recommended default choice unless the function needs a copy.\r\n\r\nNote that passing by **const** value is often not a good idea since it forces the function to copy the string again in cases where it could otherwise move it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465437/is-there-any-case-when-passing-by-const-is-not-optimal-for-strings/58465553#58465553","title":"Is there any case when passing by const &amp; is not optimal for strings?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1203,"user_id":5105949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbd9d7ecb21c40f7a4256317fd80cecc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"churill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5105949/churill"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1203,"user_id":5105949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbd9d7ecb21c40f7a4256317fd80cecc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"churill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5105949/churill"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58465553,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571507593,"creation_date":1571500585,"last_edit_date":1571500883,"question_id":58465437,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465437","body_markdown":"Recently I mentioned to a relative new user, that he should pass string parameters as `const std::string &amp;` instead of passing them by value and received a comment:\r\n&gt; passing by const ref is not necessarily better then passing by a const value.

So the compiler interprets your intention as:\r\n\r\n    public static int TimerBase = 0D;  // LHS is int, RHS is double\r\n\r\nSo you get the error:\r\n\r\n&gt;  cannot implicitly convert type `double` to `int` \r\n\r\nThe compiler expects to see a `;` after the `double` declaration (`00D`) so it also shows an error for missing semi-colon:\r\n\r\n&gt; ; expected\r\n\r\nNext the compiler sees `B9780` which it tries to interpret as a variable which is why you get the error:\r\n\r\n&gt; &#39;B9780&#39; does not exist in the current context\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types#real-literals","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465430/declaring-hex-number-the-name-b9780-does-not-exist-in-the-current-context/58465486#58465486","title":"Declaring hex number: The name &#39;B9780&#39; does not exist in the current context"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12243641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e84e439b534b5338046ef5372f733f3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FirePlank","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12243641/fireplank"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3990,"user_id":9665021,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HlcMo.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"haldo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9665021/haldo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571655061,"creation_date":1571500554,"last_edit_date":1571519546,"question_id":58465430,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465430","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t know why it says this:\r\n\r\n&gt; The name &#39;B9780&#39; does not exist in the current context\r\n\r\nI have the following code: \r\n\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static int TimerBase = 00DB9780;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI expect it to accept that, but it says:\r\n\r\n&gt; Cannot implicitly  convert type `double` to `int`.

For a cert in a file (or anything that can be accessed as a Stream) in _either_ PEM or DER format (although the javadoc isn&#39;t clear on that) all you need is [CertificateFactory](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/security/cert/CertificateFactory.html):\r\n\r\n    CertificateFactory fact = CertificateFactory.getInstance(&quot;X.509&quot;);\r\n\r\n    // from a real file\r\n    InputStream is = new FileInputStream (&quot;filename&quot;);\r\n    Certificate cert = fact.generateCertificate(is);\r\n    is.close(); // or use try-resources to do automatically\r\n\r\n    // from an alternate/custom filesystem, such as a ZIP\r\n    Path p = Paths.get(&quot;somespecification&quot;); // or any other creation of a Path\r\n    InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(p); // add open options if needed\r\n    // same as before\r\n\r\n    // from the classpath (usually a JAR)\r\n    InputStream is = ClassLoader /*or any Class&lt;?&gt; object*/ .getResourceAsStream(&quot;name&quot;);\r\n    // same as before\r\n\r\n    // from a byte[] in memory\r\n    InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream (bytearray);\r\n    // same as before, except don&#39;t really need to close\r\n\r\n    // you get the idea\r\n\r\nAlthough JCA APIs like this one are defined to allow a lot of extension,  reading an X.509 cert will actually give you not just `Certificate` but subclass [`X509Certificate`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/security/cert/X509Certificate.html) from which `.getNotAfter()` gives the expiration date-time directly. The email address if present (which isn&#39;t required by X.509 certs in general, but should always be the case in a cert used for S/MIME) will usually be an attribute in the subject name, which actually has internal structure that Java doesn&#39;t let you get at directly so you need to:\r\n\r\n    String x500name = ((X509Certificate)cert).getSubjectX500Principal()) .toString();\r\n    // simple case: no multivalue RDN, no reserved chars ,+=&quot;&lt;&gt;\\;# or extra spaces \r\n    for( String attr : x500name.split(&quot;, &quot;) )\r\n      if( attr.startsWith(&quot;EMAILADDRESS=&quot;) ) \r\n        ... use attr.substring(13) ...\r\n    // other cases require slightly more complicated parsing \r\n\r\nNote there is no encryption at all in X.509, and thus no actual decryption, although many people use &#39;decrypt&#39; to describe anything unfamiliar not an actual cipher.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465375/is-there-a-way-to-decrypt-s-mime-public-key-data/58467494#58467494","title":"Is there a way to decrypt S/MIME public key data?"}],"owner":{"reputation":65,"user_id":646912,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90fe92f85b1619394b155655d3f518cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Arquillian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/646912/arquillian"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571515023,"creation_date":1571500187,"question_id":58465375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465375","body_markdown":"I would like to get the email address and expire date to a S/MIME certificate based on it&#39;s public key.

So as you see a transposed 2D-ndarray is simply the exact same array, whose strides have been reordered.

However, numpy seems to treat the &quot;1D array&quot; of `(N,)` as a 0D scalar.

I have two Wagail CMS sites, one development/staging environment and another production environment. The sites are running on AWS inside of Docker containers, and the database is a PostgreSQL database inside RDS. The source code for the site is in GitHub. When I commit a code change, it triggers a new build using AWS&#39; CodeBuild; this creates a new container. I copy over the media folder containing the current images, change the owner/group for the folder, and set the folder&#39;s permissions. When I go to the site, the images are missing although I copied over the media folder into the new container instance. The only solution I&#39;ve found is to manually re-add the images. I wonder if my issue is connected to not executing the &quot;python manage.py collectstatic&quot; command when I create a new container instance. Technically, the media folder contains static files, but I&#39;ve held off executing the command until I full understand what it does. \r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to resolve the images issue?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465347/problem-restoring-wagtail-cms-media-folder-when-copying-from-staging-to-prod-env","title":"Problem restoring Wagtail CMS media folder when copying from staging to prod environment"},{"tags":["kubernetes","redis"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":4574131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c0e7d6264c082605266769b568c7424?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mOchi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4574131/mochi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571543695,"post_id":58465345,"comment_id":103273823,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465345/redis-cluster-without-persistence-on-kubernetes#comment103273823_58465345"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1066,"user_id":2898919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10df96d2d1b61c5e52c46a4ad55f5794?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FL3SH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2898919/fl3sh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571510037,"creation_date":1571510037,"answer_id":58466839,"question_id":58465345,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58466839","body_markdown":"You cannot do this, the state of your redis is lots when a pod is restarted.

a variable from within the context of a task?\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what I&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;tasks&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;isBackground&quot;: true,\r\n            &quot;label&quot;: &quot;make CURRENT-CONFIGURATION&quot;,\r\n            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,\r\n            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;make&quot;,\r\n            &quot;args&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;CONFIGURATION=${input:CURRENT-CONFIGURATION}&quot;,\r\n                &quot;${input:make-targets}&quot;,\r\n                &quot;-j4&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;group&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,\r\n                &quot;isDefault&quot;: true\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;presentation&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;clear&quot;: true,\r\n                &quot;panel&quot;: &quot;dedicated&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;problemMatcher&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;$msCompile&quot;\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;label&quot;: &quot;make rebuild CURRENT-CONFIGURATION&quot;,\r\n            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,\r\n            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;make CONFIGURATION=${input:CURRENT-CONFIGURATION} --directory ${input:DIRECTORY} clean &amp;&amp;

So far, I can only get the points to add with trails in between each one.  That type of plotting would work if I wasn&#39;t plotting locations on a map that have no connection.  \r\n\r\nHow can I plot my locations as points on the map that simply appear when it&#39;s their &quot;year&quot; (or other specified time)?  For example, adding several points in 2004, then in 2005, etc, etc.  I&#39;ve tried all the transition_*() functions, and those don&#39;t seem to work, but maybe I&#39;ve missed something.\r\n\r\nThe code I&#39;m using to plot the points on the map is below:\r\n\r\n    Final_View &lt;- Minneapolis + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;, axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\r\n                                      axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) + \r\n      geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = &quot;darkred&quot;), data = Properties, size = 1) +\r\n      transition_reveal(Year) +\r\n      shadow_mark(past = TRUE) +\r\n      labs(title = &quot;CLCLT Properties Added&quot;)\r\n\r\nI created the variable Final_View and added my map of Minneapolis (the city I&#39;m mapping) along with all the parts of the map I wanted removed (like the legend and axis ticks).  I then add all the points using geom_point with the data coming from a .csv that I read earlier on (that part of the code not shown).  \r\n\r\nNext is what I suspect is causing the issue, but I can&#39;t find a fix: I&#39;ve been trying out the different transition_*() functions, but none of them add the points as groups by year and keep previous points added on the map.\r\n\r\nIs there an alternative to transition_*() which will achieve what I&#39;m looking for?  Or is there a transition function which I probably didn&#39;t try yet or attempted incorrectly?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Wanted to add that I&#39;ve looked into the enter.*() functions as well, but those don&#39;t seem like they&#39;d be what I&#39;m looking for, since, if I&#39;m reading it right, points plotted with those functions disappear as new points are plotted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adm3RB4ieXU","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465320/is-there-a-way-to-remove-trailing-as-points-are-added-to-a-map","title":"Is there a way to remove trailing as points are added to a map?"},{"tags":["connect-direct"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10908752,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GfXTfTQrL_4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbl1S5aH6hMneyVYW8Gl5cwNzixPw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"sohail khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10908752/sohail-khan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2059,"user_id":4479165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fb7faf1344075e6252156358b64e539?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theduck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4479165/theduck"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571512574,"creation_date":1571499814,"last_edit_date":1571512574,"question_id":58465317,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465317","body_markdown":"My file is present in connect direct in UAT environment in windows server.

The problem is **classC** needs two arguments in the constructor, which can only be created in **classB** (after calling an init method in **classB**, but for now, assume this init method is called early enough. Further, I have a **classD**, which inherits from **classB** (which holds the two arguments needed). And last, I also need an object of **classA** in **classD**.\r\n\r\nAs said, I need an object of **classC** in **classA**. I can&#39;t just create it directly in **classA**, since I would not be able to provide the necessary arguments (which are created in **classB**). My idea was to create an object of **classC** in **classB** (since this is the only way (I guess) to initialize the object with the arguments). Then, since I need an object of **classA** in **classD**, and **classD** inherits from **classB**, I thought that I can grab the object of **classC** (created in **classB**) in **classD** (should be possible due to the inheritance, shouldn&#39;t it?) and pass it to **classA** as an argument of its constructor. (I don&#39;t want that **classA** inherits from classD.)\r\n\r\nIs this a good idea? In my inexperienced eyes, it looks very confusing and until now, I couldn&#39;t manage to get it working (maybe it&#39;s not possible, or maybe I just didn&#39;t set up everything correctly). But I would be happy with any advice on how to solve this problem more elegantly. I appreciate any help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n----\r\nThanks for all the answers! I have tried to simplify the code as much as possible. I get the error, that the constructor must explicitly initialize the member of classC (see classA.cpp and classB.cpp comment). But the necessary arguments to initialize an object of classC are created during the ```init``` function call in classB. What is the problem here, i.e. why do I get these errors? I thought, that when I pass an object of a class as an argument for the constructor of another class, I don&#39;t need to instantiate the class again?\r\nAny help is really appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n**Class A**\r\n\r\n```classA.h```\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;classC.h&gt;\r\n\r\nclassA\r\n{\r\n    public:\r\n        explicit classA(classC classC_object);\r\n        void doSomething();\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```classA.cpp```\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;classA.h&gt;\r\n\r\nclassA::classA(classC classC_object) // Error: constructor for classC must explicitly initialize the member classC_object which does not have a default constructor\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid classA::doSomething()\r\n{\r\n    classC_object.someMethod();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**class B**\r\n\r\n```classB.h```\r\n```\r\nclassB\r\n{\r\n    public:\r\n        classB(int argc, char** argv);\r\n\r\n        void init();\r\n        \r\n        classC classC_object;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```classB.cpp```\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;classB.h&gt;\r\n\r\nclassB::classB(int argc, char** argv) // Error: constructor for classB must explicitly initialize the member classC_object which does not have a default constructor\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid classB::init()\r\n{\r\n    some_type_specificly_created_in_classB arg;\r\n    classC classC_object(arg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Class C**\r\n\r\n```classC.h```\r\n```\r\nclassC\r\n{\r\n    public:\r\n        classC(const some_type_specificly_created_in_classB&amp; arg);\r\n        // some methods I want to access in classA\r\n        void someMethod();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Class D**\r\n\r\n```classD.h```\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;classB.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;classA.h&gt;\r\n\r\nclassD\r\n{\r\n    public:\r\n        classD(int argc, char** argv);\r\n\r\n    private:\r\n        classB classB_object;\r\n        classA* classA_object;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```classD.cpp```\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;classD.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;classA.h&gt;\r\n\r\nclassD::classD(int argc, char** argv) : classB_object(argc, argv)\r\n{\r\n    classA_object = new classA(classB_object.classC_object);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yx8fX.jpg\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465299/how-to-explicitly-initialize-a-member-which-does-not-have-a-default-constructor","title":"How to explicitly initialize a member which does not have a default constructor?"},{"tags":["php","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":534,"user_id":5700274,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/296611a36356cc767257abb5d4a5f58d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LetsSeo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5700274/letsseo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571501973,"post_id":58465298,"comment_id":103266048,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465298/form-submission-for-single-text-box-and-multiple-textboxes#comment103266048_58465298"},{"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":3779493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d3cd631e59860f4696f05059b7904dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3779493","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3779493/user3779493"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":534,"user_id":5700274,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/296611a36356cc767257abb5d4a5f58d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LetsSeo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5700274/letsseo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571635243,"post_id":58465298,"comment_id":103292299,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465298/form-submission-for-single-text-box-and-multiple-textboxes#comment103292299_58465298"}],"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":3779493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d3cd631e59860f4696f05059b7904dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3779493","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3779493/user3779493"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571499676,"creation_date":1571499676,"question_id":58465298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465298","body_markdown":"I am wondering that why a form is not submitted for multiple textboxes if it has no submit button?

`GameManager.Instance` at any time, it&#39;ll create the instance if it&#39;s not created yet, avoiding the headache of maintaining race conditions in unity&#39;s event functions.\r\n\r\nIf you have a `GameManager` or any singleton with properties you want to preset in the editor which a created instance in play mode won&#39;t have, then create an instance prefab and place it at a folder named **Singleton** under a folder called **Resources**, since the system first checks if a pre-defined prefab for the singleton exists and spawns it and then falls back to creating a new gameobject and attaching the script to it.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465288/execution-order-of-scripts-awake-and-onenable/58465549#58465549","title":"Execution Order of Scripts - Awake and

The user inputs information on rangebar sliders that automatically updates a chart giving them a visualization of their financial position. I have one function where the user puts in the age they would like to begin collecting their social security income (called Canada Pension Plan, or CPP}.\r\n\r\nWhen the user slides the range bar on their retirement age, a function is fired called handleSetRangeBarValue, this function first fires an action called setPensionStartAge which moves into the reducer and updates the variables. These variables are essential for the next function that is fired; CalculateCPP() (this function is too big for me to post and explain it all here). Calculate CPP then shows the user what their pension income would be. The user is then seeing a change on two values, the range bar on which they are changing the age and the change in their CPP payment. The trouble is, every-time this fires the CalculateCPP is one step behind. The user will see that they set the age to 67 but the display for the CPP calculation shows the information for age 66. No matter what I&#39;ve tried the CalculateCPP() function is always receiving the reducer variable information from the last update. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried hacky work-arounds such as passing the variables directly received from the rangebar change into CalculateCPP() but CalculateCPP() draws on several other values that are updated in the reducer which don&#39;t just come from the range bar so that doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve also changed the function to be async await but that doesn&#39;t work. I tried writing it as a promise function but wasn&#39;t able to figure out how to do that. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? There is no fetching of any API&#39;s. All the variables are local in the reducer. \r\n```\r\nhandleSetRangeBarValue\r\n\r\nhandleSetRangeBarValue = (name, financialValue, rangeBarValue) =&gt; {\r\n  this.props.setPensionStartAge(name, rangeBarValue)\r\n\r\n  this.props.calculateCPP()\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const setPensionStartAge = (name, rangeBarValue) =&gt; {\r\n  return {\r\n    type: &quot;SET_PENSION_AGE&quot;,\r\n    payload: {\r\n      name: name,\r\n      rangeBarValue: rangeBarValue,\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n    \r\nconst initialState = {\r\n  pensionAges: {\r\n    cppStartAge: {\r\n      name: &quot;cppStartAge&quot;,\r\n      label: &quot;CPP Start Age&quot;,\r\n      rangeBarValue: 65,\r\n      min: 60,\r\n      max: 70,\r\n      step: 1,\r\n      numberType: &quot;age&quot;,\r\n    },\r\n    oasStartAge: {\r\n      name: &quot;oasStartAge&quot;,\r\n      label: &quot;OAS Start Age&quot;,\r\n      rangeBarValue: 65,\r\n      min: 65,\r\n      max: 70,\r\n      step: 1,\r\n      numberType: &quot;age&quot;,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst lifeTimeIncomeVariableState = (state = initialState, action) =&gt; {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case &quot;SET_PENSION_AGE&quot;:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...state,\r\n        pensionAges: {\r\n          ...state.pensionAges,\r\n          [action.payload.name]: {\r\n            ...state.pensionAges[action.payload.name],\r\n            rangeBarValue: action.payload.rangeBarValue,\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      }\r\n    default:\r\n      return state\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465279/react-redux-function-fires-action-and-a-second-function-but-the-second-function","title":"React/Redux function fires action and a second function, but the second function receives old information and is one step behind"},{"tags":["ubuntu","github","networking","dns","subdomain"],"owner":{"reputation":4434,"user_id":158008,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/834ab5fa1dd4a0ce31b808afdf0ff03c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"James123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/158008/james123"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571499549,"creation_date":1571499549,"question_id":58465278,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465278","body_markdown":"I am pure windows guys.

Ran my importer in my test cases and it all worked. So, if you&#39;re also wondering why you&#39;re tests don&#39;t work, check that you&#39;ve got some data in the test db!\r\n**End Update**\r\n\r\nI am writing tests for my Django Rest Framework API but I am struggling to get my code to return a 200 OK. At the moment, my test case continually returns a 404 Not Found.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m in the early stages of writing tests, and have a lot to learn. I&#39;m currently following https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to test an endpoint at the following URL\r\n```python\r\n# Not shown here, is that all URLs here will be prepended with /api/v1\r\n    path(&#39;case/&lt;int:pk&gt;/&#39;, EntireCaseView.as_view(), name=&#39;case&#39;),\r\n```\r\nI have an object in my database with an ID (primary key) of 1. I can successful query the API by going to http://localhost:8000/api/v1/case/1/\r\n\r\nI receive a valid JSON response (Trampe is a rabbit)\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;total_points&quot;: 5000,\r\n    &quot;passing_points&quot;: 3700,\r\n    &quot;budget&quot;: 5000,\r\n    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Saving Trampe from Trauma&quot;,\r\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Trampe&quot;,\r\n    &quot;signalment&quot;: &quot;8yr, intact male, mixed breed.&quot;,\r\n    &quot;problem&quot;: &quot;Respiratory difficulty&quot;,\r\n    &quot;image&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n        &quot;file&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8000/media/images/trampe.jpg&quot;,\r\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A lovely picture of Trampe&quot;\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy API requires authentication, and as such I am providing authentication in my test case.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass CaseTests(APITestCase):\r\n\r\n    def test_status_code(self):\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        ensure that case/1 returns 200 OK\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        # Create a test user\r\n        test_user = User(username=&#39;jim&#39;, password=&#39;monkey123&#39;, email=&#39;jim@jim.com&#39;)\r\n        test_user.save()\r\n\r\n        # build a factory and get our user Jim\r\n        factory = APIRequestFactory()\r\n        user = User.objects.get(username=&#39;jim&#39;)\r\n\r\n        # Get our view to test and the url, too\r\n        view = EntireCaseView.as_view()\r\n        url = reverse(&#39;case&#39;, kwargs={&#39;pk&#39;: &#39;1&#39;})\r\n        print(url.__str__())\r\n\r\n        # Make an authenticated request to the view...\r\n        request = factory.get(url)\r\n        print(request.get_full_path())\r\n        force_authenticate(request, user=user)\r\n\r\n        response = view(request, &quot;1&quot;)\r\n        print(response.data)\r\n\r\n        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf interest here (at least to me) are the lines\r\n```url = reverse(&#39;case&#39;, kwargs={&#39;pk&#39;: &#39;1&#39;})```\r\nand\r\n```response = view(request, &quot;1&quot;)```\r\n\r\nIf I leave out either the ```kwargs``` argument in ```url =r everse(&#39;case&#39;, kwargs={&#39;pk&#39;: &#39;1&#39;})``` or the ```&quot;1&quot;``` in ```response = view(request, &quot;1&quot;)``` I will receive an error saying that the get() method requires 2 positional arguments but only given.\r\n\r\nHere is the signature of the get() method in my view.\r\n```python\r\nclass EntireCaseView(APIView):\r\n    def get(self, request, pk):\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run my test, Django reports that it fails because of a 404.\r\n```\r\n    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)\r\nAssertionError: 404 != 200\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to work out is why this is the case. Printing ```print(url.__str__())``` outputs ```/api/v1/case/1/``` as does ```print(request.get_full_path())```\r\n\r\nSo in summary, I am trying to understand why I&#39;m receiving this 404, and ultimately, how I can test this, and other endpoints.\r\n\r\nAny and all help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465269/test-cases-for-django-rest-framework-struggling-to-get-a-correct-response","title":"Test cases for Django Rest
