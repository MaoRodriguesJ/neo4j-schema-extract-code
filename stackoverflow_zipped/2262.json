have created a spreadsheet that pulls in data via the WEBSERVICE function.  This function was implemented in Excel 2013 so I was expecting that it should work on that version or newer, however, it doesn&#39;t.  We are accessing the data via a non-authenticated web service and the two computers (one with 2013 and one with 2016) are on the same network i.e. there shouldn&#39;t be any blocking issues.  2016 performs the retrieval and calculation flawlessly and 2013 resolves to a #VALUE! error without ever hitting the end point (nothing in the web service log).\r\nThe only other variable is that the 2013 Excel is running on Windows 7 and 2016 is on Windows 10.  We have tried different endpoints to see if that makes any difference and it seems that Excel 2013 (or at least that version on Windows 7 with the latest service pack) does not work.  This seems odd considering that the combination surely would have worked when this function was introduced.\r\nIs there anyone out there who has any suggestions on what we could try?  We cant insist on Excel 2016 because the spreadsheet will go out to partner organisations.\r\n\r\nAny help greatly

So it compares its input operands, of course.  In this case they&#39;re both qword registers holding pointers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#39;t recommend `jle` for address comparison; better to treat addresses as unsigned.  Although for x86-64 it doesn&#39;t actually matter; you can&#39;t have an array that spans the signed-overflow boundary because the non-canonical &quot;hole&quot; is there.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47687805/should-pointer-comparisons-be-signed-or-unsigned-in-64-bit-x86\r\n\r\nStill, `jbe` would make more sense.  Unless you actually have arrays that span across the boundary from the highest address to the lowest address, so the pointer wraps from `0xfff...fff` to `0`.  But anyway, you could fix this bug by doing `if (p == start) break` instead of `p &lt;= start`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**There is a bug in this function though**, assuming it&#39;s written for the x86-64 System V ABI: its signature takes an `int` size arg, but it assumes its sign-extended to pointer width when it does `char *endp = start + len`.\r\n\r\nThe ABI allows narrow args to have garbage in the high bits of their register.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36706721/is-a-sign-or-zero-extension-required-when-adding-a-32bit-offset-to-a-pointer-for/36760539#36760539\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also major performance problems with this: checking 1 byte at a time is total garbage vs. SSE2 16 bytes at a time.  Also, it doesn&#39;t use either conditional branch as the loop branch, so it has 3 jumps per iteration instead of 2.  i.e. an extra not-taken conditional branch.\r\n\r\nAlso, it pointer-subtract after the loop instead of wasting an `inc %eax` inside the loop.  If you&#39;re going to do `inc %eax` inside the loop, you might as well check the size against it instead of the pointer compare.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the function is written to be easy to reverse engineer, not to be efficient.  The `jmp` as well as 2 conditional branches makes it worse for that IMO, vs. an idiomatic loop with a condition at the bottom.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002197/what-does-cmpq-compare/58002242#58002242","title":"What does cmpq compare?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568856567,"post_id":58002243,"comment_id":102410598,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002197/what-does-cmpq-compare/58002243#comment102410598_58002243"},{"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568856573,"post_id":58002243,"comment_id":102410600,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002197/what-does-cmpq-compare/58002243#comment102410600_58002243"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1457,"user_id":1545658,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":30,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8184a1f0d5a54654d20831407acbe3d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"acegs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1545658/acegs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1457,"user_id":1545658,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":30,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8184a1f0d5a54654d20831407acbe3d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"acegs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1545658/acegs"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568855180,"last_edit_date":1568855180,"creation_date":1568853236,"answer_id":58002243,"question_id":58002197,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002243","body_markdown":"it seems it&#39;s doing like this:\r\n\r\n    char* buff = &quot;abcdef&quot;        //this is the rdi.\r\n    int64_t len = strlen(buff);  //this is the rsi.\r\n    \r\n    for(char* pRCX = buf+len; pRCX &gt;= buff/*this is the cmpq*/; pRCX--){\r\n    \t//do something.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthe `cmpq` in the code checks if rcx reach the start of the array of data. it decreases on every loop because it started on the last item in the array.\r\n\r\nyes, `cmpq    %rdi, %rcx` compares the address. it seems the optimize version of looping through array of characters. instead of looping through index, it directly loop through the address. it&#39;s faster this way but a little hard to grasp specially for beginners.\r\n\r\nalso, i think i read it on agner&#39;s books, that looping through series of data starting from the last item and accessing in decreasing order is faster than in increasing order which is typical when coding a loop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002197/what-does-cmpq-compare/58002243#58002243","title":"What does cmpq compare?"}],"owner":{"reputation":800,"user_id":4821710,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e71896fe8c180bb8e96ae6ddbefbc903?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joshua Leung","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4821710/joshua-leung"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":95,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58002242,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568855970,"creation_date":1568852764,"last_edit_date":1568853143,"question_id":58002197,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002197","body_markdown":"mystery has this function signature:\r\n\r\n    int mystery(char *, int);\r\n\r\nThis is the mystery function assembly code:\r\n\r\n    mystery:\r\n            movl    $0, %eax                ;set eax to 0\r\n            leaq    (%rdi, %rsi), %rcx      ; rcx = rdi + rsi\r\n    \r\n    loop:\r\n            cmpq    %rdi, %rcx\r\n            jle     endl\r\n            decq    %rcx\r\n            cmpb    $0x65, (%rcx)\r\n            jne     loop\r\n            incl    %eax\r\n            jmp     loop\r\n    \r\n    endl:\r\n            ret\r\n\r\nWhat does this line `cmpq    %rdi, %rcx` compare?

Another side, `MongoClient.connect` and `return &quot;outside function&quot;;` execute in &quot;the same&quot; time, then `createDB` will do nothing, it just get back `&quot;outside function&quot;` string. Your lambda function just takes 50ms :| .\r\n\r\nBut why, `MongoClient.connect` is a `callback` function, the `callback` function will be call when **task - MongoClient.connect** done, in your code you don&#39;t care about that, you just return `&quot;outside function&quot;` string ???\r\n\r\nI see you use `await` keyword, I guest you want to wait until a connection to DB is already, then execute next operator. As you know (maybe) `await` only effect with a `Promise` (To many things to explain there, you can read more in the internet).\r\n\r\nHow to solve your problem, `MongoClient.connect` does not have `Promise` version (I think so), then you have to convert it to a Promise function version, and I think what you need to wait is a instance of DB instead of a string.

Save them if you want them again.\r\n\r\n````\r\nfloat *A = []; # old array\r\nint *B = []; # index array\r\nfloat *C;\r\nint ln = length(B);\r\nint n = (ln + 7) % 8;\r\nswitch (n % 8) {\r\ncase 0: do { *C++ = A[*B++];\r\ncase 7:      *C++ = A[*B++];\r\ncase 6:      *C++ = A[*B++];\r\ncase 5:      *C++ = A[*B++];\r\ncase 4:      *C++ = A[*B++];\r\ncase 3:      *C++ = A[*B++];\r\ncase 2:      *C++ = A[*B++];\r\ncase 1:      *C++ = A[*B++];\r\n    } while (--n &gt; 0);\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nWith this much scope I can do no better, but with a larger scope a better choice might exist involving redesigning your data structures.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002180/fast-copy-selected-elements-of-an-array-in-c/58002516#58002516","title":"Fast copy selected elements of an array in C?"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12087607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-by5raSazHZo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reibT8y7rO2pOzMc0wNdbEIsIwEpg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zhenhua Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087607/zhenhua-li"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12087607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-by5raSazHZo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reibT8y7rO2pOzMc0wNdbEIsIwEpg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zhenhua Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087607/zhenhua-li"},"comment_count":15,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58002516,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568856210,"creation_date":1568852580,"last_edit_date":1568855056,"question_id":58002180,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002180","body_markdown":"This could be a very basic question but it really bugs me a lot. What I am trying to do is basically to copy elements in an old vector to a new vector using C.\r\n\r\nThe copy is based on an index vector where each element in this vector represents the index of the element in the old vector. The index vector is not sorted.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\nan old vector A = [3.4, 2.6, 1.1].\r\n\r\na index vector B = [1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2].\r\n\r\nAfter copy, I would expect the new vector to be C = [3.4, 3.4, 1.1, 1.1, 2.6, 3.4, 2.6].\r\n\r\nThe most brutal solution I can think of is to run a loop through B and copy the corresponding element in A to C. But when the vector is too large, the cost is not bearable.\r\n\r\nMy question is, is there a faster/smarter way to do copy in C on this occasion?\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally the code is written in Julia and I had no problem with that. In Julia, I simply use C = A[B] and it is fast. Anyone knows how they do it?\r\n\r\nAdd the C pseudo code:\r\n\r\n    float *A = []; # old array\r\n    int *B = []; # index array\r\n    float *C;\r\n    for(i=0;i&lt;length(B);i++)\r\n    {\r\n       *(C+i) = *(A+*(B+i));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002180/fast-copy-selected-elements-of-an-array-in-c","title":"Fast copy selected elements of an array in C?"},{"tags":["quickbooks"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22325,"user_id":26133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dfe9cf5d0681a2cd730408d5ac909851?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Keith Palmer Jr.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/26133/keith-palmer-jr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568860867,"post_id":58002179,"comment_id":102411316,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002179/0x80040400-quickbooks-found-an-error-when-parsing-the-provided-xml-text-stream#comment102411316_58002179"}],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":2620362,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5812c10c51eb9f663513ba415f5d7909?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shehroz Asmat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2620362/shehroz-asmat"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568852523,"creation_date":1568852523,"question_id":58002179,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002179","body_markdown":"I am using php SDK for quickbooks desktop via webconnector i import vendors, customers and invoices in my quickbooks everything works fine except while adding vendor.

The string has sections that are standard to InfoPath attachments as far as I can tell. They are there no matter what file I attach. This is how I&#39;m determining the sections I need to decode. Maybe my assumptions are incorrect, but I don&#39;t have the background to know how these things are normally done.

I have to be able to decode in order to know what to encode when encoding an attachment. If I leave it alone and encode the filename portion, InfoPath can&#39;t read it. If I leave the whole thing alone and append the base64 for the file after this, InfoPath will attach the file, but it will display the wrong filename.

The second value is the same city, but with a small population, that represents that city’s overlap into the second county. So variables include city, population, school district, school district expenditure, crime count, etc. and I want to keep all values where a city and a school district are unique (so observations of city may repeat), but I don’t want two observations of the same city when it represents county overlap (because then I’ll end up with a smaller population that will be misrepresentative and it will scuttle everything else). To complicate things, cities also repeat by year (since I want to keep my dput short, you won&#39;t be able to see this).\r\n\r\nSo \r\n\r\n```r\r\n    dat%&gt;%distinct(city, school district, year .keep all = TRUE) \r\n```\r\n\r\nwould get me all unique values, but there’s still two issues: 1) I want to make sure that the larger population is the one that is kept (unless the overlap is near half…maybe over 30% with regard to population), and 2) the other part of the city in the second county might attend another school district, in which case it would still be recorded as distinct with my current code.\r\n\r\nI could then run distinct again…as dat%&gt;%distinct(city, year, .keep all = TRUE) but then I&#39;d also get rid of cities where there are repeating observations representing different school districts, and I can’t do distinct by school district, because there are school districts which might be attended by several cities. So I think making it conditional on the larger population would be the way to go, but I’m not sure how to do that.\r\n\r\nI found this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47267725/remove-duplicates-by-multiple-conditions\r\n\r\nand tried something similar, but to no avail:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    dat%&gt;%\r\n         group_by(PLACE_ID, COUNTY_ID, full_district_id, year)%&gt;%\r\n         mutate(n = n())%&gt;%\r\n      arrange(PLACE_ID, year, desc(n)) %&gt;% \r\n      ifelse(n&gt;1, distinct(PLACE_ID,.keep_all = TRUE, PLACE_ID)%&gt;%\r\n         ungroup()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get this error:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Error in ifelse(., n &gt; 1, distinct(PLACE_ID, .keep_all = TRUE), PLACE_ID) : unused argument (PLACE_ID)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, much!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the dput (note that the two values that do repeat, should both be kept because it is same city different school districts; I can&#39;t find an example of repeating city values I don&#39;t want, given that that is pretty near the answer to my question)\r\n\r\n```\r\nstructure(list(PLACE_ID = c(&quot;0100124&quot;, &quot;0100460&quot;, &quot;0101228&quot;, \r\n&quot;0101708&quot;, &quot;0102116&quot;, &quot;0102260&quot;, &quot;0102320&quot;, &quot;0102320&quot;, &quot;0102836&quot;, \r\n&quot;0102860&quot;), CITY = c(&quot;abbeville&quot;, &quot;adamsville&quot;, &quot;aliceville&quot;, \r\n&quot;andalusia&quot;, &quot;arab&quot;, &quot;ardmore&quot;, &quot;argo&quot;, &quot;argo&quot;, &quot;ashford&quot;, &quot;ashland&quot;\r\n), COUNTY_ID = c(&quot;01067&quot;, &quot;01073&quot;, &quot;01107&quot;, &quot;01039&quot;, &quot;01095&quot;, \r\n&quot;01083&quot;, &quot;01073&quot;, &quot;01115&quot;, &quot;01069&quot;, &quot;01027&quot;), full_district_id = c(&quot;0101740&quot;, \r\n&quot;0101920&quot;, &quot;0102730&quot;, &quot;0100060&quot;, &quot;0100100&quot;, &quot;0102100&quot;, &quot;0101920&quot;, \r\n&quot;0103062&quot;, &quot;0101770&quot;, &quot;0100750&quot;), POPULATION.EST = c(2882, 4841, \r\n2581, 8901, 7503, 1042, 2692, 2692, 1905, 2035), year = c(2003, \r\n2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003), EXPENDITURE_PER_STUDENT = c(6.91392685629849, \r\n5.93085371942087, 6.58799048751486, 6.23839541547278, 5.89238165680473, \r\n6.22123450607237, 5.93085371942087, 5.45296752519597, 5.5939837398374, \r\n6.11974248927039), CRIME_TOTAL = c(105, 365, 4, 734, 632, 19, \r\n44, 44, 26, 14)), class = c(&quot;tbl_df&quot;, &quot;tbl&quot;, &quot;data.frame&quot;), row.names = c(NA, \r\n-10L))\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002168/removing-duplicate-values-based-on-multiple-conditions","title":"Removing duplicate values based on multiple conditions"},{"tags":["php","mysqli","utf-8","phpmyadmin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":8530696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c18337cb06eb0b8f51009656f0be0d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"VPSCoin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8530696/vpscoin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568866062,"post_id":58002167,"comment_id":102412192,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002167/how-can-i-set-charset-utf-8-php-mysqli-phpmyadmin#comment102412192_58002167"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":8530696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c18337cb06eb0b8f51009656f0be0d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"VPSCoin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8530696/vpscoin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568854618,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568927427,"creation_date":1568852383,"last_edit_date":1568927427,"question_id":58002167,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002167","body_markdown":"before i post this question i do lot of search without success\r\n\r\nI’m setting up a php script, and want to support UTF-8 fully in my web application.

a helpful comment pointed out, I was overthinking the problem.\r\nThe following works, and uses a simple [bool to int conversion][1]:\r\n\r\n    x += (a == b);\r\n    y += (a != b);\r\n\r\nExamining the PTX assembly file before and after this change (several places in the kernel), the number of branches was reduced from 39 to 9, so this made a significant change. The `nvcc` compiler did not optimize these out on its own, particularly in cases where there were if/then/else statements two or three levels deep, as in:\r\n\r\n    bool ag = (ca == &#39;.&#39;);\r\n    bool bg = (cb == &#39;.&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    bool agx = ag &amp;&amp; apg;\r\n    bool bgx = bg &amp;&amp; bpg;\r\n    bool gx = agx || bgx;\r\n    \r\n    if (ag || bg)\r\n    {\r\n        if (ag &amp;&amp; bg)\r\n        {\r\n            // ignore\r\n        } else {\r\n            if (!gx)\r\n            {\r\n                ++gs;\r\n                ++ps;\r\n            }\r\n            apg = ag;\r\n            bpg = bg;\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        if (ca == cb)\r\n        {\r\n            ++ms;\r\n            ++ps;\r\n        } else {\r\n            ++ns;\r\n            ++ps;\r\n        }\r\n        apg = false;\r\n        bpg = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOnce I was able to reduce all of the assignments to boolean expressions (here are two out of the six assignments after conversion from the original kernel):\r\n    \r\n    apg = (apg &amp;&amp; !!(ag &amp;&amp; bg)) || ((ag || bg) &amp;&amp; !(ag &amp;&amp; bg) &amp;&amp; ag)\r\n    bpg = (bpg &amp;&amp; !!(ag &amp;&amp; bg)) || ((ag || bg) &amp;&amp; !(ag &amp;&amp; bg) &amp;&amp; bg)\r\n    \r\nI was able to simplify those expressions:\r\n    \r\n    apg  = (ag &amp;&amp; !bg) || (ag &amp;&amp; apg)\r\n    bpg  = (!ag &amp;&amp; bg) || (bg &amp;&amp; bpg)\r\n\r\nAnd in two cases I was able to combine several expressions (multiple assignments) into a single boolean expression. Ultimately, the full set of conditionals reduced to:\r\n\r\n    ps += ((ca != &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; (cb != &#39;.&#39;)) || ((ca != &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; !bpg) || ((cb != &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; !apg);\r\n    ms += (ca == cb) &amp;&amp; (ca != &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; (cb != &#39;.&#39;);\r\n    apg = ((ca == &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; (cb != &#39;.&#39;)) || ((ca == &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; apg);\r\n    bpg = ((ca != &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; (cb == &#39;.&#39;)) || ((cb == &#39;.&#39;) &amp;&amp; bpg);\r\n\r\nBased on the [method from this answer][2], I found that the number of *real* branches in my kernel were ultimately reduced from 39 to 12:\r\n\r\n    cuobjdump -sass kernel_original.o &gt; kernel_original.sass\r\n    grep BRA kernel.sass | wc -l\r\n    39\r\n    \r\n    cuobjdump -sass kernel_simplified.o &gt; kernel_simplified.sass\r\n    grep BRA kernel_opt.sass | wc -l\r\n    12\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5369770/bool-to-int-conversion\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58015878/2074605\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002166/avoiding-thread-divergence-in-a-cuda-kernel-with-conditional-assignments/58002612#58002612","title":"Avoiding thread divergence in a CUDA kernel with conditional assignments"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4377,"user_id":2074605,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vTHal.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"vallismortis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2074605/vallismortis"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568920956,"post_id":58015878,"comment_id":102438978,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002166/avoiding-thread-divergence-in-a-cuda-kernel-with-conditional-assignments/58015878#comment102438978_58015878"},{"owner":{"reputation":45030,"user_id":1593077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10c44e0d9568e48d05708ae196ad936f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"einpoklum","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1593077/einpoklum"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4377,"user_id":2074605,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vTHal.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"vallismortis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2074605/vallismortis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568921447,"post_id":58015878,"comment_id":102439169,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002166/avoiding-thread-divergence-in-a-cuda-kernel-with-conditional-assignments/58015878#comment102439169_58015878"},{"owner":{"reputation":4377,"user_id":2074605,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vTHal.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"vallismortis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2074605/vallismortis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":45030,"user_id":1593077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10c44e0d9568e48d05708ae196ad936f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"einpoklum","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1593077/einpoklum"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568922069,"post_id":58015878,"comment_id":102439468,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002166/avoiding-thread-divergence-in-a-cuda-kernel-with-conditional-assignments/58015878#comment102439468_58015878"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":103142,"user_id":1695960,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f9f557c03db19232aa410540af2f966?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Robert Crovella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1695960/robert-crovella"},"last_editor":{"reputation":103142,"user_id":1695960,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f9f557c03db19232aa410540af2f966?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Robert Crovella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1695960/robert-crovella"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568940693,"last_edit_date":1568940693,"creation_date":1568912699,"answer_id":58015878,"question_id":58002166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58015878","body_markdown":"### tl;dr: Consider avoiding such supposed-micro-optimizations.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see if we can determine what differences there are (if any) from the original formulation suggested in the question:\r\n\r\n    if (a == b) { ++x;

There is no branching (and indeed not even any predication) in either realization.\r\n2.  The supposedly &quot;optimized&quot; case is nearly identical, except that it is 1 instruction longer than the if/else case.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand this is not &quot;your code&quot;.  I can only work with what is presented.\r\n\r\nThis gives me the intuition that these types of transformations:\r\n\r\n1. Require effort (potentially wasted time)\r\n2. May not yield any improvement in performance\r\n3. May obfuscate the code, making maintenance more difficult\r\n\r\nProceed as you wish, of course.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002166/avoiding-thread-divergence-in-a-cuda-kernel-with-conditional-assignments/58015878#58015878","title":"Avoiding thread divergence in a CUDA kernel with conditional assignments"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6111,"user_id":1662425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8109db00d44ebcdc900353b05e3a1443?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662425/tera"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568978452,"post_id":58019289,"comment_id":102457016,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002166/avoiding-thread-divergence-in-a-cuda-kernel-with-conditional-assignments/58019289#comment102457016_58019289"},{"owner":{"reputation":6111,"user_id":1662425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8109db00d44ebcdc900353b05e3a1443?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662425/tera"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568979699,"post_id":58019289,"comment_id":102457585,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002166/avoiding-thread-divergence-in-a-cuda-kernel-with-conditional-assignments/58019289#comment102457585_58019289"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6111,"user_id":1662425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8109db00d44ebcdc900353b05e3a1443?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662425/tera"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6111,"user_id":1662425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8109db00d44ebcdc900353b05e3a1443?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662425/tera"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568978415,"last_edit_date":1568978415,"creation_date":1568929572,"answer_id":58019289,"question_id":58002166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58019289","body_markdown":"### tl;dr: Consider the larger picture first before applying such supposed-micro-optimizations.\r\n\r\nLooking at Robert&#39;s example code, my first thought was\r\n```\r\n++*( (a==b) ? &amp;x : &amp;y);\r\n```\r\nHowever I was on my mobile phone and could not check the disassembly of this myself.\r\n\r\nRobert was kind enough to insert it into his test kernel and posted the SASS diff of this idea vs. the original if/else code posted in the question:\r\n\r\n    $ cuobjdump -sass t1513.o &gt;out3.sass\r\n    $ diff out1.sass out3.sass\r\n    13,44c13,52\r\n    &lt;

In trying to stay close to the (most likely accurately) presumed intentions of the questioner, he dereferenced the pointers into automatic variables, then inserted my one-liner (which really makes little sense in that case because taking the address of automatic variables forces them into local memory), and wrote the content of the the automatic variables back to global memory.\r\n\r\nMy thought however was to just replace the entire body of the test case with my `++*( (a==b) ? dx : dy);` one-liner, which would have led to better looking assembly:\r\n```\r\n        /*0008*/                   MOV R1, c[0x0][0x44];             /* 0x2800400110005de4 */\r\n        /*0010*/                   LDC.U8 R0, c[0x0][0x141];         /* 0x1400000507f01c06 */\r\n        /*0018*/                   LDC.U8 R2, c[0x0][0x140];         /* 0x1400000503f09c06 */\r\n        /*0020*/                   I2I.S16.S8 R0, R0;                /* 0x1c00000000101e84 */\r\n        /*0028*/                   I2I.S16.S8 R2, R2;                /* 0x1c00000008109e84 */\r\n        /*0030*/                   LOP32I.AND R0, R0, 0xff;          /* 0x38000003fc001c02 */\r\n        /*0038*/                   LOP32I.AND R2, R2, 0xff;          /* 0x38000003fc209c02 */\r\n                                                                     /* 0x228202c042804237 */\r\n        /*0048*/                   BFE R0, R0, 0x1000;               /* 0x7000c04000001c23 */\r\n        /*0050*/                   BFE R3, R2, 0x1000;               /* 0x7000c0400020dc23 */\r\n        /*0058*/                   MOV R2, c[0x0][0x148];            /* 0x2800400520009de4 */\r\n        /*0060*/                   ISETP.NE.AND P0, PT, R3, R0, PT;  /* 0x1a8e00000031dc23 */\r\n        /*0068*/                   MOV R0, c[0x0][0x14c];            /* 0x2800400530001de4 */\r\n        /*0070*/                   SEL R2, R2, c[0x0][0x150], !P0;   /* 0x2010400540209c04 */\r\n        /*0078*/                   SEL R3, R0, c[0x0][0x154], !P0;   /* 0x201040055000dc04 */\r\n                                                                     /* 0x20000002f04283f7 */\r\n        /*0088*/                   LD.E R0, [R2];                    /* 0x8400000000201c85 */\r\n        /*0090*/                   IADD32I R4, R0, 0x1;              /* 0x0800000004011c02 */\r\n        /*0098*/                   ST.E [R2], R4;                    /* 0x9400000000211c85 */\r\n        /*00a0*/                   EXIT;                             /* 0x8000000000001de7 */\r\n        /*00a8*/                   BRA 0xa8;                         /* 0x4003ffffe0001de7 */\r\n        /*00b0*/                   NOP;                              /* 0x4000000000001de4 */\r\n        /*00b8*/                   NOP;                              /* 0x4000000000001de4 */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code looks better to me than Robert&#39;s testcase (by itself).

Because this chart may extend the boundaries of the SVG&#39;s `width`, I automatically adjust its `viewport` and `width` after the chart was resized. When doing so the `div` where the SVG is located in also may exceed the boundaries of the screen, thus, adding a scrollbar. \r\n\r\n**THE PROBLEM**\r\n\r\nIf I now try to drag my **`rect`** it gives me the following error message:\r\n\r\n&gt; *Ignored attempt to cancel a touchmove event with cancelable=false, for example because scrolling is in progress and cannot be\r\n&gt; interrupted.*\r\n\r\nI guess this is because a scroll event is actually triggered, instead of the drag.

Also, additionalX and additionalY might be null.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to achieve this behavior?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002155/merging-compile-time-defined-member-variable-data-structures-before-calling-base","title":"Merging compile time defined member variable data structures before calling base constructor in C#"},{"tags":["python","plotly","geometry-surface"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11541972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u6lF6gV01EU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMg/wdg9YezVyI4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ulgen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541972/ulgen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568857474,"post_id":58002152,"comment_id":102410775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002152/how-to-draw-multiple-squares-at-different-heights-in-plotly-3d#comment102410775_58002152"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11541972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u6lF6gV01EU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMg/wdg9YezVyI4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ulgen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541972/ulgen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569121385,"post_id":58036714,"comment_id":102491036,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002152/how-to-draw-multiple-squares-at-different-heights-in-plotly-3d/58036714#comment102491036_58036714"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15854,"user_id":112871,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c672b1a855701ccca00911a6fbf02e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nicolaskruchten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/112871/nicolaskruchten"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569031028,"creation_date":1569031028,"answer_id":58036714,"question_id":58002152,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036714","body_markdown":"You can add many little square surfaces, like this:\r\n\r\n    import plotly.graph_objects as go\r\n    \r\n    def add_hovering_square(fig, x0, y0, size, height):\r\n        fig.add_trace(go.Surface(\r\n            z=[[height,height],[height,height]],\r\n            x=[x0,x0+size], y=[y0,y0+size],\r\n            coloraxis=&#39;coloraxis1&#39;\r\n        ))\r\n    \r\n    fig = go.Figure()\r\n    \r\n    add_hovering_square(fig, 1, 1, 1, 1)\r\n    add_hovering_square(fig, 1, 2, 1, 2)\r\n    add_hovering_square(fig, 2, 1, 1, 3)\r\n    add_hovering_square(fig, 2, 2, 1, 4)\r\n    \r\n    fig.show()\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6sY4p.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002152/how-to-draw-multiple-squares-at-different-heights-in-plotly-3d/58036714#58036714","title":"how to draw multiple squares at different heights in plotly 3D"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11541972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u6lF6gV01EU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMg/wdg9YezVyI4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ulgen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541972/ulgen"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569031028,"creation_date":1568852151,"question_id":58002152,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002152","body_markdown":"I am trying to draw area 1 squares that are parallel to xy-plane on different heights in plotly 3D.

I&#39;ve been learning on how to retrieve objects from an array and I&#39;ve had my fair share of converting an array of objects into a singular object of objects, but I couldn&#39;t wrap my head

in regards to this but the output I&#39;m expecting is quite different as it involves nested objects:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      cars : {\r\n          idOrder : {\r\n              &quot;car1&quot; : {\r\n

https://codesandbox.io/s/old-morning-hx9m1. I used `Object.assign({}, ...dataOfCars)` but it only _&#39;spreads&#39;_ the whole array, thus returning the final element only per entity. Here&#39;s the code at **index.js**:\r\n\r\n    import dataOfCars from &quot;./data.js&quot;;\r\n    import { normalize, schema } from &quot;normalizr&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    const ownerSchema = new schema.Entity(&quot;owners&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    const mechanicSchema = new schema.Entity(&quot;mechanics&quot;, {\r\n      mechanic: ownerSchema\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    const carSchema = new schema.Entity(&quot;cars&quot;, {\r\n      owner: ownerSchema,\r\n      mechanics: [mechanicSchema]\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    /* This method somehow returns the very final element */\r\n    const objectPost = Object.assign({}, ...dataOfCars);\r\n    \r\n    const normalizedPost = normalize(objectPost, carSchema);\r\n    \r\n    // The normalized object returning the 2/3 expected entities\r\n    console.log(normalizedPost);\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m still relatively new to ES6 and I would love to know how this works out in the end! Thanks for the help in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002139/converting-an-array-of-objects-into-an-object-of-objects","title":"Converting an array of objects into an object of objects"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","express","next.js"],"owner":{"reputation":1049,"user_id":410487,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8725228523429c49c64c63b75787cb9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Yaobin Then","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/410487/yaobin-then"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568852063,"creation_date":1568852063,"question_id":58002137,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002137","body_markdown":"To start, I naively copied the middlewares that express server use into Next as a custom server, it somewhat works, except that the middlewares are called for every request coming in including those for /static and /_next and HMR stuff.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the passport and CSRF middleware are being called repeatedly.

It is formatted in a way not supported by the `DataSet`. When nesting tables, you must define a parent-child relationship between the tables and you must set the `Nested` property of the child table to `true`. In your XML, the `DataSet` has no idea which parent the new child row belongs to, so it appends it to the end.\r\n\r\nYou can read in the MSDN about [Nesting DataRelations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/nesting-datarelations).\r\n\r\nHaving said that, your XML doesn&#39;t actually have parent and child tables. It has `METADATA` and `ROWDATA`. Like I said, that format is not supported by `DataSet`, you will have to move your meta data to a `Schema` (XSD). You can read in the MSDN about [Deriving DataSet Relational Structure from XML Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/deriving-dataset-relational-structure-from-xml-schema-xsd).\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how you car represent your data in question with XSD and XML:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Data;\r\n    using System.IO;\r\n    using System.Xml;\r\n    \r\n    public class Program\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic static void Main()\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tstring xml = @&quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;&quot;1.0&quot;&quot; encoding=&quot;&quot;UTF-8&quot;&quot; standalone=&quot;&quot;yes&quot;&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;MyDataSet&gt;\r\n        &lt;Companies&gt;\r\n    \t    &lt;CompanyID&gt;CC&lt;/CompanyID&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;Description&gt;Contoso&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Companies&gt;\r\n    &lt;/MyDataSet&gt;\r\n    &quot;;\r\n    \t\tstring xsd = @&quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;&quot;1.0&quot;&quot; encoding=&quot;&quot;utf-8&quot;&quot;?&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;xs:schema id=&quot;&quot;SomeID&quot;&quot;\r\n    \t\t\txmlns=&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n                xmlns:xs=&quot;&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&quot;\r\n                xmlns:msdata=&quot;&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;&quot;MyDataSet&quot;&quot; msdata:IsDataSet=&quot;&quot;true&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\r\n           &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;&quot;0&quot;&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;&quot;unbounded&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n             &lt;xs:element name=&quot;&quot;Companies&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n               &lt;xs:complexType &gt;\r\n                 &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\r\n                   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;&quot;CompanyID&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot;xs:string&quot;&quot; minOccurs=&quot;&quot;0&quot;&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;&quot;Description&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot;xs:string&quot;&quot; minOccurs=&quot;&quot;0&quot;&quot; /&gt;  \r\n                 &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\r\n               &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\r\n              &lt;/xs:element&gt;\r\n           &lt;/xs:choice&gt;\r\n         &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\r\n       &lt;/xs:element&gt;\r\n     &lt;/xs:schema&gt;\r\n    &quot;;\r\n            DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();\r\n            StringReader sr = new StringReader(xsd);\r\n    \t\tdataSet.ReadXmlSchema(sr);\r\n    \t\tsr = new StringReader(xml);\r\n    \t\tdataSet.ReadXml(sr, XmlReadMode.InferTypedSchema);\r\n    \t\tvar rowTable = dataSet.Tables[&quot;Companies&quot;];\r\n    \t\tvar newRow = rowTable.NewRow();\r\n    \t\tnewRow[&quot;CompanyID&quot;] = &quot;APPL&quot;;\r\n    \t\tnewRow[&quot;Description&quot;] = &quot;Apple&quot;;\r\n    \t\trowTable.Rows.Add(newRow);\r\n    \t\tConsole.WriteLine(dataSet.GetXml());\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn this case, you don&#39;t really need a Schema because you only have one table with all columns as `string`. So if you remove the Schema from the code above and run it again, you&#39;ll get the exact same results. However, this gives you an idea on how to define your `DataSet` structure using a Schema, so you can add more complex tables with relationship between them. For simple tables with no relationships, you don&#39;t need a Schema.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002118/after-importing-dataset-from-xml-new-rows-are-not-nested-properly/58010610#58010610","title":"After importing DataSet from XML, new rows are not nested properly"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":321,"user_id":10188134,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1350b770964d868235b4c1e7db9429b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DotNetPadawan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10188134/dotnetpadawan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":321,"user_id":10188134,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1350b770964d868235b4c1e7db9429b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DotNetPadawan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10188134/dotnetpadawan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568916414,"last_edit_date":1568916414,"creation_date":1568913880,"answer_id":58016152,"question_id":58002118,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58016152","body_markdown":"I solved my own question.

I&#39;ve seen other engineers struggling to understand its purpose before. As the warning is suggesting, you must pass a `__typename` property to objects you write directly to the cache, as Apollo Client will use this value by default in its data normalization process internally, to save/identify the data.\r\n\r\nOn all your calls to `client.writeData`, you should include a `__typename` property, like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclient.writeData({\r\n  data: {\r\n    name: {\r\n      __typename: &#39;FullName&#39;, // this is the name of the type this data represents, as you defined in your typeDefs\r\n      firstName: &#39;Lebron&#39;,\r\n      lastName: &#39;James&#39;,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, you can&#39;t use `async/await` on the `render` method of your component -- in the case of function components, the main body itself, as Promises are not valid React elements. So you have two options:\r\n\r\n- switch from `client.query` to the `useQuery` hook; or\r\n- since you&#39;re only requesting client-side fields, you can use the `client.readQuery` method which is synchronous and will return the data to you without a Promise. Note that with this method you&#39;re only able to make client-side requests, i.e if you want to request client and server fields at the same time, it won&#39;t work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002108/cant-set-apollo-local-state-with-nested-values/58028986#58028986","title":"Cant Set Apollo Local State with nested values"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":7025417,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28442658a6821b622c2133364a57e32a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7025417/chris"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58028986,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568984787,"creation_date":1568851764,"question_id":58002108,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002108","body_markdown":"I&#39;m testing out Apollo Graphql with React and I&#39;m trying to update the local state with Apollo Graphql with a nested object.

I am trying to get safety on my client side GraphQL queries (so if there is a better approach to this let me know). \r\n\r\nBut what I have been doing is defining my query like this. \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const tenantManagePageQuery = async (tenantId: string) =&gt;\r\n    graphQLClient.request&lt;{\r\n        tenants: TenantManagePageQueryTenant[];\r\n    }&gt;(\r\n        /* GraphQL */ `\r\n            query tenants($tenantId: String!) {\r\n                tenants(tenantIds: [$tenantId]) {\r\n                    id\r\n                    description\r\n                    name\r\n                    approvedUsers {\r\n                        id\r\n                        alias\r\n                    }\r\n                    pendingUsers {\r\n                        id\r\n                        alias\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        `,\r\n        { tenantId },\r\n    );\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nin order to define the `TenantManagePageQueryTenant` type I do something like this \r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface TenantManagePageQueryTenant\r\n    extends Pick&lt;Tenant, &#39;id&#39; | &#39;description&#39; | &#39;name&#39;&gt; {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the base Tenant model is my GQL model type. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anyway to do this kind of Pick statement but to also pick the nested properties. \r\n\r\nsomething like \r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface TenantManagePageQueryTenant\r\n    extends Pick&lt;Tenant, &#39;id&#39; | &#39;description&#39; | &#39;name&#39; | Pick&lt;approvedUser| &#39;id&#39; | &#39;alias&#39;&gt; {}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002078/is-there-anyway-to-do-nested-pick-types-in-typescript","title":"Is there anyway to do nested Pick&lt;&gt; types in

working on an app for iPad that includes some text editing in a UITextView.  I have a toolbar over the textview with buttons that can be used to modify the text, such as font, font size, bold, italics, etc. When the user taps the Font button in the toolbar, a popover view controller (not full screen) appears below the button with a list of fonts to choose from.  My problem is that when I select text that starts at the left edge of the textview and then tap the font button in my toolbar, the left selection grab handle appears in my popover.  Worse yet, I can drag the grab handle and change the selection but can&#39;t see what the selection is because it&#39;s covered by the popover.  Even more odd is that the left selection grab handle has to be before the first character on any line of text in the textview.  If I move the left grab handle to the right one or more characters and tap the Font button, I don&#39;t see the grab handle in the popover.\r\n\r\nI assumed I was doing something wrong but after days of playing with this I&#39;m beginning to think this is a bug in the SDK.  I was able to reproduce this with a very simple project that includes a button over a textview and a popover view controller, so there&#39;s nothing exotic about my code.\r\n\r\nBelow are some screen shots showing the simple app with selected text and then the same thing but with the Font Selection button tapped.  Note the blue dot in the popover.\r\n\r\nSelected Text:\r\n\r\n![img][1]\r\n\r\nFont Selection button tapped:\r\n\r\n![img][2]\r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced this and is there a workaround?  I&#39;ve been searching but haven&#39;t seen this documented elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zpCTr.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZiPG.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002073/uitextview-with-selected-text-covered-by-popover-shows-selection-grab-handle-in","title":"UITextView with selected text covered by popover shows selection grab handle in popover"},{"tags":["azure","azure-sql-database"],"owner":{"reputation":331,"user_id":4964812,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ccc989583ed57482f777e957b74d5084?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Norrin Rad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4964812/norrin-rad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568851254,"creation_date":1568851254,"question_id":58002069,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002069","body_markdown":"We are trying to use Failover CLuster Instances in Azure (IAAS) and we&#39;ve been trying to configure the DTC drive, however we need to set the port in the azure load balancer rules blade.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve looked online and it looks like it uses port 135 for incoming and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) dynamic port allocation for outgoing ports, and Microsoft recommendation is to open 15 to 20 ports using registry settings (which I&#39;m not keen on), and I don&#39;t want to 15 to 20 rules in Azure load balancer as you can&#39;t specify a range on the load balancer (not that I&#39;m aware off).\r\n\r\nCould anyone shed any light on this, thanks in advance :)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002069/sql-dtc-ports-azure-load-balancer","title":"SQL DTC Ports Azure Load Balancer"},{"tags":["wordpress","elementor"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wG5tQ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Renato Linares","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087584/renato-linares"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568852006,"post_id":58002120,"comment_id":102409823,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002058/aligning-icon-list-vertically-in-wordpress/58002120#comment102409823_58002120"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":79,"user_id":11161030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfed660fea69201963d5fed6e6b3c555?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Timothy C.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11161030/timothy-c"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568851850,"creation_date":1568851850,"answer_id":58002120,"question_id":58002058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002120","body_markdown":"In Elemetor you can edit the alignment of an icon list.[Go to Style &gt; Alignement &gt; Center][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4vuyC.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002058/aligning-icon-list-vertically-in-wordpress/58002120#58002120","title":"Aligning Icon List vertically in Wordpress"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wG5tQ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Renato Linares","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087584/renato-linares"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2110,"user_id":9206753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156572780228840/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jee Mok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9206753/jee-mok"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568854521,"creation_date":1568851130,"last_edit_date":1568854521,"question_id":58002058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002058","body_markdown":"new to overflow and website design.

kind of compiler optimization is at play.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried your code with 50000 iterations instead of 500000, because life is short. My times are roughly 10 times better than yours.\r\n\r\nFirst, I&#39;ve ran your code\r\n```\r\n0.502928476\r\n1.68480928\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I tried to run the same with `-Djava.compiler=NONE` (disables JIT):\r\n\r\n```\r\n25.267888581\r\n24.742234792\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how awful the timing became. JIT is definitely a suspect here.\r\n\r\nThen I tried to make `input1` less uniform:\r\n\r\n`array[i] = i % 21 == 0 ? FIRST_INSTANCE : SECOND_INSTANCE;`\r\n\r\nand that hasn&#39;t made a difference. Then I tried to remove the pattern from `input1`:\r\n\r\n`array[i] = (int)(Math.sqrt(i) * Math.sqrt(i)) == i ? FIRST_INSTANCE : SECOND_INSTANCE;`\r\n\r\n```\r\n0.973357599\r\n1.82497641\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance of `input1` became almost twice worse.\r\n\r\nSo my conclusion is as follows: uniformity of the array matter to JIT for some reason :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLooking at it a bit further:\r\n\r\nIf we don&#39;t run `input` at all, and run `input2` 5 times instead of twice, we get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.826676411\r\n1.835746098\r\n1.566231165\r\n1.531194014\r\n1.551068832\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems that JIT fully kicked in by the third loop. Note the times are ~1.5s.\r\n\r\nNow, if we start off running `input1` twice, then proceed to `input2`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput1: 2 times\r\n0.507165973\r\n0.509543633\r\ninput2: 5 times\r\n1.270496255        &lt;------ WAT?\r\n1.817742481\r\n1.804664757\r\n1.845583904\r\n1.846861045\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like JIT set up for `input1` actually helped `input2` a bunch, but then got scrapped and never quite recovered\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002047/processing-an-array-of-overridden-methods-depends-if-it-is-arbitrary-or-in-alter/58002174#58002174","title":"Processing an array of overridden methods depends if it is arbitrary or in alternance"}],"owner":{"reputation":323,"user_id":10462735,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GQqZmtQFsho/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/rRSRyfMRDlA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Khaled Baklouti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10462735/khaled-baklouti"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6425,"user_id":597770,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VflG9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"iluxa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/597770/iluxa"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1569061680,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568855140,"creation_date":1568851020,"last_edit_date":1568855101,"question_id":58002047,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002047","body_markdown":"I have this piece of code and I want to know the cause of the difference between the time of execution of the first input and the second.\r\nI think it should take the same time because I am calling the same method which do nothing in 2 objects.\r\nbut input1 (which is an alternation of 2 instances) takes on my computer 5 seconds.\r\nand input2 (which is an arbitrary choosing between 2 instances) takes on my computer 17 seconds.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Program {\r\n\r\n\r\n    private static final Runnable FIRST_INSTANCE = () -&gt; {};\r\n    private static final Runnable SECOND_INSTANCE = () -&gt; {};\r\n\r\n    private static Runnable[] input1() {\r\n        Runnable[] array = new Runnable[10000];\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {\r\n            array[i] = i % 2 == 0 ?

Everything was going pretty well. So I created a point where I would get all the specific ManagedObjects Entities and set them on the `CompletedGameResultManagedObject` that is my central point in this specific model.\r\n\r\nThis is the CompletedGameResultManagedObject method used to setup the values before saving in CoreData\r\n\r\n    func managedObject(from context: NSManagedObjectContext){\r\n\r\n        let entity = NSEntityDescription.entity(forEntityName: String(describing: CompletedGameResultManagedObject.self), in: context)\r\n        \r\n        let newData = NSManagedObject(entity: entity!, insertInto: context) as! CompletedGameResultManagedObject\r\n        \r\n        //Relationships\r\n        newData.gamePlayedInformation = gamePlayedInformation.managedObject(from: context)\r\n        newData.environmentInformation = environmentInformation.managedObject(from: context)\r\n        newData.gameResultData = result.managedObject(from: context)\r\n\r\n        //Entity Properties\r\n        newData.studentIdentifier = studentIdentifier\r\n        newData.tutorIdentifier = tutorIdentifier\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat method, the persistence with CoreData, crashes my app with this [Error log][2]\r\n\r\nThis is solved, if for some reason I go and comment any `newData` attribution. Transforming whatever one of the lines into a comment, makes my CoreData works. Basically, if I comment\r\n\r\n        //newData.gamePlayedInformation = gamePlayedInformation.managedObject(from: context)\r\n\r\nCoreData will be able to save the `CompletedGameResultManagedObject`.\r\n\r\nI tried commenting and uncommenting each and every one of the lines to see if the problem was coming out from one of them, and it would work smoothly in all cases that I had at least one line commented.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve added these Arguments to help debug:\r\n\r\n`-com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1`\r\n\r\n`-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1`\r\n\r\n`-com.apple.CoreData.MigrationDebug 1`\r\n\r\nI Still could not understand what was going on.\r\n\r\nTried to see if some value were corrupted before calling the CoreData Save Method. But it was not the case, all values were correct and were saved and fetched correctly when I persist the data with one of the properties or relationship attribution line commented.\r\n\r\nThis makes no sense at all.

The following image is from [here](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/lists#convert_a_paragraph_to_a_list).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, how about this answer?\r\n\r\n## Solution:\r\nWhen [the document](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/documents/request#createparagraphbulletsrequest) is confirmed, the following document can be seen.\r\n\r\n&gt; The nesting level of each paragraph will be determined by counting leading tabs in front of each paragraph. To avoid excess space between the bullet and the corresponding paragraph, these leading tabs are removed by this request. This may change the indices of parts of the text.\r\n\r\nFrom this, when you want to create the nested list, please use `\\t` at the top of paragraph. For example, when the following paragraphs are put to the Document,\r\n\r\n\tItem One\r\n\tItem Two\r\n\t\tSub-Item One\r\n\t\tSub-Item Two\r\n\tItem Three\r\n\r\nit becomes as follows.\r\n\r\n\tItem One\\nItem Two\\n\\tSub-Item One\\n\\tSub-Item Two\\nItem Three\\n\r\n\r\nUsing this, the endpoint and request body are as follows.\r\n\r\n### Endpoint:\r\n\tPOST https://docs.googleapis.com/v1/documents/{documentId}:batchUpdate\r\n\r\n### Sample request body:\r\nFor the situation the paragraphs are existing, please use `createParagraphBullets`.\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t  &quot;requests&quot;: \r\n\t  [\r\n\t    {\r\n\t      &quot;insertText&quot;: \r\n\t      {\r\n\t        &quot;location&quot;: \r\n\t        {\r\n\t          &quot;index&quot;: 1\r\n\t        },\r\n\t        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Item One\\nItem Two\\n\\tSub-Item One\\n\\tSub-Item Two\\nItem Three\\n&quot;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    },\r\n\t    {\r\n\t      &quot;createParagraphBullets&quot;: \r\n\t      {\r\n\t        &quot;range&quot;: \r\n\t        {\r\n\t          &quot;startIndex&quot;: 1,\r\n\t          &quot;endIndex&quot;: 50\r\n\t        },\r\n\t        &quot;bulletPreset&quot;: &quot;BULLET_ARROW_DIAMOND_DISC&quot;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t  ]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n- For example, if the paragraphs have already been existing in the Document, you can only use `createParagraphBullets`.\r\n- It seems that about `endIndex` of `createParagraphBullets`, when the paragraph is included, the request works for the paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy above endpoint and request body, the nested list can be created.\r\n\r\n### Reference:\r\n- [CreateParagraphBulletsRequest](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/documents/request#createparagraphbulletsrequest)\r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood your question and this was not the direction you want, I apologize.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYuts.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002044/google-docs-api-v1-how-to-create-list-nested-element/58002821#58002821","title":"Google Docs API v1 - how to create list nested element?"}],"owner":{"reputation":640,"user_id":641071,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13eadab25651ea4832ca8eb88f425bdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mateusz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/641071/mateusz"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568859322,"creation_date":1568850958,"question_id":58002044,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002044","body_markdown":"So there is this example: https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/lists \r\n\r\nHow do I make nested list element?

So if a program doesn&#39;t use hooks like atexit, on_exit. It&#39;s quite possible that the program will close in an undetermined state.\r\n\r\n&gt; All functions registered with atexit(3) and on_exit(3) are called, in\r\n&gt;        the reverse order of their registration.  (It is possible for one of\r\n&gt;        these functions to use atexit(3) or on_exit(3) to register an\r\n&gt;        additional function to be executed during exit processing; the new\r\n&gt;        registration is added to the front of the list of functions that\r\n&gt;        remain to be called.)  If one of these functions does not return\r\n&gt;        (e.g., it calls _exit(2), or kills itself with a signal), then none\r\n&gt;        of the remaining functions is called, and further exit processing (in\r\n&gt;        particular, flushing of stdio(3) streams) is abandoned.  If a\r\n&gt;        function has been registered multiple times using atexit(3) or\r\n&gt;        on_exit(3), then it is called as many times as it was registered.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exit.3.html\r\n\r\nThe other problem would be that some program rely on some particular exit codes so if the program exit with `exit(0)` it has to exit because the program ended normally otherwise it should use some kind of exit code that make sense to the program.\r\n\r\nIf the program implement correctly exiting callbacks, it wouldn&#39;t be terrible to use exit directly assuming that the program can do the cleanups.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a program provide some APIs to exit the program it should be used instead of exit directly.\r\n\r\nSo it really depends if the program actually handle the &quot;exiting&quot; situations.\r\n\r\nBut if we&#39;re talking about a library like an NFCReader library... or something general that isn&#39;t coupled with the main program. That would be weird and possibly annoying to have a library that would make your program die in cases that aren&#39;t unrecoverable errors.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a general library, the library writer cannot know if any of the program using their library use the same exit codes, or have actual exitting callbacks enabled so it would be a terrible idea to do that and in worse case it could become even dangerous.\r\n\r\nImagine a regex library being used on some medical equipment that in some weird scenario would fail to parse a regex and decide to exit the program in the middle of an operation.

Here is the formula to be put in Cell `E2` to find **Period**:\r\n\r\n    {=IFERROR(INDEX(Policy_Period,MATCH(D2,IF((OEM=C2),YEAR(Effective)),0)),&quot;&quot;)}\r\n\r\n&gt;Just a reminder, all formulas used are **Array Formula** so you need to press \r\n&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; in the formula bar after entering the formula otherwise it will not return the correct result. Then you can drag them down to apply across board.\r\n\r\nScreenshot for **Approach 1**\r\n\r\n[![Example1][1]][1]\r\n\r\nScreenshot for **Approach 2**\r\n\r\n[![Example2][2]][2]\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

For a small test project I want to update a calendar grid when the user changes the display mode or changes the date.\r\n\r\nHere is `Calendar.jsx`. The state is stored here. `date` and `setDate` are passed as props to `CalendarDatePicker`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React, {useState} from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport PropTypes from &#39;prop-types&#39;;\r\nimport CalendarDisplayMode from &#39;./CalendarDisplayMode&#39;;\r\nimport CalendarDatePicker from &#39;./CalendarDatePicker&#39;;\r\nimport CalendarGrid from &#39;./CalendarGrid&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst Calendar = props =&gt; {\r\n    const [date, setDate] = useState(props.date);\r\n    const [mode, setMode] = useState(props.mode);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        &lt;div className=&quot;bg-light border border-dark rounded p-1&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;CalendarDisplayMode mode={mode} setMode={setMode} /&gt;\r\n            &lt;CalendarDatePicker date={date} setDate={setDate} /&gt;\r\n            &lt;CalendarGrid displayDate={date} displayMode={mode} /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nCalendar.propTypes = {\r\n    date: PropTypes.instanceOf(Date).isRequired,\r\n    mode: PropTypes.oneOf([&#39;day&#39;, &#39;week&#39;, &#39;month&#39;, &#39;year&#39;]).isRequired\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Calendar;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is `CalendarDatePicker.jsx`.

If I increment or decrement the number in the year field, the month field increments its value. If I increment or decrement the month field none of the other fields change values (as expected). If I increment or decrement the number in the day field, the month field increments its value. If I increment or decrement the number in the day field enough the month field rolls over (from 12 to 1) and the year field also increments its value.\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain what might be happening here and how to fix it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002021/why-does-changing-a-value-in-one-input-change-the-value-in-another-input-too","title":"Why does changing a value in one input change the value in another input too?"},{"tags":["node.js","mongodb","mongoose"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":8993892,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02d217a8e43b4be4221499fbf51debbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chameleon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8993892/chameleon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568853737,"post_id":58002201,"comment_id":102410118,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002020/trying-to-save-data-to-a-collection-with-mongodb-nodejs-and-mongoose/58002201#comment102410118_58002201"},{"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":8993892,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02d217a8e43b4be4221499fbf51debbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chameleon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8993892/chameleon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568854800,"post_id":58002201,"comment_id":102410296,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002020/trying-to-save-data-to-a-collection-with-mongodb-nodejs-and-mongoose/58002201#comment102410296_58002201"},{"owner":{"reputation":4078,"user_id":7133482,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ec0rd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sayuri Mizuguchi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7133482/sayuri-mizuguchi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":47,"user_id":8993892,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02d217a8e43b4be4221499fbf51debbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chameleon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8993892/chameleon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568903131,"post_id":58002201,"comment_id":102430592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002020/trying-to-save-data-to-a-collection-with-mongodb-nodejs-and-mongoose/58002201#comment102430592_58002201"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4078,"user_id":7133482,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ec0rd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sayuri Mizuguchi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7133482/sayuri-mizuguchi"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568852778,"creation_date":1568852778,"answer_id":58002201,"question_id":58002020,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002201","body_markdown":"According to [Mongoose docs][1], you might use `.create` or `.save`.

{\r\n      console.log(&#39;Connection Failed!&#39;)\r\n    })\r\n\r\n\r\nand here is what is in my env.json minus the secret stuff: \r\n\r\n    .mongodb.net/gameData?retryWrites=true&amp;w=majority\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to send this object: \r\n\r\n    { IA: 4, undefined: 7, MI: 1, FL: 1, WV: 1, TX: 1, MN: 1, MO: 1 }\r\n\r\nI&#39;m getting the error insertOne() is not a function but I don&#39;t think that is my problem here.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002020/trying-to-save-data-to-a-collection-with-mongodb-nodejs-and-mongoose","title":"Trying to save data to a collection with mongoDB, nodejs and mongoose"},{"tags":["android"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087602,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/750e16d4a747ee4e0a41a51f730eaff4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jonathan M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087602/jonathan-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568852948,"post_id":58002135,"comment_id":102409970,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002019/attribute-not-found-on-first-load-of-android-studio-3-5/58002135#comment102409970_58002135"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087602,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/750e16d4a747ee4e0a41a51f730eaff4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jonathan M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087602/jonathan-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568853170,"post_id":58002135,"comment_id":102410011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002019/attribute-not-found-on-first-load-of-android-studio-3-5/58002135#comment102410011_58002135"},{"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":7688161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1282330571882556/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rowan Berry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7688161/rowan-berry"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087602,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/750e16d4a747ee4e0a41a51f730eaff4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jonathan M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087602/jonathan-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568856018,"post_id":58002135,"comment_id":102410503,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002019/attribute-not-found-on-first-load-of-android-studio-3-5/58002135#comment102410503_58002135"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087602,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/750e16d4a747ee4e0a41a51f730eaff4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jonathan M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087602/jonathan-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568859279,"post_id":58002135,"comment_id":102411070,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002019/attribute-not-found-on-first-load-of-android-studio-3-5/58002135#comment102411070_58002135"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":7688161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1282330571882556/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rowan Berry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7688161/rowan-berry"},"last_editor":{"reputation":41,"user_id":7688161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1282330571882556/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rowan Berry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7688161/rowan-berry"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568855841,"last_edit_date":1568855841,"creation_date":1568852028,"answer_id":58002135,"question_id":58002019,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002135","body_markdown":"Apologies for putting this as an answer as I do not have the rep to comment but.\r\n\r\nHave you tried going to the AndroidManifest.xml and checking that the following lines exist?\r\n\r\n    &lt;activity android:name=&quot;.MainActivity&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;intent-filter&gt;\r\n                    &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot;

don&#39;t think your code is gonna work - there are multiple problems with it: \r\n\r\nfirst of all window&#39;s `load` event is probably not going to fire for your data request. \r\n\r\nsecondly - attaching an event listener is a &quot;side effect&quot; you should wrap it inside a `useEffect`. (however we shouldn&#39;t be using that event here) https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html\r\n\r\nIn `React` - try to avoid using `document.find***` or other helpers to get DOM nodes (again, usually you don&#39;t need to change dom nodes directly) If you need to have access to a DOM node, use `ref`. https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html\r\n\r\nand in React in 99.99% cases you shouldn&#39;t modify DOM directly - let `React` handle that - you should provide react components with proper `state` and let your components render directly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK how do we solve your problem here? \r\n\r\n&gt; loading gif run on top of it all until all my data outputs on the DOM\r\n\r\nSo from this I think we should:\r\n\r\n1. have a state flag (let&#39;s say `loaded`) that tracks if data has been fetched.\r\n2. hide the loading animation when `loaded` is true. (and assuming we are still doing that with css)\r\n\r\nHow do we do that?\r\n\r\nSo in your loader component, it should take a prop `hidden` - when it is true, we add the `hidden` class to the loader - so it is going to look like this:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n\r\nconst LoadingGif = ({ hidden }) =&gt; {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;loader&quot; className={`loader ${hidden ? &#39;hidden&#39; : &#39;&#39;}`}&gt;\r\n      &lt;img\r\n       //...\r\n      /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in your `App` add a field to your state to track if your data has been loaded:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstate = {\r\n  // ... your other states\r\n  loaded: false\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen your fetch completes, make sure to update it to `true` \r\n```\r\n    const data = await getData.json();\r\n      this.setState({\r\n        author: data.copyright,\r\n        date: data.date,\r\n        explanation: data.explanation,\r\n        title: data.title,\r\n        url: data.url,\r\n        loaded: true  // here\r\n      });\r\n```\r\n\r\nin your render, provide that `loaded` state to your loader component as a prop:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// it is hidden when `loaded` is true\r\n&lt;LoadingGif hidden={this.state.loaded} /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting it together:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/patient-resonance-s3si9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58001998/loading-gif-fades-out-before-the-image-completely-loads-why-is-that/58002353#58002353","title":"Loading gif fades out before the image completely loads, why is that?"}],"owner":{"reputation":77,"user_id":10393420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f736a1e0ac0df12fa5796a32b1676e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"josephT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10393420/josepht"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568854497,"creation_date":1568850477,"question_id":58001998,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58001998","body_markdown":"I am testing out a dummy site to work on fetching data from, in this case the NASA API.
