could use notifications, as pointed out in the comments, but I would do something else. \r\n\r\n**1.** In your custom cell class, I would add a property called `parentVC` of type `UIViewController`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass YourTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {\r\n\r\n    var parentVC: UIViewController!\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2.** Then, when you are dequeueing the cell, I would set the cell&#39;s `parentVC` to `self`, like so:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nfunc tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {\r\n    let cell: UITableViewCell! = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: &quot;YourCellIdentifier&quot;) as! YourTableViewCell\r\n    //`self` is the view controller that the cell&#39;s table view is held in\r\n    cell.parentVC = self\r\n    return cell\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3.** Finally, whenever your custom cell&#39;s button is clicked, simply present the alert controller from `parentVC`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass YourTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {\r\n\r\n    var parentVC: UIViewController!\r\n\r\n    @IBAction func customButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {\r\n        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: &quot;Your alert title.&quot;, message: &quot;Your alert message.&quot;, preferredStyle: .alert)\r\n        parentVC.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Another variation (as suggested by rmaddy)**\r\n\r\nYou could simply change the button within your `UITableViewCell` to recursively check the next responder until it is of type `UIViewController`.\r\n\r\nFirst add the following extension to `UIView`.

For now there is just printing info from the `Notification.`\r\n\r\nThen when you fire any Notification use this function in button click or row click.\r\n\r\n    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n            \r\n            var alertData = [&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Alert Title&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Alert Description&quot;]\r\n            \r\n            NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Notification.Name(&quot;isAlertReallyAlert&quot;), object: self, userInfo: alertData)\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSo maybe you can specified and add feature for user info to prepare any alert.\r\n\r\nLastly here is the extension for the `UIViewController` to use `UIAlertController` `efficiently`.\r\n\r\n    extension UIViewController{\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        func shotAlert(title:String, description:String){\r\n            // Create Alert Controller\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n// GOOD POINT:\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume your view controllers `A, B and C` are living in `UINavigationController` stack like `A -&gt; B -&gt; C`, so if you add observer in A controller you can fire any notification from the C as you describe `Notification.Name` correctly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421761/present-alert-controller-from-table-view-cell-across-multiple-view-controllers/58422393#58422393","title":"Present alert controller from table view cell across multiple view controllers"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":6724161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1abf5e341f46c0c79d430ad81112dd6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6724161","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6724161/user6724161"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571264391,"creation_date":1571260236,"last_edit_date":1571260474,"question_id":58421761,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421761","body_markdown":"I have a table view cell with a button.

current code, you&#39;re looping through `@product_names` once with `until` and inside of that you&#39;re looping through `@product_names` with `.each`. For example if `@product_names.length == 3`, you&#39;d print `3 * 3 == 9` times!\r\n\r\nSince you only need to loop through `@product_names` once, pick either `until` or `.each`.

Which one is called first depends on which kind of primitive it should be converted to.\r\n\r\nWhen an object is converted to a number the order is `valueOf`, `toString`. `toString` is called if `valueOf` doesn&#39;t return a primitive value. And that&#39;s the case for the default implementation of `valueOf` which returns the object itself:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var obj = {};\r\n    console.log(obj.valueOf() === obj)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing this we can verify the order in which the methods are called by implementing our own `valueOf` but returning the same value as the default one:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let user2 = {\r\n      valueOf() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;valueOf&#39;);\r\n        return super.valueOf();\r\n      },\r\n      toString() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;toString&#39;);\r\n        return 10;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    console.log(+user2); // 20 10\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYour first example, `user1`, doesn&#39;t call `valueOf` because\r\n\r\n1. Since the value is converted to a string, the call order of the methods is `toString`, `valueOf`.\r\n2. The default implementation of `toString` returns a primitive value, hence the algorithm stops there and doesn&#39;t try `valueOf`.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let user1 = {\r\n      toString() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;toString&#39;);\r\n        return super.toString();\r\n      },\r\n      valueOf() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;valueOf&#39;);\r\n        return 10;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    console.log(`${user1}`);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelevant parts of the spec:\r\n\r\n- https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-toprimitive\r\n- https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-ordinarytoprimitive\r\n- https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-object.prototype.valueof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421747/why-the-valueof-prototype-function-does-not-work/58421886#58421886","title":"Why the valueOf prototype function does not work"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11974660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCgNl807C6xBUewRJZ-MSsTak-h8HFO2fnBl6KF=k-s128","display_name":"Darfion Dario","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974660/darfion-dario"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11974660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCgNl807C6xBUewRJZ-MSsTak-h8HFO2fnBl6KF=k-s128","display_name":"Darfion Dario","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974660/darfion-dario"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58421886,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571261350,"creation_date":1571260200,"last_edit_date":1571260519,"question_id":58421747,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421747","body_markdown":"This my code \r\n\r\n    let user1 = {\r\n      valueOf() {\r\n        console.log(20);\r\n        return 10;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    console.log(`${user1}`);

One of which needs filtering based on a property from the other one.\r\n\r\nI have a movies list such as this:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    id: 1,\r\n    type: &#39;movies&#39;,\r\n    attributes: {\r\n      name: &#39;Batman&#39;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 2,\r\n    type: &#39;movies&#39;,\r\n    attributes: {\r\n      name: &#39;Spiderman&#39;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then have another array which contains movies that a user has watched but they are within a nested object within the array as a relationship following the JSON API spec.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    id: &#39;1&#39;,\r\n    type: &#39;moviesWatched&#39;,\r\n    attributes: {\r\n      comment: &#39;Excellent film, would recommend to anyone who loves a action film!&#39;\r\n    },\r\n    relationships: {\r\n      movie: {\r\n        data: {\r\n           type: &#39;movies&#39;,\r\n           id: 2\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I need to achieve is I need to cross reference the id from `watchList[].relationships.movie.data.id` with the first array. Obviously, this list is a lot longer in production but what I am hoping to achieve is to have a full list of movies which the use has watched with the name of the movie based off 2 arrays formatted like this to save me having to store needless data inside of the database. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of the array would be something along the lines of...\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    id: 1,\r\n    type: &#39;movies&#39;,\r\n    attributes: {\r\n       name: &#39;Batman&#39;\r\n    },\r\n    meta: {\r\n      watched: false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 2,\r\n    type: &#39;movies&#39;,\r\n    attributes: {\r\n      name: &#39;Spiderman&#39;\r\n    },\r\n    meta: {\r\n      watched: true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is what I have currently, which is working but I don&#39;t know if there is a better way to go about it...\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmovies.map((movie) =&gt; {\r\n    const watched = watchedMovies.find((searchable) =&gt; {\r\n        return searchable.relationships.movie.data.id === searchable.id;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    movie.meta.watched = watched || false;\r\n\r\n    return movie;\r\n});\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421730/filter-javascript-array-based-on-object-property-from-another-array","title":"Filter JavaScript array based on object property from another array"},{"tags":["android","react-native"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":5705408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35925dad32f715c478bd3f4ae26e8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lenoarod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705408/lenoarod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571290062,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103192528,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103192528_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":180,"user_id":4741073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1d9j6b6OZqw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/AXL41K5kTTk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Waheed Akhter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4741073/waheed-akhter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571294367,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103194118,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103194118_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":114,"user_id":5705408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35925dad32f715c478bd3f4ae26e8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lenoarod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705408/lenoarod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571314619,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103205380,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103205380_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":180,"user_id":4741073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1d9j6b6OZqw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/AXL41K5kTTk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Waheed Akhter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4741073/waheed-akhter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571314665,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103205406,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103205406_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":5705408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35925dad32f715c478bd3f4ae26e8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lenoarod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705408/lenoarod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571361679,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103224674,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103224674_58421729"}],"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"last_editor":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571260995,"creation_date":1571260128,"last_edit_date":1571260995,"question_id":58421729,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421729","body_markdown":"I have a screen with many horizontal FlatLists inside a ScrollView, the structure is likes this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;ScrollView&gt;\r\n  &lt;View&gt;\r\n    &lt;FlatList horizontal={true} .../&gt;\r\n  &lt;/View&gt;\r\n  &lt;View&gt;\r\n    &lt;FlatList horizontal={true} .../&gt;\r\n  &lt;/View&gt;\r\n  &lt;View&gt;\r\n    &lt;FlatList horizontal={true} .../&gt;\r\n  &lt;/View&gt;\r\n&lt;/ScrollView&gt;\r\n```\r\nHorizontal scrolling on each FlatList sometimes work, but most of the times happens a swipe to the next screen:\r\n\r\n![gif](https://i.imgur.com/YaZlJh5.gif)\r\n\r\nAm using react native 0.61.2, react-navigation 4.0.10.

problem is that the line `myImage.image = UIImage(named: randomSet[randomNumber])` is wrong because `randomSet[randomNumber]` returns `[String:String]`, not `String`. What you instead need to do is `randomSet[randomNumber][&quot;myImage&quot;]`, which will return the string you want to initialize the `UIImage`.\r\n\r\nAlso note: your dictionary&#39;s keys should be `String`s in this case. Unless `myImage` and `myText` are declared as `String`s elsewhere, your dictionary is set up incorrectly. Try changing your `randomSet` to `[[&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;1-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 1&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;2-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 2&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;3-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 3&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;4-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 4&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;5-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 5&quot;]]`\r\n\r\nSo, implementing the changes, your code should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myImage: UIImageView!\r\n//Note this change from `@IBOutlet weak var myText:  = UILabel()`, which is incorrect\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myText: UILabel!\r\n\r\nvar randomSet: [[String:String]] = [[&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;1-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 1&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;2-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 2&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;3-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 3&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;4-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 4&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;5-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 5&quot;]]\r\n\r\nfunc randomiseSet (){\r\n    let randomNumber:Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(5))\r\n    myImage.image = UIImage(named: randomSet[randomNumber][&quot;myImage&quot;]!)\r\n    myText.text = randomSet[randomNumber]\r\n}\r\n\r\n@IBAction func showRandomSet(_ sender: UIButton) {\r\n    randomiseSet()\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421718/displaying-a-randomised-set-of-image-and-text-from-a-dictionary-in-swift/58421773#58421773","title":"Displaying a randomised set of image and text from a dictionary in Swift"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":6728595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/227def1f03ba933c6d46dc6080334ece?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cocodenut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6728595/cocodenut"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58421773,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571266982,"creation_date":1571260048,"question_id":58421718,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421718","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to retrieve and display from a dictionary a randomised set of an image with its associated text on click of a button. \r\n\r\nFirst, I tried having the image array and text array seperate and use **Int(arc4random_uniform())** to randomly pick the elements from the array to display. It worked, BUT in doing so I need to make sure the image and its associated text are in the same position within their own array and I thought there must be better ways to structure the data by combining them into a multidimensional array or a dictionary. I end up using a dictionary, but got stuck don&#39;t know how to get the image and text to display.\r\n\r\nSee in the code below **//THIS IS THE BIT I GOT STUCK AT**. I don&#39;t know how to retrieve the image and its text from the dictionary.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if it&#39;s ok to put the myImage and myText var in the dictionary and it seems a bit tedious to keep repeating &#39;**myImage**&#39;, &#39;**myText**&#39; for each set as well.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myImage: UIImageView!\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myText:  = UILabel()\r\n\r\nvar randomSet = [[myImage:&quot;1-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 1&quot;], [myImage:&quot;2-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 2&quot;], [myImage:&quot;3-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 3&quot;], [myImage:&quot;4-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 4&quot;], [myImage:&quot;5-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 5&quot;]]\r\n\r\nfunc randomiseSet (){\r\n        let randomNumber:Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(5))\r\n        //THIS IS THE BIT I GOT STUCK AT\r\n        myImage.image = UIImage(named: randomSet[randomNumber])\r\n        myText.text = randomSet[randomNumber]\r\n        //END\r\n    }\r\n\r\n@IBAction func showRandomSet(_ sender: UIButton) {\r\n        randomiseSet()\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI also tried instead of using myImage.image = .... myText.text = ....\r\n```swift\r\nreturn randomSet[[randomNumber]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth didn&#39;t work and showed &#39;Build Failed&#39;\r\n \r\n\r\nI have also investigated using CoreData but I&#39;m a noob and that opens another can of worm for me regarding binary data for images vs using URL due to image size etc.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion on what&#39;s the best way to fix the above is much appreciated.

In addition if the input is a vowel you need to write &quot;ub&quot; out first, except where the previous character was also a vowel.\r\n\r\nOne thing which is going to be handy is to be able to identify vowels.  Starting by writing a function for this is a good idea.  It could look like:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate boolean isVowel(char c) {\r\n    \t\treturn\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;a&#39; || c == &#39;A&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;e&#39; || c == &#39;E&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;i&#39; || c == &#39;I&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;o&#39; || c == &#39;O&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;u&#39; || c == &#39;U&#39;;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nNow that&#39;s in place if you look at the translation, we want to step over every character in the input and write it to the output.   This could look like this:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n                // some extra stuff needed here\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nFor the extra stuff you need to know if the current character is a vowel and whether the previous character was a vowel so we can add a little to do this:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \t\tboolean wasLastCharacterVowel = false;  // \r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\tif(isVowel(c)) {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = true;\r\n    \t\t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nAnd finally to ad &quot;ub&quot; where required you can check if the character is a vowel and whether the last character was a vowel:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \t\tboolean wasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\tif(isVowel(c)) {\r\n    \t\t\t\tif(!wasLastCharacterVowel) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\ttranslated += &quot;ub&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = true;\r\n    \t\t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nWith that in place you just need to hook up the button press action etc.  So it might look a little like this:\r\n\r\n    public class UbbiDubbi {\r\n    \t\r\n    \tprivate boolean isVowel(char c) {\r\n    \t\treturn\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;a&#39; || c == &#39;A&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;e&#39; || c == &#39;E&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;i&#39; || c == &#39;I&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;o&#39; || c == &#39;O&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;u&#39; || c == &#39;U&#39;;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \t\tboolean wasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\tif(isVowel(c)) {\r\n    \t\t\t\tif(!wasLastCharacterVowel) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\ttranslated += &quot;ub&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = true;\r\n    \t\t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic void buttonPressed() {\r\n\t\t    String userInput = &quot;&quot;;// = input.getText();\r\n\t        Scanner words = new Scanner( userInput );\r\n\t        while (words.hasNext()) {\r\n    \t        String lowerCase = words.next().toLowerCase();\r\n\t            String translated = translate(lowerCase);\r\n\t            System.out.println(translated);\r\n\t        }\r\n    \t    words.close();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String...none) {\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(new UbbiDubbi().translate(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy aadvark&quot;));\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nadding the main method gives an easy way to test out the translation.  Hope this helps.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421701/creating-an-ubbi-dubbi-translator-in-java/58423643#58423643","title":"Creating an Ubbi Dubbi translator in Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12229061,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rKFmPHkUPUo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rePb2hUNMqwASqwPlaM33FQ9Bf_2Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brooke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12229061/brooke"},"last_editor":{"reputation":65,"user_id":8383744,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cad9d89972b1591bbe384f23a88b51d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C2H50H","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8383744/c2h50h"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571284892,"creation_date":1571259938,"last_edit_date":1571260776,"question_id":58421701,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421701","body_markdown":"I&#39;m in an entry java class, and for one of my programs I am expected to create a ubbi dubbi translator, which ads a ub before every vowel and vowel cluster.

The first way is using the Angular Animation. The second way is the Native Page Transitions plugin.\r\n\r\nFor the Angular animations, follow the the steps below. You can also check [this tutorial][1]:\r\n\r\n 1. Import the `BrowserAnimationsModule`.\r\n\r\n        import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from &#39;@angular/platform-browser/animations&#39;;\r\n        \r\n        imports: [\r\n            BrowserAnimationsModule, \r\n            BrowserModule,\r\n            AppRoutingModule\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n 2. Wrap the Router Outlet\r\n\r\n         import { slider } from &#39;./route-animation.ts&#39;;\r\n\r\n        @Component({\r\n          selector: &#39;app-root&#39;,\r\n          animations: [ slider ]\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        prepareRoute(outlet: RouterOutlet) {\r\n          return outlet &amp;&amp; outlet.activatedRouteData &amp;&amp; outlet.activatedRouteData[&#39;animation&#39;];\r\n        }\r\n 3. Create route-animation.ts file\r\n\r\n        export const slider =\r\n          trigger(&#39;routeAnimations&#39;, [\r\n            transition(&#39;* &lt;=&gt; *&#39;, [\r\n              query(&#39;:enter, :leave&#39;, [\r\n                style({\r\n                  position: &#39;absolute&#39;,\r\n                  top: 0,\r\n                  left: 0,\r\n                  width: &#39;100%&#39;\r\n                })\r\n              ], { optional: true }),\r\n              query(&#39;:enter&#39;, [\r\n                style({ left: &#39;-100%&#39;})\r\n              ]),\r\n              group([\r\n                query(&#39;:leave&#39;, [\r\n                  animate(&#39;600ms ease&#39;, style({ left: &#39;100%&#39;}))\r\n                ], { optional: true }),\r\n                query(&#39;:enter&#39;, [\r\n                  animate(&#39;600ms ease&#39;, style({ left: &#39;0%&#39;}))\r\n                ])\r\n              ]),\r\n              // Normalize the page style... Might not be necessary\r\n\r\n              // Required only if you have child animations on the page\r\n              // query(&#39;:leave&#39;, animateChild()),\r\n              // query(&#39;:enter&#39;, animateChild()),\r\n          ]),\r\n        ]);\r\n\r\n**Using Native Page Transitions**\r\n\r\nYou can also use the [Native Page Transitions][2] plugin also. Even though it is not maintainable right now, but you can give it a try if you want.\r\n\r\nNot sure why it didn&#39;t work with you, but please make sure doing these steps:\r\n\r\n 1. Install the plugin: `ionic cordova plugin add com.telerik.plugins.nativepagetransitions` and `npm install @ionic-native/native-page-transitions`\r\n 2. Add it to the provider list in the app.module.ts:\r\n\r\n        import { NativePageTransitions } from &#39;@ionic-native/native-page-transitions/ngx&#39;;\r\n        ...\r\n        providers: [NativePageTransitions]\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n 3. When navigating, use this\r\n\r\n        import { NativePageTransitions, NativeTransitionOptions } from &#39;@ionic-native/native-page-transitions/ngx&#39;;\r\n\r\n        constructor(private nativePageTransitions: NativePageTransitions) { }\r\n\r\n        ionViewWillLeave() {       \r\n          let options: NativeTransitionOptions = {\r\n            direction: &#39;left&#39;,\r\n            duration: 500,\r\n            slowdownfactor: 3,\r\n            slidePixels: 20,\r\n            iosdelay: 100,\r\n            androiddelay: 150,\r\n            fixedPixelsTop: 0,\r\n            fixedPixelsBottom: 60\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          this.nativePageTransitions.slide(options);\r\n        \r\n        }\r\nOr before navigating:\r\n\r\n        this.nativePageTransitions.slide(options);\r\n        router.navigate([&#39;myPath&#39;]);\r\n\r\nYou can play with the config to meet your best slide. And don&#39;t forget that you will need to slide to the other direction when going back from a page.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://fireship.io/lessons/angular-router-animations/\r\n  [2]: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/native-page-transitions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421686/ionic4-native-page-transitions-not-working-on-router-navigate/58422514#58422514","title":"Ionic4 native page transitions not working on router navigate"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":10751081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LIatxdjFrok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFc/Ij4FYFMUwx4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Minus Zero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10751081/minus-zero"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20,"user_id":10751081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LIatxdjFrok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFc/Ij4FYFMUwx4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Minus Zero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10751081/minus-zero"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58422514,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571265169,"creation_date":1571259846,"last_edit_date":1571260536,"question_id":58421686,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421686","body_markdown":"The page transitions are not working when navigating to a new url.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIve tried all the possibilities of navigation the ionic angular like `routerLink` `href` `router.navigateByUrl()`.

parsing class definitions through introspection and would like to know whether the class has *explicitly* defined a default value for some of its fields.\r\n\r\n    class Foo {\r\n        private int member = 5; // Init value is 5\r\n    }\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\r\n    class Foo {\r\n        private int member; // Default value is 0 but no init value defined\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI could instanciate the class and get its members, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to distinguish between *explicitly*-initialized fields like `private int member = 0;` from *implicitly*-initialized like `private int member;` (which initial value is also `0`, except that it was not *explicitly* set).\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using introspection through [`getDeclaredFields()`][1] which means I can&#39;t assume a specific type for the field, so I can&#39;t use an annotation like:\r\n\r\n    @DefaultValue(5)\r\n    private int member;\r\n\r\nBecause:\r\n\r\n    public @interface DefaultValue {\r\n        Object value() default null; // Error &quot;... only primitive type, String, Class, annotation, enumeration are permitted or 1-dimensional arrays thereof&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI was thinking about using a `String` in such annotation (instead of the `Object` I wanted to use) then code some `deserialize()` method to parse the string and retrieve the value, but it seems like an overkill (if there are nicer ways) and cannot be checked at compile time (e.g. `@DefaultValue(&quot;toto&quot;) private int member;` would compile but is broken).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

If a read error occurs, or end of file is reached before any data is read, EOF is returned. \r\n\r\nSo, as others have said, the following while loop will not stop at a newline character.

The domain has its `DMARC` entry properly configured, it passes all the test of MXToolbox, according to MXToolbox the domain is all OK.\r\n\r\nI checked all the apps running in the domain and I found that one of them, in PhP, was using `PhPMailer` to send emails and the DMARC policy was set to quarantine.

I&#39;m thinking I can&#39;t use MapPath?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421613/displaying-list-of-files-in-a-folder-with-links","title":"Displaying List of Files in a Folder with

Get rid of `response.getStatusCode() / 100 == 2`. Write `response.getStatusCode() == 200` or `response.getStatusCode() == HttpStatus.SC_OK` instead.\r\n\r\n2. Remove the `else` branch and `throw` after the `if` statement.\r\n3. Rename the method to `getExceptionByStatusCode` or `generateExceptionForStatusCode`. You don&#39;t `handleException`, you decide which one to throw.\r\n\r\n4. Choose the right return type. Don&#39;t use `RuntimeException`. It can be `ResponseStatusException` or any other type appropriate to the HTTP/your domain abstraction.\r\n\r\n5. For each case, decide what type you want to return. Again, not `RuntimeException`.\r\n\r\nA bit improved version would be\r\n\r\n    private String handleResponse(HttpResponse response) {\r\n        final int statusCode = response.getStatusCode();\r\n    \r\n        if (statusCode == HttpStatus.SC_OK) {\r\n            return response.getEntity().toString();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        throw getExceptionByStatusCode(statusCode);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private MyDomainHTTPException getExceptionByStatusCode(int statusCode) {\r\n        switch (statusCode) {\r\n            case HttpStatus.SC_NOT_FOUND:\r\n                return new MyDomainHTTPException(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n            case HttpStatus.SC_UNAUTHORIZED:\r\n                return new MyDomainHTTPException(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n            default:\r\n                return new MyDomainHTTPException(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat said, returning an exception in Java doesn&#39;t *feel* right. \r\n\r\nIt works fine but it doesn&#39;t seem absolutely correct because of the &quot;special&quot; status of exceptions. It can be justifiable when there is lazy evaluation,  and you will be throwing the exception when you meet a certain condition in the future, or in cases with `Optional.orElseThrow`.\r\n\r\nIt might be confusing to some people who got used to the `throw new` template and never thought that returning an exception is a compilable option.\r\n\r\nIn large frameworks (Spring, PrimeFaces - if my memory serves me correctly), I saw exception factories used to compose exceptions based on the given context and rules. They definitely employ exceptions more extensively than we do.

best way to convey the additional information is going to entirely depend on who or what is consuming it. Formatting the output for a human is going to be different than massaging the output for further programmatic analysis or manipulation.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the dynamic column option in your first example only works in scenarios when the possible number of columns is very small. And even then, it&#39;s still a bit messy to work with both programmatically and understand visually.\r\n\r\nThe second option is a more human readable version of the output you already have. But the way to make it look like that basically turns it into plain text that you can&#39;t do any further work on.\r\n\r\nMy preferred option is usually a variation on the second option. Instead of trying to omit the Name/Extension data from subsequent skill rows, just duplicate it. So Kylo&#39;s original entry with two skills becomes two different Kylo entries each with a different skill. This known in database-world as denormalization.\r\n\r\nWithin your foreach loop, you&#39;re going to have a sub-loop that iterates over the collection of skills and then outputs an object for each skill rather than just one for the individual `$resource`. So maybe something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nforeach ($resource in $data) {\r\n    for ($i=0; $i -lt @($resource.skillmap.skillcompetency.skillNameUriPair).Count; $i++) {\r\n        [pscustomobject]@{\r\n            &#39;First Name&#39; = $resource.firstName\r\n            &#39;Last Name&#39; = $resource.lastName\r\n            &#39;Extension&#39; = $resource.extension\r\n            &#39;Skill Group&#39; = $resource.skillmap.skillcompetency.skillNameUriPair[$i].name\r\n            &#39;Skill Level&#39; = $resource.skillmap.skillcompetency.competencelevel[$i]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421590/expanding-an-array-in-an-object/58422002#58422002","title":"Expanding an array in an object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":7092295,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca1b34dd669035e944545e93a60b29e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"D.

The resulting data is put into an object and eventually output to the screen and into a CSV.  The problem is that many users are members of multiple queues and the resulting queue membership data is returned as an array.\r\n\r\nSo this is what my output looks like:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nFirst Name Last Name   Extension Skill Group                              Skill Level\r\n---------- ---------   --------- -----------                              -----------\r\nKylo       Ren\t\t   1234      {Sales Support, Customer Service} \t\t  {8, 8}\r\nFlip       Zimmerman   4321      {Accounting, Marketing} \t\t          {5, 3}\r\nClyde      Logan\t   1122      {Sales Support, Customer Service} \t\t  {4, 9}\r\nRonnie     Peterson    2211      {Sales Support, Customer Service,Claims} {4, 9, 1}\r\nAdam       Sackler     1212      Engineering                              2\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see the &quot;Skill Group&quot; and &quot;Skill Level&quot; columns are represented as arrays and the CSV that&#39;s saved just has `System.Object[]` for the cell which is obviously just saying that the cell contains an array.  However if the user is a member of only one skill group then the returned data will be a normal string, like Adam Sackler in the above list.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I&#39;m struggling with is that I don&#39;t know how the data should be displayed?  Some suggestions from you fine folks would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nFor instance should I dynamically create columns for each skill group and associated skill level?  What happens when a user has fewer, or more, columns than what&#39;s already there?\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nFirst Name Last Name   Extension Skill Group 1 Skill Level 1 Skill Group 2 \t  Skill Level 2\r\n---------- ---------   --------- ------------- ------------- -------------    -------------\r\nKylo       Ren\t\t   1234      Sales Support 8\t\t\t Customer Service 8\r\nFlip       Zimmerman   4321      Accounting\t   5\t\t     Marketing        3\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nOr should each additional skill group and skill level be on a new line?  Should additional skill group/level be on its own row or just use a carriage return in the cell?\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nFirst Name Last Name   Extension Skill Group      Skill Level\r\n---------- ---------   --------- -----------      -----------\r\nKylo       Ren\t\t   1234      Sales Support\t  8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Customer Service 4\r\nFlip       Zimmerman   4321      Accounting\t\t  5\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Marketing\t\t  3\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nIn any case, here&#39;s the relevant code that&#39;s creating the object with the arrays:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[xml]$resourceCsqInfo = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uccxServerBaseUrl&quot;resource?csqid=&quot;$($csq.id) -Method Get -Headers @{Authorization=(&quot;Basic {0}&quot; -f $base64AuthInfo)}\r\n\r\n[object]$data = $resourceCsqInfo.resources.resource\r\n\r\nforeach ($resource in $data) {\r\n    $outputList += New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{\r\n        &quot;First Name&quot;

So for example a connection to MySql and to SQLIte-DB.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421577/two-pdo-db-connections-for-two-different-mysql-servers-in-the-same-script/58426356#58426356","title":"Two PDO DB connections for two different MySQL servers in the same script"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11352130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38dc0b9cfe582ae93c4dce50ffbb6736?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"WildWilly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11352130/wildwilly"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1571294837,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571295268,"creation_date":1571259302,"last_edit_date":1571259698,"question_id":58421577,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421577","body_markdown":"Until now I used one MySQL server to which I was connection through including the following code from a file like i.e. pdo-config.php\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n$host = &#39;server&#39;;\r\n$db   = &#39;db&#39;;\r\n$user = &#39;user&#39;;\r\n$pass = &#39;pass&#39;;\r\n$charset = &#39;utf8mb4&#39;;\r\n\r\n$dsn = &quot;mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db;charset=$charset&quot;;\r\n$options = [\r\n    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE            =&gt;

Let&#39;s say first array(table_1) dimension is 30 so i need to put: diff1-diff30?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421575/how-can-i-loop-through-observations-and-values-in-the-dataset/58439092#58439092","title":"How can I loop through observations and values in the dataset?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10099944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00f53f902f29401ddbb1ce3f918a97e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Muska","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10099944/muska"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58424281,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571433914,"creation_date":1571259295,"question_id":58421575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421575","body_markdown":"I need to loop through a dataset (built-in, training SAS table with data) and do some calculations based on it.

Second, need to loop through all values in every observation and calculate difference between previous and following value. Here is the example of a table:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAuto   Price1  Price2  Price3 \r\nMazda  35.000  40.500  38.000\r\nAudi   70.000  60.000  80.000\r\nBMW    110.000 85.000  93.000\r\n```\r\nLet&#39;s say my table is named Prices in SAS.

My guess is that Blender is doing something weird with my class instance, like copying it from one memory location to another, or possibly that the instance is not fully constructed yet.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421562/printed-instance-address-looks-like-constructor","title":"Printed instance address looks like constructor"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9117}{"items":[{"tags":["angular","typescript","angular8"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2067,"user_id":3634032,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VTzk9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sam Herrmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3634032/sam-herrmann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571260822,"post_id":58421787,"comment_id":103185879,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421787/problem-rendering-the-result-of-a-function-in-angular-template#comment103185879_58421787"},{"owner":{"reputation":1111,"user_id":3718031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfBC6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VBobCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3718031/vbobcat"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2067,"user_id":3634032,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VTzk9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sam Herrmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3634032/sam-herrmann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571261586,"post_id":58421787,"comment_id":103186165,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421787/problem-rendering-the-result-of-a-function-in-angular-template#comment103186165_58421787"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1111,"user_id":3718031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfBC6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VBobCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3718031/vbobcat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265135,"post_id":58422299,"comment_id":103187193,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421787/problem-rendering-the-result-of-a-function-in-angular-template/58422299#comment103187193_58422299"},{"owner":{"reputation":2067,"user_id":3634032,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VTzk9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sam Herrmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3634032/sam-herrmann"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1111,"user_id":3718031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfBC6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VBobCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3718031/vbobcat"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571265551,"post_id":58422299,"comment_id":103187310,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421787/problem-rendering-the-result-of-a-function-in-angular-template/58422299#comment103187310_58422299"},{"owner":{"reputation":1111,"user_id":3718031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfBC6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VBobCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3718031/vbobcat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571266259,"post_id":58422299,"comment_id":103187494,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421787/problem-rendering-the-result-of-a-function-in-angular-template/58422299#comment103187494_58422299"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2067,"user_id":3634032,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VTzk9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sam Herrmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3634032/sam-herrmann"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571263710,"creation_date":1571263710,"answer_id":58422299,"question_id":58421787,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58422299","body_markdown":"As mentioned in my comment above, if Angular calls `emailAddress` before `mail` and `userPrincipalName` are set, then there is no way for Angular to know that those properties have changed and that it needs to call `emailAddress` again. The behavior you are looking for is certainly attainable in an Angular application using [RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/). Maybe a good introduction read is [Observables in the Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/observables). I have added some sample code to help you get an idea for what you will need to solve your problem:\r\n\r\n## Service\r\n```\r\nimport { HttpClient } from &#39;@angular/common/http&#39;;\r\nimport { Observable} from &#39;rxjs&#39;;\r\nimport { map} from &#39;rxjs/operators&#39;;\r\n\r\nexport class MyService {\r\n\r\n  constructor(httpClient: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n  user(): Observable&lt;User&gt; {\r\n    return this.httpClient.get(&#39;user/end/point&#39;);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  username(): Observable&lt;string&gt; {\r\n    return this.user().pipe(\r\n      map(user =&gt; user.mail || user.principalName)\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Component Class\r\n```\r\nexport class MyComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  \r\n  username = this.myService.username();\r\n\r\n  constructor(private myService: MyService) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Component Template\r\n```\r\n&lt;p&gt;{{ username | async }}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n```\r\nThe [async pipe](https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe) subscribes to the `username` observable and displays the result.

could use notifications, as pointed out in the comments, but I would do something else. \r\n\r\n**1.** In your custom cell class, I would add a property called `parentVC` of type `UIViewController`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass YourTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {\r\n\r\n    var parentVC: UIViewController!\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2.** Then, when you are dequeueing the cell, I would set the cell&#39;s `parentVC` to `self`, like so:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nfunc tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {\r\n    let cell: UITableViewCell! = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: &quot;YourCellIdentifier&quot;) as! YourTableViewCell\r\n    //`self` is the view controller that the cell&#39;s table view is held in\r\n    cell.parentVC = self\r\n    return cell\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3.** Finally, whenever your custom cell&#39;s button is clicked, simply present the alert controller from `parentVC`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass YourTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {\r\n\r\n    var parentVC: UIViewController!\r\n\r\n    @IBAction func customButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {\r\n        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: &quot;Your alert title.&quot;, message: &quot;Your alert message.&quot;, preferredStyle: .alert)\r\n        parentVC.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Another variation (as suggested by rmaddy)**\r\n\r\nYou could simply change the button within your `UITableViewCell` to recursively check the next responder until it is of type `UIViewController`.\r\n\r\nFirst add the following extension to `UIView`. This will find the `UIView`&#39;s parent view controller:\r\n```swift\r\nextension UIView {\r\n    var parentViewController: UIViewController? {\r\n        var parentResponder: UIResponder? = self\r\n        while parentResponder != nil {\r\n            parentResponder = parentResponder!.next\r\n            if let viewController = parentResponder as? UIViewController {\r\n                return viewController\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return nil\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could simply change the button within your `UITableViewCell` to recursively check the next responder until it is of type `UIViewController`. Once you find this `UIViewController`, you can have it present the `UIAlertController`, or any other view controller:\r\n\r\nSource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1372977/given-a-view-how-do-i-get-its-viewcontroller=\r\n\r\nOnce you find this `UIViewController`, you can have it present the `UIAlertController`, or any other view controller:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass YourTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    @IBAction func customButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {\r\n        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: &quot;Your alert title.&quot;, message: &quot;Your alert message.&quot;, preferredStyle: .alert)\r\n\r\n        guard let parentVC = self.parentViewController else { return }   \r\n        parentVC.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421761/present-alert-controller-from-table-view-cell-across-multiple-view-controllers/58421883#58421883","title":"Present alert controller from table view cell across multiple view controllers"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571264105,"post_id":58421986,"comment_id":103186939,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421761/present-alert-controller-from-table-view-cell-across-multiple-view-controllers/58421986#comment103186939_58421986"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1109,"user_id":3034573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vVJwk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RAJA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3034573/raja"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571264084,"last_edit_date":1571264084,"creation_date":1571261649,"answer_id":58421986,"question_id":58421761,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58421986","body_markdown":"Your can present using AppDelegates window property.\r\n\r\n    let alert = UIAlertController(title: &quot;title&quot;, message: &quot;message&quot;, preferredStyle: .alert)\r\n    let action = UIAlertAction(title: &quot;OK&quot;, style: .cancel, handler: nil)\r\n    alert.addAction(action)\r\n    UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.rootViewController?.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n\r\nBetter you have a validation based on your application rootViewController type to avoid \r\nissues.

For now there is just printing info from the `Notification.`\r\n\r\nThen when you fire any Notification use this function in button click or row click.\r\n\r\n    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n            \r\n            var alertData = [&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Alert Title&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Alert Description&quot;]\r\n            \r\n            NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Notification.Name(&quot;isAlertReallyAlert&quot;), object: self, userInfo: alertData)\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSo maybe you can specified and add feature for user info to prepare any alert.\r\n\r\nLastly here is the extension for the `UIViewController` to use `UIAlertController` `efficiently`.\r\n\r\n    extension UIViewController{\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        func shotAlert(title:String, description:String){\r\n            // Create Alert Controller\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n// GOOD POINT:\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume your view controllers `A, B and C` are living in `UINavigationController` stack like `A -&gt; B -&gt; C`, so if you add observer in A controller you can fire any notification from the C as you describe `Notification.Name` correctly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421761/present-alert-controller-from-table-view-cell-across-multiple-view-controllers/58422393#58422393","title":"Present alert controller from table view cell across multiple view controllers"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":6724161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1abf5e341f46c0c79d430ad81112dd6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6724161","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6724161/user6724161"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571264391,"creation_date":1571260236,"last_edit_date":1571260474,"question_id":58421761,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421761","body_markdown":"I have a table view cell with a button.

It is in fact called, but that&#39;s not all that happens.\r\n\r\nWhen converting an object to a primitive either `toString` or `valueOf` are called. Which one is called first depends on which kind of primitive it should be converted to.\r\n\r\nWhen an object is converted to a number the order is `valueOf`, `toString`. `toString` is called if `valueOf` doesn&#39;t return a primitive value. And that&#39;s the case for the default implementation of `valueOf` which returns the object itself:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var obj = {};\r\n    console.log(obj.valueOf() === obj)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing this we can verify the order in which the methods are called by implementing our own `valueOf` but returning the same value as the default one:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let user2 = {\r\n      valueOf() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;valueOf&#39;);\r\n        return super.valueOf();\r\n      },\r\n      toString() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;toString&#39;);\r\n        return 10;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    console.log(+user2); // 20 10\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYour first example, `user1`, doesn&#39;t call `valueOf` because\r\n\r\n1. Since the value is converted to a string, the call order of the methods is `toString`, `valueOf`.\r\n2. The default implementation of `toString` returns a primitive value, hence the algorithm stops there and doesn&#39;t try `valueOf`.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let user1 = {\r\n      toString() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;toString&#39;);\r\n        return super.toString();\r\n      },\r\n      valueOf() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;valueOf&#39;);\r\n        return 10;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    console.log(`${user1}`);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelevant parts of the spec:\r\n\r\n- https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-toprimitive\r\n- https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-ordinarytoprimitive\r\n- https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-object.prototype.valueof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421747/why-the-valueof-prototype-function-does-not-work/58421886#58421886","title":"Why the valueOf prototype function does not work"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11974660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCgNl807C6xBUewRJZ-MSsTak-h8HFO2fnBl6KF=k-s128","display_name":"Darfion Dario","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974660/darfion-dario"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11974660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCgNl807C6xBUewRJZ-MSsTak-h8HFO2fnBl6KF=k-s128","display_name":"Darfion Dario","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974660/darfion-dario"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58421886,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571261350,"creation_date":1571260200,"last_edit_date":1571260519,"question_id":58421747,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421747","body_markdown":"This my code \r\n\r\n    let user1 = {\r\n      valueOf() {\r\n        console.log(20);\r\n        return 10;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    console.log(`${user1}`);

{\r\n    const watched = watchedMovies.find((searchable) =&gt; {\r\n        return searchable.relationships.movie.data.id === searchable.id;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    movie.meta.watched = watched || false;\r\n\r\n    return movie;\r\n});\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421730/filter-javascript-array-based-on-object-property-from-another-array","title":"Filter JavaScript array based on object property from another array"},{"tags":["android","react-native"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":5705408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35925dad32f715c478bd3f4ae26e8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lenoarod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705408/lenoarod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571290062,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103192528,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103192528_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":180,"user_id":4741073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1d9j6b6OZqw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/AXL41K5kTTk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Waheed Akhter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4741073/waheed-akhter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571294367,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103194118,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103194118_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":114,"user_id":5705408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35925dad32f715c478bd3f4ae26e8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lenoarod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705408/lenoarod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571314619,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103205380,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103205380_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":180,"user_id":4741073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1d9j6b6OZqw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/AXL41K5kTTk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Waheed Akhter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4741073/waheed-akhter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571314665,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103205406,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103205406_58421729"},{"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":5705408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35925dad32f715c478bd3f4ae26e8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lenoarod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705408/lenoarod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571361679,"post_id":58421729,"comment_id":103224674,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421729/horizontal-flatlist-inside-scrollview-is-not-scrolling#comment103224674_58421729"}],"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"last_editor":{"reputation":78,"user_id":1715471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Gbj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andres Lopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1715471/andres-lopez"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571260995,"creation_date":1571260128,"last_edit_date":1571260995,"question_id":58421729,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421729","body_markdown":"I have a screen with many horizontal FlatLists inside a ScrollView, the structure is likes this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;ScrollView&gt;\r\n  &lt;View&gt;\r\n    &lt;FlatList horizontal={true} .../&gt;\r\n  &lt;/View&gt;\r\n  &lt;View&gt;\r\n    &lt;FlatList horizontal={true} .../&gt;\r\n  &lt;/View&gt;\r\n  &lt;View&gt;\r\n    &lt;FlatList horizontal={true} .../&gt;\r\n  &lt;/View&gt;\r\n&lt;/ScrollView&gt;\r\n```\r\nHorizontal scrolling on each FlatList sometimes work, but most of the times happens a swipe to the next screen:\r\n\r\n![gif](https://i.imgur.com/YaZlJh5.gif)\r\n\r\nAm using react native 0.61.2, react-navigation 4.0.10.

problem is that the line `myImage.image = UIImage(named: randomSet[randomNumber])` is wrong because `randomSet[randomNumber]` returns `[String:String]`, not `String`. What you instead need to do is `randomSet[randomNumber][&quot;myImage&quot;]`, which will return the string you want to initialize the `UIImage`.\r\n\r\nAlso note: your dictionary&#39;s keys should be `String`s in this case. Unless `myImage` and `myText` are declared as `String`s elsewhere, your dictionary is set up incorrectly. Try changing your `randomSet` to `[[&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;1-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 1&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;2-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 2&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;3-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 3&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;4-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 4&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;5-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 5&quot;]]`\r\n\r\nSo, implementing the changes, your code should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myImage: UIImageView!\r\n//Note this change from `@IBOutlet weak var myText:  = UILabel()`, which is incorrect\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myText: UILabel!\r\n\r\nvar randomSet: [[String:String]] = [[&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;1-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 1&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;2-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 2&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;3-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 3&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;4-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 4&quot;], [&quot;myImage&quot;:&quot;5-image&quot;, &quot;myText&quot;:&quot;text for 5&quot;]]\r\n\r\nfunc randomiseSet (){\r\n    let randomNumber:Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(5))\r\n    myImage.image = UIImage(named: randomSet[randomNumber][&quot;myImage&quot;]!)\r\n    myText.text = randomSet[randomNumber]\r\n}\r\n\r\n@IBAction func showRandomSet(_ sender: UIButton) {\r\n    randomiseSet()\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421718/displaying-a-randomised-set-of-image-and-text-from-a-dictionary-in-swift/58421773#58421773","title":"Displaying a randomised set of image and text from a dictionary in Swift"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":6728595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/227def1f03ba933c6d46dc6080334ece?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cocodenut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6728595/cocodenut"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58421773,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571266982,"creation_date":1571260048,"question_id":58421718,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421718","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to retrieve and display from a dictionary a randomised set of an image with its associated text on click of a button. \r\n\r\nFirst, I tried having the image array and text array seperate and use **Int(arc4random_uniform())** to randomly pick the elements from the array to display. It worked, BUT in doing so I need to make sure the image and its associated text are in the same position within their own array and I thought there must be better ways to structure the data by combining them into a multidimensional array or a dictionary. I end up using a dictionary, but got stuck don&#39;t know how to get the image and text to display.\r\n\r\nSee in the code below **//THIS IS THE BIT I GOT STUCK AT**. I don&#39;t know how to retrieve the image and its text from the dictionary.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if it&#39;s ok to put the myImage and myText var in the dictionary and it seems a bit tedious to keep repeating &#39;**myImage**&#39;, &#39;**myText**&#39; for each set as well.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myImage: UIImageView!\r\n@IBOutlet weak var myText:  = UILabel()\r\n\r\nvar randomSet = [[myImage:&quot;1-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 1&quot;], [myImage:&quot;2-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 2&quot;], [myImage:&quot;3-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 3&quot;], [myImage:&quot;4-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 4&quot;], [myImage:&quot;5-image&quot;, myText:&quot;text for 5&quot;]]\r\n\r\nfunc randomiseSet (){\r\n        let randomNumber:Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(5))\r\n        //THIS IS THE BIT I GOT STUCK AT\r\n        myImage.image = UIImage(named: randomSet[randomNumber])\r\n        myText.text = randomSet[randomNumber]\r\n        //END\r\n    }\r\n\r\n@IBAction func showRandomSet(_ sender: UIButton) {\r\n        randomiseSet()\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI also tried instead of using myImage.image = .... myText.text = ....\r\n```swift\r\nreturn randomSet[[randomNumber]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth didn&#39;t work and showed &#39;Build Failed&#39;\r\n \r\n\r\nI have also investigated using CoreData but I&#39;m a noob and that opens another can of worm for me regarding binary data for images vs using URL due to image size etc.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion on what&#39;s the best way to fix the above is much appreciated.

In addition if the input is a vowel you need to write &quot;ub&quot; out first, except where the previous character was also a vowel.\r\n\r\nOne thing which is going to be handy is to be able to identify vowels.  Starting by writing a function for this is a good idea.  It could look like:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate boolean isVowel(char c) {\r\n    \t\treturn\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;a&#39; || c == &#39;A&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;e&#39; || c == &#39;E&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;i&#39; || c == &#39;I&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;o&#39; || c == &#39;O&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;u&#39; || c == &#39;U&#39;;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nNow that&#39;s in place if you look at the translation, we want to step over every character in the input and write it to the output.   This could look like this:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n                // some extra stuff needed here\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nFor the extra stuff you need to know if the current character is a vowel and whether the previous character was a vowel so we can add a little to do this:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \t\tboolean wasLastCharacterVowel = false;  // \r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\tif(isVowel(c)) {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = true;\r\n    \t\t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nAnd finally to ad &quot;ub&quot; where required you can check if the character is a vowel and whether the last character was a vowel:\r\n\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \t\tboolean wasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\tif(isVowel(c)) {\r\n    \t\t\t\tif(!wasLastCharacterVowel) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\ttranslated += &quot;ub&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = true;\r\n    \t\t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nWith that in place you just need to hook up the button press action etc.  So it might look a little like this:\r\n\r\n    public class UbbiDubbi {\r\n    \t\r\n    \tprivate boolean isVowel(char c) {\r\n    \t\treturn\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;a&#39; || c == &#39;A&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;e&#39; || c == &#39;E&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;i&#39; || c == &#39;I&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;o&#39; || c == &#39;O&#39; ||\r\n    \t\t\tc == &#39;u&#39; || c == &#39;U&#39;;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \tprivate String translate(String raw) {\r\n    \t\tString translated = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \t\tboolean wasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tfor(char c:raw.toCharArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\tif(isVowel(c)) {\r\n    \t\t\t\tif(!wasLastCharacterVowel) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\ttranslated += &quot;ub&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = true;\r\n    \t\t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\t\twasLastCharacterVowel = false;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\ttranslated += c;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn translated;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic void buttonPressed() {\r\n\t\t    String userInput = &quot;&quot;;// = input.getText();\r\n\t        Scanner words = new Scanner( userInput );\r\n\t        while (words.hasNext()) {\r\n    \t        String lowerCase = words.next().toLowerCase();\r\n\t            String translated = translate(lowerCase);\r\n\t            System.out.println(translated);\r\n\t        }\r\n    \t    words.close();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String...none) {\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(new UbbiDubbi().translate(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy aadvark&quot;));\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nadding the main method gives an easy way to test out the translation.  Hope this helps.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421701/creating-an-ubbi-dubbi-translator-in-java/58423643#58423643","title":"Creating an Ubbi Dubbi translator in Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12229061,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rKFmPHkUPUo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rePb2hUNMqwASqwPlaM33FQ9Bf_2Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brooke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12229061/brooke"},"last_editor":{"reputation":65,"user_id":8383744,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cad9d89972b1591bbe384f23a88b51d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C2H50H","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8383744/c2h50h"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571284892,"creation_date":1571259938,"last_edit_date":1571260776,"question_id":58421701,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421701","body_markdown":"I&#39;m in an entry java class, and for one of my programs I am expected to create a ubbi dubbi translator, which ads a ub before every vowel and vowel cluster.

Each year, we want to do something at certain days, and mark these days on the timeline. Similar to a Gant char, but the difference is that periods can have gaps in between. This means for instance there is an activity from 13. to 20. April, and the next one from 1. to 8. May of the same year. In the MWE below I am only using a time period from 1. January 2000 to 28. February 2000, for simplicity:\r\n\r\n    library(data.table)\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    x &lt;- seq(as.Date(&quot;2000/01/01&quot;),\r\n             as.Date(&quot;2000/02/28&quot;), &quot;day&quot;)\r\n    y &lt;- x\r\n    y[c(3,6,8,9,34:43,50:59)] &lt;- NA\r\n    x[c(1,2,3,12:33,44:58)] &lt;- NA\r\n    timetable &lt;- data.table(Year=c(rep(&quot;Year_1&quot;,59),rep(&quot;Year_2&quot;,59)),\r\n    date=c(x,y))\r\n\r\nHow can I create a timetable which illustrates the activities in form of rectangular shapes?

The first way is using the Angular Animation. The second way is the Native Page Transitions plugin.\r\n\r\nFor the Angular animations, follow the the steps below. You can also check [this tutorial][1]:\r\n\r\n 1. Import the `BrowserAnimationsModule`.\r\n\r\n        import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from &#39;@angular/platform-browser/animations&#39;;\r\n        \r\n        imports: [\r\n            BrowserAnimationsModule, \r\n            BrowserModule,\r\n            AppRoutingModule\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n 2. Wrap the Router Outlet\r\n\r\n         import { slider } from &#39;./route-animation.ts&#39;;\r\n\r\n        @Component({\r\n          selector: &#39;app-root&#39;,\r\n          animations: [ slider ]\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        prepareRoute(outlet: RouterOutlet) {\r\n          return outlet &amp;&amp; outlet.activatedRouteData &amp;&amp; outlet.activatedRouteData[&#39;animation&#39;];\r\n        }\r\n 3. Create route-animation.ts file\r\n\r\n        export const slider =\r\n          trigger(&#39;routeAnimations&#39;, [\r\n            transition(&#39;* &lt;=&gt; *&#39;, [\r\n              query(&#39;:enter, :leave&#39;, [\r\n                style({\r\n                  position: &#39;absolute&#39;,\r\n                  top: 0,\r\n                  left: 0,\r\n                  width: &#39;100%&#39;\r\n                })\r\n              ], { optional: true }),\r\n              query(&#39;:enter&#39;, [\r\n                style({ left: &#39;-100%&#39;})\r\n              ]),\r\n              group([\r\n                query(&#39;:leave&#39;, [\r\n                  animate(&#39;600ms ease&#39;, style({ left: &#39;100%&#39;}))\r\n                ], { optional: true }),\r\n                query(&#39;:enter&#39;, [\r\n                  animate(&#39;600ms ease&#39;, style({ left: &#39;0%&#39;}))\r\n                ])\r\n              ]),\r\n              // Normalize the page style... Might not be necessary\r\n\r\n              // Required only if you have child animations on the page\r\n              // query(&#39;:leave&#39;, animateChild()),\r\n              // query(&#39;:enter&#39;, animateChild()),\r\n          ]),\r\n        ]);\r\n\r\n**Using Native Page Transitions**\r\n\r\nYou can also use the [Native Page Transitions][2] plugin also. Even though it is not maintainable right now, but you can give it a try if you want.\r\n\r\nNot sure why it didn&#39;t work with you, but please make sure doing these steps:\r\n\r\n 1. Install the plugin: `ionic cordova plugin add com.telerik.plugins.nativepagetransitions` and `npm install @ionic-native/native-page-transitions`\r\n 2.

Error &quot;... only primitive type, String, Class, annotation, enumeration are permitted or 1-dimensional arrays thereof&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI was thinking about using a `String` in such annotation (instead of the `Object` I wanted to use) then code some `deserialize()` method to parse the string and retrieve the value, but it seems like an overkill (if there are nicer ways) and cannot be checked at compile time (e.g. `@DefaultValue(&quot;toto&quot;) private int member;` would compile but is broken).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

If a read error occurs, or end of file is reached before any data is read, EOF is returned. \r\n\r\nSo, as others have said, the following while loop will not stop at a newline character.

The domain has its `DMARC` entry properly configured, it passes all the test of MXToolbox, according to MXToolbox the domain is all OK.\r\n\r\nI checked all the apps running in the domain and I found that one of them, in PhP, was using `PhPMailer` to send emails and the DMARC policy was set to quarantine.

I&#39;m thinking I can&#39;t use MapPath?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421613/displaying-list-of-files-in-a-folder-with-links","title":"Displaying List of Files in a Folder with

Get rid of `response.getStatusCode() / 100 == 2`. Write `response.getStatusCode() == 200` or `response.getStatusCode() == HttpStatus.SC_OK` instead.\r\n\r\n2. Remove the `else` branch and `throw` after the `if` statement.\r\n3. Rename the method to `getExceptionByStatusCode` or `generateExceptionForStatusCode`. You don&#39;t `handleException`, you decide which one to throw.\r\n\r\n4. Choose the right return type. Don&#39;t use `RuntimeException`. It can be `ResponseStatusException` or any other type appropriate to the HTTP/your domain abstraction.\r\n\r\n5. For each case, decide what type you want to return. Again, not `RuntimeException`.\r\n\r\nA bit improved version would be\r\n\r\n    private String handleResponse(HttpResponse response) {\r\n        final int statusCode = response.getStatusCode();\r\n    \r\n        if (statusCode == HttpStatus.SC_OK) {\r\n            return response.getEntity().toString();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        throw getExceptionByStatusCode(statusCode);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private MyDomainHTTPException getExceptionByStatusCode(int statusCode) {\r\n        switch (statusCode) {\r\n            case HttpStatus.SC_NOT_FOUND:\r\n                return new MyDomainHTTPException(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n            case HttpStatus.SC_UNAUTHORIZED:\r\n                return new MyDomainHTTPException(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n            default:\r\n                return new MyDomainHTTPException(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat said, returning an exception in Java doesn&#39;t *feel* right. \r\n\r\nIt works fine but it doesn&#39;t seem absolutely correct because of the &quot;special&quot; status of exceptions. It can be justifiable when there is lazy evaluation,  and you will be throwing the exception when you meet a certain condition in the future, or in cases with `Optional.orElseThrow`.\r\n\r\nIt might be confusing to some people who got used to the `throw new` template and never thought that returning an exception is a compilable option.\r\n\r\nIn large frameworks (Spring, PrimeFaces - if my memory serves me correctly), I saw exception factories used to compose exceptions based on the given context and rules. They definitely employ exceptions more extensively than we do.

best way to convey the additional information is going to entirely depend on who or what is consuming it. Formatting the output for a human is going to be different than massaging the output for further programmatic analysis or manipulation.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the dynamic column option in your first example only works in scenarios when the possible number of columns is very small. And even then, it&#39;s still a bit messy to work with both programmatically and understand visually.\r\n\r\nThe second option is a more human readable version of the output you already have. But the way to make it look like that basically turns it into plain text that you can&#39;t do any further work on.\r\n\r\nMy preferred option is usually a variation on the second option. Instead of trying to omit the Name/Extension data from subsequent skill rows, just duplicate it. So Kylo&#39;s original entry with two skills becomes two different Kylo entries each with a different skill. This known in database-world as denormalization.\r\n\r\nWithin your foreach loop, you&#39;re going to have a sub-loop that iterates over the collection of skills and then outputs an object for each skill rather than just one for the individual `$resource`. So maybe something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nforeach ($resource in $data) {\r\n    for ($i=0; $i -lt @($resource.skillmap.skillcompetency.skillNameUriPair).Count; $i++) {\r\n        [pscustomobject]@{\r\n            &#39;First Name&#39; = $resource.firstName\r\n            &#39;Last Name&#39; = $resource.lastName\r\n            &#39;Extension&#39; = $resource.extension\r\n            &#39;Skill Group&#39; = $resource.skillmap.skillcompetency.skillNameUriPair[$i].name\r\n            &#39;Skill Level&#39; = $resource.skillmap.skillcompetency.competencelevel[$i]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421590/expanding-an-array-in-an-object/58422002#58422002","title":"Expanding an array in an object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":7092295,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca1b34dd669035e944545e93a60b29e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"D.

The resulting data is put into an object and eventually output to the screen and into a CSV.  The problem is that many users are members of multiple queues and the resulting queue membership data is returned as an array.\r\n\r\nSo this is what my output looks like:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nFirst Name Last Name   Extension Skill Group                              Skill Level\r\n---------- ---------   --------- -----------                              -----------\r\nKylo       Ren\t\t   1234      {Sales Support, Customer Service} \t\t  {8, 8}\r\nFlip       Zimmerman   4321      {Accounting, Marketing} \t\t          {5, 3}\r\nClyde      Logan\t   1122      {Sales Support, Customer Service} \t\t  {4, 9}\r\nRonnie     Peterson    2211      {Sales Support, Customer Service,Claims} {4, 9, 1}\r\nAdam       Sackler     1212      Engineering                              2\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see the &quot;Skill Group&quot; and &quot;Skill Level&quot; columns are represented as arrays and the CSV that&#39;s saved just has `System.Object[]` for the cell which is obviously just saying that the cell contains an array.  However if the user is a member of only one skill group then the returned data will be a normal string, like Adam Sackler in the above list.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I&#39;m struggling with is that I don&#39;t know how the data should be displayed?  Some suggestions from you fine folks would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nFor instance should I dynamically create columns for each skill group and associated skill level?  What happens when a user has fewer, or more, columns than what&#39;s already there?\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nFirst Name Last Name   Extension Skill Group 1 Skill Level 1 Skill Group 2 \t  Skill Level 2\r\n---------- ---------   --------- ------------- ------------- -------------    -------------\r\nKylo       Ren\t\t   1234      Sales Support 8\t\t\t Customer Service 8\r\nFlip       Zimmerman   4321      Accounting\t   5\t\t     Marketing        3\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nOr should each additional skill group and skill level be on a new line?  Should additional skill group/level be on its own row or just use a carriage return in the cell?\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nFirst Name Last Name   Extension Skill Group      Skill Level\r\n---------- ---------   --------- -----------      -----------\r\nKylo       Ren\t\t   1234      Sales Support\t  8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Customer Service 4\r\nFlip       Zimmerman   4321      Accounting\t\t  5\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Marketing\t\t  3\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nIn any case, here&#39;s the relevant code that&#39;s creating the object with the arrays:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[xml]$resourceCsqInfo = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uccxServerBaseUrl&quot;resource?csqid=&quot;$($csq.id) -Method Get -Headers @{Authorization=(&quot;Basic {0}&quot; -f $base64AuthInfo)}\r\n\r\n[object]$data = $resourceCsqInfo.resources.resource\r\n\r\nforeach ($resource in $data) {\r\n    $outputList += New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{\r\n        &quot;First Name&quot;

So for example a connection to MySql and to SQLIte-DB.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421577/two-pdo-db-connections-for-two-different-mysql-servers-in-the-same-script/58426356#58426356","title":"Two PDO DB connections for two different MySQL servers in the same script"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11352130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38dc0b9cfe582ae93c4dce50ffbb6736?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"WildWilly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11352130/wildwilly"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1571294837,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571295268,"creation_date":1571259302,"last_edit_date":1571259698,"question_id":58421577,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421577","body_markdown":"Until now I used one MySQL server to which I was connection through including the following code from a file like i.e. pdo-config.php\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n$host = &#39;server&#39;;\r\n$db   = &#39;db&#39;;\r\n$user = &#39;user&#39;;\r\n$pass = &#39;pass&#39;;\r\n$charset = &#39;utf8mb4&#39;;\r\n\r\n$dsn = &quot;mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db;charset=$charset&quot;;\r\n$options = [\r\n    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE            =&gt;

Let&#39;s say first array(table_1) dimension is 30 so i need to put: diff1-diff30?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421575/how-can-i-loop-through-observations-and-values-in-the-dataset/58439092#58439092","title":"How can I loop through observations and values in the dataset?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10099944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00f53f902f29401ddbb1ce3f918a97e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Muska","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10099944/muska"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58424281,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571433914,"creation_date":1571259295,"question_id":58421575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58421575","body_markdown":"I need to loop through a dataset (built-in, training SAS table with data) and do some calculations based on it. First off, I don&#39;t know how I could loop through values in range of columns of the table. Second, need to loop through all values in every observation and calculate difference between previous and following value. Here is the example of a table:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAuto   Price1  Price2  Price3 \r\nMazda  35.000  40.500  38.000\r\nAudi   70.000  60.000  80.000\r\nBMW    110.000 85.000  93.000\r\n```\r\nLet&#39;s say my table is named Prices in SAS. I tried below but I know it&#39;s totally wrong. I have no idea how to start:\r\n\r\n```sas\r\ndata data.Prices;\r\n\r\nset myDataset.Prices;\r\ndo price_prev = Price1;\r\n\tdo price_next = Price2;\r\n\r\n\tend;\r\n\tend;\r\n\r\n\tresult = price_next-price_prev;\r\n run;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDesired output should be as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAuto   Diff1   Diff2    Diff3 \r\nMazda  0       5.500    -2.500\r\nAudi   0       -10.000  20.000\r\nBMW    0       -25.000  8.000\r\n```\r\n\r\nI need do use some kind of a loop but don&#39;t know how. Important thing is that I can&#39;t use macros or some other complex synthax.
