Flyway does have a Callback system, but it only works when migrations are run and not when it can&#39;t get a connection from the db.  I am aware of the DataSourceHealthIndicator that SpringBoot provides, but as far as I can tell this only gets run when the Actuator endpoint gets called.  Is there a way to validate the datasource (create a new connection) or force the DataSourceHealthIndicator to be called before Flyway auto-configures?

don&#39;t know whether to make this a comment or an answer.  I think this might come down to a console buffer flushing issue.  It may *seem* like the function is taking more than 5 seconds to finish because it is printing so many console lines, but it&#39;s actually only taking ~2 seconds, runs the timeout and takes ~6 seconds for you to see the end result of all the consoling.  Try removing the `console.log` from the `forEach` and see if you can still produce this issue.\r\n\r\nInstead, of using a variable &quot;long running process&quot; that might not actually be long-running on everone&#39;s computers, let&#39;s create an example that will definitely block the execution thread for a set duration and see if we get the same result.  Let&#39;s also remove the possibility of the console buffer being the issue.\r\n\r\nHere is my example written in **node.js**.  I am not quite sure of how we can reliably block the execution thread in the browser for a set duration.  A lot of effort has gone into preventing exactly that due to its impact on user experience.  One idea might be to make a synchronous AJAX call that times out after the browser default.  In any case, using node we can write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst {execSync} = require(&quot;child_process&quot;);\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Test stack/setTimeout interactions\r\n * @param {Number} [t1=5] Duration of setTimeout in seconds\r\n * @param {Number} [t2=5] System sleep duration in seconds\r\n */\r\nfunction test(t1=5, t2=5) {\r\n     // Get time at start\r\n    const start = Date.now();\r\n\r\n    // Schedule printing of delta\r\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(`Diff: ${Date.now() - start}`;\r\n    }), t1 * 1000);\r\n\r\n    // Synchronously sleep for a duration\r\n    execSync(`sleep ${t2}`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my output matrix:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest(1, 5); // Diff: 5021\r\ntest(5, 1); // Diff: 5002\r\ntest(3, 3); // Diff: 3018\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe inner delta calculating function never runs until the whole execution block is finished.  That&#39;s why you see the diff as the larger of the 2 arguments (multiplied by 1000).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOne way to do a cross-platform blocking example (that&#39;s even simpler than mine) would be to use a `while` block with a `Date.now()` as is done in this question: [setTimeout behaviour with blocking code](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14863022/691711).  In fact, that question might even provide some additional insight on `setTimeout`&#39;s logic with long running processes:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;     console.log(&#39;Before wait&#39;);\r\n&gt;     setTimeout(function () { console.log(&#39;Yo!&#39;); }, 1000);\r\n&gt;     var start = Date.now();\r\n&gt;     while (Date.now() &lt; start + 3000) {}\r\n&gt;     console.log(&#39;After wait&#39;);\r\n\r\nDo bear in mind that you should avoid writing code that blocks the main JavaScript execution thread, **it is always a bad idea**.  If you need to use long-running logic, leverage [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379167/settimeout-call-stack-issue/58380328#58380328","title":"setTimeout call stack issue"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":10126928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4AWG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kexek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10126928/kexek"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571069564,"creation_date":1571064374,"question_id":58379167,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58379167","body_markdown":"I learned about call stack in JS and I tried some code on my own, here is the problem:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst timestamp = Date.now(); // get current timestamp\r\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(Date.now() - timestamp), 2000); // get difference\r\nArray(10000).fill(0).forEach((item, i) =&gt; console.log(i ** 3)); // simulating long-running task\r\n```\r\nThe problem is after I run my code in browser, its take much more time than 2000 ms to log the difference in console, likely 4000-6000 ms, but I have 2000-2300 ms in my console.

The problem is that it never waits the await function to finish before throwing. The awaited function return a promise as well.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am, I have this sample code for my class, note that remoteFs is just a custom module containing my functions to manipulate remote FTP data.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = class processError extends Error {\r\n\r\n    constructor(args) {\r\n        super(args);\r\n        \r\n        this.name = &quot;customError&quot;\r\n        this._folder = &quot;./test/&quot;\r\n        this._credentials = {\r\n                host: &#39;my.host.com&#39;,\r\n                user: &#39;username&#39;,\r\n                password: &#39;passwd123&#39;,\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        return (this._errorProcess());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    async _errorProcess () {\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            // The function below is basic FTP list and should return a promised true/false if the folder exists or not.\r\n            let IsThereFolder = await remoteFs.EntityExist(this._credentials, this._folder)\r\n        } catch (err) {\r\n            throw new Error(&quot;Fatal error in error handler:&quot;, err)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        console.log(&quot;Should I create folder ?&quot;, IsThereFolder )\r\n        return (this);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried several methods to make the constructor wait, like calling _errorProcess from an init() function that would return it after being called from constructor. I also tried to put this function out the class scope but nothing seems to work properly, I always end up having the throwing output before receiving my promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ``` \r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n\r\nEntityExist: function (credentials, toFind) {\r\n        var c = new Client();\r\n        let entityExist = false;\r\n\r\n        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(&quot;CREDENTIALS -&gt;&quot;, credentials)\r\n            c.on(&#39;ready&#39;, function () {\r\n                console.log(&quot;Connection established&quot;);\r\n                c.on(&#39;error&#39;, function (err) {\r\n                    console.log(err);\r\n                    reject(err);\r\n                })\r\n                c.list(toFind, (err, list) =&gt; {\r\n                    if (err) throw err;\r\n\r\n                    for (let i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {\r\n                        if (list[i].name == toFind) { entityExist = true; }\r\n                    }\r\n                    c.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&gt; { resolve(entityExist); })\r\n                    c.end();\r\n                });\r\n            });\r\n            console.log(&quot;Before connect&quot;)\r\n            c.connect(credentials);\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd here is the actual output I get for this execution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREDENTIALS -&gt; { host: &#39;my.host.com&#39;,                                                       \r\n  user: &#39;username&#39;,                                                                                    \r\n  password: &#39;passwd123&#39; }                                                                                  \r\nBefore connect                                                                                          \r\n                                                                                                        \r\nC:\\path_to_project\\includes\\file.js:62 \r\n                        throw new handleError(&quot;Testing custom error: &quot; + err); break;    \r\n                        ^                                                                               \r\n[object Promise]\r\n\r\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\nnpm ERR! errno 1\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, it doesn&#39;t wait for the promise to came back and don&#39;t even reach the &quot;Connection established&quot; log on the EntityExist function (please not that this function works fine in another circonstances).\r\n\r\nActually, I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s possible to perform such things directly from constructor.\r\nI hope the context is clear enough, thanks for your time!

ssh tunnel is a a viable, though sometimes tricky measure to protect a service.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part is that the tunnel might collapse and you have little you can do when this happens, since the tunnel is created outside your application.\r\n\r\nHowever, for MongoDB, it additionally comes with some rather nasty side effects: You would need to fiddle a lot with settings and DNS to get a replica set up and running, let alone sharding.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if you enabled authentication (it is not that hard) and TLS as well as proper security measures and ***then*** bind your MongoDB server to either 0.0.0.0 or the IP address you use to connect to the machine.\r\n\r\n&gt; Side note: Make sure you have a brute force blocker like [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) or [denyhosts](https://github.com/denyhosts/denyhosts) installed, configured to protect MongoDB and ***tested*** if you do so.\r\n\r\nIf the sum of the above seems too complicated, you should think ***VERY*** thoroughly about wether you should not rather use a hosted MongoDB service like [MongoDB Inc&#39;s Atlas][atlas] or [mLab][mlab].\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, here is how you can do it:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ ssh user@linuxhost -N -f -L 27017:127.0.0.1:27017\r\nPassword:\r\n```\r\nEnter the password. The process will get into background, and you can check wether it is still running via\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ ps ax | grep ssh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis opens an ssh tunnel to the remote host, opening the port 27017 (the first port on the machine you run the command on, and tunnels it through the ssh connections to 127.0.0.1 (the localhost adress of the remote host) on port 27017.\r\n\r\nNow, you can simply set `&amp;mgo.DialInfo{Addrs:[]string{&quot;127.0.0.1:27017&quot;}}`\r\n\r\n&gt; **Note**\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; In case it was not clear by now: I ***strongly (!!!)*** advice against using an ssh tunnel. It makes creating a replicaset rather complicated and excludes sharding pretty much. Learn how to ***properly*** manage MongoDB.\r\n[MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com) offers free courses, and they are pretty damn good.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; You. Have. Been.

performs the\r\n&gt; comparison on two objects of the type T.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **2)** *IEquatable&lt;T&gt;* is for an object of type T so that it can compare itself\r\n&gt; to another.\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n&gt; **3)** If there is only one way of testing two instances of T for equality,\r\n&gt; or if one of several methods is preferred One instance of T has\r\n&gt; internal knowledge of how to compare itself to another instance of T.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **4)** On the other hand, if there are several equally reasonable methods of\r\n&gt; comparing two Ts for equality, IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt; would seem more\r\n&gt; appropriate\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **5)** This interface is not meant to be implemented by T itself, but by\r\n&gt; other &quot;external&quot; classes.\r\n\r\nBased on these tips(1-5) and my code, I need to have IEdge be able to compare itself to another.\r\n\r\nAlso there is only one way of testing two instances of T or IEdge for equality.\r\n\r\nSo It seems Implementing IEquatable is the solution.\r\n\r\nBut the **problem** is that HashSets use **GetHashCode** method.\r\n\r\nAnd IEquatable doesn&#39;t force to override GetHashCode method.\r\n\r\nHow can I use IEquatable and in the same time force the developer to override GetHashCode ?!\r\n\r\nIf you prefer using `IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;` or `EqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;` in this case, doesn&#39;t it matter that it has conflict with Tips above ?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Then you select the column you want to perform operations on, here the MaxSpeed. From then we convert the DataFrameGroupby object to a dataframe and specify the name of the new column we are creating (result of groupby operation). The `reset_index()` is not directly usefull here, you can take it off.

Currently [this can be done with activation hooks](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#saving-environment-variables), but in Conda v4.8 you will be able to set it at the commandline with [the `conda env config vars` command](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/master/conda_env/cli/main_vars.py).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379071/how-to-enable-local-code-while-using-a-conda-environment/58402455#58402455","title":"How to enable local code while using a conda environment?"}],"owner":{"reputation":307,"user_id":1289171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NECHx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Schroeder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1289171/schroeder"},"last_editor":{"reputation":29050,"user_id":570918,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/27ce5101af57acecf9a5fe563b6192b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"merv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/570918/merv"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571176345,"creation_date":1571064044,"last_edit_date":1571080873,"question_id":58379071,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58379071","body_markdown":"How do I import local code while using a conda environment?\r\n\r\nI have some code in some location like C:\\Users\\me\\Code\\mycode\\, and that directory is in my path variable.

you could make use of Passport&#39;s [Client Credentials Grant Tokens][1]. From the docs:\r\n\r\n&gt; ## Client Credentials Grant Tokens\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The client credentials grant is suitable for machine-to-machine\r\n&gt; authentication. For example, you might use this grant in a scheduled\r\n&gt; job which is performing maintenance tasks over an API.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Before your application can issue tokens via the client credentials\r\n&gt; grant, you will need to create a client credentials grant client. You\r\n&gt; may do this using the `--client` option of the `passport:client`\r\n&gt; command:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     php artisan passport:client --client\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Next, to use this grant type, you need to add the\r\n&gt; `CheckClientCredentials` middleware to the `$routeMiddleware` property\r\n&gt; of your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     use Laravel\\Passport\\Http\\Middleware\\CheckClientCredentials;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     protected $routeMiddleware = [\r\n&gt;         &#39;client&#39; =&gt; CheckClientCredentials::class,\r\n&gt;     ];\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Then, attach the middleware to a route:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     Route::get(&#39;/orders&#39;, function (Request $request) {\r\n&gt;         ...\r\n&gt;     })-&gt;middleware(&#39;client&#39;);\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; To restrict access to the route to specific scopes you may provide a\r\n&gt; comma-delimited list of the required scopes when attaching the\r\n&gt; `client` middleware to the route:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     Route::get(&#39;/orders&#39;, function (Request $request) {\r\n&gt;         ...\r\n&gt;     })-&gt;middleware(&#39;client:check-status,your-scope&#39;);\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ### Retrieving Tokens\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; To retrieve a token using this grant type, make a request to the\r\n&gt; `oauth/token` endpoint:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     $guzzle = new GuzzleHttp\\Client;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     $response = $guzzle-&gt;post(&#39;http://your-app.com/oauth/token&#39;, [\r\n&gt;         &#39;form_params&#39; =&gt; [\r\n&gt;             &#39;grant_type&#39; =&gt; &#39;client_credentials&#39;,\r\n&gt;             &#39;client_id&#39; =&gt; &#39;client-id&#39;,\r\n&gt;             &#39;client_secret&#39; =&gt; &#39;client-secret&#39;,\r\n&gt;             &#39;scope&#39; =&gt; &#39;your-scope&#39;,\r\n&gt;         ],\r\n&gt;     ]);\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     return json_decode((string) $response-&gt;getBody(), true)[&#39;access_token&#39;];\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://laravel.com/docs/passport#client-credentials-grant-tokens\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379061/laravel-passport-without-oauth/58379352#58379352","title":"Laravel Passport without oAuth"}],"owner":{"reputation":1508,"user_id":936965,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEcAb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheatreOfSouls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/936965/theatreofsouls"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1508,"user_id":936965,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEcAb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheatreOfSouls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/936965/theatreofsouls"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58379352,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571065053,"creation_date":1571064014,"last_edit_date":1571064391,"question_id":58379061,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58379061","body_markdown":"I want to use laravel passport to secure my api calls.

Those dlls are in different directories : Nuget restore directory, Reference Assemblies or any other code dll. \r\n\r\nOn the server, we are using VS 2017. \r\n\r\nNow the thing is this started happening when I migrated the project to PackageReferences. We never had any issues with Access Denied before that. And this is exactly the same code base with the same build infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried to do : \r\n\r\n- I tried to check with the process monitor but there is no &quot;access denied&quot; entry there. I could see that it was read correctly\r\n- Just to be safe I installed the agent on my local machine to see if it&#39;s not the build machine problem, and it did happen there as well\r\n- This does not happen when we build locally with MSBuild nor visual studio\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be appreciated. \r\nAt least to point to the direction of the solution.\r\n\r\n[Update]\r\n\r\nWe actually had 3 whole days w/o the issue happening on the server and now it&#39;s back. \r\n\r\nWe also &quot;managed&quot; to get it once while building locally with msbuild(PS script). From the look of that local build and the next one ( passing one triggered right after), we managed to see that nuget was downloading packages that were successfully downloaded in the previous(failed) build. We do not observe that behaviour with consecutive passing builds. Nuget does not download new packages each time unless cleaned.\r\n\r\n[Update2]\r\nDebug log file for Nuget restore step and build step.\r\n\r\n[gdrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JjDeC07rGOIVDV9fObn0abiPc9XFaC_B )\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nM ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379001/migration-from-packages-config-to-packagereferences-causes-could-not-load-file-o","title":"Migration from packages.config to PackageReferences causes Could not load file or assembly &quot;...&quot; or one of its dependencies.
