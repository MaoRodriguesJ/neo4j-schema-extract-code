something like this:\r\n\r\nWhen you use `range.getValues()` you get a two dimensional array [][] or an array of arrays.  In this case `vA[0][0]` is the value in `B15` and `vA[1][0]` is the value in `B16`.  So the first index is for the rows and the second is for the columns although the arrays start with zero and row and columns start with one.  \r\n\r\nThere is not a `range.clearContents(p)` function so I assumed you wanted to delete that row.  `vA[0]` is actually row 15 so that&#39;s why the 15 in `sh.deleteRow(i+15-d++);` and the d just keeps track of how many rows have been deleted.  I didn&#39;t see much sense in sorting during the for loop because that would potentially mess all the rows up so I waited until after the for loop was completed.  This may not be what your after...we can discuss that further.\r\n\r\n    function ResetCompletedOnly() {\r\n      var sh=SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheetByName(&#39;WITH RESET&#39;);\r\n      var rg=sh.getRange(&#39;B15:P51&#39;);\r\n      var vA=rg.getValues();\r\n      var d=0;\r\n      for(var i=0;i&lt;vA.length;i++) {\r\n        if(vA[i][8]==1){//column J\r\n          sh.deleteRow(i+15-d++);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      rg.sort({column:3,ascending:true});//column C\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n[Sheet.clearContents](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet#clearContents())\r\n\r\n[Range.getValues()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#getValues()) \r\n\r\n[Sheet.deleteRow()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet#deleteRow(Integer))\r\n\r\n[Range.sort()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#sort(Object))\r\n\r\n&gt;This is probably not the exact answer that your looking for but hopefully it will help you to learn a little more about Google Apps Script in order to get the results that you need.\r\n\r\nYou did an excellent job in creating your question although a bit more research in to the Google Apps Script [documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/) would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t really test this without your example spreadsheet but I think this will clear all of the row cells that don&#39;t have formulas.

Ideally once the sale has been paid out, there is no further action required by the sales rep, so it&#39;s ok to clear this data. \r\n\r\nCLEARING rather than DELETING is crucial due to the formatting and the constant daily reuse/refresh of the sales tracker. \r\n\r\nThe folks I&#39;m making this tracker for are very computer challenged (Copy Paste is a difficult concept for them) and so it needs to be simple, easy, and clean for them to use continuously. \r\n\r\n[AFTER HITTING RESET][3](img) only the rows which were paid out and required no further action from the sales person have been cleared. Afterwards, the remaining rows were then sorted according the date they were first entered into the sheet so that the oldest and most pressing is always at the top. \r\n\r\nSorry for the delay in the update, it&#39;s been a crazy week and I wanted to make sure I tinkered with all the suggestions first before posting the update. I&#39;m still digging into the tutorials and information given but am struggling a little to fully grasp the scripting language and what I&#39;m trying to ask the script to do.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU

Can `CLOSE` and `DEALLOCATE` throw an exception in this specific case?\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t see how either one could throw an error in any case. They simply release the resources. It would certainly be possible that down-stream operations that are expecting the cursor to exist can error if the cursor has been closed or deallocated (depending on what was expected)\r\n\r\n&gt; Should I remove the `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statement in the `CATCH` block? Is the transaction automatically rolled-back when an exception is thrown?\r\n\r\nNo, don&#39;t remove the `ROLLBACK`. You will need that no matter what, although that is something that is usually wrapped in a test for `IF (@@TRANCOUNT &gt; 0)`.\r\n\r\nIf `XACT_ABORT` is `OFF` (the default) then the transaction could likely still be open so you will need to do the `ROLLBACK`. If `XACT_ABORT` is `ON`, then the transaction is already rolled-back, BUT the transaction is also in an uncommittable state at which point the only thing you can do is issue a `ROLLBACK`. So, either way, you need the `ROLLBACK`.\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there any way to avoid the duplicate `CLOSE` and `DEALLOCATE` statements in this piece of code?\r\n\r\nNo, not really. BUT, you _could_ get away with only having the `DEALLOCATE` statement as it will close the cursor first. (see example below)\r\n\r\n&gt; Does using a variable really automatically close and deallocate the cursor?\r\n\r\nNot sure about the variable, but I do know that it isn&#39;t necessary. All you need is for the cursor to be `LOCAL` (which you are already doing) and it will automatically deallocate at the end of the batch. (see example below)\r\n\r\n&gt; If it really works, why call `CLOSE` at all on a local cursor that is only referenced once?\r\n\r\nProbably because most people aren&#39;t aware that local cursors are automatically deallocated at the end of the batch (I didn&#39;t until I did the test so that I could answer this question), _and_ the default scope for cursors (unless changed at the DB level and I doubt most people mess with that setting, not knowing how it will impact built-in stored procedures) is `GLOBAL`, so they did need to be deallocate them.\r\n\r\nThe following tests show the difference between `LOCAL` and `GLOBAL` (default on most systems) cursors, and that `DEALLOCATE` by itself is just fine (assuming you don&#39;t need to re-run the cursor query again):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDECLARE myLocalCursor CURSOR LOCAL STATIC FORWARD_ONLY READ_ONLY FOR\r\nSELECT TOP (10) [object_id] FROM sys.objects;\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;DECLARE (local)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- 1 row\r\nGO\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;NEXT BATCH (local)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- no rows\r\n\r\nDECLARE myGlobalCursor CURSOR GLOBAL STATIC FORWARD_ONLY READ_ONLY FOR\r\nSELECT TOP (10) [object_id] FROM sys.objects;\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;DECLARE (global)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- 1 row\r\nGO\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;NEXT BATCH (global)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- 1 row (same cursor_id as previous SELECT)\r\n\r\nDEALLOCATE myGlobalCursor;\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;DEALLOCATE (global)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- no rows\r\nGO\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n```sql\r\n-- open cursor then deallocate (do not close first):\r\nDECLARE CursorToDeallocate CURSOR GLOBAL STATIC FORWARD_ONLY READ_ONLY FOR\r\nSELECT TOP (10) [object_id] FROM sys.objects;\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;DECLARE (global2)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- 1 row\r\n\r\nOPEN CursorToDeallocate;\r\nSELECT &#39;OPEN (global2)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- 1 row\r\n\r\nDEALLOCATE CursorToDeallocate;\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;DEALLOCATE (global2)&#39; AS [Step], @@CURSOR_ROWS AS [Rows], *\r\nFROM   sys.dm_exec_cursors(@@SPID);\r\n-- no rows\r\nGO\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom your [documentation issue][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Do you have to call `CLOSE` and then `DEALLOCATE`? Is there an automatic mechanism that does this?\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, yes, you `CLOSE` first which keeps the cursor allocated, and then you can `DEALLOCATE`. If you call `DEALLOCATE` first, then the cursor is automatically closed. By merely closing a cursor, it is still defined and can be re-run simply by executing `OPEN` on it again (no need to re-declare it).\r\n\r\nRegarding automatically `CLOSE` or `DEALLOCATE`:\r\n\r\n1. A `LOCAL` cursor is automatically closed and deallocated when the batch ends\r\n1. Please see [SET CURSOR_CLOSE_ON_COMMIT][2]\r\n\r\n&gt; Can you provide information what `DEALLOCATE` actually does internally?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, `DEALLOCATE` just de-lists the cursor definition from `sys.dm_exec_cursors` (well, wherever that data is stored). And, of course, closes the cursor if it&#39;s not already closed (at least in the sense that no cursor means that there is no cursor to be either open or closed, or maintain any locks or any resources; to be fair, this merely describes the end-result, not the path that the code took to get there, so I can&#39;t say technically if `DEALLOCATE` actually _calls_ `CLOSE` or merely duplicates some functionality handled by `CLOSE`, nor am I sure if that distinction even matters to anyone outside of someone who would be maintaining that code).\r\n\r\n\r\nI did some testing and found that both `DEALLOCATE` by itself and `CLOSE` have the same effect: the &quot;CURSOR&quot;-based locks on the table are removed. I found no evidence of `DEALLOCATE` by itself leaving any locks in place. I tested with a sensitive / scrollable cursor with `SCROLL_LOCKS` enabled in a transaction while doing an `UPDATE ... WHERE CURRENT OF Cursor`. Each `FETCH` took an `IU` lock on the page, a `U` lock on the key, &amp; an `IX` lock on the table, all with a lock owner type of `CURSOR`. The `UPDATE` itself duplicated those 3 locks with `TRANSACTION` as the owner type (well, minor differences in the Page and Key lock-types). After either `DEALLOCATE` or `CLOSE`, only the transaction locks remained. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sql-docs/issues/2987\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-cursor-close-on-commit-transact-sql","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57952068/close-and-deallocate-cursor-and-try-catch-in-tsql/57986098#57986098","title":"Close and Deallocate Cursor and Try-Catch in TSQL"}],"owner":{"reputation":3080,"user_id":1560623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYAbK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"feO2x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1560623/feo2x"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3080,"user_id":1560623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYAbK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"feO2x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1560623/feo2x"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":83,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57986098,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568872479,"creation_date":1568618421,"last_edit_date":1568623163,"question_id":57952068,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57952068","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing a stored procedure in TSQL which uses a transaction and a cursor.

This program internally loads several (30 ish) WebBrowser objects and shows one at a time in a panel depending on the user&#39;s input. After some use (non deterministic), the program closes itself.\r\n\r\nThe only hint I have about why it&#39;s closing itself is reported by Visual Studio 2013, which tells me that the program finished with code -1073740791 (0xc0000409). No more hints about why or where this behaviour happens.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve done some research and I&#39;ve found [this][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; The clue to the problem is in the exception code: 0xc0000409\r\n\r\n&gt; **0xc0000409** means **STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN**.\r\n\r\n&gt; In other words, something in your program is writing past the current stack frame, corrupting data on the stack. The program has detected this and rather than let it continue, has thrown an exception.\r\n\r\nOther sources, like [this one][2] say:\r\n\r\n&gt; **Exception Code 0xc0000409 Error** Codes are caused in one way or another by misconfigured system files in your windows operating system.\r\n\r\nWhich I suspect is pointing me in the wrong direction, because the problem I&#39;m describing only happens in my program.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to fix this issue or at least to have a more precise diagnostic about this bug?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I&#39;ve been doing more research. [The official documentation][3] says the following about WebBrowser:\r\n\r\n&gt; The **WebBrowser** control is resource-intensive. Be sure to call the **Dispose()** method when you are finished using the control to ensure that all resources are released in a timely fashion. You must call the **Dispose()** method on the same thread that attached the events, which should always be the message or user-interface (UI) thread.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also found [this question][4].

If I understand right, you then wish to call back into Alexa and set up a reminder for a time and date. I have not tried this, (but may do so for my Alexa+Watson demos), but expect you would need to call out via a cloud function or AWS lambda to the [Alexa Reminders API][1] and then understand the response from this call out, and then return a message back to Alexa. &lt;br/&gt;\r\nHope this answers your question. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/alexa-reminders-api-reference.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951966/how-to-set-day-and-time-reminder-in-alexa-using-ibm-watson-assistant/58318781#58318781","title":"How to set day and time reminder in Alexa using IBM Watson Assistant?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11394804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qPf47qjGM1M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAG4/oVmEfplnvHc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vivek Chauhan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11394804/vivek-chauhan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2059,"user_id":4479165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fb7faf1344075e6252156358b64e539?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theduck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4479165/theduck"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570696837,"creation_date":1568617938,"last_edit_date":1568621724,"question_id":57951966,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57951966","body_markdown":"How to set reminder for day(Weekdays like Monday, Tuesday etc..) and time  in Alexa using IBM Watson Assistant? I am able to set date and time in IBM Watson Assistant using system entities like `@sys-date` and `@sys-time`.The context variables like `$day` and `$time` have been used to fetch and store the data.

Setting the reminder for day and time in Alexa using IBM Watson assistant. \r\n2. If reminder already exists then Alexa must be able to tell that.

+ &quot;image/jpeg&quot; + &quot;;&quot; + &quot;base64&quot; + &quot;,&quot; + response.data.replace(/-/g, `+`).replace(/_/g, `/`)\r\n    // replace the src of the image with the new src \r\n    thisImg.attr({&quot;src&quot;:newSrc});\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/attachments/get\r\n  [2]: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/attachments#resource","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951953/how-do-i-display-inline-images-and-attachments-from-gmail-api-in-html-last-pa/57988663#57988663","title":"How do I display Inline images and Attachments from Gmail API in HTML -- Last part of the puzzle"}],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":4391416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a07fe693ff41f7bf26a5926dbfc74f3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cydb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4391416/cydb"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57988663,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568796459,"creation_date":1568617845,"question_id":57951953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57951953","body_markdown":"I have a &#39;message&#39;

It produces class names same as attribute names.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951918/wrong-type-hints-when-the-attribute-name-is-the-same-as-the-class-name","title":"Wrong type hints when the attribute name is the same as the class name"},{"tags":["postgresql","amazon-ec2","apache-kafka-connect"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":8002010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6796fea327cab9ac13e660bf3a9b67b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rvl007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8002010/rvl007"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568635257,"post_id":57956297,"comment_id":102324677,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951915/connect-to-remote-postgres-server-from-ec2-instance/57956297#comment102324677_57956297"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":11980498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/607853669a1672a561f285d7120ab703?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BlueIris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11980498/blueiris"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568634846,"creation_date":1568634846,"answer_id":57956297,"question_id":57951915,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57956297","body_markdown":"Looks like error is in the pg_hba.conf.

It Debugs the release build fine but doesn&#39;t apply those changes to\r\n&gt; .exe file.\r\n\r\nWhen you debug the project, `VS debug engine will try to fetch the output project.exe and project.pdb for debugging`. So if the debugging works well(those changes being applied), the output project.exe should also work without any issues(changes applied).\r\n\r\nSee this(for C++, similar situation with C#, VB):\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThis error message comes when VS debug engine can&#39;t find the output .exe, that&#39;s why I say if the changes are applied during debugging, it actually indicates the changes have been applied to your .exe file.\r\n\r\nLet me name the project which outputs the .exe ProjectA, other projects in your solution are B,C,D. Here are two directions you can check:\r\n\r\nIf the code changes you mean is **in Project A**:\r\n\r\n1. Right click project A in Solution Explorer=&gt;Properties, check the value of your `Output Directory`(C++) or `Output path in build tab`(C#), it represents where the output .exe will actually exist, and VS debug engine will fetch the .exe in this path.\r\n\r\nSo make sure you tested the .exe in this path instead of old versions from other locations.\r\n\r\nIf the code changes you mean is **in B,C,D**, and A depends on B,C,D:\r\n\r\n1. In most of the time VS will help copy the assemblies from B,C,D into A&#39;s bin folder, but I&#39;m not sure if something&#39;s wrong with your environment which breaks this. You should make sure all the assemblies in your bin folder are **updated**.\r\n\r\nI think this issue comes from your project instead of IDE(create a new simple project to check if the issue occurs in it). And in which way did you check if the changes are applied? Make sure you use the same way no matter checking during debugging or checking the `.exe`.\r\n\r\n**Updated:** \r\n\r\nAccording to Sandesh, this issue could be resolved by a **clean**(clean \r\n old versions completely) rebuild. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/EWhUa.png\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951868/vs2017-code-changes-not-affecting-exe-file/57966828#57966828","title":"VS2017 code changes not affecting .exe file"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12062876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2713865465303849/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sandesh KS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12062876/sandesh-ks"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2141,"user_id":6334037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/czgV2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user392117","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6334037/user392117"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57966828,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568700187,"creation_date":1568617515,"last_edit_date":1568632305,"question_id":57951868,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57951868","body_markdown":"So I have a problem facing VS code changes. \r\n\r\nWhatever changes I have applied to my solution and built, it is working fine and I can see those changes being applied when I debug. **But** the same changes aren&#39;t applying to the .exe file. \r\n\r\nI have tried release build as well, Same with that.

Because what a return type of `void` essentially means is that you can&#39;t use the return value. And this property is compatible with any function, you just have to ignore whatever it is returning.\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t only affect `Promise&lt;void&gt;` but all return types:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndeclare let voidFunction: (a: number) =&gt; void;\r\ndeclare let promiseFunction: (a: number) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;;\r\ndeclare let numberFunction: (a: number) =&gt; number;\r\ndeclare let stringFunction: (a: number) =&gt; string;\r\ndeclare let undefinedFunction: (a: number) =&gt; undefined;\r\n\r\nvoidFunction = promiseFunction; // no error\r\nvoidFunction = numberFunction; // no error\r\nvoidFunction = stringFunction; // no error\r\nvoidFunction = undefinedFunction; // no error\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, note that the opposite isn&#39;t true:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\npromiseFunction = voidFunction; // error\r\nnumberFunction = voidFunction; // error\r\nstringFunction = voidFunction; // error\r\nundefinedFunction = voidFunction; // error\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think a better solution for your case would actually be to use `undefined` as return type instead of `void`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nundefinedFunction = promiseFunction; // error\r\nundefinedFunction = numberFunction; // error\r\nundefinedFunction = stringFunction; // error\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the issue with this is that when you declare a function with return type `undefined` you actually need to have a `return undefined;` statement, which you probably don&#39;t want.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, I believe `undefined | void` would be a good compromise for a return type:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndeclare let undefinedVoidFunction: (a: number) =&gt; undefined | void;\r\n\r\nundefinedVoidFunction = promiseFunction // error\r\nundefinedVoidFunction = numberFunction // error\r\nundefinedVoidFunction = stringFunction // error\r\n\r\nundefinedVoidFunction = undefinedFunction // no error\r\nundefinedVoidFunction = voidFunction // no error\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#code/CYUwxgNghgTiAEEQBd4DcD2BLYAxArgHZjJYaEBc8AFFFYfgLYBGIMAlPALwB862wANwBYAFChIsBElQAHGBkZYAziALFS5KrXpNWHbnwAKCpaoA8mHDxHjw0OIhTwGLNupJlKNOi71tOXj83GFsJB2lnZWQYLEIAcw9Nbx1g-UC+aNiEsPspJ1QiUAAzOJA8Ik8tH10QjPgikFLCctsxKwqNL254eUUVNUrkwXgAelGXDHg2BRh2gSTurjT3Ia8R8cnpmFn5nEXyHqy4xLXyDYnCKZmMOdEOg8Iexubyx4utm7uxPrNBrsOyweZ0IHy+Ylc+kePWBANBYwm4NExwS0KBCxBYJ2tzELzKnSqT3R+0xCO2u1EuMIJXxaN6pgG7zJSLxLQJyR6kNWcKxFNZbxBRxiJyZmyRYjE4XyMga1Ka+IAahi4dpfFyDEF+cB4AAffg4NqiLVKklwnq-RmCsXYu7G5WEzn+GDQ618uWvYAm9lLeAo05m104ylG92K+0c5Zal2Xa42qk0tleumwh2bK7k25AA)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951850/is-there-not-promise-type-in-typescipt/57952264#57952264","title":"Is there &#39;not promise&#39; type in typescipt?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12072707,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5VUr600CePA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdHrPe_Ypukv3nrDzlnCe2fidCzlQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"nkowne63zf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12072707/nkowne63zf"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57952264,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568619316,"creation_date":1568617438,"question_id":57951850,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57951850","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing TypeScript and want to create something like `Exclude&lt;void, Promise&lt;void&gt;&gt;`, which allows `void` but not allow `Promise&lt;void&gt;`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype A = (a: number) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;\r\ntype B = (a: number) =&gt; void\r\n\r\ndeclare let a: A\r\ndeclare let b: B\r\n// it does not cause type error\r\nb = a\r\n\r\n// what i want to do...\r\n// but it is identical to B\r\ntype C = (a: number) =&gt; Exclude&lt;void, Promise&lt;void&gt;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `Exclude&lt;void,Promise&lt;void&gt;&gt;` seems to be identical to `void`.\r\n\r\nIs there some ways to create type like this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951850/is-there-not-promise-type-in-typescipt","title":"Is there &#39;not promise&#39; type in typescipt?"},{"tags":["firebase","firebase-realtime-database","google-analytics"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12072739,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBWJrxoIXTqjfFbwOJN0tjDxKaYKDU4dLKT4tuhiQ=k-s128","display_name":"Isaiah Bjorklund","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12072739/isaiah-bjorklund"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568617421,"creation_date":1568617421,"question_id":57951847,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57951847","body_markdown":"I am looking to integrate google analytics into our back end and connecting the data to make it easier for our team to see everything.

I followed the advice but it didn&#39;t solve my issue and now I get a host:port error whatever library I try to download. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to cancel the global variable or reset the host:port to the default ?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951821/python-3-7-could-not-install-packages-due-to-an-environmenterror-failed-to-par","title":"Python 3.7 &quot;Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: Failed to parse: host:port"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2746,"user_id":8259345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8b9002c18988cc5820bdb5d9b9c58a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Micka&#235;l Leger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8259345/micka%c3%abl-leger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568617562,"post_id":57951816,"comment_id":102315950,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951816/javascript-replace-word-from-string-with-matching-array-key#comment102315950_57951816"},{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568617771,"post_id":57951816,"comment_id":102316049,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951816/javascript-replace-word-from-string-with-matching-array-key#comment102316049_57951816"},{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568617891,"post_id":57951816,"comment_id":102316104,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951816/javascript-replace-word-from-string-with-matching-array-key#comment102316104_57951816"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12072671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SGegTmAVXOg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd_V4bjTI70k9OKEi8xwVI37wdh6A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Prakash Jadhav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12072671/prakash-jadhav"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568618709,"post_id":57951816,"comment_id":102316482,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951816/javascript-replace-word-from-string-with-matching-array-key#comment102316482_57951816"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12072671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SGegTmAVXOg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd_V4bjTI70k9OKEi8xwVI37wdh6A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Prakash Jadhav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12072671/prakash-jadhav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568618844,"post_id":57951931,"comment_id":102316545,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57951816/javascript-replace-word-from-string-with-matching-array-key/57951931#comment102316545_57951931"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1568749203,"last_edit_date":1568749203,"creation_date":1568617747,"answer_id":57951931,"question_id":57951816,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57951931","body_markdown":"One option is to add word boundaries around every short word you&#39;re matching.
