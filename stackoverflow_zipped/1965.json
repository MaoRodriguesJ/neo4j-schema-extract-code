If so, is it possible to add each bar as a single layer, while retaining the unique coloring scheme defined for each bar? Or there are other reasons for the slow plots and how can I make it more efficient?

This basically means once you&#39;ve created the String it&#39;s in memory, even if you overwrote it, until such time that the garbage collection removes it. This means that a another process can dump memory (before the GC runs) and potentially get your password. With Arrays on the other hand you can go and specifically overwrite the array and no other process will be able to get it. \r\n\r\nWith an array, you can explicitly wipe the data after you&#39;re done with it. You can overwrite the array with anything you like, and the password won&#39;t be present anywhere in the system, even before garbage collection. \r\n\r\nHad a look at [org.apache.http.auth.UsernamePasswordCredentials][1] and the `UsernamePasswordCredentials` only supports `String`. So potentially I would just store the password as a char array as per your security recommendation and then just convert it to String when calling this class. Then if you that paranoid, dispose the class once your done with it and immediately run the GC (this may run up your memory usage). \r\n\r\nAlso, if security is such a serious concern then your administrators should look at other alternatives, such as [disabling core dumps][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://org.apache.http.auth.UsernamePasswordCredentials\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E36387/html/ol_discdp_sec.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074361/using-char-array-instead-of-string/58075242#58075242","title":"Using char array instead of String"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":10996284,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--DbBRLu_8E4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/UAMTZKeWIAo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Madhan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10996284/madhan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58075242,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569310404,"creation_date":1569306963,"question_id":58074361,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58074361","body_markdown":"We have a security recommendation to use char array instead of String while storing password and later clear the char array.

first of all this way will not work as the interpolation considers the value as a string so it will always appear as a text on the screen.\r\n\r\nBy your question what i understand is you want to add HTML inside an already existing element.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way way would be: -\r\n\r\nin your ts give your variable the value that you want to insert so eg.\r\n\r\n    tagName = `&lt;div&gt; Some text inside &lt;/div&gt;`;\r\n\r\nand then in your html you can simply do:-\r\n\r\n    &lt;h1 [innerHTML]=&quot;tagName&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nother way to do this would be to get the reference of the

Your top-level `VStack` has 21 direct subviews: the 10 child `VStack`s, and the 11 `Spacer`s around them.\r\n\r\nThere are various workarounds. If you really need a hard-coded list of subviews, you can use `Group` to make some children indirect:\r\n\r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n        var body: some View {\r\n\r\n            VStack {\r\n                Group {\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 1&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 1&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 2&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 2&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 3&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 3&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                Group {\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 4&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 4&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 5&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 5&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 6&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 6&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                Group {\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 7&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 7&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 8&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 8&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                    Spacer()\r\n                    VStack {\r\n                        Text(&quot;Title 9&quot;)\r\n                        Text(&quot;Text 9&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                Spacer()\r\n                VStack {\r\n                    Text(&quot;Title 10&quot;)\r\n                    Text(&quot;Text 10&quot;)\r\n                }\r\n                Spacer()\r\n            }\r\n            .background(Color.red)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere, the top-level `VStack` has 6 direct children: 3 `Group`, 2 `Spacer`, and 1 `VStack`. Each `Group` also has 6 direct children: 3 `VStack` and 3 `Spacer`. No view has more than 10 direct children.\r\n\r\nA better approach here is to use `ForEach` to generate the children:\r\n\r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n        var body: some View {\r\n\r\n            VStack {\r\n                Spacer()\r\n                ForEach(1 ... 10, id: \\.self) { i in\r\n                    Group {\r\n                        VStack {\r\n                            Text(&quot;Title \\(i)&quot;)\r\n                            Text(&quot;Text \\(i)&quot;)\r\n                        }\r\n                        Spacer()\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            .background(Color.red)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow the top-level `VStack` only has two direct subviews: the first `Spacer` and the `ForEach`. The `ForEach` replicates its subview (the `Group`) as many times as needed.\r\n\r\nWe use the `Group` in this case to allow Swift to infer the type of the `ForEach` body, since the `ForEach` body would otherwise contain two statements (the `VStack` and the `Spacer`) which would prevent Swift from inferring its type.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074225/swiftui-distribute-equally-multiple-vstacks-in-a-vstack-with-spacers/58074553#58074553","title":"SwiftUI: Distribute equally multiple VStacks in a VStack with Spacers"}],"owner":{"reputation":1102,"user_id":1685971,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fa3543d02e2905e8172edb7fa7a2d76?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"FrankZp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1685971/frankzp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58074553,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569307771,"creation_date":1569306328,"question_id":58074225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58074225","body_markdown":"I am trying to build a VStack (container) containing multiple VStacks (element) with each a title and a text.

- Just a random thought after looking at the example you are following.\r\n\r\n - if you are using the aws cli to create the lambda function just\r\n   wondering what is the **--timeout** value that you have given. The example says `--timeout 10` which is 10 sec which is definitely small time span.\r\n\r\n - You can check/change it on the aws console as well and try and increase it to say 10 min i.e. 600 sec (this is just for testing if this is the problem or not later on you can get down to some appropriate value after evaluation).\r\n\r\n - The timeout is optional value while creating via aws cli. Thus the default is 3 seconds.
