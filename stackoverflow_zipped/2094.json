I would still recommend you the upper one.\nMost of the time you will have a lot of data manager classes e.g. a PlayerManager storing your custom player data. You could of course make everything static inside the Manager or make it a singleton, but it&#39;s better to initialize it in the on enable method to allow &#39;/reload&#39; to work properly and because you would probably want to inject the main there too.\nBack to why store the main. If you got your main stored in the command you can e.g. simply do &#39;main.getPlayerManager()&#39; and don&#39;t have to use any static work arounds.\n\nThere is also another way of injecting commands. You could add the command via reflection into the command map, which would not require you to.define the command in the plugin.yml.

You pass the result in meta until the scraping finishes:\r\n```\r\ndef parse(self, response):\r\n    result = response.meta.get(&#39;result&#39;, [])\r\n    for resource in response.xpath(&#39;.//*[@class=&quot;sample&quot;]&#39;):\r\n        result.append(resource.xpath(&quot;text()&quot;).extract_first())\r\n\r\n    nextUrl = response.xpath(&#39;//*[@label=&quot;Next&quot;]/@href&#39;).extract_first()\r\n    meta = {&#39;result&#39;: result}\r\n    if nextUrl:\r\n        absoluteNextUrl = response.urljoin(nextUrl)\r\n        yield Request(url=absoluteNextUrl, callback=self.parse, meta=meta)\r\n    else:\r\n        item = PriceSpiderItem()\r\n        item[&#39;result&#39;] = result\r\n        yield item\r\n```\r\nDepending on how much data you&#39;ll be getting, this can become quite heavy.\r\n\r\n 2. Write a custom item pipeline:\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t pass around the full result-set in meta, but you write an item pipeline that keeps the results in a list and gives the results at the end.\r\n```\r\nclass CombineResultsPipeline(object):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.results = []\r\n\r\n    def process_item(self, item, spider):\r\n        self.results.append(item[&#39;result&#39;])\r\n        return item\r\n    \r\n    def close_spider(self, spider):\r\n        print(f&quot;full result set is {self.results}&quot;)\r\n```\r\nThis is basically like storing the results in a global variable, so might not be exactly what you need either.\r\n\r\n 3. Write to a file/database\r\n\r\nA more memory-efficient option could be to write the results to a file (or to a database), and do some processing on it afterwards to get the results in the format you need. You can do this in an item pipeline ([items to json][1]) or just use Feed Exports for this ([feed exports][2]).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#write-items-to-a-json-file\r\n  [2]: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html#topics-feed-exports","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043009/scrapy-scrape-multiple-pages-and-yield-the-results-in-a-single-array/58046634#58046634","title":"Scrapy: scrape multiple pages and yield the results in a single array"}],"owner":{"reputation":918,"user_id":3655192,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/139659651d4bb908cda0b928fe9a50e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hiroki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3655192/hiroki"},"last_editor":{"reputation":918,"user_id":3655192,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/139659651d4bb908cda0b928fe9a50e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hiroki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3655192/hiroki"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58046634,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569146462,"creation_date":1569090388,"last_edit_date":1569146462,"question_id":58043009,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58043009","body_markdown":"What I&#39;m trying to do is to scrape multiple pages and yield the result in ***a single array***.\r\n\r\nI found [this post][1], which describes how to scrape multiple pages and yield a text from each of the scraped pages.\r\n\r\nI referred to this approach (and modified it a bit), and here&#39;s my spider looks like...\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom scrapy import Request\r\nfrom test_project.items import PriceSpiderItem\r\n\r\nclass RoomsSpider(scrapy.Spider):\r\n    name = &#39;rooms&#39;\r\n    allowed_domains = [&#39;sample.com&#39;]\r\n    start_urls = [&#39;http://sample.com/rooms&#39;]\r\n\r\n    def parse(self, response):\r\n        for resource in response.xpath(&#39;.//*[@class=&quot;sample&quot;]&#39;):\r\n            item = PriceSpiderItem()\r\n            item[&#39;result&#39;] = resource.xpath(&quot;text()&quot;).extract_first()\r\n            yield item\r\n\r\n        nextUrl = response.xpath(&#39;//*[@label=&quot;Next&quot;]/@href&#39;).extract_first()\r\n\r\n        if(nextUrl is not None):\r\n            absoluteNextUrl = response.urljoin(nextUrl)\r\n            yield Request(url=absoluteNextUrl, callback=self.parse)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, with this approach, the result will look like...\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n &quot;items&quot; : [\r\n  {&quot;result&quot;: &quot;blah blah&quot;},\r\n  {&quot;result&quot;: &quot;blah blah blah blah blah&quot;},\r\n  {&quot;result&quot;: &quot;blah blah blah blah&quot;},\r\n  ...\r\n  etc.\r\n  ...\r\n  {&quot;result&quot;: &quot;blah blah blah blah blah&quot;},\r\n  {&quot;result&quot;: &quot;blah blah blah&quot;}\r\n ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not exactly what I&#39;m aiming to yield.

You can use an if-statement to define the direction your code would follow based on conditions.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\nIn **pseudocode**, you can have something like this:\r\n\r\n    if BurgatoryCheckBox.isChecked -&gt; stringbuilder.append(...)\r\n    if SiennaCheckBox.isChecked -&gt; stringbuilder.append(...)\r\n    if BakersCheckBox.isChecked -&gt; stringbuilder.append(...)\r\n\r\nThis way, if BurgatoryCheckBox is not checked, nothing will happen, no StringBuilder appending would take place. The same applies to SiennaCheckBox and BakersCheckBox.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nIn **actual Java code**, your `OnClick` method should look like this:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n        public void onClick(View v) {\r\n\r\n            StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\r\n\r\n            if (BurgatoryCheckBox.isChecked()) { \r\n              stringBuilder.append(BurgatoryCheckBox.getText().toString() +\r\n                    &quot;state is:&quot;+ BurgatoryCheckBox.isChecked() + &quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n           if(SiennaCheckBox.isChecked()) {\r\n              stringBuilder.append(SiennaCheckBox.getText().toString() +\r\n                    &quot;state is:&quot;+ SiennaCheckBox.isChecked() + &quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if(BakersCheckBox.isChecked()) {\r\n              stringBuilder.append(BakersCheckBox.getText().toString() +\r\n                    &quot;state is:&quot;+ BakersCheckBox.isChecked() + &quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            showTextView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\r\n            showTextView.setText(stringBuilder);\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.

am learning Django for the last few months and I face a problem with makemigrations file.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the beginning, I added these models:\r\n\r\n    class Booking(models.Model):\r\n        alias = models.UUIDField(\r\n            primary_key=True,\r\n            default=uuid4,\r\n            editable=False\r\n        )\r\n        seat = models.ForeignKey(Seats, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n        show = models.ForeignKey(Show, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n\r\nAlso, i run makemigrations and migrate, also added some data...\r\n\r\nBut later i found i need to add another field, so i add this field:\r\n\r\n    booked_by = models.ForeignKey(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n\r\nand finally my models is below:\r\n\r\n    class Booking(models.Model):\r\n        alias = models.UUIDField(\r\n            primary_key=True,\r\n            default=uuid4,\r\n            editable=False\r\n        )\r\n        seat = models.ForeignKey(Seats,

successfully `makemigrations` command but when i try to run `python manage.py migrate` command: It throws me an error that i guess you all know what error.\r\n\r\nbut if i run `python manage.py migrate -fake`It works successfull\r\n\r\nThe problem is, when i try to add something from admin templates, it cant add new data and throws me some horrible error and i think you know what kind of error those.\r\n\r\nI need your help me to know, how do you handle this kind of error? how to fix those? how to add new foregin key after run a few makemigrations..\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me to know it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042981/how-to-you-handle-error-during-migration-after-you-add-new-foreign-key","title":"How to you handle error during migration after you add new

The function takes as input a random pattern p, a weights matrix, and a beta value along with the original pattern (in the first iteration the random pattern and the original pattern would be the same.) The function is called recursively so that the output of each iteration is the input of the next iteration, however the original pattern should remain unchanged through all iterations. But, my original pattern changes along with my p(i) pattern which I don&#39;t understand why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne strange thing that this is the case when the initial random pattern and the original pattern are even dissimilar at many indices. If the two are completely (at all indices) different then this would not be the case. However, some exceptions appear here as well which I will explain in the code. Below is the function that executes one update step for the network. \r\n\r\n\r\n    def stochastic_feed(input_pattern, weights, beta, original_pattern):\r\n\r\n        bits = len(input_pattern)\r\n        bias = 0\r\n        new_stoch_pattern = input_pattern\r\n\r\n        random_neuron = int(np.random.choice(range(bits), replace=True))\r\n        for i4 in range(bits):\r\n            bias += weights[random_neuron][i4] * input_pattern[i4]\r\n        probability = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-2 * beta * bias))\r\n\r\nThis is the line where the problem occurs and the original pattern is changed to be the same as new_stoch_pattern which I don&#39;t understand why.\r\n\r\n        np.put(new_stoch_pattern, random_neuron, np.random.choice([1, -1], p=[probability, 1-probability]))\r\n\r\nAnd True is printed out by the console\r\n\r\n        print(np.array_equal(new_stoch_pattern, original_pattern))\r\n\r\n        return new_stoch_pattern\r\n\r\n\r\nfinally, this is how I iterate recursively through the function.\r\nThe pattern to be fed into the function has the shape (1,N). The weights matrix has the shape (N,N) which you can set to random uniform numbers for the sake of this question. \r\n    \r\n    new_pattern = original_pattern\r\n    iter = 1\r\n    while iter1 &lt; 10000:\r\n        new_pattern = \r\n        stochastic_feed(new_pattern, weights, 0, original_pattern)\r\n        all_first_sums.append(first_sum)\r\n        iter1 += 1\r\n\r\nSomething that happens here is that, for example if I do this:\r\n\r\n    new_pattern = -original_pattern \r\n\r\nthen the console will display false. But if write:\r\n    \r\n    new_pattern[:] = -original_pattern[:]\r\n\r\nthen the original pattern is again changed along with the new_pattern. The same applies if:\r\n\r\n    new_pattern[:50] = -original_pattern[:50] \r\n\r\nfor instance. \r\n\r\nI expect the new_pattern to be different than the original pattern which actually is, but the original should remain unchanged whereas this is not the case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042973/why-is-my-constant-variable-being-changed-inside-my-function","title":"Why is my constant variable being changed inside my function?"},{"tags":["javascript","ecmascript-6","filter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":231746,"user_id":1447675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziYmO.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nina Scholz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1447675/nina-scholz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569090526,"post_id":58042972,"comment_id":102486258,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042972/2-level-of-filter-function-not-returns-the-value#comment102486258_58042972"},{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569090617,"post_id":58042972,"comment_id":102486281,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042972/2-level-of-filter-function-not-returns-the-value#comment102486281_58042972"},{"owner":{"reputation":4488,"user_id":2924577,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c499286ca761a5b21f3744ca229dffb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikhil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2924577/nikhil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569092542,"post_id":58042972,"comment_id":102486774,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042972/2-level-of-filter-function-not-returns-the-value#comment102486774_58042972"},{"owner":{"reputation":6197,"user_id":218349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abb2f595ca653f4b91bbdc0329000a04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"3gwebtrain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/218349/3gwebtrain"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569115169,"post_id":58042972,"comment_id":102490416,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042972/2-level-of-filter-function-not-returns-the-value#comment102490416_58042972"},{"owner":{"reputation":4488,"user_id":2924577,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c499286ca761a5b21f3744ca229dffb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikhil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2924577/nikhil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569198836,"post_id":58042972,"comment_id":102506648,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042972/2-level-of-filter-function-not-returns-the-value#comment102506648_58042972"},{"owner":{"reputation":6197,"user_id":218349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abb2f595ca653f4b91bbdc0329000a04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"3gwebtrain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/218349/3gwebtrain"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4488,"user_id":2924577,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c499286ca761a5b21f3744ca229dffb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikhil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2924577/nikhil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569256734,"post_id":58042972,"comment_id":102529631,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042972/2-level-of-filter-function-not-returns-the-value#comment102529631_58042972"},{"owner":{"reputation":4488,"user_id":2924577,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c499286ca761a5b21f3744ca229dffb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikhil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2924577/nikhil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569257031,"post_id":58042972,"comment_id":102529735,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042972/2-level-of-filter-function-not-returns-the-value#comment102529735_58042972"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4488,"user_id":2924577,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c499286ca761a5b21f3744ca229dffb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikhil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2924577/nikhil"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569198811,"creation_date":1569198811,"answer_id":58054425,"question_id":58042972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58054425","body_markdown":"You are passing a string as filters argument to the function.

is a very broad application and there exist numerous methods on how to perform SLAM.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to estimate a map of an environment and the path a robot takes through the environment at the same time. The map generally is sensed by a sensor that measures the position of prominent landmarks in the environment. The movements of the robot are often integrated by IMU, odometry or GPS sensors. The setup and algorithms used to perform SLAM may vary drastically though.\r\n\r\nIt is not even necessary to get movement data from the robot. You can think of a Kalman filter which tracks landmark positions and robot location in it&#39;s state vector and assumes a constant position state transition model for the robot with no control input. Even though the transition model is assumed to be constant position the measurement updates of the landmark position are theoretically enough to give an estimate of the updated position of the robot.\r\n\r\nThis is taken a step further if you consider the Structure from Motion approach where a single camera that is moved through an environment is used to estimate a map of the environment from image features and at the same time estimate the path the camera takes through that map.\r\n\r\nSo as long as you don&#39;t have a specific sensor setup and algorithm in mind the question of &quot;how a robot does pose estimation in SLAM&quot; is not really productive. If you have a specific question I can maybe point you into the direction of specific literature.\r\n\r\nThe [probabilistic robotics][1] book by Sebastian Thrun has a good intro to probabilistic approaches to SLAM.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042966/how-does-robot-do-pose-estimation-in-slam/58306361#58306361","title":"How does robot do pose estimation in SLAM?"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":4268642,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39b515da16b6b6f6b8bf8bd119495c02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ma All","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4268642/ma-all"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58306361,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570630988,"creation_date":1569090012,"question_id":58042966,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58042966","body_markdown":"I know that in particle filter algorithm a robot can pick the best pose given the map.

I can solve it by redefining `x` inside the `foreach`-loop, but that is an unnecessary call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042946/r-foreach-cant-find-global-variable","title":"R: Foreach can&#39;t find global variable?"},{"tags":["c"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569089905,"post_id":58042945,"comment_id":102486120,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042945/how-to-prevent-char-arrays-from-being-overwritten-from-for-loops-when-using-strc#comment102486120_58042945"},{"owner":{"reputation":817870,"user_id":17034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cii6b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hans Passant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17034/hans-passant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569090300,"post_id":58042945,"comment_id":102486206,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042945/how-to-prevent-char-arrays-from-being-overwritten-from-for-loops-when-using-strc#comment102486206_58042945"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8917573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a2377fcc7905dfabc664b4453751480?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thegoodhunter-9115","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8917573/thegoodhunter-9115"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569090616,"post_id":58043006,"comment_id":102486280,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042945/how-to-prevent-char-arrays-from-being-overwritten-from-for-loops-when-using-strc/58043006#comment102486280_58043006"},{"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8917573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a2377fcc7905dfabc664b4453751480?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thegoodhunter-9115","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8917573/thegoodhunter-9115"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569090761,"post_id":58043006,"comment_id":102486324,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042945/how-to-prevent-char-arrays-from-being-overwritten-from-for-loops-when-using-strc/58043006#comment102486324_58043006"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8917573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a2377fcc7905dfabc664b4453751480?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thegoodhunter-9115","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8917573/thegoodhunter-9115"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569090974,"post_id":58043006,"comment_id":102486395,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042945/how-to-prevent-char-arrays-from-being-overwritten-from-for-loops-when-using-strc/58043006#comment102486395_58043006"},{"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8917573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a2377fcc7905dfabc664b4453751480?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thegoodhunter-9115","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8917573/thegoodhunter-9115"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569091201,"post_id":58043006,"comment_id":102486465,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042945/how-to-prevent-char-arrays-from-being-overwritten-from-for-loops-when-using-strc/58043006#comment102486465_58043006"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569090371,"creation_date":1569090371,"answer_id":58043006,"question_id":58042945,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58043006","body_markdown":"The problem is that your `code` variable is an array of 1 character!

There is not one step-by-step tutorial that illustrates everything, though. But there are quite a few bits and pieces that should get you started.\r\n\r\nDo you want to generate written single-choice exams or do you want to conduct your tests in some learning management system like Moodle or so? If you&#39;re looking for written exams, then `exams2nops()` is the most complete solution, see:\r\n&lt;http://www.R-exams.org/tutorials/exams2nops/&gt;\r\n\r\nFor setting up single-choice exercises based on numeric questions, a step-by-step tutorial is: &lt;http://www.R-exams.org/tutorials/static_num_schoice/&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you prefer an arithmetic illustration rather than one from economics, there is:\r\n&lt;http://www.R-exams.org/general/user2019/&gt;\r\n\r\nFor selecting one out of a set of exercises for each participant, you need to define an exam with a list of exercises, e.g.,\r\n\r\n    exm &lt;- list(\r\n      c(&quot;a.Rmd&quot;, &quot;b.Rmd&quot;, &quot;c.Rmd&quot;),\r\n      c(&quot;d.Rmd&quot;, &quot;e.Rmd&quot;)\r\n    )\r\n\r\nWhen using `exams2xyz(exm)` then you will get an exam with two exercises. The first one is a random sample of `a`-`c` and the second one a random sample of `d`-`e`.\r\n\r\nI suggest you try to get started with these, keeping it simple in the beginning.

I might be able to help you then. Also, if this is your first contact with programming, this is way to advanced. Start with something simpler and first understand the basic concepts of programming before moving on. Here is a good tutorial series to learn c# programming for absolute beginners. \r\n    \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSiIHe2uZ2w\r\n    \r\nI am not sure what you are trying to do but why is your movement control within your for loop. That might be why your are messing up. Try removing all of this code out of the for loop.\r\n    \r\n    transform.position = Vector2.MoveTowards(transform.position, targetPos, speed * Time.deltaTime);\r\n \r\n    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.UpArrow) &amp;&amp; transform.position.y &lt; maxHeight)\r\n    {\r\n        Instantiate(effect, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);\r\n        targetPos = new Vector2(transform.position.x, transform.position.y + Yincrement);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.DownArrow) &amp;&amp; transform.position.y &gt; minHeigth)\r\n    {\r\n        Instantiate(effect, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);\r\n        \r\n        targetPos = new Vector2(transform.position.x, transform.position.y - Yincrement);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nAlso this code should be after you check if the player has moved. \r\n    \r\n    transform.position = Vector2.MoveTowards(transform.position, targetPos, speed * Time.deltaTime);\r\n    \r\nHere is a tip to make movement a little easier. Use transform.translate instead of Vector2.MoveTowards. Transform.translate takes in 3 floats and changes you player&#39;s position by the three floats represented as a vector.\r\n    \r\nHere is an example\r\n    \r\n    transform.translate(0,2,0);\r\n    \r\nThis will change the players y position by 2.

It should only be used for updating the UI - **not** for multiple times calling your movement and Scene reload! You should close your `for` loop earlier.\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; hearts.Length; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        // you can also reduce these to single lines\r\n        hearts[i].enabled = i &lt; numOfHearts;\r\n\r\n        if(i &lt; numOfHearts) hearts[i].sprite = i &lt; health ? heartFull : heartEmpty;    \r\n    } // &lt;-- ALREADY CLOSE IT HERE\r\n\r\n    if(health &lt;= 0) ...\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n### Position clamping\r\n\r\nYour clamping of the position is extremely insecure!

If the goal is to make sure that every row and/or column is the same size, you can configure rows and columns to be part of a uniform group. `weight` alone won&#39;t do that because it only configures how extra space is allocated, it doesn&#39;t control the absolute size of a row or column.\r\n\r\nTo create a uniform group, use the `uniform` option for `row_configure` and `column_configure`. All rows or columns in the same uniform group will have the same size in proportion to their weight. If their weight is the same, their size will be the same. \r\n\r\nFrom the canonical tcl/tk documentation:\r\n\r\n&gt; The -uniform option, when a non-empty value is supplied, places the row in a uniform group with other rows that have the same value for -uniform. The space for rows belonging to a uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always in strict proportion to their -weight values.\r\n\r\nIn your case, you can try something like this:\r\n\r\n    self.rowconfigure(0,weight=1, uniform=&#39;row&#39;)\r\n    self.rowconfigure(1,weight=1, uniform=&#39;row&#39;)\r\n    self.rowconfigure(2,weight=1, uniform=&#39;row&#39;)\r\n    self.rowconfigure(3,weight=1, uniform=&#39;row&#39;)\r\n\r\nFor more information see [The grid algorithm](http://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/grid.htm#M32) in the tcl/tk documentation. It describes precisely how the grid algorithm works.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042901/prevent-tkinter-grid-from-dynamically-resizing-cells/58043121#58043121","title":"Prevent Tkinter grid from dynamically resizing cells"}],"owner":{"reputation":147,"user_id":5719079,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g0gYz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mercury","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5719079/mercury"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58043121,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569091295,"creation_date":1569089483,"question_id":58042901,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58042901","body_markdown":"I have a Tkinter class with a grid in it, each of the grid rows should be the same weight as stated in the row configuration and the content of the grid should not affect the grid dimensions as I turned propagation off.\r\n\r\nThis works fine as long as I have empty frames with background colours in the grid but as soon as I add a button to the top grid row the row increases in size compared to the other ones by about exactly the height of the button itself.

You need to dereference the array pointer to access the individual string pointers so you can pass them to `strcmp()` until you reach that terminator, eg:\n\n```c\nbool RfLinkIsStringInArray(char *buffer, char* strArray[])\n{\n\tint i = 0;\n\tint j;\n\twhile (*(strArray + i) != &quot;\\0&quot;) // &lt;- note the *\n\t{\n\t\tj = strcmp(buffer, *(strArray + i++)); // &lt;- note the *\n\t\tif (j == 0) return true;\n\t}\n\treturn false;\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, just use normal array syntax (which works on array pointers) instead of manual pointer arithmetic syntax:\n\n```c\nbool RfLinkIsStringInArray(char *buffer, char* strArray[])\n{\n\tint i = 0;\n\tint j;\n\twhile (strArray[i] != &quot;\\0&quot;)\n\t{\n\t\tj = strcmp(buffer, strArray[i++]);\n\t\tif (j == 0) return true;\n\t}\n\treturn false;\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to eliminate the `i` and `j` variables completely:\n\n```c\nbool RfLinkIsStringInArray(char *buffer, char* strArray[])\n{\n\twhile (*strArray != &quot;\\0&quot;)\n\t{\n\t\tif (strcmp(buffer, *strArray++) == 0)\n\t\t\treturn true;\n\t}\n\treturn false;\n}\n```\n\nThat being said, there is no guarantee that two different `&quot;\\0&quot;` string literals in code will point to the same memory address at runtime. Some compilers do merge duplicate strings, but that is very compiler-specific behavior. You should not rely on that. You need to either use `strlen(...) == 0` to detect the terminating zero-length string, or better to use a NULL pointer instead.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042873/strcmp-cannot-convert-char-to-const-char-for-argument-2-to-int-strcmp/58042988#58042988","title":"strcmp cannot convert &#39;char**&#39;

It&#39;s important in this case to set the `patternUnits` to `userSpaceOnUse` which for simplicity keeps the pattern fill from scaling to the objects bounding box.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .body {\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      background: #1f1b33;\r\n      padding: 2rem;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    svg {\r\n      width: 120px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;svg viewBox=&quot;0 0 121.375 125.397&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;defs&gt;\r\n            &lt;pattern id=&quot;patt&quot; patternUnits=&quot;userSpaceOnUse&quot; width=&quot;97&quot; height=&quot;97&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;image xlink:href=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/17496/flace.jpg&quot; width=&quot;97&quot; height=&quot;97&quot;&gt;&lt;/image&gt;\r\n            &lt;/pattern&gt;\r\n          &lt;/defs&gt;\r\n          &lt;g\r\n            id=&quot;blank&quot;\r\n            transform=&quot;translate(-1460.94 -927.887)&quot;\r\n          &gt;\r\n            &lt;path\r\n              id=&quot;wrapper&quot;\r\n              data-name=&quot;Caminho 2257&quot;\r\n              d=&quot;M80.617,78.013C67.787,91.6,11.606,90.985-8.689,69.872s-20.527-73.915,0-90.659S66.834-47.3,87.13-26.188,93.447,64.424,80.617,78.013Z&quot;\r\n              transform=&quot;translate(1484.938 966.119)&quot;\r\n              fill=&quot;#fff&quot;\r\n              opacity=&quot;0.2&quot;\r\n            /&gt;\r\n            &lt;rect\r\n              id=&quot;within&quot;\r\n              data-name=&quot;Ret&#226;ngulo 365&quot;\r\n              width=&quot;97&quot;\r\n              height=&quot;97&quot;\r\n              rx=&quot;37&quot;\r\n              transform=&quot;translate(1475 945)&quot;\r\n              fill=&quot;url(#patt)&quot;\r\n            /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/g&gt;\r\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042863/centered-background-image-within-svg/58043438#58043438","title":"centered background image within SVG"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3876,"user_id":7394871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfkUM.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alexandr_TT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7394871/alexandr-tt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3876,"user_id":7394871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfkUM.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alexandr_TT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7394871/alexandr-tt"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569098286,"last_edit_date":1569098286,"creation_date":1569096505,"answer_id":58043722,"question_id":58042863,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58043722","body_markdown":"An image can be inserted into any SVG shape in several ways:\r\n\r\n1.

order to make some other calls an access token is needed, so the idea is to get the access token and once that is received then use it to make the next call.\r\n\r\nHere is the actual call, but building the request is ignored:\r\n\r\n    @available(iOS 13.0, *)\r\n    func postToken(session: URLSession = URLSession.shared) throws -&gt; URLSession.DataTaskPublisher {\r\n        let request = try buildTokenRequest()\r\n        return session.dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @available(iOS 13.0, *)\r\n    public func fetchToken() -&gt; AnyPublisher&lt;AccessToken, Error&gt; {\r\n        return try! postToken()\r\n            .tryMap{ try self.validate($0.data, $0.response) }\r\n                .decode(type: AccessToken.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())\r\n                .eraseToAnyPublisher()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe validate is pretty basic but may be useful:\r\n\r\n    @available(iOS 13.0, *)\r\n    func validate(_ data: Data, _ response: URLResponse) throws -&gt; Data {\r\n        guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse else {\r\n            throw APIError.invalidResponse\r\n        }\r\n        guard (200..&lt;300).contains(httpResponse.statusCode) else {\r\n            throw APIError.statusCode(httpResponse.statusCode)\r\n        }\r\n        return data\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn my test I am doing this and if I can get the assertions to work in my test then my thought is to then basically copy that code where I will make the next service call.\r\n\r\n    @available(iOS 13.0, *)\r\n    func testRetrieveToken() {\r\n        let cancellableLogin = AccessTokenService().fetchToken()\r\n        .sink(receiveCompletion: { (completion) in\r\n            switch completion {\r\n            case .failure(let error):\r\n                print(error)\r\n            case .finished:\r\n                print(&quot;BEARER TOKEN&quot;)\r\n            }\r\n        }, receiveValue: { response in\r\n            print(response)\r\n            XCTAssertNotNil(response)\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy problem is when I run the application I don&#39;t get errors, it just doesn&#39;t print out any results as it finishes running.  I basically need to be able to pause and wait for the request to finish before I try to do the assertion, so pretend it is synchronous.\r\n\r\nThis is the results of my run:\r\n\r\n    Test Case &#39;-[AccessTokenServiceTests.AccessTokenServiceTests testRetrieveToken]&#39; started.\r\n    Test Case &#39;-[AccessTokenServiceTests.AccessTokenServiceTests testRetrieveToken]&#39; passed (0.004 seconds).\r\n\r\nIt should have taken about 1 second if it had waited for the token generation.\r\n\r\n** Update **\r\n\r\nI changed the test to be as follows, so I think the solution may be to use a `PassThroughSubject` perhaps. It may require timing, so I call this when the app starts, then it should be back before the first webservice is called, or I wait until I get the fact that it has been set.\r\n\r\n        let expectation = self.expectation(description: &quot;Scaling&quot;)\r\n        let cancellableLogin = AccessTokenService().fetchToken()\r\n        .sink(receiveCompletion: { (completion) in\r\n            switch completion {\r\n            case .failure(let error):\r\n                print(error)\r\n                expectation.fulfill()\r\n                XCTFail()\r\n            case .finished:\r\n                print(&quot;BEARER TOKEN&quot;)\r\n            }\r\n        }, receiveValue: { response in\r\n            print(response)\r\n            XCTAssertNotNil(response)\r\n            XCTAssertEqual(response.token_type, &quot;Bearer&quot;)\r\n            expectation.fulfill()\r\n        })\r\n        waitForExpectations(timeout: 60, handler: nil)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042858/using-swift-and-combine-wait-to-get-results-from-webservice-call-to-make-next-ca","title":"Using Swift and Combine wait to get results from webservice call to make next call"},{"tags":["django","django-email"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10421193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e5a4fa535b83496972ed05d14c527f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10421193","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10421193/user10421193"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":202753,"user_id":113962,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b80ae1d65878cf68a4b1a00848467527?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alasdair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/113962/alasdair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569089771,"post_id":58042857,"comment_id":102486087,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042857/emails-in-my-django-app-send-in-the-shell-but-not-when-app-is-running#comment102486087_58042857"},{"owner":{"reputation":202753,"user_id":113962,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b80ae1d65878cf68a4b1a00848467527?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alasdair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/113962/alasdair"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569090369,"post_id":58042857,"comment_id":102486226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042857/emails-in-my-django-app-send-in-the-shell-but-not-when-app-is-running#comment102486226_58042857"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10421193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e5a4fa535b83496972ed05d14c527f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10421193","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10421193/user10421193"},"last_editor":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10421193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e5a4fa535b83496972ed05d14c527f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10421193","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10421193/user10421193"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569089878,"creation_date":1569089179,"last_edit_date":1569089878,"question_id":58042857,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58042857","body_markdown":"This exact code works in the shell, but does not work in my view and I have no idea why.

All your other services will just registered to at least one `entrypoint` of traefik in order to get requests. \r\n\r\nSo you just need to remove the `ports: - 80:3001` from your api service. \r\n\r\nWhat will happen is that traefik only will listen to port 80 and all the traefik which has an http host header of `domain.org` or`www.domain.org` will be routed to app service though all requests with `api.domain.org` will be routed to your api service. \r\n\r\nIf you have done the above and you cannot send requests to your api service please share some logs from your service to check the errors most of the cases some headers need to be propagated to backend services in order for them to work properly. \r\n\r\nPS. You are using the latest v2.0 version of traefik where apparently the registration of a service to an entrypoint is enough for traefik to route requests to this service. In previous versions you should add the label `traefik.port` to the service in order to advertise where your service is listening which was a bit more explicit to what was happening.

How can I make the ``` api ``` and ``` traefik ``` service both run together on ``` port 80 ```?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042831/how-to-manage-multiple-ports-exposed-on-port-80-with-docker","title":"How to manage multiple ports exposed on port 80 with

We will loop this data and for each channel we will:\r\n\r\n- Calculate a list of update intervals (timediff between timestamps)\r\n- Average the above and round to int - this part might need more work in real data\r\n\r\nStore the above in another dict where its key is the interval and the value is a list of channels that seem to have this update interval:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Identify intervals\r\nchannel_interval = defaultdict(list)\r\nFMT = &#39;%H:%M:%S&#39;\r\n\r\nfor channel, report_times in data.items():\r\n    # We need at least 2 samples to determine interval - \r\n    # channel 4 needed another entry for this to work\r\n    if len(report_times) &lt; 2:\r\n        continue\r\n\r\n    # Collect all reports timediff for this channel\r\n    diffs = []\r\n    # This converts timestamp to datatime\r\n    prev_time = datetime.strptime(report_times[0], FMT)\r\n\r\n    for rt in report_times[1:]:\r\n        cur_time = datetime.strptime(rt, FMT)\r\n        diffs.append((cur_time - prev_time).seconds)\r\n        prev_time = cur_time\r\n\r\n    # average the report time difference - int division\r\n    # here you might need to be smarter with real data and round up a bit\r\n    # if needed\r\n    interval = sum(diffs) // len(diffs)\r\n    channel_interval[interval].append(channel)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the reporting: Simply loop each channel_interval and for each channel that fall in this interval print the timestamps:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# report\r\nfor interval, channels in channel_interval.items():\r\n    print(&quot;Updating every {} seconds (channels={})&quot;.format(interval, channels))\r\n    for channel in channels:\r\n        hdr = &#39;\\nchannel {}: &#39;.format(channel)\r\n        print(hdr + hdr.join(data[channel]))\r\n        print(&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe final output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUpdating every 60 seconds (channels=[4])\r\n\r\nchannel 4: 3:26:15\r\nchannel 4: 3:27:15\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating every 10 seconds (channels=[1])\r\n\r\nchannel 1: 3:25:15\r\nchannel 1: 3:25:25\r\nchannel 1: 3:25:35\r\nchannel 1: 3:25:45\r\nchannel 1: 3:25:55\r\nchannel 1: 3:26:05\r\nchannel 1: 3:26:15\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating every 20 seconds (channels=[2])\r\n\r\nchannel 2: 3:25:35\r\nchannel 2: 3:25:55\r\nchannel 2: 3:26:15\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating every 30 seconds (channels=[3])\r\n\r\nchannel 3: 3:25:45\r\nchannel 3: 3:26:15\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I said the above might need minor changes to work with real data but should be a good start. Let me know if you have questions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nupdate 1: if you want the printing to be ordered by interval you can loop\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor channel, interval in sorted(channel_interval.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58042826/is-it-possible-to-group-data-by-time-intervals/58043242#58043242","title":"Is it possible to group data by time intervals?"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":11152639,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YjIUb9bfsGk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHVI/gHKkFy5qOeU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Manap Shymyr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11152639/manap-shymyr"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2696,"user_id":3727050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OFrev.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"urban","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3727050/urban"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569092280,"creation_date":1569088992,"last_edit_date":1569090441,"question_id":58042826,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58042826","body_markdown":"I am trying to analyze satellite telemetry data.

Can I wait for this to load before returning the HTML or how can I accomplish this?\r\n\r\nI have also tried finding a JS method that adds the songs, but wasn&#39;t able to!\r\n\r\nHere is the entire code responsible for getting the data:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction makeHttpObject() {\r\n\r\n    try { return new XMLHttpRequest(); }\r\n    catch (error) { }\r\n\r\n    try { return new ActiveXObject(&quot;Msxml2.XMLHTTP&quot;); }\r\n    catch (error) { }\r\n\r\n    try { return new ActiveXObject(&quot;Microsoft.XMLHTTP&quot;); }\r\n    catch (error) { }\r\n\r\n    throw new Error(&quot;Could not create HTTP request object.&quot;);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction setup() {\r\n    var request = makeHttpObject();\r\n\r\n    request.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/&quot; + url, true);\r\n    request.send(null);\r\n\r\n    request.onreadystatechange = function () {\r\n        if (request.readyState == 4) {\r\n            console.log(request.response);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will, and am, use Node.js for the Discord Music bot, but I would prefer not to use jQuery.
