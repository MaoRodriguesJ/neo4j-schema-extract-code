I am trying to use a U-Net architecture as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Inputs\r\nX_train # list of all images, shaped (256, 256, 3)\r\nY_train # list of weighted mask, as shown above\r\nY_train = to_categorical(Y_train, num_classes=None)\r\n\r\n# Dice coefficient\r\ndef dice_coef(y_true, y_pred):\r\n    y_true_f = K.flatten(y_true)\r\n    y_pred_f = K.flatten(y_pred)\r\n    intersection = K.sum(y_true_f * y_pred_f)\r\n    return (2. * intersection + 1.) / (K.sum(y_true_f) + K.sum(y_pred_f) + 1.)\r\n\r\n# Define model\r\ninputs = Input((256, 256, 3))\r\ns = Lambda(lambda x: x / 255) (inputs)\r\n# ... convolutional etc. layers\r\noutputs = Conv2D(12, (1, 1), activation=&#39;softmax&#39;) (c9)\r\nmodel = Model(inputs=[inputs], outputs=[outputs])\r\nmodel.compile(optimizer=&#39;adam&#39;, loss=&#39;categorical_crossentropy&#39;, metrics=[dice_coef])\r\n\r\n# Train model\r\nModelCheckpoint(&#39;model.hf&#39;, verbose=1, save_best_only=True)\r\nresults = model.fit(X_train, Y_train, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=10, epochs=15, callbacks=[checkpointer])\r\n\r\n# Test\r\ntest_image = # test image of shape (256,256,3)\r\ntest_image = np.expand_dims(test_image, axis=0)\r\nprediction = model.predict(test_image)\r\nprint(prediction.shape)\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (1, 256, 256, 12)\r\nimshow(np.sum(prediction[0,:,:,1:], axis=-1)) # or argmax or a single layer \r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\nAll of my predicted outputs are either blank or have the borders highlighted as is shown here.\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nDoes anyone see something wrong with my code or architecture or has another idea to separate close objects? As my first project I&#39;m having a hard time figuring out what things to look out for.\r\n\r\nGigantic thank you in advance.

So you would need to manage deleting them when not in use.

While disabling the axis ticks on the respective subfigures is quite easy, it unfortunately causes the saved figures to come out with different image sizes (the plot region takes up more of the image if no axis labels are present), which subsequently messes up the layout in my LaTeX figure.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to force the specific size of these plots, based on the size of plot c) (having both axis ticks)?\r\n\r\nMy current attempt has been to use `plt.savefig([...], bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;, pad_inches=x)`, but to no avail.\r\nI am also open to using `plt.subplot()`, but I would prefer to keep them as individual plots for the sake later presentations.\r\n\r\nFor reference and to give you some MCVE to work with, imagine the plot of subfigure a) (no x-axis label and ticks) to look like this:\r\n\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n    \r\n    x = [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n    y = [1, 4, 9, 16]\r\n    plt.plot(x, y)\r\n    plt.xticks([1,2,3,4], [])  # Disable x-axis ticks\r\n    plt.xlabel(&quot;&quot;)  # Disable x-axis label","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119058/matplotlib-force-equal-size-with-and-without-axes-labels","title":"Matplotlib force equal size with and without axes labels"},{"tags":["wordpress","function"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":6897985,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yfcu7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ususipse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6897985/ususipse"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569508735,"post_id":58119051,"comment_id":102627449,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119051/how-can-i-force-playsinline-for-all-video-content-in-wordpress#comment102627449_58119051"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5837496,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/497492507120995/picture?type=large","display_name":"Viktor Nagy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5837496/viktor-nagy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569508139,"creation_date":1569508139,"question_id":58119051,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119051","body_markdown":"I want to make all video file playsinline in Wordpress globally.\r\n\r\nIn a function.php or something.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119051/how-can-i-force-playsinline-for-all-video-content-in-wordpress","title":"How can i force playsinline for all &lt;video&gt;

I need to be able to navigate away from the form to create new patients, physicians, insurance etc if they are not currently present. When I am redirected back to the form I need to retain the form data plus whatever new data was added. Currently I am using TempData to keep the values of each individual property in my model. I then refer to the TempData value to populate the &quot;value&quot; field in my inputs. This works fine for all my field including text and date time, but the drop downs are giving me a problem. I am using a viewbag to populate the DropDownListFor, and the closest I can get to achieve what I want is to replace the 3rd parameter in the DropDownListFor with my TempData(The default value) and set a hidden field with my TempData value. This is far from rock solid and very buggy. I want the dropdown lists to behave like my text and date time inputs, but there is no &quot;value&quot; attribute with a DropDownListFor.

Recently, I was familiarizing myself with `swift` by solving some trivial exercises and faced one where statistics should be calculated. The goal was to calculate the mean (sum of all elements divided by amount) for an array of numbers. I decided to follow the best known way to solve this, and defined an extension over a collection with a function that returns a numeric value:\r\n```swift\r\n//this is specific case with Integers. Seems bold enought\r\nextension Array where Element == Int {\r\n    func mean() -&gt; Double {\r\n        var result = 0.0\r\n        for i in self {\r\n            result += Double(i)\r\n        }\r\n        return result / Double(self.count)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].mean() //outputs 5.0\r\n```\r\nThe code above runs without a problem. But I want to be able to apply `mean()` to any sequence of numerals (Floats, Doubles, etc), so the try is: \r\n```swift\r\nextension Collection where Element: Numeric {\r\n    func mean() -&gt; some Numeric {\r\n        var result = Element.init(exactly: 0)!\r\n        for i in self {\r\n            result += i\r\n        }\r\n        return result / Element.init(exactly: self.count)! \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis would allow to get a result from any numeral array:\r\n```swift\r\nvar array1: [Float] = ...\r\nvar array2: [UInt] = ... \r\nvar array3: [Int8] = ... //nutty case\r\n```\r\nBut the compilation fails with a message that says that, because values in that collection can be of a different concrete type, it is not possible to invoke a division operator due to `swift` strict typing. So, the only option to implement needed functionality is to extend all concrete types that operate with numbers (Int, UInt, UInt8, ...), which is a robust thing to do (there are ~20 of them). Given `swift`&#39;s great abstractization possibilities with extensions, is it possible to:\r\n```swift\r\nextension Collection where Adopter: HomogeneousCollection { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, some types cannot be big numbers: Int8 can hold up to 256 numbers, so a collection of `[Int8]` can only give a correct result if there is less than 128 elements, otherwise division by `nil` would occur. \r\n\r\nSo I ask, what is the most appropriate way to declare a function to calculate a mean for a homogeneous sequential collection? Also, how would you solve for a case when collection is empty?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118983/swift-numerals-and-monotype-collections","title":"Swift numerals and monotype collections"},{"tags":["php","validation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":38796,"user_id":453002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66e564e1221dfd0bfd24e7c47e2079ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex Howansky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/453002/alex-howansky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569508069,"post_id":58118982,"comment_id":102626980,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118982/preg-grep-pattern-for-checking-url-prefix#comment102626980_58118982"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":8808458,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca764810dccbd3ef1ffd332e06953f52?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DarkPanda182","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8808458/darkpanda182"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":38796,"user_id":453002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66e564e1221dfd0bfd24e7c47e2079ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex Howansky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/453002/alex-howansky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569508764,"post_id":58118982,"comment_id":102627465,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118982/preg-grep-pattern-for-checking-url-prefix#comment102627465_58118982"},{"owner":{"reputation":921,"user_id":1594359,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yEqJE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"xdeepakv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1594359/xdeepakv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569509253,"post_id":58118982,"comment_id":102627756,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118982/preg-grep-pattern-for-checking-url-prefix#comment102627756_58118982"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":8808458,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca764810dccbd3ef1ffd332e06953f52?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DarkPanda182","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8808458/darkpanda182"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511545,"post_id":58118982,"comment_id":102628971,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118982/preg-grep-pattern-for-checking-url-prefix#comment102628971_58118982"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":8808458,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca764810dccbd3ef1ffd332e06953f52?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DarkPanda182","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8808458/darkpanda182"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569508791,"post_id":58119098,"comment_id":102627479,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118982/preg-grep-pattern-for-checking-url-prefix/58119098#comment102627479_58119098"},{"owner":{"reputation":3288,"user_id":61779,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/508d531669fbeeb58f486c8249113716?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cOle2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/61779/cole2"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569508903,"post_id":58119098,"comment_id":102627554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118982/preg-grep-pattern-for-checking-url-prefix/58119098#comment102627554_58119098"},{"owner":{"reputation":336,"user_id":10513828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef8fb870fda09c465225fdb06ffe64fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Will","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10513828/will"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569566638,"post_id":58119098,"comment_id":102645488,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118982/preg-grep-pattern-for-checking-url-prefix/58119098#comment102645488_58119098"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":336,"user_id":10513828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef8fb870fda09c465225fdb06ffe64fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Will","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10513828/will"},"last_editor":{"reputation":336,"user_id":10513828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef8fb870fda09c465225fdb06ffe64fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Will","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10513828/will"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569566834,"last_edit_date":1569566834,"creation_date":1569508254,"answer_id":58119098,"question_id":58118982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58119098","body_markdown":"Why don&#39;t you use `filter_var(&#39;http://example.com&#39;, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL);` ?\r\n([doc][1])\r\n\r\nEdit, after your comment and @cOle2&#39;s\r\n\r\nYou can also have a look at [parse_url][2].

As you have noticed it will be ignored. \r\n\r\nSwing was designed to be used with layout managers. The default layout for a JPanel is the FlowLayout. The JLabel and JCheckBox will both be displayed at their preferred size.\r\n\r\nIf you want extra space on the panel then you can use an `EmptyBorder`.

If you don&#39;t like that then you can use a different layout manager on the frame. Read the tutorial on [Layout Managers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html). The easiest might be the `FlowLayout`. You can specify the alignment to be left aligned.\r\n\r\n&gt; with dimensions say 50x50.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t use random numbers. You have no idea if the text of the label and check box can be displayed in 50 pixels. I already told you how to make the panel size bigger. Read the tutorial on Borders!!!\r\n\r\n    static GraphicsConfiguration gc;\r\n    static JFrame frame = new JFrame(gc);\r\n\r\nYou are still using static variables.

Actually the code should be:\r\n\r\n    frame.pack();\r\n    frame.setVisible( true );\r\n\r\nThen all the components will be display nicely at their preferred size.\r\n\r\nRead the tutorial each section in the tutorial has working examples which you can download and play with.

I confirmed that the SOPine board I&#39;m using has a [VFPv4 Floating Point Unit](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PINE_A64-LTS/SOPine_Main_Page#CPU_Architecture), contains the directory /lib/arm-linux-gnueablhf/, and I have the JDK bellsoft-java11:armhf (From dpkg -l) installed, so I am not clear on why it is using libjSSC-2.7_arm**sf**.so instead of libjSSC-2.7_arm**hf**.so, which is in the same jssc.jar.\r\n\r\nI tried adding libjSSC-2.7_arm**hf**.so to the /root/.jssc/linux/ directory, installing libjssc-java to linux, and modifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH and -Djava.library.path to point to another directory, but it throwing the same exception that it cannot locate libjSSC-2.7_arm**sf**.so.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using the following command to run the JAR file with the pine user:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo java -jar product-0.1.0.jar &amp;&gt; output-0.1.0_1.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit 10/2/2019:**\r\nI tried to change the JSSC shared library it&#39;s using by deleting the libjSSC-2.7_armsf.so, installing jssc locally using `sudo apt install libjssc-java`, and using LD_LIBRARY_PATH and -Djava.library.path to focus my program at running the new library, but it is still asking for libjSSC-2.7_armsf.so. I&#39;m going to configure the Eclipse project to not package the JSSC JAR file with my project&#39;s exported JAR file and try running it again.\r\n\r\n**Edit 10/7/2019:**\r\nLast week, I decided to create a simple HelloSerial.java program to reduce potential dependencies. The code is below:\r\n```java\r\nimport jssc.SerialPortList;\r\n\r\npublic class HelloSerial {\r\n    \r\n    static {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;HelloSerial: loading JSSC&quot;);\r\n        try {\r\n            System.load(&quot;/root/.jssc/linux/libjSSC-2.7_armhf.so&quot;);\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;HelloSerial: loading JSSC&quot;);\r\n        } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {\r\n            System.err.println(&quot;Native core library failed to load.\\n&quot; + e);\r\n            System.exit(1);;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;HelloSerial: start&quot;);\r\n\r\n        String[] portNames = SerialPortList.getPortNames();\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;HelloSerial: listing &quot; + portNames.length + &quot; port names&quot;);\r\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; portNames.length; i++){\r\n            System.out.println(portNames[i]);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        System.out.println(&quot;HelloSerial: end&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere is the output from compiling and running it within the Linux system:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo javac -classpath .:jssc.jar HelloSerial.java\r\n$ sudo java -cp jssc.jar:.

What could be forcing it to use the soft float version? All of the libraries, including the JDK, are using either armhf, arm64, or all in `dpkg -l`.\r\n\r\n**Edit 10/8/2019:**\r\nI found that JSSC uses logic in its [SerialNativeInterface](https://github.com/scream3r/java-simple-serial-connector/blob/2.8.0/src/java/jssc/SerialNativeInterface.java#L120) class to determine which shared library to use (This is just showing the relevant lines of code):\r\n```java\r\n79  static {\r\n80      String libFolderPath;\r\n81      String libName;\r\n82\r\n83      String osName = System.getProperty(&quot;os.name&quot;);\r\n84      String architecture = System.getProperty(&quot;os.arch&quot;);\r\n85      String userHome = System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;);\r\n86      String fileSeparator = System.getProperty(&quot;file.separator&quot;);\r\n87      String tmpFolder = System.getProperty(&quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot;);\r\n...\r\n118     else if(architecture.equals(&quot;arm&quot;)) {//since 2.1.0\r\n119         String floatStr = &quot;sf&quot;;\r\n120 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    if(javaLibPath.toLowerCase().contains(&quot;gnueabihf&quot;) || javaLibPath.toLowerCase().contains(&quot;armhf&quot;)){\r\n121             floatStr = &quot;hf&quot;;\r\n122         }\r\n123         else {\r\n...\r\n139         }\r\n140         architecture = &quot;arm&quot; + floatStr;\r\n141     }\r\n142\r\n143     libFolderPath = libRootFolder + fileSeparator + &quot;.jssc&quot; + fileSeparator + osName;\r\n144     libName = &quot;jSSC-&quot; + libVersion + &quot;_&quot; + architecture;\r\n145     libName = System.mapLibraryName(libName);\r\n```\r\nThe important part is on line 120, where the ARM&#39;s library is choosen be soft float or hard float based on whether the java.library.path includes a gnueabihf or armhf path. Including the following line of code shows those paths:\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;HelloSerial: java.library.path &quot; + System.getProperty(&quot;java.library.path&quot;));\r\n```\r\nThis outputted:\r\n```\r\nHelloSerial: java.library.path /usr/java/packages/lib:/lib:/usr/lib\r\n```\r\nIt looks like gnueabihf or armhf paths like `/lib/gnueabihf` aren&#39;t being used, so I need to add one as a placeholder.\r\n\r\nUsing `sudo java -D.java.library.path=&quot;.:/lib/gnueabihf&quot; -jar HelloSerial-1.0.0.jar` works.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll see if I can permanently add `/lib/gnueabihf` to java.library.path in the future.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118965/how-to-fix-a-java-lang-unsatisfiedlinkerror-for-jssc-needs-hard-float","title":"How to fix a java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError for JSSC?

The whole auth process works well in both iOS and Android - in both cases I get a token and can query our API.\r\n\r\nThe Android app does not accept navigation commands and stays &quot;stuck&quot; on the target activity for the custom URI callback.\r\n\r\nThe android manifest has an activity entry for _is4.callback_ and it works well:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n    // The Name property here is referred to in the Activity in Android.manifest\r\n    // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/platform/android-manifest\r\n    [Activity(Name = &quot;is4.callback&quot;)]\r\n    public class AuthCallback : Activity\r\n    {\r\n        protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)\r\n        {\r\n            base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n\r\n            if (Intent?.Data?.ToString() != null)\r\n            {\r\n                // Convert Android.Net.Url to Uri\r\n                var uri = new Uri(Intent?.Data?.ToString());\r\n\r\n                // Load redirectUrl page\r\n                AuthenticationState.Authenticator.OnPageLoading(uri);\r\n\r\n                //this.Finish();\r\n                //return;\r\n\r\n            } else\r\n            {\r\n                // deal with it\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _OnPageLoading()_ method call above sends control back to _OnAuthCompleted()_ per Xamarin.Auth as expected:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n        async void OnAuthCompleted(object sender, AuthenticatorCompletedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            if (e.Account != null &amp;&amp; e.Account.Properties != null)\r\n            {\r\n                Client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(&quot;Authorization&quot;, $&quot;Bearer {e.Account.Properties[&quot;access_token&quot;]}&quot;);\r\n\r\n                HttpResponseMessage response = await Client.GetAsync(&quot;https://our.is4.server/connect/userinfo&quot;);\r\n                if (response != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    using (HttpContent content = response.Content)\r\n                    {\r\n                        string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\r\n                        Console.WriteLine(responseBody);\r\n                    }\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(_logStringPre + &quot;MainPage.OnAuthCompleted(), calling nav:&quot;);\r\n                    await Navigation.PushAsync(new HasAuth());\r\n                }\r\n                else\r\n                {\r\n                    // deal with it\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                await Navigation.PushAsync(new NoAuth());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, for Android that `PushAsync` to the `HasAuth` view doesn&#39;t happen as expected - the Activity that catches the call back (_is4.callback_) retains the focus. The little &quot;back&quot; &lt; button at the bottom of the screen on my Pixel 3 sends me to the `HasAuth` page, where the view should be, though. That last `WriteLine` prior to `PushAsync` does fire, I think I need to close the Android activity somehow?\r\n\r\nThe use of `finish()` in _is4.callback_ prevents auth from happening. `return` in that activity seems to have no effect at all.\r\n\r\nI _do_ see the &quot;If CustomTabs Login Screen does not close automatically...&quot; suggestion from the Android OS, visible over the _is4.callback_ activity, but it looks to me like CustomTabs closed correctly?\r\nWhat am I missing?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118951/android-app-pushasync-nav-not-working-after-xamarin-auth-oidc-completes","title":"Android app PushAsync nav not working after Xamarin.Auth oidc completes"},{"tags":["c++","build","cmake"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":123162,"user_id":817643,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3ec3655af26685ce29823b04cb6c78d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"StoryTeller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/817643/storyteller"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569508044,"post_id":58118948,"comment_id":102626965,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118948/conditionally-compiling-a-single-file-with-cmake-flag#comment102626965_58118948"},{"owner":{"reputation":696,"user_id":8474738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdQLR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"D.

If you have a look at the [Comparing objects](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.object-comparison.php) documentation you will see that:\r\n\r\n&gt; When using the comparison operator (==), object variables are compared in a simple manner, namely: Two object instances are equal if they have the same attributes and values (values are compared with ==), and are instances of the same class.\r\n\r\nSo... In your case you loaded `$obj1` and `$obj2`\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$obj1 = MyModel::find($id);\r\n$obj2 = MyModel::find($id);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we follow the guidelines when running the `dd` PHP will look for:\r\n\r\n**1. Instance of the same class**\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s **true** =&gt; `MyModel::class == MyModel::class` \r\n\r\n**2. Attributes**:\r\nIt&#39;s true as well since same class equals same attributes.\r\n\r\n**3. Values**\r\n\r\nYou looked for the same database `id` so Laravel mapped the query result inside two different instances... but retrieving the same values.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, when you perform a [lazy load](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/eloquent-relationships#lazy-eager-loading), Laravel will push inside the `relations` array a new value. So the comparison will succed for point 1 and 2, but fails on point 3 since\r\n\r\n```php\r\ndd($obj1-&gt;relations)\r\n\r\n/* RESULT\r\n * [...]\r\n * #relations: array:1[\r\n *  &quot;users&quot; =&gt; Collection { ... }\r\n * ],\r\n */\r\n\r\ndd($obj2-&gt;relations)\r\n\r\n/* RESULT\r\n * [...]\r\n * #relations: array:0[],\r\n */\r\n```\r\nThe values inside this attributes are different, and the comparison fails.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118919/accessing-relation-on-object-variable-changes-the-variable/58119436#58119436","title":"accessing relation on object variable changes the variable"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":9912346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/677c1fc021f8ef7447bab1a120d15f05?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aman Pawar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9912346/aman-pawar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569510201,"creation_date":1569510201,"answer_id":58119705,"question_id":58118919,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58119705","body_markdown":"The relations do not get inherited unless you call them.

Up until now, that worked and the quick look would present with the document properly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that no longer works. I updated to Xcode 11 (swift 5.1) this morning, and now my QLPreview controller doesn&#39;t show the document. It still presents, but with a gray background that says &quot;Document name&quot; and &quot;pdf document.&quot; If I click the share button and go to print it, the print preview correctly shows my file (and pushing print does print the correct file in its entirety) so I know the file is there, and is readable.

In your code base you can decide when you want to call the performSegue and actually close the VC using the manual exit segue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118872/losing-row-id-in-tableview-before-passing-data/58119018#58119018","title":"Losing row id in tableview before passing data"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":11447379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54cd088cf965d94d960c8332a7bd6aac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sebastien Desemberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11447379/sebastien-desemberg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22,"user_id":11447379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54cd088cf965d94d960c8332a7bd6aac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sebastien Desemberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11447379/sebastien-desemberg"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569555166,"last_edit_date":1569555166,"creation_date":1569524054,"answer_id":58123087,"question_id":58118872,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58123087","body_markdown":"As @Tommie C. mentioned, my issue was with the TableViewCell that was linked to the Storyboard Exit.

Im very new to jQuery/AJAX so forgive my ignorance. After two days, this is what I came up with to make it still work after the page refresh.\r\n\r\nSurely, there has to be a cleaner method than what I&#39;m doing here. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118852/how-can-i-combine-60-similar-jquery-functions-into-a-single-function","title":"How can I combine 60 similar jquery functions into a single function?"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7657}
