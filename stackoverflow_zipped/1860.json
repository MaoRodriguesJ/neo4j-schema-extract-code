When you connect to an Oracle database and write a query against that date column, you will see its default format `DD-MON-YY` as per [this reference][1].\r\n\r\nYou can override this setting by running an `ALTER SESSION` command, eg\r\n\r\n    ALTER SESSION SET NLS_DATE_FORMAT = &#39;YYYY MM DD&#39;;\r\n\r\nbut this is just in that local session.  The data is still stored in Oracle in the same manner and it&#39;s simply the way you view it that is changing.\r\n\r\nIn Azure Data Factory (ADF v2) and your example, you are dealing with strings.  So you must make sure any parameters you pass in are in the correct format or set to the correct datatype.  The Oracle function `TO_DATE` converts strings to the date datatype.  Therefore when *passing in* a string of format `YYYY-MM-DD` then that is the format you must use, to let the `TO_DATE` function know what you are passing in:\r\n\r\n    TO_DATE(&#39;2015-10-25&#39;,&#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;)\r\n\r\nThe function then successfully converts your parameter to a `date` datetype for correct comparison against the main date column.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/datatype.htm#CNCPT413","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099377/azure-data-factory-lookup-date-in-azure-sql-dwh-use-in-oracle-query/58111999#58111999","title":"Azure Data Factory.

In VSCode the relative path is relative to the folder / workspace that you have opened as opposed to jupyter where it is relative to the file. To work around this you can either change your path to academic_data_settings to be relative to the opened folder, or you can set the Notebook File Root in the setting to point to the location that you want for this workspace to be the working root.

I feel that it is being used inappropriately in this situation, and they insist that &quot;this is how it is everywhere&quot;.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the scenario:\r\nWe have a REST API endpoint with a static URI like &quot;https://server.domain.com/restapi/getnode&quot; that accepts a json body during a POST operation to see if a server exists within the database.   There is 1 server allowed per query.  \r\nThe way it is designed, if the server exists, it returns http code 200 with the body of the message being the details of the server within the database.  If it doesn&#39;t exist, then they return a 404 code with the message &quot;server x is not found in database y&quot;.  \r\n\r\nI feel that this is incorrect because according to the standards from [W3C][1] 4xx codes are for client-related issues, and 404 is specifically if the server can not server up that specific URI.  Further, this is not really an error, we would not only expect the occasional negative/empty response as part of the normal business, but that is expected to be the state on the majority of the calls.\r\n\r\nTheir response to this is that according to sources such as [AWS REST Standards][2] and [ServiceNow REST Standards][3] that 404 is appropriate because the query didn&#39;t find the server, therefore it couldn&#39;t find the resource (To which I feel that they are misinterpreting the term &quot;resource&quot;).\r\n\r\nSo, who is correct here?

there seems to be a lot of questions about the Java API itself, but I&#39;m facing a problem I haven&#39;t found anywhere: My code runs fine if I run it directly from the class file, but it refuses to work as soon as I put it in a JAR.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    Mixer.Info[] mixerInfo = AudioSystem.getMixerInfo();\r\n    for (Mixer.Info info: mixerInfo) {\r\n        Mixer mixer = AudioSystem.getMixer(info);\r\n        Line.Info[] targetLineInfo = mixer.getTargetLineInfo();\r\n        for (Line.Info lineInfo: targetLineInfo) {\r\n            try {\r\n                Line line = mixer.getLine(lineInfo);\r\n                line.open();     //&lt;---- problematic line\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Success: Opened line &quot; + line.getLineInfo());\r\n                if (line.getLineInfo().getLineClass().equals(TargetDataLine.class)) {\r\n                    TargetDataLine dataLine = (TargetDataLine) line;\r\n                    byte[] read = new byte[16];\r\n                    dataLine.start();\r\n                    dataLine.read(read, 0, 16);\r\n                    dataLine.stop();\r\n                    System.out.println(&quot;Success: Finished reading from line &quot; + line.getLineInfo());\r\n                }\r\n                line.close();\r\n            } catch (LineUnavailableException e) {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + e.getMessage());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for this very simple example, the following runs as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc&gt;javac AudioTest.java\r\nsrc&gt;java AudioTest\r\nSuccess: Finished reading from line interface TargetDataLine supporting 8 audio formats, and buffers of at least 32 bytes\r\nSuccess: Finished reading from line interface TargetDataLine supporting 8 audio formats, and buffers of at least 32 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding a jar out of this yields the following result:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc&gt;jar cfe AudioTest.jar AudioTest AudioTest.class\r\nsrc&gt;jar tf AudioTest.jar\r\nMETA-INF/\r\nMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MF\r\nAudioTest.class\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when trying to run this jar:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc&gt;java -jar AudioTest.jar\r\nError: line with format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit, stereo, 4 bytes/frame, little-endian not supported.\r\nError: line with format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit, stereo, 4 bytes/frame, little-endian not supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the main class manually and putting the jar on the classpath works as expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc&gt;java -classpath .\\AudioTest.jar AudioTest\r\nSuccess: Finished reading from line interface TargetDataLine supporting 8 audio formats, and buffers of at least 32 bytes\r\nSuccess: Finished reading from line interface TargetDataLine supporting 8 audio formats, and buffers of at least 32 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m completely stumped at this point.

SQL isn&#39;t really convertable to LookML, as LookML *generates* SQL, as opposed to just translating it.\r\n\r\nLookML uses view files to describe tables, and you&#39;ve got two tables here, so you&#39;ll need two view files. They might look something like this, though I&#39;m just guessing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nview: accounts {\r\n  sql_table_name: Accounts ;;\r\n  \r\n  dimension: Accounts_Unlock_Price {\r\n    type: number\r\n    sql: ${TABLE}.Accounts_Unlock_Price ;;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  dimension: Accounts_Upfront_Price {\r\n    type: number\r\n    sql: ${TABLE}.Accounts_Upfront_Price ;;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  dimension: Portfolio_Derived_Previous_Cumulative_Paid {\r\n    type: number\r\n    sql: ${TABLE}.Portfolio_Derived_Previous_Cumulative_Paid ;;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  dimension: FRR {\r\n    type: number\r\n    sql: ${Portfolio_Derived_Previous_Cumulative_Paid}/(${Accounts_Unlock_Price} - ${Accounts_Upfront_Price}) * 100;;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  dimension: Angaza_ID {\r\n    type: number\r\n    sql: ${TABLE}.Accounts_Angaza_ID ;;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nview: Portfolio_derived {\r\n  sql_table_name: Portfolio_derived_20 ;;\r\n  ##don&#39;t know what&#39;s in this file\r\n  \r\n  dimension: Account_Angaza_ID {\r\n    type: number\r\n    sql: ${TABLE}.Portfolio_Derived_Account_Angaza_ID ;;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve defined the fields in views, you need to join them in an explore, so you can actually query them.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m again just guessing, and it looks like you&#39;re doing a CROSS join here but I&#39;m not sure.\r\n```\r\nexplore: accounts_angaza {\r\n  view_name: accounts\r\n  sql_always_where: ${Portfolio_derived.Account_Angaza_ID} = ${accounts.Angaza_ID} ;;\r\n  \r\n  join: Portfolio_derived {\r\n    type: cross\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis would let you open that explore in the Explore UI and visually select Unlock price, upfront price, cumulative paid, and FRR, and query that. That&#39;s the easy part, &quot;building the query&quot;. The harder part is laying the framework for it, which is what I&#39;ve described a bit above. \r\n\r\nThis might be a helpful resource if you&#39;re comparing SQL to Looker queries, as it explains how Looker generates SQL: https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/how-looker-generates-sql\r\n\r\nThis explains how joins work and has links out to the lower-level components you have to build before you can join stuff. https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/working-with-joins\r\n\r\nGood luck!

In the backend I then ask the authorization server with the refresh token to get a new access token. Then I send the access token back to the frontend.\r\n\r\nA bit like here:\r\nhttps://medium.com/@ognjanovski.gavril/use-refresh-token-to-renew-access-token-and-resend-all-unauthorized-401-requests-that-failed-190e9c97fc3a\r\n\r\nBecause my access tokens expire after 5 min (to short?)

Please note that I do refer to a mail address other than my primary one. When I try send a message back (either by replying or regular send operation) I noticed a few pecularities.\r\n\r\n- Normally when one member of a distribution mail group sends a mail, the receiver should see &quot;ACCOUNT NAME on behalf of DISTRIBUTION GROUP NAME&quot;. Instead, the sender name is limited to the account name only. How can I get achieve the former mentioned structure.\r\n- After a mail is sent, it changes to a concept message and it doesn&#39;t move to the &quot;Sent items&quot; folder which I cannot seem to understand. This doesn&#39;t occur when I change the primary smtp address from a distribution group to my actual primary address. \r\n- When sending (or replying to) a mail from the Microsoft Exchange Server and as a member of a mail group distribution , I noticed that each message I sent, ends up getting saved in the &quot;Sent items&quot; folder of my PRIMARY mail address. I expected the same behaviour when using the library exchangelib but unfortunately.\r\n```\r\n# You can now create the Account without autodiscovering, using the cached values:\r\nconfig = Configuration(service_endpoint=ews_url, credentials=credentials, auth_type=ews_auth_type)\r\naccount = Account(\r\n    primary_smtp_address=primary_smtp_address, \r\n    config=config, autodiscover=False, \r\n    access_type=DELEGATE,\r\n)\r\n```\r\nand the code for replying to a mail\r\n```\r\n# &#39;m&#39; is the message instance we want to reply to \r\nm.reply(\r\n    subject=&#39;Re: Daily motivation&#39;,\r\n    body=&#39;I agree&#39;,\r\n    to_recipients=[&#39;carl@example.com&#39;, &#39;denice@example.com&#39;]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my question is how to solve the pecularities I mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099222/sending-mails-as-member-of-a-distribution-group-exchangelib","title":"Sending mails as member of a distribution group [Exchangelib]"},{"tags":["nginx","url-rewriting","uri","proxypass"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":538,"user_id":9612225,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"flaixman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9612225/flaixman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569424035,"creation_date":1569424035,"answer_id":58101503,"question_id":58099221,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58101503","body_markdown":"You can proxy_pass to host+uri.\r\n\r\n    location  ~ ^/foo/(.*)$ {\r\n        include proxy_params;\r\n        proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1/bar/$1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr rewrite and proxy_pass should work:\r\n\r\n\r\n    location  ~ ^/foo {\r\n        rewrite ^foo(.*) /bar$1\r\n        proxy_pass   http://example.com;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI hope any of those 2 works for you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099221/rewrite-rules-without-changing-uri-in-nginx/58101503#58101503","title":"Rewrite rules without changing uri in Nginx"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":4844078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JhQSErjD3O8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAvU/lFgEWLmCvx8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ponicorn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4844078/ponicorn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7723,"user_id":6028607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JUJdo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vincent G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6028607/vincent-g"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58101503,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569424035,"creation_date":1569417009,"last_edit_date":1569422802,"question_id":58099221,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58099221","body_markdown":"How can I rewrite an uri without returning a redirect in the process in Nginx ?
