Would this work? \r\n\r\nNo.  That would break the DbContext, and prevent you from writing queries that joins the lookup items with non-cached items.  So you&#39;ll need a seperate cache.  You can try a pattern like this:\r\n\r\n    public class Db : DbContext\r\n    {\r\n        private IMemoryCache _memoryCache;\r\n        public Db(IMemoryCache memoryCache)\r\n        {\r\n            _memoryCache = memoryCache;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class EntityCache\r\n        {\r\n            private Db db;\r\n            public EntityCache(Db db)\r\n            {\r\n                this.db = db;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public IList&lt;LK_ProductType&gt; LK_ProductTypes =&gt; db._memoryCache.GetOrCreate&lt;IList&lt;LK_ProductType&gt;&gt;(&quot;LK_ProductTypeMemoryCache&quot;,f =&gt; db.LK_ProductTypes.AsNoTracking().ToList());\r\n        }\r\n        public EntityCache Cache =&gt; new EntityCache(this);\r\n      \r\n        public DbSet&lt;LK_ProductType&gt; LK_ProductTypes { get; set; }\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nUsage would be like\r\n\r\n    using var db = new Db(memoryCache);\r\n    var pt1 = db.LK_ProductTypes.ToList();  //from database\r\n    var pt2 = db.Cache.LK_ProductTypes; //from cache\r\n\r\nEF Core 3 introduces a new query interception framework, which should make it possible to introduce a query results cache in your DbContext.

Lookup tables only change few times a year, are mostly static, AddressCategory, CustomerStatus, ProductType . The database is composed of Large Transaction tables which should be read from Database, and lookup tables to be read from Memory.\r\n\r\nNote: Company has existing Linq queries, and want to auto forward existing code to Cache.\r\n\r\n**Method 1: EF InMemory / SQLite Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\n 1. Copy/Paste Original DbContext (StoreContext) into new DbContext copy called StoryMemoryContext. In Startup.cs\r\n\r\n        services.AddDbContext&lt;StoreContext&gt;(options =&gt; options.UseSqlServer(@&quot;Server=localhost;Database=StoreDatabase&quot;;));\r\n\r\n        services.AddDbContext&lt;StoreMemoryContext&gt;(options =&gt; options.UseInMemoryDatabase(databaseName: &quot;StoreMemoryContext&quot;));\r\n\r\n        services.AddDbContext&lt;CustomDbContext&gt;(options =&gt; options.UseSqlServer(@&quot;Server=localhost;Database=StoreDatabase&quot;)));\r\n\r\n 2. Save Lookup Mini lookup tables into InMemoryDatabase &#39;StoryMemoryContext&#39; (around 5 Mb max).\r\n 3. Have CustomDbContext inherit from original, where Original StoreContext get accessors forward to StoryMemoryContext.\r\n\r\nLoop code all lookup Tables with T4 or Powershell automation\r\n\r\n    public class CustomDBContext : StoreContext\r\n    {\r\n        public StoreMemoryContext _storeMemoryContext; = new StoreMemoryContext();\r\n        public CustomDBContext()\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override DbSet&lt;ProductType&gt; ProductType\r\n        {\r\n            set\r\n            {\r\n                base.ProductType = value;\r\n                _storeMemoryContext.ProductType = value;\r\n            }\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                return _storeMemoryContext.ProductType;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n   \r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n1) Would this Get method work? Any issues to research for? Feel free to revise/edit in answer. Open to any solution not only this, \r\n\r\nGet accessors seems to be working.\r\n\r\n - If executing `_customDbContext.ProductType.ToList()` , it reads InMemory EF. \r\n\r\n - `_customDbContext.CustomerTransaction.Include(c =&gt; c.ProductType).ToListAsync()` will read database, matching intended behavior. Don&#39;t want to read large non-lookup table customer transaction from InMemory Database.\r\n\r\n2) Set Accessors only partially works, since many ways exist to modify DBSet and DBContext: Add, AddRange, Remove, [Add Entity Graph][1] (is challenging to track) Physical lookup tables change only couple times a year. Thought about ChangeTracker, however to place If statement after every `SaveChanges()` to validate if lookup table changed/then update InMemory database, may slow application, as we have 500 transactions/per second. (this is what I was told? willing to hear more opinions about ChangeTracker and effect on performance/speed)\r\n Note: Physical and InMemory Lookup tables, can have 30 min sync period between two, per customer requirement, as lookup tables rarely change. However near instantaneous data sync between two is goal solution for question(&lt; 5 sec).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Method 2: MemoryCache Does not Seem to Work:**\r\nSimilar create Inherited/custom DbContext where read overrides forward lookup tables to MemoryCache. Storing DBContext in MemoryCache only stores IQueryable, not actual Materialized values. Going from controller to controller refreshes DbContext, and clears out cache, feel free to revise/edit in answer. \r\n\r\n    public class CustomDBContext : EcommerceContext\r\n    {\r\n        public CustomDBContext(IMemoryCache memoryCache)\r\n        {\r\n            _memoryCache = memoryCache;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override DbSet&lt;ProductType&gt; ProductType\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                return _memoryCache.Get&lt;DbSet&lt;ProductType&gt;&gt;(&quot;ProductTypeMemoryCache&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n   \r\n\r\n**Update:** \r\n\r\nAnswer from David Browne will not work for question requirements, as has\r\nUsage like\r\n\r\n    var pt2 = db.Cache.LK_ProductTypes; //from cache\r\n\r\nCompany has many existing queries, and want to forward existing code to Cache. Additionally,  programmers may forget to apply Cache, so code below should automatically forward\r\n\r\n    var pt1 = db.LK_ProductTypes.ToList() ;  \r\n\r\nWe have mix of large transactional tables which should not be cached and small lookup tables.\r\n\r\nDBA does not allow use SQL Server memory-optimized tables due to some limitations.

We used the website : https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backpropagation.html to get our errors calculated.\r\n\r\nWe are by no means expert&#39;s on the topic and would be happy to accept any help that we can get, so feel free to ask us any questions you like.\r\n\r\n    {def linearfunc(x): #The Linear Output function used for the Forward-Propagation\r\n        return(x)\r\n    \r\n    def linderiv(x):  #The Derivative of our Linear function used for the Back-Propagation\r\n        return(1)\r\n    \r\n    def backward(): #Back-Propagtion\r\n    \r\n        alpha = 0.001                                                       #Learning Rate\r\n    \r\n        Weights_Output = np.random.randn(5, 12288)   #Weights of the Output Layer / 5 is the number of neurons in the Hidden-Layer and 12228 the number of neurons in the Output Layer                                        \r\n        Bias_Output = np.random.randn(12288,1)       #Bias of the Output Layer / 12288 is always derived from the features of the Output Image, which is 64*64*3 (3 For the RGB Values)\r\n    \r\n        Weights = np.random.randn(768,5)             #Weights of the only Hidden-Layer / The number 768 is derived from the number of input features of the images being 16*16*3\r\n        Bias    = np.random.randn(5,1)               #Bias of the only Hidden-Layer\r\n    \r\n        #Start of the Back-Propagation for the Output-Layer\r\n        DW_Output  = np.zeros((12288,5))                                    #Preparing the shapes of DW in the Output-Layer for the Back-Propagation\r\n        DB_Output  = np.zeros((12288, 1))                                   #Preparing the shapes of DB in the Output-Layer for the Back-Propagation\r\n    \r\n        da_dz2    = linderiv(Z_Output)                                      #Applying the derivative of the Linear Function to our Z&#39;s in the Output-Layer / 1 Step                                                                 \r\n    \r\n        y         = np.load(&#39;DatasetY.npy&#39;)                                 #Loading our Output Features of our Dataset with the Y values            \r\n        a         = np.load(&#39;Activations.npy&#39;)                              #Loading the Activations of the previous Layer before the Output-Layer / Our only Hidden-Layer\r\n    \r\n        Error_Output = (activations_Output-y) * da_dz2                      #Computing DZ(The Error) of our Output-Layer by using the formula Error = (Activations in the Output-Layer - Y-Values) multiplied with the derivative of the ReLu function applied to the Z&#39;s of the Output Layer\r\n        DW_Output = np.dot(Error_Output , activations.T)                    #Computing DW of our Output-Layer by using the dot product of DZ_Output and our activations and then divide by the number of images in our Trainingset\r\n        DB_Output = np.sum(Error_Output, axis = 1, keepdims = True) * (1/10000)#Computing DB of our Output-Layer by summing up all of the DZ&#39;s along axis 1 to get the right shape\r\n    \r\n        Weights_Output = Weights_Output - alpha * DW_Output.T               #The Weights of the Output Layer perform the Gradient Descent Step / The first time they update they all go way too high or too low\r\n        Bias_Output = Bias_Output - alpha * DB_Output                       #The Bias of the Output Layer perform the Gradient Descent Step / The first time they update they all go way too high or too low\r\n    \r\n        #Start of the Back-Propagation for the Hidden-Layer\r\n    \r\n        dw  = np.zeros((5,768))                                                 #Preparing the shapes of dw in the only Hidden-Layer for the Back-Propagation\r\n        db  = np.zeros((5, 1))                                                  #Preparing the shapes of dw in the only Hidden-Layer for the Back-Propagation\r\n    \r\n        a_2    = np.load(&#39;DatasetX.npy&#39;)                                        #Loading the activations of the Layer previous to out Hidden-Layer, which would be the Input Features\r\n    \r\n        da_dz   = z &gt;= 0                                                        #Applying the derivative of the ReLu Function to our Z&#39;s in the Hidden-Layer / 1 Step               \r\n        da_dz   = da_dz.astype(np.int)                                          #Turning all the TRUE values into 1 and all the FALSE values into 0 / 2 Step\r\n    \r\n        Error = Error_Output * np.dot(Weights_Output.T , da_dz)    #&lt;&lt;

Therefore, if you want to write a single `foo` template declaration that is limited to accepting pointers to members (but accepts both `const` and non-`const` member functions) then it would have to be:\r\n\r\n    template &lt;class MemberOf, class F&gt;\r\n    void foo(F MemberOf::*func);\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;type_traits&gt;\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;class MemberOf, class F&gt;\r\n    void foo(F MemberOf::*func) {\r\n        static_assert(std::is_same&lt;F, void(int) const&gt;::value);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    struct S {\r\n        void bar(int) const {}\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n        foo(&amp;S::bar);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou cannot have `F`&#39;s argument types deduced at that point.

Say we have:\r\n\r\n* `(1, 2) =&gt; &quot;a&quot;`\r\n* `(1, 3) =&gt; &quot;b&quot;`\r\n* `(1, 4) =&gt; &quot;c&quot;`\r\n* `(2, 1) =&gt; &quot;d&quot;`\r\n* `(2, 2) =&gt; &quot;e&quot;`\r\n* `(2, 3) =&gt; &quot;f&quot;`\r\n\r\nThe particularity is that I want all the entries that have a specific value for the first field, but a range on the second field, i.e. I want all entries where `a = 1 AND 1 &lt; b &lt;= 4`. The `RangeBounds` operator in that case is not too complicated, it would be `(Excluded((1, 1)), Included((1, 4)))`.

Is there a way to solve that problem? It would be useful to be able to use `Unbounded` inside of the tuple, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right. The less interesting solution would be to have multiple layers of datastructures (for instance a hashmap for the first field, where keys map to... a BTreeMap). Any thoughts?

The declaration of the static member in your example is not a definition, so there is no problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem in your program is that you failed to define `B` before you define the static member variable in `A.cpp`.

But why I can&#39;t declare an static member this way? I mean the variable will not life inside any instance of the class, it won&#39;t add up to the object&#39;s size neither it&#39;s lifetime, it will be initialized the first time is used.

It would take too much CPU to calculate the actual distance between two points. What we did was divide the &quot;screen&quot; into larger Cartesian squares and avoid the actual distance calculation if the Delta-X or Delta-Y was &quot;too far away&quot; - That&#39;s just subtraction, so maybe something like that to qualify where the actual Eucledian distance metric calculation is needed (extend to n-dimensions as needed)?\r\n\r\nEDIT - expanding &quot;too far away&quot; candidate pair selection comments.\r\nFor brevity, I&#39;ll assume a 2-D landscape.\r\nTake the point of interest (X0,Y0) and &quot;draw&quot; an nxn square around that point, with (X0,Y0) at the origin.\r\n\r\nGo through the initial list of points and form a list of candidate points that are within that square. While doing that, if the DeltaX [ABS(Xi-X0)] is outside of the square, there is no need to calculate the DeltaY.\r\n\r\nIf there are no candidate points, make the square larger and iterate.\r\n\r\nIf there is exactly one candidate point and it is within the radius of the circle incribed by the square, that is your minimum.\r\n\r\nIf there are &quot;too many&quot; candidates, make the square smaller, *but you only need to reexamine the candidate list from this iteration, not all the points.*\r\n\r\nIf there are not &quot;too many&quot; candidates, then calculate the distance for that list. When doing so, first calculate DeltaX^2 + DeltaY^2 for the first candidate. If for subsequent candidates the DetlaX^2 is greater than the minumin so far, no need to calculate the DeltaY^2.\r\n\r\nThe minimum from that calculation is the minimum if it is within the radius of the circle inscribed by the square.\r\n\r\nIf not, you need to go back to a previous candidate list that includes points within the circle that has the radius of that minimum. For example, if you ended with one candidate in a 2x2 square that happened to be on the vertex X=1, Y=1, distance/radius would be SQRT(2). So go back to a previous candidate list that has a square greated or equal to 2xSQRT(2).\r\n\r\nIf warranted, generate a new candidate list that only includes points withing the +/- SQRT(2) square.\r\nCalculate distance for those candidate points as described above - omitting any that exceed the minimum calcluated so far.\r\n\r\nNo need to do the square root of the sum of the Delta^2 until you have only one candidate.\r\n\r\nHow to size the initial square, or if it should be a rectangle, and how to increase or decrease the size of the square/rectangle could be influenced by application knowledge of the data distribution.\r\n\r\nI would consider recursive algorithms for some of this if the language you are using supports that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224771/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-compute-the-euclidean-distance-of-the-neares/58228783#58228783","title":"What is the Most Efficient Way to Compute the (euclidean) Distance of the Nearest Neighbor in a List of (x,y,z) points?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12160841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-066MYN4YucA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfOAnOfywPEk1YFPg3X_OV32SWbbA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cole Pierson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12160841/cole-pierson"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12160841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-066MYN4YucA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfOAnOfywPEk1YFPg3X_OV32SWbbA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cole Pierson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12160841/cole-pierson"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58228783,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571765961,"creation_date":1570126519,"last_edit_date":1571765961,"question_id":58224771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58224771","body_markdown":"What is the most efficient way compute (euclidean) distance of the nearest neighbor for each point in an array?\r\n\r\nI have a list of 100k (X,Y,Z) points and I would like to compute a list of nearest neighbor distances.

Use the scipy.spatial.cdist to compute the full distances matrices\r\n2. Use a nearest X neighbors in radius R to find subset of neighbor distances for every point and return the smallest.\r\n\r\nResults are that Method 2 is faster than Method 1 but took a lot more effort to implement (makes sense).\r\n\r\nIt seems the limiting factor for Method 1 is the memory needed to run the full computation, especially when my data set is approaching 10^5 (x, y, z) points. For my data set of 23k points, it takes ~ 100 seconds to capture the minimum distances.\r\n\r\nFor method 2, the speed scales as n_radius^2. That is, &quot;neighbor radius squared&quot;, which really means that the algorithm scales ~ linearly with number of included neighbors. Using a Radius of ~ 5 (more than enough given application) it took 5 seconds, for the set of 23k points, to provide a list of mins in the same order as the point_list themselves. The difference matrix between the &quot;exact solution&quot; and Method 2 is basically zero.\r\n\r\nThanks for everyones&#39; help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224771/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-compute-the-euclidean-distance-of-the-neares","title":"What is the Most Efficient Way to Compute the (euclidean) Distance of the Nearest Neighbor in a List of (x,y,z) points?"},{"tags":["sql","oracle","plsql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":891,"user_id":10496710,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5cb3d11da053d8e1e94ef99a27ca6af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"B.

However, you also have to make sure it is included after the element that it applies to already exists; it won’t work otherwise. Here, we can accomplish that by adding it to the output of the `renderMenu()` call as an additional child of the menu item created with `menuItem()`:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\noutput$test &lt;- renderMenu({\r\n  menu &lt;- menuItem(&quot;test_tabs&quot;, do.call(tagList, tabs_list))\r\n  tagAppendChildren(menu, sortable_js(&quot;test_tabs&quot;))\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the id that you give to `sortable_js()` has to be the CSS id of the element whose children you want to make sortable. In this case, that would be the `ul` element inside the `menuItem()`, which contains all of the sub-items. Unfortunately there is no way to directly set this id when creating the menu item, so we have to inject it after the fact. A quick inspection of the `menuItem()` source code reveals that the `ul` tag is the second child of the menu item tag:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\noutput$test &lt;- renderMenu({\r\n  menu &lt;- menuItem(&quot;test_tabs&quot;, do.call(tagList, tabs_list))\r\n  menu$children[[2]] &lt;- tagAppendAttributes(menu$children[[2]], id = &quot;test_tabs&quot;)\r\n  tagAppendChildren(menu, sortable_js(&quot;test_tabs&quot;))\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these modifications, your example will be up and running:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\nlibrary(shinydashboard)\r\nlibrary(sortable)\r\n\r\n# Define UI for shinydashboard\r\nui &lt;- dashboardPage(\r\n  dashboardHeader(),\r\n  dashboardSidebar(\r\n    sidebarMenu(\r\n      menuItem(&quot;tab_one&quot;, tabName = &quot;test_body&quot;),\r\n      menuItemOutput(&quot;test&quot;)\r\n    )\r\n  ),\r\n  dashboardBody(\r\n    tabItem(&quot;test_body&quot;, actionButton(&quot;click_me&quot;, &quot;Click Me&quot;))\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Define server logic to dynamically create menuSubItems\r\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\r\n  observeEvent(input$click_me, {\r\n    tabs_list &lt;- lapply(1:5, function(x) {\r\n      menuSubItem(text = paste(&quot;tab&quot;, x))\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    output$test &lt;- renderMenu({\r\n      menu &lt;- menuItem(&quot;test_tabs&quot;, do.call(tagList, tabs_list))\r\n      menu$children[[2]] &lt;- tagAppendAttributes(menu$children[[2]], id = &quot;test_tabs&quot;)\r\n      tagAppendChildren(menu, sortable_js(&quot;test_tabs&quot;))\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Run the application\r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;Created on 2019-10-16 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v0.3.0)&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224759/dynamically-create-sortable-menusubitems-in-shinydashboard/58411077#58411077","title":"Dynamically create sortable menuSubItems in shinydashboard"}],"owner":{"reputation":302,"user_id":6039074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac0c361e8591de5aed419612e791dedb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"code_cowboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6039074/code-cowboy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":302,"user_id":6039074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac0c361e8591de5aed419612e791dedb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"code_cowboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6039074/code-cowboy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":107,"favorite_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58411077,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571221780,"creation_date":1570126485,"last_edit_date":1570128678,"question_id":58224759,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58224759","body_markdown":"I have a Shiny app using the `shinydashboard` package in which I&#39;m dynamically creating `menuSubItem`s in the `sidebarMenu` of a `dashboardSidebar`.

The partition itself is a commit log working just in append mode from a producer point of view.\r\nOf course, it means that without any kind of mechanisms like deletion (by retention time) and compaction, the partition size could grow endlessly.\r\nAt this point you could think .. &quot;so it&#39;s not immutable!&quot; as you mentioned.\r\nWell, as I said the immutability is from a producer&#39;s point of view. Deletion and compaction are administrative operations.\r\nFor example, deleting records is also possible using the Admin Client API ... but we are always talking about administrative stuff, not producer/consumer related stuff.\r\n\r\nIf you think about compaction and how it works, the producer initially sends, for example, a message with key = A and payload = &quot;Hello&quot;. After a while in order to &quot;update&quot; the value, it sends a new message with same key = A and payload = &quot;Hi&quot; ... but actually it&#39;s a really new message appended at the end of the partition log; it will be the compaction thread in the broker doing the work of deleting the old message with &quot;Hello&quot; payload leaving just the new one.\r\nIn the same way a producer can send the message with key = A and payload = null. It&#39;s the way for actually deleting the message (null is called &quot;tombstone&quot;). Anyway the producer is still appending a new message to the partition; it&#39;s always the compaction thread which will delete the last message with key = A when it saw the tombstone.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224758/what-does-it-really-mean-by-kafka-partitions-are-immutable/58225722#58225722","title":"What does it really mean by &quot;Kafka partitions are immutable&quot;?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":429,"user_id":3621944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEKLf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3621944/andrey"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570136819,"creation_date":1570136819,"answer_id":58226896,"question_id":58224758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58226896","body_markdown":"Data in Kafka is stored in topics, topics are partitioned, each partition is further divided into **segments** and finally each segment has a log file to store the actual message, an index file to store the position of the messages in the log file and timeindex file, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ls -l /mnt/data/kafka/*consumer*/00000000004618814867*\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 kafka kafka 10485760 Oct  3 23:41 /mnt/data/kafka/__consumer_offsets-7/00000000004618814867.index\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 kafka kafka  8189913 Oct  3 23:41 /mnt/data/kafka/__consumer_offsets-7/00000000004618814867.log\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 kafka kafka 10485756 Oct  3 23:41 /mnt/data/kafka/__consumer_offsets-7/00000000004618814867.timeindex\r\n```\r\nIn scenario where ```log.cleanup.policy``` (or ```cleanup.policy``` on particular topic) set to *delete*, occur complete delete some of log segments (one or more).\r\n\r\nIn scenario where params set to *compact* the compaction is done in the background by periodically **recopying** log segments: it recopies the log from beginning to end removing keys which have a later occurrence in the log.

This means that under normal circumstances, if object A references object B, object A will be destroyed before object B.\r\n\r\nThis fails if the object survives until global destruction. There are two circumstances where this happens:\r\n\r\n* Reference cycle. If two objects directly or indirectly reference each other, the order of destruction of the objects involved in the cycles is unpredictable.\r\n\r\n* Global variable. The order in which objects referenced by package variables (and therefore objects directly or indirectly referenced by them) is unpredictable (though Perl does try to do the right thing).\r\n\r\nSo if the log holds a reference to a session object (as it appears you are doing), the log will be destroyed first (within the limits I mentioned above).\r\n\r\nIf the objects are in package variables instead of lexical (`my`) variables, and if you don&#39;t want to change that, you could use the following in the main program:\r\n\r\n    use Sub::ScopeFinalizer qw( scope_finalizer );\r\n \r\n    # Here or wherever.\r\n    our $log;\r\n    our $session;\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        # The lexicals within these curlies will get destroyed before\r\n        # global destruction. This will lead to the code ref provided to\r\n        # scope_finalizer getting called before global destruction.\r\n\r\n        my $guard = scope_finalizer {\r\n           # The order doesn&#39;t matter because the log object \r\n           # holds a reference to the session object.\r\n           $log     = undef;\r\n           $session = undef;\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        # ... Main program here ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs long as the log holds a reference to the session, this will ensure that the objects are destroyed in the correct order. Even if the program dies or exits.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can tell if objects of a class are surviving until global destruction by adding the following code to the program and examining the order of the output:\r\n\r\n    DESTROY { warn($_[0]-&gt;id . &quot; destroyed.\\n&quot;); }  # In the class\r\n\r\n    END { warn(&quot;Global destruction.&quot;); }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. In this post, I&#39;m using the word &quot;object&quot; loosely. I don&#39;t just means instances of classes, but also scalars, arrays, hashes subs and other values and variables.\r\n\r\n    Similarly, referencing refers not just to a Perl reference, but other forms of referencing. For example, arrays and hashes reference their elements, and subs reference variables they capture, etc.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224753/controlling-order-of-object-destruction/58224888#58224888","title":"Controlling order of object destruction"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4355766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8169dba6aa92a9b76e2eb654fd79659?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ardidaj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4355766/ardidaj"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58224888,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570130033,"creation_date":1570126470,"question_id":58224753,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58224753","body_markdown":"My web application uses a Log module to record various events.  The log object is initialized by being passed a CGI::Session object containing various information about the user. This information gets copied to the log object&#39;s data fields. Owing to the volume of activity on the site and the fact that a single visit to the site can result in multiple loggable events, the log module currently caches all events in memory, then actually writes them to the log file in the DESTROY function.  However, this results in the session parameters being frozen at the time the log object is initialized, which occurs at the beginning of the request. \r\n\r\nRecently, some new parameters were required to be logged that a) would be stored in the session object, and b) needed to be logged as their final, instead of initial value (and would potentially change during execution).  My initial idea was to instead store a reference to the session object in the log object, but as the DESTROY function typically is called in global destruction, I have no guarantee that the session object will still be defined when the log is destroyed.  Is there a way to guarantee that the CGI::Session object won&#39;t be destroyed before my log, hopefully without having to add an explicit destruct to each page of the

A fully custom heap impl is one way to go. But I wanted to rely on C++ STL for desired operations.     \r\nC++ documentation and StackOverflow answer [here][1] pointed me to use a custom class and overload custom `remove` method. I also overloaded custom comparator in the same class.\r\n\r\n    template&lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    class custom_priority_queue_MinHeap : public std::priority_queue&lt;T, std::vector&lt;T&gt;&gt;\r\n    {\r\n      public:\r\n      bool remove(const T&amp; value) \r\n      {\r\n        auto it = std::find(this-&gt;c.begin(), this-&gt;c.end(), value);\r\n        if (it != this-&gt;c.end())\r\n        {\r\n            this-&gt;c.erase(it);\r\n            std::make_heap(this-&gt;c.begin(), this-&gt;c.end(), this-&gt;comp);\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      bool operator()(const pair&lt;int, int&gt; &amp;a, const pair&lt;int, int&gt; &amp;b)\r\n      {\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Custom comparator called&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;  &lt;----------- Never called\r\n        return a.second &gt; b.second;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nConsumption of the custom heap looks something like:   \r\n \r\n\tcustom_priority_queue_MinHeap&lt;pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; minHeap;\r\n\tminHeap.push({0, 10});\r\n\tminHeap.push({1, 5});\r\n\tminHeap.push({2, 15});\r\n\t\t\r\n\twhile(!minHeap.empty())\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpair&lt;int, int&gt; p = minHeap.top();\r\n\t\tminHeap.pop();\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; p.first &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; p.second &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nWhen run on [Ideone][2], minHeap `push` is not working as expected. It flashes below output:    \r\n\r\n    2 15\r\n    1 5\r\n    0 10    \r\nThe correct output should be:    \r\n\r\n    1 5\r\n    0 10  \r\n    2 15      \r\nThe `()` comparator overload is never called which seems to be the culprit. Elements are getting popped in the order they were inserted. Interestingly, `remove` function is working fine. \r\n\r\n**Question(s):**    \r\nIs it possible to fully rely on C++ priority_queue STL to achieve desired operations, i.e. custom comparator with support of removal of any element?

An element that is styled as disabled (greyed out) using CSS, is not considered disabled.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224713/how-to-get-selenium-to-wait-on-multiple-elements-to-load/58225705#58225705","title":"How to get selenium to wait on multiple elements to load"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":738,"user_id":1312320,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebf28b20dae6510720e69b1310422fd2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sardok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312320/sardok"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570132012,"creation_date":1570132012,"answer_id":58225956,"question_id":58224713,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58225956","body_markdown":"`WebDriverWait.until` expects callable object.

Well, I tried to put function showCommentsArea() inside viewNews() function, but it shows me same comments in every article, I want like separated comments for every article, like on Facebook, I mean, when you enter someone&#39;s post (in this case article), you can publish a comment only for that post (article).\r\n\r\nI tried putting showCommentsArea() function inside viewNews() function, right after displaying timestamp of that article.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Function for viewing news. #\r\n    function viewNews()\r\n    {\r\n      global $db;\r\n      $query = &quot;SELECT * FROM newsmodule ORDER BY timestamp&quot;;\r\n      $result = @mysqli_query($db, $query);\r\n      if (!$result)\r\n      {\r\n        echo &quot;Error selecting headline from database.&quot;;\r\n        exit();\r\n      }\r\n      if (mysqli_num_rows($result) &gt; 0)\r\n      {\r\n        echo &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;margin-left: 0; width: 100%;&#39; class=&#39;jumbotron&#39;&gt;&quot;;\r\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_object($result))\r\n        {\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; . $row-&gt;headline . &quot;&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; . $row-&gt;storyline . &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;h5 class=&#39;pull-right&#39;&gt;&quot; . $row-&gt;username . &quot;&lt;/h5&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; . $row-&gt;timestamp . &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo showCommentArea();\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;a data-target=&#39;#postComment&#39; class=&#39;text-white dropdown-toggle btn btn-danger&#39; data-toggle=&#39;modal&#39; type=&#39;button&#39;&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo  &quot;Publish a Comment&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        echo &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n      else\r\n      {\r\n        echo &quot;No headlines in database.&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n```\r\nfunction showCommentArea()\r\n    {\r\n      global $db, $errors, $username;\r\n      if(count($errors) == 0)\r\n      {\r\n        $query = &quot;SELECT comment, name FROM comments\r\n                  JOIN newsmodule ON comments.articlecID=newsmodule.id WHERE newsmodule.id=comments.articlecID&quot;;\r\n        $result = @mysqli_query($db, $query);\r\n        if(!$result)\r\n        {\r\n          echo &quot;SQL Query ERROR: !ERR_SQL_QUERY_01&quot;;\r\n          exit();\r\n        }\r\n        if (mysqli_num_rows($result) &gt; 0) {\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;h4&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;Comments:&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;/h4&gt;&quot;;\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n          while ($row = mysqli_fetch_object($result)) {\r\n            echo &quot;&lt;p class=&#39;text-danger&#39; style=&#39;font-weight: bold;&#39;&gt;&quot; . $row-&gt;name . &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;\r\n            echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; . $row-&gt;comment . &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;\r\n          }\r\n          echo &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I expect to have one individual comments section for one individual post, you see I tried to add it with JOINING tables, but it shows me entire table &#39;comments&#39;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224709/how-to-fix-comment-section-in-php-and-mysql","title":"How to fix comment section in PHP and MySQL?"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8100}
