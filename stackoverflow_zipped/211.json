There are a few different solutions posted about it, including:\r\n\r\n- reinstall Visual Studio\r\n- Remove mspdb140.dll, it should be included with the PATH variable\r\n- Add mspdb140.dll (and other files) to `&lt;msvc-install-dir&gt;\\&lt;subpath&gt;`\r\n\r\nIn my case, I have used the build tools for msvc 2019 installer in a docker container, and then installed both build tools for msvc 2017 and 2019. If I then go to `C:\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.16.27023\\bin\\HostX64`, there are two folders: `x64` and `x86`. If I write the powershell command `ls -Recurse -Filter &quot;*mspdb*&quot;`, I get the following output:\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.16.27023\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\r\n      mspdb140.dll\r\n      mspdbcmf.exe\r\n      mspdbcore.dll\r\n      mspdbsrv.exe\r\n      mspdbst.dll\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.16.27023\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\1033\r\n      mspdbcmfui.dll\r\n\r\nThere is none of these files in the `HostX64\\x86` directory though. If I build with x64 as target everything goes fine, but with x86 as target, both the release and debug build gets error. The release build has:\r\n\r\n    ERROR: C:\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.16.27023\\bin\\HostX64\\x86\\cl.exe\r\n    ...\r\n    c1xx: fatal error C1356: unable to find mspdbcore.dll\r\n\r\nand the debug build has:\r\n\r\n    ERROR: C:\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.16.27023\\bin\\HostX64\\x86\\cl.exe\r\n    ...\r\n    c1xx: fatal error C1356: unable to find mspdb140.dll\r\n\r\nThese builds are using Qt and Qbs, and Qbs uses vcvarsall.bat to find the environment variables needed. There is a bug in Qbs when having multiple installed msvc toolchains, which makes Qbs always choose the newest one. To work around this, I manually move vcvarsall.bat and replace it with this in each build job:\r\n\r\n    call %~dp0vcvarsall_real.bat %1 store 10.0.17134.0 -vcvars_ver=14.16.27023 || exit /b 1\r\n\r\nThis forces vcvarsall to choose the toolchain 14.16.27023 that I want.\r\n\r\nI managed to fix both of the compilation errors by simply copying the DLL and EXE files that exists for the x64 target, except `mspdbcmfui.dll`. There is no reason for not copying that last DLL, as I am just experimenting. Even though the program compiles, I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m doing, where these files are used, or why they are missing for some targets! It would feel better to not have to manually copy files in my build environment.\r\n\r\nI also checked my local installation of Visual Studio 2017 Professional, and then I have the same name of the files for HostX64\\x64, but for HostX64\\x86 I get this output:\r\n\r\n    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\WDProfesional\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.16.27023\\bin\\Hostx64\\x86\r\n    ...\r\n    mspdb140.dll\r\n    mspdbcore.dll\r\n\r\nOnly two of the DLLs!\r\n\r\nIn the docker image, I also have the build tools for MSVC 2019, and there all of the host and target combinations have all of the DLLs and EXEs.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n- Why are there missing DLLs in some cases\r\n- What is the correct way of fixing this?\r\n- How does Visual Studio compile differ from using vcvarsall.bat and external tools, as it is clearly able to compile without copying DLLs/EXEs!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485842/what-is-the-proper-usage-of-msdpb-files-when-compiling-with-msvc","title":"What is the proper usage of msdpb* files when

the easiest way (`vb.NET`) to update a full `OleDB` table from a previous modified imported table?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I have.\r\n\r\nFirst I import the table from an `Access` Database:\r\n\r\n    Dim PRDB As String = &quot;Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;                                    \r\n                          Data Source=&lt;location&gt;;\r\n                          Jet OLEDB:Database Password=&lt;password&gt;&quot;                                                        \r\n    Dim CNDB As New OleDb.OleDbConnection(PRDB)                                                                              \r\n    Dim CMDB As New OleDb.OleDbCommand                                                                                \r\n    Dim ADDB As New OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter(CMDB)                                                                       \r\n    Dim TBDB As New DataTable                                                                                                    \r\n\r\n    Try : CNDB.Open()\r\n    Catch EX As Exception : MsgBox(EX.ToString) : End Try\r\n    \r\n    Try : CMDB.CommandText = &quot;SELECT * FROM [TABLE 01]&quot; : ADDB.Fill(TBDB)\r\n    Catch EX As Exception : MsgBox(EX.ToString) : End Try\r\n\r\nSo far so good. I managed to import `TABLE 01` successfully to `TBDB`.\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s say I change one cell of the `DataTable`:\r\n\r\n    TBDB.Rows(2).Item(3) = &quot;CHANGED&quot;\r\n\r\nIs there a way to update directly the `OleBD` table without describing the changed cell adress? Something like\r\n\r\n    ADDB.Update(TBDB) (?)\r\n\r\nI already tried the last bit of code but it didn&#39;t work (I think it works only if the argument is a `DataRow` not a `DataTable`).\r\n\r\nI researched this matter, but all the answers I found looked a lit bit complicated for this (apparent) simple task. So I wonder if there is a more direct way to do this - I also read something about `Binders`, but I didn&#39;t quite understand the method.\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485787/easiest-way-to-update-a-oledb-table-from-a-datatable","title":"Easiest way to update a OleDB table from a DataTable"},{"tags":["django","django-rest-framework"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1153,"user_id":5638542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YW89i.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jacek B Budzynski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5638542/jacek-b-budzynski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571660264,"post_id":58485784,"comment_id":103303003,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485784/nested-serializer-data-in-django-rest-framework#comment103303003_58485784"},{"owner":{"reputation":89,"user_id":9733755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c575c89383142a43237068a53cee083?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gamer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9733755/gamer"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1153,"user_id":5638542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YW89i.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jacek B Budzynski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5638542/jacek-b-budzynski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571680175,"post_id":58485784,"comment_id":103313317,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485784/nested-serializer-data-in-django-rest-framework#comment103313317_58485784"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":89,"user_id":9733755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c575c89383142a43237068a53cee083?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gamer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9733755/gamer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571729512,"post_id":58498626,"comment_id":103327234,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485784/nested-serializer-data-in-django-rest-framework/58498626#comment103327234_58498626"},{"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":10979187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wfo8xOAP2xs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNKasK70i7rQ19IBTAu0ScKffhlYQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"HabibUllah Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10979187/habibullah-khan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":89,"user_id":9733755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c575c89383142a43237068a53cee083?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gamer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9733755/gamer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571737096,"post_id":58498626,"comment_id":103331321,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485784/nested-serializer-data-in-django-rest-framework/58498626#comment103331321_58498626"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":10979187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wfo8xOAP2xs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNKasK70i7rQ19IBTAu0ScKffhlYQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"HabibUllah Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10979187/habibullah-khan"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571727345,"creation_date":1571727345,"answer_id":58498626,"question_id":58485784,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58498626","body_markdown":"Try Nested Serializers, It will solve your problem.

Applications must sign their\r\n&gt; AWS API requests with AWS credentials, and this feature provides a\r\n&gt; strategy for managing credentials for your applications to use,\r\n&gt; similar to the way that Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide\r\n&gt; credentials to EC2 instances. Instead of creating and distributing\r\n&gt; your AWS credentials to the containers or using the EC2 instance’s\r\n&gt; role, you can associate an IAM role with an ECS task definition or\r\n&gt; RunTask API operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the when you assign role to ECS task or ECS service your entrypoint will be that simple.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprintenv\r\naws s3 cp s3://BUCKET/file.txt /PATH/file.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, your export will not work as you are expecting, the best way to pass ENV to container form [task definition][3], [export][4] will not in this case.\r\n\r\nI will suggest assigning role to ECS task and it should work as you are expecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33379393/docker-env-vs-run-export","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485776/aws-ecs-load-s3-files-in-entrypoint-script/58486172#58486172","title":"AWS - ECS load S3 files in entrypoint script"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":8563982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/46a9bfe690031b27d71a5c2477b09dee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"milunas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8563982/milunas"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58486172,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571661316,"creation_date":1571658869,"question_id":58485776,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58485776","body_markdown":"### Hi all! ###\r\n\r\nCode: (entrypoint.sh)\r\n```\r\nprintenv\r\nCREDENTIALS=$(curl -s &quot;http://169.254.170.2$AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI&quot;)\r\n\t\r\nACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo &quot;$CREDENTIALS&quot; | jq .AccessKeyId)\r\nSECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo &quot;$CREDENTIALS&quot; | jq .SecretAccessKey)\r\nTOKEN=$(echo &quot;$CREDENTIALS&quot; | jq .Token)\r\n\t\r\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$ACCESS_KEY_ID\r\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\r\nexport AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$TOKEN\r\n\r\naws s3 cp s3://BUCKET/file.txt /PATH/file.txt\r\n```\r\nProblem:\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to fetch AWS S3 files to ECS inspired by: \r\n\t[AWS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-manage-secrets-for-amazon-ec2-container-service-based-applications-by-using-amazon-s3-and-docker/)\r\n(But I&#39;m fetching from S3 directly, not throught VPC endpoint) &lt;br /&gt;\r\nI have configured bucket policy &amp; role policy (that is passed in taskDefinition as taskRoleArn &amp; executionRoleArn) &lt;br /&gt;\r\nLocally when I&#39;m fetching with aws cli and passing temporary credentials (that I logged in ECS with printenv command in entrypoint script) everything works fine.

In fact, at least in go, gRPC uses TCP by default.\r\n\r\nIf the requirement is only that machine A communicates using TCP sockets, but you can use external libraries, then it should be fairly easy to use the gRPC library of the language of your choice to implement the client/server interaction on top of the raw TCP sockets.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you **can not** use the gRPC library, while still possible you would have to implement the gRPC protocol yourself, and possibly the http/2 one as well if you can&#39;t use any external library; this would likely be a lot of work, and you may be better off creating a simpler, ad-hoc RPC protocol for your use case. \r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nThe updated question makes the requirements clearer. If you need to use a specific TCP library, but you can use gRPC on top of that, then I think the difficulty of the task really depends on the programming language.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in go it would be as easy as creating a wrapper struct, implement the `net.conn` interface for it, and use it with the `withDialer` option when creating the client.

This sample code will resolve all the validators you need:\r\n\r\n    [Fact]\r\n    public void Test()\r\n    {\r\n        var container = new SimpleInjector.Container();\r\n\r\n        container.Collection.Append&lt;IValidator&lt;IOrder&gt;, OrderValidator&gt;();\r\n        container.Collection.Append&lt;IValidator&lt;Command&gt;, CommandValidator&gt;();\r\n\r\n        var validators = container.GetAllInstances&lt;IValidator&lt;Command&gt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        validators.Should().HaveCount(2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlternatively you have to explicitly register your validators parameterized with all commands they must apply to:\r\n\r\n    [Fact]\r\n    public void Test()\r\n    {\r\n        var provider = new ServiceCollection()\r\n            .AddTransient(typeof(IValidator&lt;Command&gt;), typeof(OrderValidator))\r\n            .AddTransient(typeof(IValidator&lt;Command&gt;), typeof(CommandValidator))\r\n            .BuildServiceProvider();\r\n    \r\n        var validators = provider.GetServices&lt;IValidator&lt;Command&gt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n        validators.Should().HaveCount(2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote the difference between `IOrder` and `Command` for `OrderValidator` registration in case of Simple Injector and .NET Core DI container:\r\n\r\n    container.Collection.Append&lt;IValidator&lt;IOrder&gt;, OrderValidator&gt;();\r\n    servcies.AddTransient(typeof(IValidator&lt;Command&gt;), typeof(OrderValidator))\r\n\r\nAssuming following classes and interfaces are defined:\r\n    \r\n    interface IOrder\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class Command : IRequest&lt;CommandResponse&gt;, IOrder\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class CommandResponse\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class OrderValidator : AbstractValidator&lt;IOrder&gt;\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class CommandValidator : AbstractValidator&lt;Command&gt;\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://simpleinjector.org","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485674/using-multiple-fluentvalidators-on-mediatr-pipeline/58525947#58525947","title":"Using multiple FluentValidators on MediatR pipeline"}],"owner":{"reputation":1558,"user_id":1242827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02766ec440c27a10a29ccb482ffad949?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RBasniak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1242827/rbasniak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1311,"user_id":2343739,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbAyK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Collin Barrett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2343739/collin-barrett"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"bounty_amount":50,"bounty_closes_date":1572446228,"accepted_answer_id":58525947,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571848359,"creation_date":1571658424,"last_edit_date":1571840304,"question_id":58485674,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58485674","body_markdown":"I have a MediatR pipeline behavior like this:\r\n\r\n    public class FailFastRequestBehavior&lt;TRequest, TResponse&gt; : IPipelineBehavior&lt;TRequest, TResponse&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly IEnumerable&lt;IValidator&gt; _validators;\r\n\r\n        public FailFastRequestBehavior(IEnumerable&lt;IValidator&lt;TRequest&gt;&gt; validators)\r\n        {\r\n            _validators = validators;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Task&lt;TResponse&gt; Handle(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestHandlerDelegate&lt;TResponse&gt; next)\r\n        {\r\n            var failures = _validators\r\n                .Select(async v =&gt; await v.ValidateAsync(request))\r\n                .SelectMany(result =&gt; result.Result.Errors)\r\n                .Where(f =&gt; f != null);\r\n\r\n\r\n            return failures.Any()\r\n                ?

\r\n                    services.AddScoped(result.InterfaceType, result.ValidatorType));\r\n\r\nThis works nice for the `MyUseCase.Validator`, it is injected on the pipeline and is executed, validating the `MyUseCase.Command`.\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s a large application, and many commands have common properties, i.e. every order operation receives an `OrderId` and I have to check if the Id is valid, if the entity exists in database, if the authenticated user is the owner of the order being modified, etc.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to create the following interface and validator:\r\n\r\n    public interface IOrder\r\n    {\r\n        string OrderId { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class IOrderValidator : AbstractValidator&lt;IOrder&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        public IOrderValidator()\r\n        {\r\n            CascadeMode = CascadeMode.StopOnFirstFailure;\r\n\r\n            RuleFor(x =&gt;

Also, we work with a lot of commands. For these reasons and another more, **I would like that when a model is saved, it validates itself**. \r\n\r\nThe problem appears in hasMany relationships, because we need save first parent, and next child.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```php\r\nclass Car extends Model\r\n{\r\n    public static function boot()\r\n    {\r\n        parent::boot();\r\n        static::saving(function ($car) {\r\n            if (!$car-&gt;builder) {\r\n                throw new \\Exception(&#39;Woops!

Code:\r\n\r\n    Sub tagging2()\r\n    Dim rng As Range, shp As Shape, n As Integer, arr() As String, arr1() As String, m As Integer\r\n    m = 1\r\n    n = ActiveSheet.Shapes.Count\r\n    ReDim arr(n)\r\n          For Each shp In ActiveSheet.Shapes\r\n              arr(m) = shp.TopLeftCell.Address\r\n              m = m + 1\r\n          Next\r\n    m = 1\r\n    n = Selection.Cells.Count\r\n    ReDim arr1(n)\r\n        For Each rng In Selection\r\n            arr1(m) = rng.Address\r\n             m = m + 1\r\n        Next\r\n    m = 1\r\n    n = 1\r\n        For Each rng In Selection\r\n            Do While m &lt;= ActiveSheet.Shapes.Count\r\n               If arr1(n) = arr(m) Then\r\n                  rng.Offset(0, 30).Value = &quot;Yes&quot;\r\n                  Exit Do\r\n               End If\r\n               m = m + 1\r\n           Loop\r\n              If IsEmpty(rng.Offset(0, 30)) Then\r\n                 rng.Offset(0, 30).Value = &quot;No&quot;\r\n              End If\r\n          n = n + 1\r\n          m = 1\r\n        Next\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485650/picture-in-certain-cells-in-range","title":"Picture In Certain Cells In Range"},{"tags":["vb.net","http","browser",".net-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":80061,"user_id":1663001,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBllQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DavidG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663001/davidg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571658474,"post_id":58485647,"comment_id":103302086,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485647/browserversion-userlanguages-request-url-in-vb-net-core-2-2#comment103302086_58485647"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":7647981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e58d53fb112b9e755d2e053239c27a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Soumika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7647981/soumika"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":80061,"user_id":1663001,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBllQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DavidG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663001/davidg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571658819,"post_id":58485647,"comment_id":103302261,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58485647/browserversion-userlanguages-request-url-in-vb-net-core-2-2#comment103302261_58485647"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":7647981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e58d53fb112b9e755d2e053239c27a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Soumika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7647981/soumika"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571658333,"creation_date":1571658333,"question_id":58485647,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58485647","body_markdown":"I am converting my vb.net solution to .net core 2.2.
