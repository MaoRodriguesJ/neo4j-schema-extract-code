it seems you have the [same question running twice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57952104/how-to-use-api-data-as-centerpoint-of-circles-in-angular-google-maps) with slightly different information in both?\r\n\r\nThe async pipe is so that you can pass an observable and it will handle the subscribing and unsubscribing for you.\r\n\r\nBased on the code you have in the other version of this question that&#39;s not your scenario.\r\n\r\nYour other questions code has a bug because [you need to unsubscribe](https://brianflove.com/2016/12/11/anguar-2-unsubscribe-observables/).\r\n\r\nTo make this work with the `| async` pipe though, what you need to do is pass the observable in, before you `.subscribe()`.\r\n\r\nFor *that* to work you need to prep your data beforehand using rxjs pipe + map (or switchMap).\r\n\r\nFor example [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54085199/156388) shows how to change the data in the observable without subscribing to it, so that it could be passed to an async pipe after.\r\n\r\nThat pretty much comes to the limit of what I can help with though because it&#39;s complicated for me and I couldn&#39;t write the code unless I had a demo to play around with and figure it out through trial and improvement.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not entirely sure if you have described your code accurately. The screenshot you have shared: is that a screenshot of what the api is returning, or a screenshot of `this.data` after you have transformed it? Because this:\r\n\r\n    if (this.earthquake_status &amp;&amp; this.earthquake_status.length)  {\r\n      for(let i=0; i&lt; this.earthquake_status.length; i++){\r\n        this.data = res[0].features;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLooks like it destroys your data not outputs the example you have given us a screenshot.\r\n\r\nIs this api public?

code is not finding the correct element to append these options to because of the selector you have used. The space in your jQuery selector `$currentField.find(&#39;.choices li&#39;)` will match each `li` element descending from an element with the `choices` class. This means that it picks up `li` elements in your `sub-choices` div.\r\n\r\nTry changing `$currentField.find(&#39;.choices li&#39;).last()` to `$currentField.find(&#39;.choices &gt; ul &gt; li&#39;).last()`to only get the last `li` in the `choices` div.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your code then clears these sub-choices when it loops for the second question. Remove `$currentField.find(&#39;.sub-choices ul&#39;).empty();` to stop this.\r\n\r\n[jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/srcqa9gj/)\r\n\r\nThe rest of your selectors will need to be checked for the same issue as per your comment regarding the additional choices. This particular one can be fixed by changing `$currentField.find(&#39;.choices ul&#39;).append(addChoice(subType));` to `$currentField.find(&#39;.choices &gt; ul&#39;).append(addChoice(subType));`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949707/jquery-append-li-tag-to-ul-tag-using-class/57950964#57950964","title":"jquery append &lt;li&gt;

If not, then you should include only those data points that have an ROI above some threshold defined by you.\r\n\r\nApproach 1) Simple feed-forward neural net. Your input  [surface temperature, rains, temperature, soil properties, etc], your output: [crop type]. By this, we model it as a classification problem. \r\n\r\nIf you want to include weather data over long time, then modify your input [(surface temperature, rains, temperature, soil properties, etc) @ t1, (surface temperature, rains, temperature, soil properties, etc) @ t2, etc] . Your output [crop type @ tn] where n is your current time. \r\n\r\nApproach 2) if you want to preserve the spatial dimension and that you think nearby pixel data is also important for the prediction, then encode that pixel info into your input too. Otherwise, you can use some spatio-temporal model like described here https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5955-convolutional-lstm-network-a-machine-learning-approach-for-precipitation-nowcasting\r\n\r\nYour other question `weather changes that lead to a change on crop type`\r\n\r\nThis can modelled as a binary classification problem where you want to predict given an input weather condition the output (change or no change in crop). Your input:  [surface temperature, rains, temperature, soil properties, etc], your output: [change or no change]\r\n\r\nThere are many ways you can solve this second question starting from a simple logistic regression, svms or use more powerful deep learning models depending on the data you have. \r\n\r\nHope this helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949683/how-to-work-with-this-time-series-data-for-crop-prediction/57965967#57965967","title":"How to work with this time series data for crop prediction?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10432039,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-G3ilSf70lEQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DVFYUPH8gDzSHcuiF66N6WxSt0EcQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dani San","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10432039/dani-san"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":3750257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KF8gx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pppery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3750257/pppery"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57965967,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568681062,"creation_date":1568600568,"last_edit_date":1568679154,"question_id":57949683,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57949683","body_markdown":"I am trying to make a model that analyzes recommended crop types for a certain area.\r\n\r\nFor my ROI I already have the historical data for each pixel from 2005 to 2009, that includes:\r\n\r\n 1.

I did find it curious React doesn&#39;t give more guidance on this. I&#39;m not sure what others are doing but this is what I came up with. \r\n\r\nFirst I make sure the dispatch from `useReducer` is added to the context. This is the interface for that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport interface IContextWithDispatch&lt;T&gt; {\r\n  context: T;\r\n  dispatch: Dispatch&lt;IAction&gt;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen given this context: \r\n```\r\nexport interface IUserContext {\r\n  username: string;\r\n  email: string;\r\n  password: string;\r\n  isLoggedIn: boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI can do this:\r\n```\r\nexport const UserContext = createContext&lt;IContextWithDispatch&lt;IUserContext&gt;&gt;({\r\n  context: initialUserContext,\r\n  dispatch: () =&gt; {\r\n    return initialUserContext;\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my top level component I memoize the context because I only want one instance. This is how I put it all together\r\n```\r\nimport memoize from &#39;lodash/memoize&#39;;\r\nimport {\r\n  IAction,\r\n  IContextWithDispatch,\r\n  initialUserContext,\r\n  IUserContext,\r\n} from &#39;./domain&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst getCtx = memoize(\r\n  ([context, dispatch]: [IUserContext, React.Dispatch&lt;IAction&gt;]) =&gt;\r\n    ({ context, dispatch } as IContextWithDispatch&lt;IUserContext&gt;),\r\n);\r\nconst UserProvider = ({ children }) =&gt; {\r\n  const userContext = getCtx(useReducer(userReducer, initialUserContext)) as IContextWithDispatch&lt;\r\n      IUserContext\r\n      &gt;;\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    // api call to fetch user info\r\n  }, []);\r\n  return &lt;UserContext.Provider value={userContext}&gt;{children}&lt;/UserContext.Provider&gt;;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nYour userReducer will be responding to all `dispatch` calls and can make API calls or call another service to do that etc... The reducer handles all changes to the `context`.\r\nA simple reducer could look like this:\r\n```\r\nexport default (user, action) =&gt; {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case &#39;SAVE_USER&#39;:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...user,\r\n        isLoggedIn: true,\r\n        data: action.payload,\r\n      }\r\n    case &#39;LOGOUT&#39;:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...user,\r\n        isLoggedIn: false,\r\n        data: {},\r\n      }\r\n    default:\r\n      return user\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my components I can now do this:\r\n\r\n```const { context, dispatch } = useContext&lt;IContextWithDispatch&lt;IUserContext&gt;&gt;(UserContext);```\r\n\r\nwhere `UserContext` gets imported from the `export` defined above.\r\n\r\nIn your case, if your route `example.com/form/:username/:form-id` doesn&#39;t have the data it needs it can `dispatch` an `action` and listen to the context for the results of that action. Your reducer can make any necessary api calls and your component doesn&#39;t need to know anything about it. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949662/best-practice-for-combining-react-usecontext-and-one-time-data-load-react-hooks/57966737#57966737","title":"Best practice for combining React useContext and one-time data load (React hooks)?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":585,"user_id":4723005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XF2bN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kwhitejr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4723005/kwhitejr"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570418861,"creation_date":1570418861,"answer_id":58263169,"question_id":57949662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58263169","body_markdown":"Managed to accomplish most of what I wanted.

The form data is shared and shareable across these sibling components via a React context and the React hook `useContext`.\r\n\r\nI am stumbling on how to optionally async load data into the same context. For example, if the browser URL is `example.com/form`, then the form can load with the default values provided by a `FormContext` (no problem). But if the user is returning to finish a previously-edited form by navigating to `example.com/form/:username/:form-id`, then application should fetch the data using those two data points. Presumably this must happen within the FormContext somehow, in order to override the default empty form initial value.\r\n\r\n 1. Are url params even available to a `React.createContext` function?\r\n 2. If so, how to handle the optional data fetch requirement when [hooks are not to be used with in a conditional][1]?\r\n 3. How to ensure that the data fetch occurs only once?\r\n 4. Lastly, the form also saves current state to local storage in order to persist values on refresh. If the data fetch is implemented, should a refresh load the async data or the local storage? I&#39;m leaning towards local storage because that is more likely to represent what the user last experienced.

Recently, I added a **Service** directory to **.../src/AppBundle**, and create, configure, and successfully execute an example service container that I found in the Symfony documentation, but I couldn&#39;t run x-debugger from phpStorm on the code in new service container when I put an debug mark next to the service container&#39;s line where I wanted to break.  The red disc changed to a red disc with a x inside indicating that the directory wasn&#39;t mapped.  With that example running, just not debugging, I put my own service-controller file in the **Service** directory, configured it, and am able to run it, but still can debug it.  Again, no errors are being displayed when I run it, but the x shows in the debug break-point marker.\r\n\r\nI tried to fix this by changing the top directory of my project one level up, **.../src/AppBundle/Controller** to **.../src/AppBundle**, the parent of Controller and Service.  I also changed this in the server-side mapping, and I added two new include directories: **.../src/AppBundle/Server** and **.../src/Appbundle/Controller**. \r\n\r\nNote the actual directories include the full path names, not actually the **.../src/AppBundle/Controller** and **.../src/AppBundle**, as I show here.\r\n\r\nAfter making all of these changes, I can still run the debugger and break on marked lines in the files contained under the **.../src/AppBundle/Controller** and its subdirectories, so the top level directory change appears to be working. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t think that this isn&#39;t a protection issue, because I can access the service container file using FileZilla to upload changes I make to the service container, and I use the same account in both programs.\r\n\r\nI know that the code is actually running, because I get back a ***FALSE*** value inspecting the **$this-&gt;loggedin** variable and I can see the **$message** is being set.  Here is the code that makes the call to the service-container:\r\n\r\n    $this-&gt;loggedin = empty( $message = $this-&gt;container\r\n                                             -&gt;get( &#39;app.checkloggedin&#39; )\r\n                                             -&gt;checkLoggedIn( $this,\r\n                                                              $userData,\r\n                                                              $userData ) );\r\n\r\nI&#39;m placing the break-point on this line and the next one after it.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here?\r\n\r\nP.S., The documentation concerning service-container say that they only load once when they are first called.  In my code I don&#39;t assign the $this-&gt;container-&gt;get(...) to a variable, so in other functions in the same controller, when I call the above, again, will the class/method(s) still only be loaded once or do I need to assign the get(...) results to a variable to ensure it loads only once?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949630/phpstorm-debugger-not-stopping-on-lines-in-my-new-service-container-marked-with","title":"phpStorm debugger not stopping on lines in my new service-container marked with a break-point, but it does in controllers and included files"},{"tags":["pytorch"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1151,"user_id":3983454,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4601cbbcaa3b1bb6f9c847c82ec3f164?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"santoku","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3983454/santoku"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568654963,"post_id":57950625,"comment_id":102335004,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949625/with-pytorch-dataloader-how-to-take-in-two-ndarray-data-label/57950625#comment102335004_57950625"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":75689,"user_id":1714410,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a254f486ab076ab1af26162a975e90f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1714410/shai"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568610021,"creation_date":1568610021,"answer_id":57950625,"question_id":57949625,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57950625","body_markdown":"You can [convert][2] your data/label ndarrays to `torch.tensor` and use [`torch.utils.data.TensorDataset`][1] to create a dataset that iterates over your examples.  \r\nOnce you have a dataset, you can wrap a [`DataLoader`][3] around it to be used for training.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://pytorch.org/docs/1.1.0/data.html#torch.utils.data.TensorDataset\r\n [2]: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.from_numpy\r\n [3]: https://pytorch.org/docs/1.1.0/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949625/with-pytorch-dataloader-how-to-take-in-two-ndarray-data-label/57950625#57950625","title":"With pytorch DataLoader how to take in two ndarray (data &amp; label)?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1695,"user_id":7212365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBxLp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zihaozhihao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7212365/zihaozhihao"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568657451,"creation_date":1568657451,"answer_id":57962290,"question_id":57949625,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57962290","body_markdown":"As @Shai mentioned, `DataLoader` requires the input to be the `Dataset` class or its subclass.

API is returning the network type as &quot;public&quot; when it is in fact connected to the AD.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n---\r\nI have a credential provider that at user logon, uses [```INetworkListManager::GetNetworks```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/netlistmgr/nf-netlistmgr-inetworklistmanager-getnetworks) to enumerate all networks on a client and uses [```INetwork::GetCategory```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/netlistmgr/nf-netlistmgr-inetwork-getcategory) and [```INetwork::GetDomainType```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/netlistmgr/nf-netlistmgr-inetwork-getdomaintype) to determine whether the client is connected to AD. If yes, it&#39;ll proceed to use the [```IADsUser```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/iads/nn-iads-iadsuser) interface to query the AD for the user&#39;s groups. The AD connectivity check is necessary because if there was no AD connection, the query groups operation would stall for many seconds before failing, and this adversely impacts user experience. The following problem appeared after upgrading from Window 7 to 10.\r\n\r\nProblem\r\n---\r\nFrequently, ```GetCategory``` returns [```NLM_NETWORK_CATEGORY_PUBLIC```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/netlistmgr/ne-netlistmgr-nlm_network_category) and ```GetDomainType``` returns [```NLM_DOMAIN_TYPE_NON_DOMAIN_NETWORK```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/netlistmgr/ne-netlistmgr-nlm_domain_type) both before **and after** a successful AD query for the user&#39;s groups. The values should have been ```NLM_NETWORK_CATEGORY_DOMAIN_AUTHENTICATED``` and ```NLM_DOMAIN_TYPE_DOMAIN_AUTHENTICATED```. After logon, Network and Sharing Center shows that user is connected to domain network. This means ```GetCategory``` and ```GetDomainType``` can no longer be counted on to reliably return network connectivity information. What could be causing this problem?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, are there other ways to resolve the problem of query groups operation stalling when there is no AD connection?\r\n\r\nEdit: some new findings. The problem frequently occurs immediately after boot, and goes away if we:\r\n\r\n- wait for ~5 minutes before logging in.\r\n- unplug, then plugin in the network cable, then wait ~30 seconds before logging in.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949605/windows-network-list-manager-api-returns-incorrect-connectivity-information","title":"Windows Network List Manager API returns incorrect connectivity information"},{"tags":["mongodb","aggregation-framework"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21690,"user_id":6238977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBcTp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mickl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6238977/mickl"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568600918,"creation_date":1568600918,"answer_id":57949715,"question_id":57949603,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57949715","body_markdown":"Using `$lookup` you would need to merge all documents from both collections into single document and then run some set logic on it to remove duplicates. 1[6 MB is the maximum size][1] of a single MongoDB document so you may reach this threshold easily if your collections are big. \r\n\r\nMongoDB 4.2 brings new [$merge][2] operator which will allow you to &quot;join&quot; two collections:\r\n\r\n    db.colA.aggregate([\r\n        {\r\n            $merge: {\r\n                into: &quot;colB&quot;,\r\n                on: &quot;Id&quot;,\r\n                whenMatched: &quot;replace&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#BSON-Document-Size\r\n  [2]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/merge/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949603/how-to-simply-join-two-collections-into-one-and-remove-dupulication-in-mongodb/57949715#57949715","title":"how to simply join two collections into one and remove dupulication in mongoDB"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":7010933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1689511538033207/picture?type=large","display_name":"Emily Chen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7010933/emily-chen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21690,"user_id":6238977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBcTp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mickl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6238977/mickl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568601004,"creation_date":1568599546,"last_edit_date":1568601004,"question_id":57949603,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57949603","body_markdown":"I only need to join two collections together without merge or combine with any objects. \r\n\r\nFor example, I have two collections with the same structures.\r\n\r\nFrom **Collection A**\r\n\r\n    {&quot;Id&quot;: 12345678, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Em&quot;, &quot;text&quot; : &quot;MongoDB is hard to learn&quot;}\r\n    {&quot;Id&quot;: 1234, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Fm&quot;, &quot;text&quot; : &quot;MongoDB is fun&quot;}\r\n\r\nFrom **Collection B**\r\n\r\n    {&quot;Id&quot;: 12345678, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Em&quot;, &quot;text&quot; : &quot;MongoDB is hard to learn&quot;}\r\n    {&quot;Id&quot;: 678, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Gm&quot;, &quot;text&quot; : &quot;MongoDB is ok&quot;}\r\n\r\nAll I need is to bring collection A and Collection B to collection C and remove the duplication (which is `Id&quot;123345678&quot;`). \r\n\r\n**Collection C** should be \r\n\r\n    {&quot;Id&quot;: 12345678, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Em&quot;, &quot;text&quot; : &quot;MongoDB is hard to learn&quot;}\r\n    {&quot;Id&quot;: 1234, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Fm&quot;, &quot;text&quot; : &quot;MongoDB is fun&quot;}\r\n    {&quot;Id&quot;: 678, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Gm&quot;, &quot;text&quot; : &quot;MongoDB is ok&quot;}\r\n\r\nI searched a lot but people usually want to involve object using `$lookup` which I don&#39;t need to involve any o jects.

These Gateways are public (regional) and accessed via public consumers. \r\n\r\nOn an ah-hoc basis, we do back-end releases, which entail removing the Gateway for external (public) access. The process is then, to make all deployments needed and then test the Gateway once public again. \r\n\r\n- We go &quot;internal&quot; but adding the current `load balance(s)` into a group that&#39;s only accessible via internal IP range.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to know if there would be a way whereby we could access the same Gateway internally, whilst we are `offline`, to help speed up testing once back to external.

The font size is decleared in relative unite (em)\r\n2. Div1, Div2 and Div3 are child and grand child of one another.\r\n\r\nSo the issue is, each div&#39;s font size is changing depending on it&#39;s parent div.\r\n\r\nPossible solution.\r\n1. If you need parent child relationship between divs then change font-size unite to px.\r\n\r\n2. If there is no problem separating the divs from each other and add one after one as sibling. then you can use relative unite for font size.\r\n\r\n**Note** : don&#39;t use transition property all for huge number of items which&#39;s transition are triggered at the same time. It creates performance issue.\r\n\r\nAlso try to avoid * selector if you are adding transition on a huge number of element.\r\n Define specific property which you want to change. It also improve performance.\r\n\r\n## Option one - separating divs\r\n\r\n&lt;script async src=&quot;//jsfiddle.net/vg1dtLrk/embed/html,css,result/&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .large .animate {\r\n      font-size: 3em;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .animate {\r\n      transition: font-size 0.5s;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    body {\r\n      font-size: 1em;\r\n      font-family: sans-serif;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    button {\r\n      margin-bottom: 25px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;button onclick=&quot;document.getElementById(&#39;text-container&#39;).classList.toggle(&#39;large&#39;)&quot;&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;text-container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;one&quot; class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;\r\n        One\r\n\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;two&quot; class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;\r\n        Two\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;three&quot; class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;\r\n        Three\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;\r\n        Four\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n## Option two - changing the font size unite to px.\r\nBut there is a problem, in this approach.

Right now whenever using voice with Google Assistant, every time the assistant finishes responding, it tries to catch a user response. This is problematic, because I have a simple response with a rich response that is a BasicCard with a url button link.

Is there a solution for this? \r\n\r\nIt seems like the reason it goes back is because the assistant wants to prompt the user for a response.

Or would it be possible to not prompt the user for a response after the assistant responds?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using node.js and I have tried both `conv.ask` and `conv.add`, but they both automatically catch audio from the user right away after the voice response finishes from the Action.\r\n\r\nI am using an iOS device for testing.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949486/linking-from-my-actions-on-google-to-a-web-url","title":"Linking from my Actions on Google to a web url"},{"tags":["javascript","json","reactjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":28141,"user_id":9624435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h44B4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Code Maniac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9624435/code-maniac"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568598343,"post_id":57949479,"comment_id":102311773,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949479/make-two-arrays-into-json-data#comment102311773_57949479"},{"owner":{"reputation":159,"user_id":10005216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1K2bN.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James H","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10005216/james-h"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568598688,"post_id":57949479,"comment_id":102311832,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949479/make-two-arrays-into-json-data#comment102311832_57949479"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11959734,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba01aaa08082c16dc237bfde6d6cce28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11959734/jay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568598352,"post_id":57949491,"comment_id":102311775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949479/make-two-arrays-into-json-data/57949491#comment102311775_57949491"},{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11959734,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba01aaa08082c16dc237bfde6d6cce28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11959734/jay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568598537,"post_id":57949491,"comment_id":102311814,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949479/make-two-arrays-into-json-data/57949491#comment102311814_57949491"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2245,"user_id":11081214,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b53d0cefd959372f49e84b943a1187f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Snow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11081214/snow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2245,"user_id":11081214,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b53d0cefd959372f49e84b943a1187f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Snow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11081214/snow"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568598354,"last_edit_date":1568598354,"creation_date":1568598302,"answer_id":57949491,"question_id":57949479,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57949491","body_markdown":"Put `a` as the `animal` property of `call`, and `b` as the `mood` property of `call`:\r\n\r\n    call = { animal: A, mood: B };\r\n\r\nIf the arrays are meant to be of strings, then make sure to put `&#39;` around each string, like\r\n\r\n    A = [&#39;cat&#39;, ...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57949479/make-two-arrays-into-json-data/57949491#57949491","title":"Make two arrays into json data"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":664,"user_id":9999417,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_D9-v2Bi8D8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq0yXnSaIoK7oO_ZNBFBPiw0SKjpsw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joven28","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9999417/joven28"},"last_editor":{"reputation":664,"user_id":9999417,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_D9-v2Bi8D8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq0yXnSaIoK7oO_ZNBFBPiw0SKjpsw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joven28","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9999417/joven28"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568598972,"last_edit_date":1568598972,"creation_date":1568598565,"answer_id":57949515,"question_id":57949479,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57949515","body_markdown":"As easy as this.
