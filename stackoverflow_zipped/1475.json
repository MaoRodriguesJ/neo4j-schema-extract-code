A number of them have a resource bundle defined as a private final field that&#39;s initialized when the object is created via new. I declare a mocked ResourceBundle, use PowerMock&#39;s mockStatic method to enable static mocking, and mock the getBundle method to return my mocked ResourceBundle. However, when the constructor runs the code to initialize the field, it simply creates the new resource bundle rather than using the mocked one. I feel like there&#39;s one little detail I&#39;ve missed, but I don&#39;t know what it might be.\r\nThe reason all this is a problem is this: when I run the test locally, it creates the ResourceBundle object without issue. But when the test is run via our build software (UCBuild), it throws a &quot;can&#39;t find resource&quot; exception and the test, and therefore the build, fails.\r\n\r\nWhen I run a test in debug and set a method breakpoint on the constructor, I can see that the &quot;strings&quot; object is created using an actual resource bundle, not the mocked one. I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried declaring the field without initializing it, then using class.getDeclaredField() and Field.setAccesible() to set the resource bundle to point at my mocked one, but of course this just gets overwritten if I run code that re-initializes the field.\r\n\r\nThe WorkerTest class which tests Worker.java:\r\n```java\r\n@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)\r\n@PrepareForTest({FacesContext.class, SaveStatus.class, FacesMessage.class, ResourceBundle.class})\r\npublic class WorkerTest {\r\n@Mock\r\n\tprivate ResourceBundle mockRB;\r\n\t\r\n\t@Before\r\n\tpublic void setUp() throws Exception {\r\n    \tPowerMockito.mockStatic(ResourceBundle.class);\r\n    \tPowerMockito.when(ResourceBundle.getBundle(anyString())).thenReturn(mockRB);\r\n  \t    PowerMockito.when(mockRB.getString(anyString())).thenReturn(&quot;tst&quot;);\r\n    \t\r\n\t\tsut = new Worker();  // Breakpoint here to verify mockRB exists\r\n    }\r\n...some tests\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWorker.java:\r\n```java\r\n@Named\r\n@ApplicationScoped\r\npublic class Worker implements Serializable {\r\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 4075799125164038417L;\r\n    private final ResourceBundle strings = ResourceBundle\r\n            .getBundle(&quot;com.resources.strings&quot;);\r\n\r\n    public Worker() {  //method breakpoint here\r\n          \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191235/resourcebundle-getbundle-returning-actual-object-in-spite-of-mockstatic-and-when","title":"ResourceBundle.getBundle returning actual object in spite of mockStatic and when() directing otherwise"},{"tags":["spring-security","jboss","single-sign-on","saml-2.0","wildfly-8"],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":8856863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ded32d27cee7d3b93d1fd0be50d96201?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ksnagendran26","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8856863/ksnagendran26"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569958513,"creation_date":1569958513,"question_id":58191234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191234","body_markdown":"I&#39;m setting up OKTA SAML 2.0 integration with Struts 1.0 in Wildfly 8.1.0.

Keeping the latest N service versions around will give you those N sets of static assets you desire.\r\n\r\nIn general, this deployment practice is good/recommended for a few other reasons:\r\n\r\n- avoids potential outages, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40192557/continuous-integration-deployment-delivery-on-google-app-engine-too-risky/40193364#40193364\r\n- avoids potential traffic loss while GAE spins up enough new version instances to handle the traffic load, see 2nd half of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45332283/gae-shutdown-or-restart-all-the-active-instances-of-a-service-app/45335739#45335739\r\n\r\nPotentially of interest: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48319789/google-frontend-retention-between-deployments/48332694#48332694\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/tools/uploadinganapp#deploying_an_app","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191207/google-app-engine-keep-previous-versions-static-files/58195329#58195329","title":"Google App Engine - keep previous version&#39;s static files"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9048,"user_id":291180,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Crlpe.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Travis Webb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/291180/travis-webb"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569991915,"creation_date":1569991915,"answer_id":58195385,"question_id":58191207,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58195385","body_markdown":"Deploy using the `--no-promote`  flag, and utilize the [Traffic Migration][2] feature in the Standard Environment to gradually migrate traffic over to the new version so that all users don&#39;t experience an immediate switchover the moment the new version goes live.

Judging code to be *understandable* is somewhat subjective. What may seem clear to me can appear incomprehensible to someone else (and vice versa). However, there are common idioms in C programming that should be followed whenever it is appropriate to do so.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do not have at the top of my head a handy list of idioms. But, I can say I largely learned C from reading *The C Programming Language* (by K &amp; R, of course). And I was an avid reader of *C Programming FAQs* (by Steve Summit).\r\n\r\nHowever, a very good resource for C idioms can be found by reading and comprehending open source C projects, and of course the source code base of the company you work at. Following the latter has the added benefit that any code you add that follows existing conventions will naturally increase the chances of it being understood by someone else in the company.\r\n\r\n&gt; &lt;sub&gt;I often hear people say that the code has to be written so that even junior programmer would easily be able to understand it and the modern compilers are &quot;smart&quot; enough to take care of the optimizations. Now I have an evidence that it is not true (or at least not always true).&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\r\nCompilers are just programs, so they cannot read your mind. The compiler will be programmed to look for particular patterns in the AST and apply optimizations to transform the tree into what it considers more optimal. Similarly, the peephole optimizer will look for patterns in the generated machine instructions, and then transform them into fewer equivalent instructions.\r\n\r\nBut these transformations are only possible if the generated tree or generated instructions follow a recognizable pattern. And these patterns are often determined by analyzing real-world software to see what kind of code gets generated for certain operations. If your code does not result in code that can be recognized by the compiler, you may be partially losing out on the compilers help to optimize.\r\n\r\nThus, another reason to try to write idiomatic C code.\r\n\r\nNow, it can be argued that forcing oneself to write idiomatic C is a form of micro-optimization. Should you try to teach the compiler how to optimize the way you write code, or let the compiler teach you how to write code it knows how to optimize? However, the momentum is carried by the existing C programmers that write code idiomatically. New C programmers adopt these idioms for the sake of writing code more easily understood by the people that will be reviewing their code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/2182002/315052","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191162/how-to-write-compiler-understandable-c-code/58192879#58192879","title":"How to write compiler &quot;understandable&quot; C code?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4825,"user_id":5218277,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZuEZa.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Lop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5218277/alex-lop"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":106,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570055539,"creation_date":1569958243,"question_id":58191162,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191162","body_markdown":"Recently I had to write a code for critical real time functionality and I used few *__builtin_...* functions.

I compiled it with different compilers and different optimization levels, the results were not so good:\r\n\r\n1. **GCC** - did great! For both [`-O3`][2] and [`-Os`][3] optimization levels it gave the same result for all the functions:\r\n\r\n        reverse:\r\n                mov     eax, edi\r\n                bswap   eax\r\n                ret\r\n        reverse1:\r\n                mov     eax, edi\r\n                bswap   eax\r\n                ret\r\n        reverse2:\r\n                mov     eax, edi\r\n                bswap   eax\r\n                ret\r\n        reverse3:\r\n                mov     eax, edi\r\n                bswap   eax\r\n                ret\r\n\r\n2. **Clang** a little disappointed me. With the [`-O3`][4] it gave the same result as GCC however with the [`-Os`][5] it totally lost the path in `reverse1`. It didn&#39;t recognize the pattern and produced way less optimal binary:\r\n\r\n        reverse1:                               # @reverse1\r\n                lea     rax, [rsp - 8]\r\n                mov     dword ptr [rax], edi\r\n                mov     ecx, 3\r\n        .LBB1_1:                                # =&gt;This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1\r\n                mov     sil, byte ptr [rax]\r\n                mov     dl, byte ptr [rsp + rcx - 8]\r\n                mov     byte ptr [rax], dl\r\n                mov     byte ptr [rsp + rcx - 8], sil\r\n                dec     rcx\r\n                inc     rax\r\n                cmp     rcx, 1\r\n                jne     .LBB1_1\r\n                mov     eax, dword ptr [rsp - 8]\r\n                ret\r\nActually the difference between `reverse` and `reverse1` is that `reverse` is the &quot;loop unrolled&quot; version of `reverse1`, so I assume that with `-Os` the compiler didn&#39;t even try to unroll or try to anticipate the purpose of the `for` loop.\r\n\r\n3. With the **ICC**, the things went even worse because it was unable to recognize the pattern in `reverse` and `reverse1` functions both with the [`-O3`][6] and the [`-Os`][7] optimization levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nI often hear people say that the code has to be written so that even junior programmer would easily be able to understand it and the *modern* compilers are &quot;smart&quot; enough to take care of the optimizations. Now I have an evidence that it is not true (or at least not always true).\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/bswap\r\n  [2]: https://godbolt.org/z/L8wvWM\r\n  [3]: https://godbolt.org/z/w0ERXJ\r\n  [4]: https://godbolt.org/z/WCdK5D\r\n  [5]: https://godbolt.org/z/prOY9W\r\n  [6]: https://godbolt.org/z/S6dHnx\r\n  [7]: https://godbolt.org/z/EL0n9k","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191162/how-to-write-compiler-understandable-c-code","title":"How to write compiler &quot;understandable&quot;

However; for Parent to be able to modify the list, the list has to be available in it&#39;s closure so after changing the list the onClick callback has to change (new closure to the list).\r\n\r\nLets investigate how useEventCallback solves this:\r\n\r\n    function useEventCallback(fn) {\r\n      //ref will never change during component life cycle\r\n      const ref = React.useRef();\r\n\r\n      //every time useEventCallback is called we set ref.current again.\r\n      //  we can add fn as a dependency but if you see how Parent calls it\r\n      //  it will have the same outcome because useEventCallback(()=&gt;...)\r\n      //  causes fn to be different every time anyway\r\n      useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n        ref.current = fn;\r\n      });\r\n      //here we return a function that will never change during the component\r\n      //  life cycle but what it does will change during it&#39;s life cycle\r\n      //  because we keep mutating ref and resetting ref.current\r\n      return React.useCallback(\r\n        (...args) =&gt; ref.current.apply(void 0, args),\r\n        []//you can do [ref] here but linter knows ref will never change so no needfor it\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe see that no matter how many times we call `useEventCallback` during a component life cycle the returned value will never change (never change reference, the implementation will change because we mutate ref and reset the callback)\r\n\r\nHere is a full example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: true --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function useEventCallback(callback) {\r\n      //ref will never change during component life cycle\r\n      const ref = React.useRef();\r\n\r\n      //every time useEventCallback is called we set ref.current again.\r\n      //  we can add fn as a dependency but if you see how Parent calls it\r\n      //  it will have the same outcome because useEventCallback(()=&gt;...)\r\n      //  causes fn to be different every time anyway\r\n      React.useEffect(() =&gt;

Using the mvnw script, I am experiencing compilation failures.\r\n   \r\n   The problem is that the company I am working for has a set of proprietary classes and JARs that it wants to use in the Spring Boot \r\napplication. The company is using Eclipse. These proprietary resources are in separate source folders (in the case of the java files) and folders (in the case of the jars). In the IDE we can set the jars to be included in the compilation, and when we compile and run the application as a runnable jar, everything compiles.\r\n\r\n   Unfortunately, if we want to create a deployment, it doesn&#39;t matter whether we are creating a war or a jar, mvnw does not find the company&#39;s java or jar files and the compilation fails.\r\n   \r\n   There is no problem creating the WAR file. We make the appropriate changes to the pom file and the main class, and as long as we don&#39;t use the company proprietary stuff, mvnw compiles and runs the jar (or it properly creates the WAR which runs well on Tomcat). It is only when we want to use the proprietary code that the mvnw compilation fails.\r\n   \r\n   I amcertain that there has got to be some way to make mvnw include external jars and code in external packages, because surely other companies have proprietary code in jars that they need to include in a Spring Boot application. I just don&#39;t know how to do it.\r\n   \r\n   So how does one include such code in a Spring Boot application, such that mvnw will compile it?\r\n

think there&#39;s pretty much no benefit to using something like `decodeURI()` or `escape()` which aren&#39;t meant for this. \r\n\r\nI would recommend passing it through something like [PostCSS][1] in order to parse the CSS first. This has multiple benefits from both a security and functionality point of view. Firstly it (should) be able to detect any syntax errors which will in turn harden you against code injection. You&#39;re relying on the security of PostCSS or whatever parser you&#39;re using but this is better than nothing. It will also makes it easier to add functionality such as debug messages or CSS prefixing in future.\r\n\r\nFor the more specific question of *&#39;is it safe to inject CSS unescaped?&#39;*: I will note my relatively basic investigation appears to suggest that `&lt;style&gt;` elements do seem to have some protection against script injection anyway, at least compared to other tags. Usually with injected code (via innerHTML) you can inject some code via doing [something like this][2]\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; onerror = &quot;alert(1);&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever it seems that for a style tag then since it&#39;s contents will always be considered a [Text node][3], (indeed you have explictly set it to be a text node in your example) then that&#39;s not something which would appear to be possible. \r\n\r\nI would still definitely pass it through a parser in any case, to be sure. (I will update this answer if I find any method of executing JavaScript via a style tag).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://postcss.org/\r\n  [2]: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/60861/why-are-scripts-injected-through-innerhtml-not-executed-whilst-onerror-and-other\r\n  [3]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-style-element","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191103/how-to-escape-internal-css/58191637#58191637","title":"How to escape internal css?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4584,"user_id":203708,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a384aa4d1fcd1368ab8085aaf2ca67c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jwerre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/203708/jwerre"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4584,"user_id":203708,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a384aa4d1fcd1368ab8085aaf2ca67c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jwerre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/203708/jwerre"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569960681,"creation_date":1569957928,"last_edit_date":1569959336,"question_id":58191103,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191103","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to insert some user generated css into the `head` of my html using javascript. The issue is that when I escape certain characters break the CSS. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\tlet css = `\r\n\t\t@import url(&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&amp;display=swap&#39;);\r\n\t\tbody { font-family: &quot;Roboto&quot;, sans-serif; }\r\n\t\t`,\r\n\t\tstyle = document.createElement(&#39;style&#39;);\r\n\r\n\tstyle.type = &#39;text/css&#39;;\r\n\tdocument.head.appendChild(style);\r\n    css = escape(css);\r\n\tstyle.appendChild( document.createTextNode( css ) );\r\n```\r\n\r\noutputs:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; id=&quot;custom-theme-styles&quot;&gt;\r\n\t@import url(&amp;#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&amp;amp;display=swap&amp;#39;);\r\n\tbody { font-family: &amp;quot;Roboto&amp;quot;, sans-serif !important; }\r\n\t&lt;/style&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the the single and double quotes produce `&amp;#39;` and `&amp;quot;` respectively. The ampersand in the query string converts to `&amp;amp;`. I could also see issues using the css child combinator (&gt;).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to escape the css so that it doesn&#39;t break and renders securely? It feels like a bad idea, but if I don&#39;t escape the css, is this even a security concern? I could be wrong but I don&#39;t think a `&lt;script&gt;` tag inside a `&lt;style&gt;` tag would execute. Are there any other vulnerabilities I&#39;m missing with not escaping the css?\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191103/how-to-escape-internal-css","title":"How to escape internal css?"},{"tags":["python","datetime","format","valueerror"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":11274560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-djJt3CmyDg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABf0/MejC6IO0fiI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MCO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11274560/mco"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569959552,"post_id":58191298,"comment_id":102762200,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191101/valueerror-time-data-datetime-datetime2018-8-21-14-14-18-233000-do/58191298#comment102762200_58191298"},{"owner":{"reputation":331,"user_id":6237334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc092220cbdcb823b99b48f95315c06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Emmanuel Arias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6237334/emmanuel-arias"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53,"user_id":11274560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-djJt3CmyDg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABf0/MejC6IO0fiI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MCO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11274560/mco"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569968477,"post_id":58191298,"comment_id":102765157,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191101/valueerror-time-data-datetime-datetime2018-8-21-14-14-18-233000-do/58191298#comment102765157_58191298"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":331,"user_id":6237334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc092220cbdcb823b99b48f95315c06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Emmanuel Arias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6237334/emmanuel-arias"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569958836,"creation_date":1569958836,"answer_id":58191298,"question_id":58191101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58191298","body_markdown":"I think that you have the problem that you are trying to convert a tuple to str, that is not the problem but that don&#39;t help you.\r\n\r\nI recommend do something like this if you want to save a str:\r\n\r\n    for result in cursor.fetchall():\r\n        print(result)\r\n        result = &#39;%d-%d-%d&#39; % (result[0].year, result[0].month, result[0].day)\r\n\r\nor if you want to save a date object, just create a new datetime.date with that values\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191101/valueerror-time-data-datetime-datetime2018-8-21-14-14-18-233000-do/58191298#58191298","title":"ValueError: time data &#39;(datetime.datetime(2018, 8, 21, 14, 14, 18, 233000),)&#39; does not match format &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":11274560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-djJt3CmyDg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABf0/MejC6IO0fiI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MCO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11274560/mco"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58191298,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569958836,"creation_date":1569957918,"question_id":58191101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191101","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to program a script that pulls data from SQL and push it into Quickbase.

I looked at some documentations and tutorials and ended up at [Using FormRequest.from_response() to simulate a user login][1]. Using Chrome dev tools, I look at the &quot;login&quot; response after logging in from the page [https://eventbrite.ca/signin/login][2]. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome things that may be important to note is that when attempting to login in browser, the web page will direct you to [https://eventbrite.ca/signin][3], where you enter your email and submit the form. \r\n\r\nThis sends a POST request to [https://www.eventbrite.ca/api/v3/users/lookup/][4] with just the email provided, and if all is dandy, the webpage will use JS to &quot;redirect&quot; you to [https://eventbrite.ca/signin/login][5] and generate the &quot;password&quot; input element. \r\n\r\nOnce you fill your password and hit the form button, if successful, it will then redirect+generate the login response as a result of POST sent to [https://www.eventbrite.ca/ajax/login/][5] with email, pw, and some other info (which can be found in my code snippet). \r\n\r\nFirst I tried doing it step by step: going from .ca/signup, sending a POST with my email to the lookup endpoint, but I get a 401 error. Next I tried directly going to .ca/signup/login, and submitting all the info found in the login response, but receive 403.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m sure I must be missing something, though it seems I am POSTing to the correct URLs and finding the correct form, but can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s left.

So is there a way just to test the hashes and not the date and return\r\n&gt; an equal or not equal result?\r\n\r\nYea, Powershell added some nifty cmdlets to help with that a few releases back.

You wouldn&#39;t usually use `Compare-Object` in a case like this since you can just compare the two hash strings. Can you modify the sample I&#39;ve given you to use `Compare-Object`, sure, but it&#39;s overkill. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DXTT1.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191081/comparing-hashes-and-outputing-differences/58191250#58191250","title":"Comparing hashes and outputing differences"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7716257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d400027cd280a2488080b2d78099788?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user7716257","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7716257/user7716257"},"last_editor":{"reputation":437,"user_id":10350118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FSa_hGMFN5w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABCE/Ae__h_35PSE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"techguy1029","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10350118/techguy1029"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569987690,"creation_date":1569957825,"last_edit_date":1569987690,"question_id":58191081,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191081","body_markdown":"So I am using the `compare-object` cmdlet to compare 2 hashes that I have created one prior to testing, one after testing.

However Chrome 57 insists on putting the red &quot;! not trusted&quot; next to https URLs.  Despite that, those URLs work.  I need to get rid of that warning since it scares users needlessly.  (There is nothing on the site that could be harmful - no financial information, no medical information, nothing like that.)  This is odd because Chrome stores the certificate in exactly the same place as IE does, and if the cert is stored by Chrome IE can use it without problems.  (But not vice versa.)  \r\n\r\nIn chrome click on the red warning and it says that the certificate is invalid, but nothing in the certificate details is marked as having a problem.  Comparing the details\r\nof the same certificate in IE and Chrome, in the same Windows supplied dialog window, oddly they differ in subtle ways.  This makes no sense to me since this is the same file, or at least it is supposed to be!  In the Details tab (all other fields are the same):\r\n\r\n```\r\n               IE         Chrome\r\nVersion        V3         V1\r\nSerial Number  (hex)      2\r\nSubject Key ID (hex)      no such field\r\nAuthority Key  (hex)      no such field\r\nBasic Constr.  (data)     no such field\r\nthumbprint     (hex)      (different hex)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried exporting the cert from IE and importing it into Chrome and saw the same thing as before.  It is like the two browsers interpret the cert differently.\r\n\r\nGiven how the CA and server certs were made (see below), can somebody please explain why this is happening, and how to either configure Chrome not to complain or how to make self signed certs that it will accept?  Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe CA cert was made this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key \\\r\n  -pass pass:random_string_of_characterss -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048\r\n\r\nopenssl req -new -x509 -days 7300 -key ca.key -out ca.crt &lt;&lt;EOD\r\nUS\r\nCalifornia\r\nPasadena\r\n(not shown)\r\n(not shown)\r\n(not shown, is part of organization name)\r\n(not shown)\r\nEOD\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe server cert was made with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key \\\r\n  -pass pass:different_random_string -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048\r\n\r\nopenssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr &lt;&lt;EOD\r\nUS\r\nCalifornia\r\nPasadena\r\n(not shown, matches CA field)\r\n(not shown, matches CA field)\r\n(not shown, is fully qualified IP name of machine)\r\n(not shown, matches CA field)\r\n\r\n\r\nEOD #the two blank lines before this are intentional\r\n\r\n#increment the CERT\r\nopenssl x509 -req -days 7300 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt \\\r\n  -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 02 -out server.crt\r\n\r\ncp server.key server.key.secure\r\n\r\nopenssl rsa -in server.key.secure -out server.key\r\n#removed password\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the name of the machine, and the name used on the certificate, are\r\nactually a DNS alias.  The primary entry is like &quot;foo.bar.school.edu&quot; and the one used is like &quot;who.bar.school.edu&quot;.  They both resolve to the same IP address.  Doesn&#39;t seem like it should matter, but maybe it does?\r\n\r\nMore info...\r\nFound this page:  \r\nhttps://medium.com/@tbusser/creating-a-browser-trusted-self-signedssl-certificate-2709ce43fd15\r\n\r\nso tried that.  \r\n\r\n```\r\ncat &gt;v3.ext &lt;&lt;&#39;EOD&#39;\r\nauthorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer\r\nbasicConstraints=CA:FALSE\r\nkeyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment\r\nsubjectAltName = @alt_names\r\n\r\n[alt_names]\r\nDNS.1 = *.bar.school.edu\r\nDNS.2 = *.school.edu\r\nEOD\r\n#increment the count and use the extfile\r\nopenssl x509 -req -days 7300 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt \\\r\n  -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 03 -out server.crt -extfile v3.ext\r\n/usr/bin/cp server.crt ../ssl.crt\r\napachectl restart\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat made Chrome happy, but IE didn&#39;t like it.  With that server crt the top boxes on IE were all pink and the center one says &quot;certificate error&quot;. \r\n\r\nSo what is the magic incantation these days to make a CA cert and an unsigned server cert that all of these browsers will accept????\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191078/chrome-warns-on-self-signed-certificate-that-ie-11-and-firefox-52-9-accept-wind","title":"Chrome warns on self signed certificate that IE 11 and Firefox 52.9 accept (Windows 7)"},{"tags":["python","numpy","scipy"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569959135,"post_id":58191077,"comment_id":102762040,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191077/futurewarning-in-scipy-stats#comment102762040_58191077"},{"owner":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569960435,"post_id":58191077,"comment_id":102762543,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191077/futurewarning-in-scipy-stats#comment102762543_58191077"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569960675,"creation_date":1569960675,"answer_id":58191636,"question_id":58191077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58191636","body_markdown":"In scipy 1.3.1 the &#39;offending&#39; code is now\r\n\r\n    # Remove outliers (indices 0 and -1 for each bin-dimension).\r\n    core = tuple([slice(None)] + Ndim * [slice(1, -1)])\r\n    result = result[core]\r\n\r\nIn the `scipy/stats/_binned_statistic.py` file.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191077/futurewarning-in-scipy-stats/58191636#58191636","title":"FutureWarning in scipy stats"}],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":8354703,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e69d817fc7430ea616db0f9f5b9ea2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kitsune_breeze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8354703/kitsune-breeze"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569960675,"creation_date":1569957809,"question_id":58191077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191077","body_markdown":"I make a function wich role is calculate radial avarege and redial median for each bins and test it for one *.tif format image.\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom math import fabs\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nfrom scipy import stats\r\n\r\n\r\ndef av_radial_profile(data, center):\r\n    y, x = np.indices((data.shape))\r\n    r = np.hypot(x - center[0],y - center[1])\r\n    r = r.astype(np.int)\r\n    b = len(set(r.ravel()))\r\n    av_radialprofile = stats.binned_statistic(r.ravel(), data.ravel(), statistic =&#39;mean&#39;, bins = b)[0]\r\n    \r\n    median_radialprofile = stats.binned_statistic(r.ravel(), data.ravel(), statistic = lambda q: np.nanmedian(q), bins = b)[0]  \r\n\r\n    return median_radialprofile, av_radialprofile\r\n    \r\n\r\nimg = mpimg.imread(&#39;test.tif&#39;,0)\r\ncenter, radi = (509, 546), 55\r\nrad2, rad3 = av_radial_profile(img, center)\r\n```\r\nThe picture is here[![the tif-format picture][1]][1]\r\nAfter running this code, I face the following Warning message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scipy/stats/_binned_statistic.py:607: FutureWarning: Using a non-tuple sequence for multidimensional indexing is deprecated; use `arr[tuple(seq)]` instead of `arr[seq]`.

I would hate to have to totally restructure my code just to pass the test, so any input would be helpful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191070/can-i-use-an-html5-audio-element-to-play-a-sound-file-in-a-functional-component","title":"Can I use an HTML5 audio element to play a sound file in a functional component using React Hooks?"},{"tags":["wordpress","plugins","breadcrumbs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31351,"user_id":436560,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GESV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lajos Arpad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/436560/lajos-arpad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569976110,"post_id":58191068,"comment_id":102766663,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191068/flexy-breadcrumbs-wordpress-plugin-css-class-to-hide-first-separator#comment102766663_58191068"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12150379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30f3df519a8ad8fc3c7d20eb7f2ae1e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12150379","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12150379/user12150379"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569957780,"creation_date":1569957780,"question_id":58191068,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191068","body_markdown":"I need to hide first item and separator in one specific page.\r\n\r\nI used class below to hide item but I don’t find any class to hide separator.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.fbc-page .fbc-wrap .fbc-items li:first-child {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhat CSS-class should I use to hide first separator?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191068/flexy-breadcrumbs-wordpress-plugin-css-class-to-hide-first-separator","title":"Flexy Breadcrumbs Wordpress plugin | CSS-class to hide first separator"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34781,"user_id":3358272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gteVQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"r2evans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3358272/r2evans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569958056,"post_id":58191067,"comment_id":102761613,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191067/can-we-elimanate-na-in-ggplot-that-is-occuring-i-tried-with-na-rm-but-its-not-w#comment102761613_58191067"},{"owner":{"reputation":9584,"user_id":5792244,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b8b7f62698a5d33a0bf49f47118d32b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dave2e","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5792244/dave2e"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569958246,"post_id":58191067,"comment_id":102761690,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58191067/can-we-elimanate-na-in-ggplot-that-is-occuring-i-tried-with-na-rm-but-its-not-w#comment102761690_58191067"}],"owner":{"reputation":168,"user_id":12019788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-USC03rOjOhs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reculp3oJ5kwbb0lCVfQqJn7gQErg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dev P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12019788/dev-p"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25763,"user_id":7128934,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oI2SB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"d.b","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128934/d-b"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569957896,"creation_date":1569957780,"last_edit_date":1569957896,"question_id":58191067,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58191067","body_markdown":"I have a dataframe df, But there are NA in a value column\r\n\r\n````\r\np12\r\n     Var1 ColA ColB\r\n1       A   NA 44.7\r\n2   asgfg  2.1   NA\r\n3       B   NA 55.3\r\n4     dds  2.1   NA\r\n5     dfg  4.3   NA\r\n6     dfh  2.1   NA\r\n7     dgh  2.1   NA\r\n8   dghgd  2.1   NA\r\n9  dgrert  2.1   NA\r\n````\r\n\r\nSO i plot \r\n\r\n````\r\nggplot(data=p12,aes(x=Var1,y=ColB,fill=Var1))+geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+coord_flip()\r\n````\r\n\r\nIt is even taking NA into account .

I can&#39;t find parameters like `chid.var = &quot;sample_no&quot;` and `alt.var = &quot;hypothesis_no&quot;` in `mlogit`. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to make `earth` accept long format data?

But our algorithm examines a group of three adjacent numbers, and if the leftmost number is larger than the rightmost number, it reverses that entire group. \r\n\r\n&gt; Because our algorithm is a &quot;triplet bubble sort&quot;, we have named it Trouble Sort for short.\r\n\r\n&gt; For example, for L = 5 6 6 4 3, Trouble Sort would proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n&gt; * First pass:\r\n&gt;   * inspect 5 6 6, do nothing: 5 6 6 4 3\r\n&gt;   * inspect 6 6 4, see that 6 &gt; 4, reverse the triplet: 5 4 6 6 3\r\n&gt;   * inspect 6 6 3, see that 6 &gt; 3, reverse the triplet: 5 4 3 6 6\r\n&gt; * Second pass:\r\n&gt;   * inspect 5 4 3, see that 5 &gt; 3, reverse the triplet: 3 4 5 6 6\r\n&gt;   * inspect 4 5 6, do nothing: 3 4 5 6 6\r\n&gt;   * inspect 5 6 6, do nothing: 3 4 5 6 6\r\n&gt; * Then the third pass inspects the three triplets and does nothing, so the algorithm terminates.\r\n\r\n&gt; It is possible that Trouble Sort does not correctly sort the list! Consider the list 8 9 7, for example.\r\n\r\n&gt; Given a list of N integers, determine whether Trouble Sort will successfully sort the list into non-decreasing order. \r\nIf it will not, find the index (counting starting from 0) of the first sorting error after the algorithm has finished: \r\nthat is, the first value that is larger than the value that comes directly after it when the algorithm is done.\r\n\r\n&gt; ##Input\r\n\r\n&gt; The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines: one line with an integer **N**, the number of values in the list, and then another line with **N** integers **V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;**, the list of values.\r\n\r\n&gt; ##Output\r\n\r\n&gt; For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is `OK` if Trouble Sort correctly sorts the list, or the index (counting starting from 0) of the first sorting error, as described above. \r\n\r\n&gt; ##Sample\r\n\r\n&gt; &lt;!-- language: none --&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt;     Input      | Output\r\n&gt;     -----------+-------------\r\n&gt;     2          |\r\n&gt;     5          |\r\n&gt;     5 6 8 4 3  |  Case #1: OK\r\n&gt;     3          |\r\n&gt;     8 9 7      |  Case #2: 1\r\n\r\n&gt; Sample Case #1 is similar to the first one described in the problem statement. Trouble Sort correctly sorts this list, so the answer is OK.\r\n\r\n&gt; Sample Case #2 is the second one described in the problem statement. Trouble Sort does not correctly sort this list, since it terminates with the list 7 9 8. The 9 is the first value in the list that is larger than the next value, so the index of the first sorting error is 1.\r\n\r\nTest set 1\r\nLike bubble sort, Trouble Sort has O(N2) time complexity; the proof is explained below. With N ≤ 100 for test set 1, we can run Trouble Sort to completion and simply iterate over the result list to find the first sorting error, if any (that is, a value that is greater than the value that follows it in the list).\r\n\r\nTest set 2\r\nRunning O(N2) Trouble Sort to completion is too slow for N ≤ 105.\r\n\r\nInstead, let&#39;s break down what Trouble Sort is doing at each step. Let&#39;s consider an input list of 6 elements. Trouble Sort makes the following comparisons on each pass through the array:\r\n\r\nelement 0 ↔ element 2\r\nelement 1 ↔ element 3\r\nelement 2 ↔ element 4\r\nelement 3 ↔ element 5\r\nRegardless of the length of the list, this table illustrates the fundamental flaw in Trouble Sort: even-index elements are compared with other even-index elements, and odd-index elements are compared with other odd-index elements, but even-index and odd-index elements are never compared with each other! This means that Trouble Sort is just bubble sort run separately on the even-index elements and the odd-index elements, interleaving them into the output list. Trouble Sort is correct only if interleaving the two sub-lists (the even-index list and the odd-index list) happens to produce another sorted list. Since there are O(N) even-index and O(N) odd-index elements, and since bubble sort is O(N2), Trouble Sort is also O(N2).\r\n\r\nTo solve test set 2, we can can run our favorite O(N log N) sorting algorithm independently on the two sub-lists described above, interleave the sorted sub-lists, and then find the first sorting error as in our solution for test set 1.\r\n\r\nWhat I already tried is to minimize the use of nested for&#39;s to reduce time complexity and I couldn&#39;t find another way to check if my array is sorted besides checking all the places and returning the index the sorting algorithm doesn&#39;t work\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the full code and I implement it correctly because when the first test case is given it gives the result, but then it exceeds the time that is 20 secs, idk if there&#39;s another solution to this.\r\n```dart\r\nimport &#39;dart:io&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;dart:math&#39; as math;\r\nimport &#39;dart:async&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;dart:convert&#39;;\r\n\r\nStream&lt;String&gt; readLine() =&gt; stdin\r\n    .transform(utf8.decoder)\r\n    .transform(const LineSplitter());\r\n\r\nmain() {\r\n  String stringCase;\r\n  //List&lt;String&gt; results =[];\r\n  \r\n  int numberOfCases = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync());\r\n  stdout.flush();\r\n  // we read the input as google wants,\r\n  BytesBuilder builder = new BytesBuilder();\r\n  for (int i = 1; i &lt;= numberOfCases; i++) {\r\n      int size = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync());\r\n      List&lt;int&gt; lint = new List(size);\r\n      for (int j = 0; j &lt; size; j++) {\r\n        int char = stdin.readByteSync();\r\n        while (char &gt;= 48 &amp;&amp; char &lt;= 57) {\r\n          builder.addByte(char);\r\n          char = stdin.readByteSync();\r\n        }\r\n        lint[j] = int.parse(String.fromCharCodes(builder.takeBytes()));\r\n      }\r\n      //print(lint);\r\n      if(lint.length &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; lint.length &lt;= math.pow(10, 9)){\r\n   print(&quot;Case #${i}: ${separateArray(lint)}&quot;);\r\n      stdout.flush();\r\n  }\r\n     \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nseparateArray(array){\r\n\r\n  List&lt;int&gt; odds = new List((array.length / 2).floor());\r\n  List&lt;int&gt; evens= new List(array.length - odds.length);\r\n  \r\n  int m, n;\r\n  m = 0;\r\n  n = 0;\r\n  for(var i = 0; i&lt;array.length; i++){\r\n    if(i%2==0){\r\n     evens[n] = array[i];\r\n     n++;\r\n    }\r\n    if(i%2!=0){\r\n      odds[m] = array[i];\r\n      m++;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  evens = evens..sort();\r\n  odds = odds..sort();\r\n  var j=0,k=0;\r\n  for(var i=0; i&lt;array.length-1;i++){\r\n    if(i%2==0){\r\n      if (evens[j] &gt; odds[k]) {\r\n          return i;\r\n      }\r\n      j++;\r\n    }else{\r\n      if (odds[k] &gt; evens[j]) {\r\n        return i;\r\n      }\r\n      k++; \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return &quot;OK&quot;;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdk If you guys see anything I don&#39;t.

is what I get:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;h1 class=&quot;text-center&quot; id=&quot;notif&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nWhy is this happening and how will I manage to render it
