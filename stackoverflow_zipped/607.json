Otherwise the same node will get inserted under multiple parents. \r\n```\r\nclass Node:\r\n    def __init__(self, val):\r\n        self._val = val\r\n        self._chdrn = []\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Nary:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, n: int):\r\n        self._n = n\r\n        self._root = None\r\n\r\n    def insert(self, val: int):\r\n        print(f&quot;Inserting {val}&quot;)\r\n        nn = Node(val)\r\n        if not self._root:\r\n            self._root = nn\r\n        else:\r\n            def recur(parent: Node):\r\n                if len(parent._chdrn) &lt; self._n:\r\n                    print(f&quot;Added under parent: {parent._val}&quot;)\r\n                    parent._chdrn.append(nn)\r\n                    return 1\r\n                else:\r\n                    for chdl in parent._chdrn:\r\n                        ret = recur(chdl)\r\n                        if ret == 1:\r\n                            return 1  # not just break\r\n\r\n            parent = self._root\r\n            recur(parent)\r\n\r\n    def dfs(self):\r\n        def _dfs(node: Node):\r\n            if not node: return\r\n            print(node._val, end=&#39; &#39;)\r\n            for chld in node._chdrn:\r\n                # print(&quot;current child = &quot;, chld._val)\r\n                _dfs(chld)\r\n\r\n        _dfs(self._root)\r\n\r\n\r\nTree = Nary(3)\r\nfor i in range(10): Tree.insert(i)\r\nTree.dfs()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW the correct DFS order for this tree is:\r\n```\r\n0 1 4 7 8 9 5 6 2 3 \r\n```\r\nYou should draw out the tree and manually do a DFS to verify.

  .*?(?&lt;!ABC\\s{0,5})(?&lt;!\\d)(\\d{4,6})(?=[A-Z/])\r\n\r\nwith `$1\\0` which removes all unrelated text before *NUMBER_NEEDED*(saved in **$1**) which is not preceded by `ABC\\s{0,5}` and `\\d` but followed by `[A-Z/]`. put a NULL char `\\0` at the end of each matched `$1`.\r\n\r\n* use `split(text, &#39;\\0&#39;)` to convert the above text into an array, notice that the last item of the array is irrelevant which should be excluded\r\n\r\n* use another `regexp_replace(text, &#39;\\0?[^\\0]*$&#39;, &#39;&#39;)` to remove the trailing unrelated text before running the above *split()* function\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n* `(?&lt;!ABC\\s{0,5})` will allow to test 0-5 whitespaces between `ABC` and the *NUMBER_NEEDED*. since regex negative lookbehind does not support `(?&lt;!ABC\\s*)`, if your text might contain more spaces in between, you can adjust `5` to a larger number. BTW. `(?&lt;!ABC\\s{0,5})` is fine with PySpark but invalid in Python `re` module which allows only fixed-width pattern\r\n\r\n* prepend `(?s)` to allow dotall mode if any texts contain line breaks\r\n\r\n* I assumed that the NULL char `\\0` is not shown in your original texts, since it wont be part of matches, you can remove them all (`regexp_replace(text, &#39;\\0&#39;, &#39;&#39;)`) before running the above 3 functions.\r\n\r\nAnother way using udf:\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n    import re\r\n    from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n\r\n    ptn = re.compile(r&#39;(?&lt;!ABC)(?&lt;!\\d)(\\d{4,6})(?=[A-Z/])&#39;)\r\n\r\n    find_number = udf(lambda x: re.findall(ptn, re.sub(r&#39;(?&lt;=ABC)\\s+&#39;, &#39;&#39;, x)) if x else [], ArrayType(StringType()))\r\n\r\n    df.withColumn(&#39;new_column&#39;, find_number(&#39;My_column&#39;)).show()\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396786/how-keep-number-in-text/58398004#58398004","title":"How keep number in text"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":11709732,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48d725f36af348b4b436ed40d1b4c319?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"verojoucla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11709732/verojoucla"},"last_editor":{"reputation":68,"user_id":11709732,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48d725f36af348b4b436ed40d1b4c319?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"verojoucla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11709732/verojoucla"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":100,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58398004,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571177129,"creation_date":1571148963,"last_edit_date":1571153996,"question_id":58396786,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396786","body_markdown":"I have a pyspark Dataframe, I would like to improve the regex bellow.\r\nI want to add a condition or modify the regex to:\r\n\r\n -

The heartbeat sending code is:\r\n```\r\nblocking_connection._impl._send_frame(pika.frame.Heartbeat())\r\ntime.sleep(60)\r\n```\r\nPika is logging a warning almost each time the listener starts up, saying &#39;WRITE indicated on fd=10, but writer callback is None;&#39; This warning is printed from the file pika.adapters.utils.selector_ioloop_adapter.\r\nBut when I prevent the first heartbeat from being sent right away, meaning I put the 60 second sleep line before the frame sending line, the warning does not show up.\r\n\r\nI am trying to understand what is actually happening, why does starting a consumer/listener and then a heartbeat thread right afterwards cause this warning? What is the significance and impact of the warning?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any insight you can offer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396762/pika-warning-on-start-up-due-to-heartbeat-thread","title":"Pika Warning on Start Up due to Heartbeat Thread"},{"tags":["python","jupyter-notebook"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571149302,"post_id":58396759,"comment_id":103139255,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396759/is-there-a-way-to-export-import-jupyter-notebook-extensions#comment103139255_58396759"},{"owner":{"reputation":110,"user_id":5615492,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b26dc181c7d559730769d1a84826652b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5615492/tom"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571592133,"post_id":58396759,"comment_id":103283914,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396759/is-there-a-way-to-export-import-jupyter-notebook-extensions#comment103283914_58396759"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571604009,"creation_date":1571604009,"answer_id":58477121,"question_id":58396759,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58477121","body_markdown":"You could install the two virtual environments as different kernels in jupyter: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments that way you only install jupyter and it&#39;s extensions once and then choose your venv as a kernel from within jupyter.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use docker, which would allow you to commit the environment to source control (i.e. it will be easier to share).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396759/is-there-a-way-to-export-import-jupyter-notebook-extensions/58477121#58477121","title":"Is there a way to export/import Jupyter Notebook extensions?"}],"owner":{"reputation":110,"user_id":5615492,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b26dc181c7d559730769d1a84826652b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5615492/tom"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58477121,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571604009,"creation_date":1571148861,"question_id":58396759,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396759","body_markdown":"I&#39;m really enjoying the Unofficial Jupyter Notebook extensions [found here](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If there is an intersection, the border can be drawn as a segment joining these two points. However, you have to make two lines, one for circle A, and another for circle B. To draw the line for circle A, slightly offset the segment towards point A. Then, use your favorite line-drawing method, but before drawing a pixel, ensure that it is closer to point A that any other point of the opposite set. After drawing the line, repeat the process for circle B. Note that both segment are not guaranteed to be the same length since the asymmetry of the points of the different sets.

a look at [REMOTE_USER authentication](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/auth-remote-user/):\r\n\r\n&gt; This document describes how to make use of external authentication sources (where the Web server sets the REMOTE_USER environment variable) in your Django applications. This type of authentication solution is typically seen on intranet sites, with single sign-on solutions such as IIS and Integrated Windows Authentication or Apache and mod_authnz_ldap, CAS, Cosign, WebAuth, mod_auth_sspi, etc.\r\n\r\nBasically your &quot;light&quot; server does the authentication as it already does. When you are doing a request to your &quot;heavy&quot; server, you should set a `Auth-User` header containing the username of your user. Django will then automatically authenticates the corresponding user.\r\n\r\nBy default, Django will read an environment variable set by an authentication server. But we can make it work with a HTTP header instead:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# middlewares.py\r\n\r\nfrom django.contrib.auth.middleware import RemoteUserMiddleware\r\n\r\nclass CustomHeaderMiddleware(RemoteUserMiddleware):\r\n    header = &#39;HTTP_AUTH_USER&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# settings.py\r\n\r\nMIDDLEWARE = [\r\n    &#39;...&#39;,\r\n    &#39;django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware&#39;,\r\n    &#39;my_project.middlewares.CustomHeaderMiddleware&#39;,\r\n    &#39;...&#39;,\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, you can do something like this then in your request (assuming you have your Django `user` at hand):\r\n\r\n```py\r\ns = requests.Session()\r\n\r\nr1 = s.get(upload_process_url)\r\na = s.post(\r\n    upload_process_url,\r\n    files=request.FILES,\r\n    headers={\r\n        &#39;Auth-User&#39;: user.username,\r\n    },\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you&#39;re not doing a request from a browser, you can avoid the CSRF protection by marking the called &quot;heavy&quot; view with `@csrf_exempt` decorator (as you found yourself).\r\n\r\nBe careful though that your &quot;heavy&quot; server should not be accessible directly on the internet and always behind a proxy/VPN accessible only by your &quot;light&quot; server.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396717/django-send-authenticated-user-to-another-django-server-with-the-same-db/58397320#58397320","title":"Django send authenticated user to another django server with the same db"}],"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":4590839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":11,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98dbe823b73ff891e1c59ec94f173e56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kailegh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4590839/kailegh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58397320,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571212449,"creation_date":1571148768,"question_id":58396717,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396717","body_markdown":"I know question sounds strange, I will explain it here.\r\nI have two Django servers which share the same DB. One is a light front/back server and the order one takes the heavy computing part. They share the same database.\r\nI am currently securing the web, and I have a couple of views in the light server requiring user login:  \r\n\r\n~~~python\r\n@login_required() \r\n@permission_required(&#39;auth.can_upload&#39;, login_url=&#39;/accounts/login/&#39;)\r\n~~~\r\nThis works nicely in the light server since the user is authenticated (request.user returns a valid user in the views).   \r\n\r\nThe problem comes when I have to send the uploaded data to the other server since it is protected as I showed earlier, I do not know how to pass it the user that is already logged (user is valid since servers share the DB).\r\n~~~python\r\n# send an upload request using requests\r\ns = requests.Session()\r\n\r\nr1 = s.get(upload_process_url)\r\ncsrf_token = r1.cookies[&#39;csrftoken&#39;]\r\na = s.post(upload_process_url, files=request.FILES,\r\n                   data={&#39;csrfmiddlewaretoken&#39;: csrf_token},\r\n                   headers=dict(Referer=upload_process_url))\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI cannot ask every time the user and password or save them.

In the app the user has the option to change his username by typing a new one in an `EditText`. The result should be that the data which is stored under his current username moves to a new document which has the new username. So first I check if the new username is already in use by someone else, if not I create a new document which name is the new username. Now I get the current displayName (which is the current username) as a string and the input of the EditText as a string (new username).

You want to do it in Power Query Editor \r\n 2. You already created the &quot;seniority&quot; and &quot;month&quot; (&quot;mois*&quot;) columns\r\n 3. You are not worried about the year (you are really grouping just by month)\r\n\r\nThen these steps may help you to begin:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a custom column name &quot;IsLesserThan3&quot; with the formula:\r\n&gt; `if [Seniority] &lt; 3 and [Activit&#233;] = &quot;En poste&quot; than 1 else 0`\r\n 2. Change the formula to include the requirement about &quot;if the month is not targed&quot; (i didn&#39;t get what it means, sorry).\r\n 3. Choose &quot;Transform&quot; (menu), then &quot;Group By&quot;, then basic, set group by = month, give it a name (&quot;Nbr_inf_3_ans&quot;), set operation = sum, set column = IsLesserThan3\r\n\r\nEDITED\r\n\r\nNew extra assumption:\r\n\r\n 4. There is a second table with month description and month number and you want to create the new column there (&quot;Nbr_inf_3_ans&quot;) and fill it, probably to grant all the months are there (including those with no occurrences).\r\n\r\nWith this new assumption in mind, the approach will be to join the two tables and do the same thing:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a custom column named &quot;IsLesserThan3&quot; with the formula:\r\n&gt; `if [Seniority] &lt; 3 and [Activit&#233;] = &quot;En poste&quot; than 1 else 0`\r\n 2. Change the formula to include the requirement about &quot;if the month is not targed&quot; (i didn&#39;t get what it means, sorry).\r\n 3. Change the type of the new column to integer (click the icon to the left of the column name).\r\n 4. Create a custom column named &quot;Mois_int&quot; with the formula:\r\n&gt; Date.Month([date_de_changement_de_mission])\r\n 5. Then join the tables by month. To do that, select the other table and choose &quot;Transform&quot; (menu), then &quot;Merge&quot;, then let the second table selected and select the first table as the &quot;bottom&quot; table, select columns &quot;Mois_int&quot; in both tables, set &quot;join kind&quot; = &quot;left outer&quot;.\r\n 6. PowerBI will create a new column wich name is the name of the first table. Click the arrows icon in that column header and choose &quot;aggregate&quot; and mark only &quot;sum of LesserThan3&quot;.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396695/create-a-monthly-graph-containing-dynamical-values/58413464#58413464","title":"Create a monthly graph containing dynamical values"}],"owner":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":7473847,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":41,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iZysq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Essex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7473847/essex"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58413464,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571237967,"creation_date":1571148691,"question_id":58396695,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396695","body_markdown":"I discovered PowerBI few hours ago and I am trying to render a new graph, pretty complex from my data.\r\n\r\n**My subject:**\r\n\r\nI have a list of employees from my society with some information (name, location, seniority, ....) inside a table named `Suivis de mission`.\r\nI&#39;m focusing on seniority column.

I know the Bookmark button is a special action button that can create a URL documenting all the input fields of a Shiny app. In addition to the default behavior, I want to save this URL to my Shiny app for further applications.\r\n\r\nMy ultimate goal is to see if I can feed in the Bookmark URL to the `urlshorteneR` package to create a shorten URL and report back to the users. When the Shiny app contains a lot of input fields, the Bookmark URL becomes lengthy. This is why I think it would be handy to be able to shorten the URL automatically.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example. The following script is an example from the `enableBookmarking` documentation. I uploaded it to the `shinyapps.io` and created this link (https://yuchenw.shinyapps.io/Bookmark_Example/).\r\n\r\n    # Basic example with state encoded in URL\r\n    ui &lt;- function(request) {\r\n      fluidPage(\r\n        textInput(&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;Text&quot;),\r\n        checkboxInput(&quot;chk&quot;, &quot;Checkbox&quot;),\r\n        bookmarkButton()\r\n      )\r\n    }\r\n    server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { }\r\n    enableBookmarking(&quot;url&quot;)\r\n    shinyApp(ui, server)\r\n\r\nNow if I want to save a state that the `Checkbox` is `TRUE`. I can click the Bookmark button and copy the URL (https://yuchenw.shinyapps.io/Bookmark_Example/?_inputs_&amp;chk=true&amp;txt=%22%22).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAfter that, I can use the `urlshorteneR` package to shorten the URL as follows.\r\n\r\n    library(urlshorteneR)\r\n    \r\n    url &lt;- &quot;https://yuchenw.shinyapps.io/Bookmark_Example/?_inputs_&amp;chk=true&amp;txt=%22%22&quot;\r\n    \r\n    isgd_LinksShorten(longUrl = url, showRequestURL = TRUE)\r\n\r\nThis works well. It would be great if I can extract the Bookmark URL and automate this process.

From https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order:\r\n\r\n&gt; #6.15. Evaluation order\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while\r\n&gt; evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the\r\n&gt; left-hand side.\r\n\r\nThe `*` has two expressions as its operands, `10**4` and `3**2`. The left operand, `10**4` is evaluated first, followed by the right operand, `3**2`.\r\n\r\nYour teacher may be confused with a *chain* of exponentiations like `2 ** 3 ** 4`. Here the &quot;outer&quot; exponentiation has two arguments `2` and `3 ** 4` (rather than `2**3` and `4`, because of right associativity). However, the `2` is still evaluated before `3**4`.\r\n\r\nFor a simple expression like this, it doesn&#39;t really matter. But it *could* matter if one or both operands involved function calls with side effects. Consider something contrived like `lambda: print(3) or 3)() + (lambda: print(4) or 4)()`. The value of the expression is 7 either way, but the order in which the `print` functions are called will affect the output. Python, though, guarantees that `3` will be output before `4`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome languages (notably C, IIRC) don&#39;t specify an order of evaluation, so it is an implementation detail whether the left or right is evaluated first. This means you can&#39;t predict the value of something like `i=3; j=(i++)*i`; `j` could be either `3*3 == 9` or `4*3 == 12`, depending on whether `i` is incremented before or after the right-hand operand is evaluated. (I don&#39;t recall if this is considered undefined behavior or implementation-defined behavior, though.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396658/order-of-calculation/58397030#58397030","title":"Order of

the expected behavior. Once the object if fetched from the backend side for the first time (i.e. `t=0`), Varnish caches it setting `beresp.ttl` to `30s` and `beresp.grace` to `3600s`. Then, if you request the object to Varnish when `t=3000`, the old object will be delivered to the client side (i.e. `Age: 3000`) and an asynchronous background fetch will be triggered in order to refresh the cached object. If you request again the object to Varnish when `t=3001`, if the background fetch already completed its job, a fresh object will be delivered (i.e. `Age: 1`). The following test illustrates this behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvarnishtest &quot;...&quot;\r\n\r\nserver s1 {\r\n    rxreq\r\n    txresp -hdr &quot;Cache-Control: public, max-age=1, stale-while-revalidate=60&quot; \\\r\n           -hdr &quot;Version: 1&quot;\r\n\r\n    rxreq\r\n    txresp -hdr &quot;Cache-Control: public, max-age=1, stale-while-revalidate=60&quot; \\\r\n           -hdr &quot;Version: 2&quot;\r\n} -start\r\n\r\nvarnish v1 -vcl+backend {\r\n} -start\r\n\r\nclient c1 {\r\n    txreq\r\n    rxresp\r\n    expect resp.http.Version == 1\r\n    expect resp.http.Age == 0\r\n\r\n    delay 5.0\r\n\r\n    txreq\r\n    rxresp\r\n    expect resp.http.Version == 1\r\n    expect resp.http.Age == 5\r\n\r\n    delay 0.1\r\n\r\n    txreq\r\n    rxresp\r\n    expect resp.http.Version == 2\r\n    expect resp.http.Age == 0\r\n} -run\r\n\r\nvarnish v1 -expect client_req == 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to refresh the object synchronously once the item in the cache consumes its TTL, you need to play with `req.grace` during `vcl_recv`. You probably want to set it to `0s` if the backend is healthy.

My next requirement in a project is finding all credit cards data in documents. Also user will be able to define some regular expression searching rules dynamically in the future.  But with standard analyzer it is not possible to search credit card info or any user defined rule. \r\nFor instance, let&#39;s say a document contains credit card info such as 4321-4321-4321-4321 or 4321 4321 4321 4321. Elastic search indexes this data as 4 parts as seen below :\r\n\r\n```\r\n  &quot;tokens&quot; : [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;token&quot; : &quot;4321&quot;,\r\n      &quot;start_offset&quot; : 0,\r\n      &quot;end_offset&quot; : 4,\r\n      &quot;type&quot; : &quot;&lt;NUM&gt;&quot;,\r\n      &quot;position&quot; : 0\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;token&quot; : &quot;4321&quot;,\r\n      &quot;start_offset&quot; : 5,\r\n      &quot;end_offset&quot; : 9,\r\n      &quot;type&quot; : &quot;&lt;NUM&gt;&quot;,\r\n      &quot;position&quot; : 1\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;token&quot; : &quot;4321&quot;,\r\n      &quot;start_offset&quot; : 10,\r\n      &quot;end_offset&quot; : 14,\r\n      &quot;type&quot; : &quot;&lt;NUM&gt;&quot;,\r\n      &quot;position&quot; : 2\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;token&quot; : &quot;4321&quot;,\r\n      &quot;start_offset&quot; : 15,\r\n      &quot;end_offset&quot; : 19,\r\n      &quot;type&quot; : &quot;&lt;NUM&gt;&quot;,\r\n      &quot;position&quot; : 3\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n   I just don&#39;t take into account Luhm algorithm now. If i do a basic regular expression search for finding a credit card  with reg exp &quot;([0-9]{4}[- ]){3}[0-9]{4}&quot; it returns nothing because data is not analyzed and indexed for that.  I thought for this purpose, i need to define a custom analyzer for regular expression searches and store the another version of data in another field or index. But as I said before in the future the user will define his/her own custom rule patterns for searching. How should i define the custom analyzer? Should i define ngram tokenizer(min:2, max:20) for that?  With ngram tokenizer i think i can search for all defined regular expression rules.  But is it reasonable? Project has to work with huge data without any performance problems. (A company&#39;s whole file system will be indexed). Do you have any other suggestion for this type of data discovery problem? My main purpose is finding credit cards at the moment.
