that is providing an API.\r\n\r\nHow could a compiled file provide an &#39;interface&#39; that uncompiled extensions could use to plug into to compiled SDK?\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\nAPI clients could include the sdk with \r\n````\r\n&lt;script src=&#39;nn-skd&#39;&gt; (nn is the name of the sdk)\r\n````\r\nHere is the whole sdk\r\n````\r\n/**\r\n * @nocollapse\r\n * @const\r\n * @namespace\r\n */\r\nvar NN = {}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @interface\r\n * @export\r\n */\r\nNN.INode = function() {}\r\n/**\r\n * @export\r\n * @return {number} \r\n */\r\nNN.INode.prototype.getMagic = function() {}\r\n\r\ndocument.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;,()=&gt;{\r\n  const node = /** @type NN.INode */ (window[&#39;specialNodeAddedByAPIClientOutsideOfTheSdk&#39;])\r\n  console.log(node.getMagic())\r\n})\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhat I would expect here is to have a client that can put classes that &quot;implement&quot; INode into the window[&#39;specialNodeAddedByAPIClientOutsideOfTheSdk&#39;] and the sdk could use this class.\r\n\r\nLike for example the following uncompiled file:\r\n````\r\nNN.Node = class {\r\n  getMagic() {\r\n    return 4;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nwindow[&#39;specialNodeAddedByAPIClientOutsideOfTheSdk&#39;] = new NN.Node();\r\n````\r\n\r\nBut this will not work because the google closure compiled nn-sdk file will never call NN.Node#getMagic. It simply does not know about it. The compiled file looks like \r\n````\r\n(function() {\r\n    var a = {},\r\n        b = a.a,\r\n        c = [&quot;NN&quot;, &quot;INode&quot;],\r\n        d = this;\r\n    c[0] in d || !d.execScript || d.execScript(&quot;var &quot; + c[0]);\r\n    for (var e; c.length &amp;&amp; (e = c.shift());) c.length || void 0 === b ? d[e] &amp;&amp; d[e] !== Object.prototype[e] ? d = d[e] : d = d[e] = {} : d[e] = b;\r\n    a.a.prototype.b = function() {};\r\n    a.a.prototype.getMagic = a.a.prototype.b;\r\n    document.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n        console.log(void 0)\r\n    });\r\n}).call(window)\r\n````\r\nwhere the console.log() is just &#39;void 0&#39;.\r\n\r\nHow could I make this work. How could an compiled file provide an interface that uncompiled extensions could use to plug into to compiled SDK.\r\n\r\n# Update1:\r\nFound a possible solution\r\n````\r\nconsole.log(node[&#39;getMagic&#39;]() || node.getMagic())\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis makes sure that if the node is mangled and is inside the sdk than node.getMagic() will be called while if it is outside the sdk than node[&#39;getMagic&#39;]() will be called.\r\n\r\nIs this what I should be doing?\r\n\r\n# Update 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe approach above works until I try to extend and override a method with \r\n\r\n````\r\nNN.Node = class extends NN.INode {\r\n````\r\nand then \r\n\r\n````\r\ngetMagic() {\r\nsuper.getMagic()\r\n}\r\n`````\r\n\r\nin which case it is impossible to resolve the correct getMagic.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460417/how-to-closure-compile-but-still-provide-interface-api-to-uncompiled-extensions","title":"How to closure compile but still provide interface API to uncompiled &#39;extensions&#39;"},{"tags":["javascript","puppeteer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1693,"user_id":590589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2ea38f6a28646832eafb034951a982?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/590589/max"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571481244,"post_id":58460415,"comment_id":103261206,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460415/click-on-element-inside-frame-in-puppeteer-1-4-0#comment103261206_58460415"},{"owner":{"reputation":669,"user_id":10195149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QDGqPvrZ7zw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7qsVg-AtouTn1Sx-GeOXqSnUVOs7g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jamesfdearborn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10195149/jamesfdearborn"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1693,"user_id":590589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2ea38f6a28646832eafb034951a982?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/590589/max"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571493993,"post_id":58460415,"comment_id":103264078,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460415/click-on-element-inside-frame-in-puppeteer-1-4-0#comment103264078_58460415"}],"owner":{"reputation":669,"user_id":10195149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QDGqPvrZ7zw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7qsVg-AtouTn1Sx-GeOXqSnUVOs7g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jamesfdearborn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10195149/jamesfdearborn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":669,"user_id":10195149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QDGqPvrZ7zw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7qsVg-AtouTn1Sx-GeOXqSnUVOs7g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jamesfdearborn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10195149/jamesfdearborn"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571493975,"creation_date":1571457696,"last_edit_date":1571493975,"question_id":58460415,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58460415","body_markdown":"Is there any way to click on an element inside an iFrame in Puppeteer 1.4.0?

(today normally tens of milliseconds). When the chunk expires the CPU is forcibly taken from your task and given to others if they need it too.\r\nWhen you sleep what happens is that your code will release the CPU earlier and it will regain it at next time your code is available for running (i.e. if enough time it will have been passed) but this check has a granularity of a chunk, and that&#39;s the reason `sleep` may take more.\r\n\r\nNote that if your system has more than one CPU there will be multiple of these chunks executing at the same time and this makes predicting exactly when your code will be waken after a sleep unpredictable (if you sleep a tiny amount it may wake up earlier than a chunk has passed not because others released their chunk earlier, but because you got this time a different CPU, for example).\r\n\r\nIf you need exact timing sleep is not the answer (and also the OS must support exact timing, something that normal OSes don&#39;t do at application level).\r\n\r\nIf your code doesn&#39;t release the control and the operation requires much less than a time slicing chunk then statistically the measure using the wall clock is reasonably correct.

I would like to do two things that I hope are quite simple for someone much more experienced in R than me. \r\n\r\nFor context, this function simulates a disease outbreak using a branching process with a negative binomial offspring distribution from a single index case. Each position in the vector represents an individual, and each integer represents the number of secondary cases caused by that individual. \r\n\r\nFor instance, `[3 0 1 0 1 0]` indicates there were six cases that transmitted the respective number of secondary cases. More specifically, it means:\r\n\r\n- The index case transmitted to `3` secondary cases (first position in the vector) to the next generation. \r\n- Of those three cases, the first case had `0` secondary cases, the second had `1` secondary case, and the third had `0` (positions 2:4 in the vector).\r\n- The one case in the following generation also transmitted `1` case (position 5), which  had `0` secondary cases (position 6), so the process exited the loop and the vector outputs. \r\n- If an index case transmitted no infections, the vector would simply be `[0]`.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a start, I would like to improve it in the following two ways:\r\n\r\n1. First, each time the loop continues it is a new &quot;generation.&quot; I would like to create a `2 x n` matrix that would denote the corresponding generation. For example, the data for the example above would look like this:\r\n\r\n    ````r\r\n    ##&#39; Example desired dataset of running the function\r\n    ##&#39; Index case transmits to three others (generation 1)\r\n    ##&#39; Those three transmit to 0, 1, and 0, respectively (generation 2)\r\n    ##&#39; The single case (Gen 3) transmits to 0 (gen 4) and the function exits the loop\r\n    generation1 &lt;- c(1,2,2,2,3,4)\r\n    secondary.cases1 &lt;- c(3,0,1,0,1,0)\r\n    example.matrix1 &lt;- cbind(generation1, secondary.cases1)\r\n    print(example.matrix1)\r\n\r\n    #      generation1 secondary.cases1\r\n    # [1,]           1                3\r\n    # [2,]           2                0\r\n    # [3,]           2                1\r\n    # [4,]           2                0\r\n    # [5,]           3                1\r\n    # [6,]           4                0\r\n\r\n    ````\r\n\r\n2. Second, the function is only for a single outbreak. For my final data, I need to simulate this a number of times (i.e. 2000), and concatenate all of these vectors. Also, similarly to 1 above, have a number denoting the corresponding simulation number. For instance, the final dataset would look like this\r\n\r\n     ````r\r\n     ##&#39; Example desired dataset of three simulations:\r\n     ##&#39; sim1 producing a vector of [3 0 1 0 1 0] in four generations\r\n     ##&#39; sim2 producing a vector of [2 0 0] in three generations\r\n     ##&#39; sim3 producing a vector of [0] in the first generation\r\n     simulation2 &lt;- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3)\r\n     generation2 &lt;- c(1,2,2,2,3,4,1,2,3,1)\r\n     secondary.cases2 &lt;- c(3,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0)\r\n     example.matrix2 &lt;- cbind(simulation2, generation2, secondary.cases2)\r\n     print(example.matrix2)\r\n    #       simulation2 generation2 secondary.cases2\r\n    #  [1,]           1           1                3\r\n    #  [2,]           1           2                0\r\n    #  [3,]           1           2                1\r\n    #  [4,]           1           2                0\r\n    #  [5,]           1           3                1\r\n    #  [6,]           1           4                0\r\n    #  [7,]           2           1                2\r\n    #  [8,]           2           2                0\r\n    #  [9,]           2           3                0\r\n    # [10,]           3           1                0\r\n     ````\r\n\r\nThe function is below. For the first issue, I tried to count each iteration as a generation and create a vector. For the second issue, I tried nesting this function in another function.

A think, you must have some way to get this person&#39;s list from your server.

It&#39;s not good idea to manage local database and server database similarly.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is move deletion method from the PhoneBookEntry component.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst PhoneBookEntry = ({ name, number, onDelete}) =&gt; {\r\n    return (\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div className=&quot;personAndDelBtn&quot;&gt;{name} {number} &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;button className=&quot;personAndDelBtn&quot; onClick={onDelete}&gt;delete&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnd define delete and fetch methods in the top level component (person&#39;s list).\r\nI&#39;m using React Hooks `useState` `useCallback` and `useEffect`.

The reason being that the static query needs to be known at build time. That&#39;s when it&#39;s executed. It runs when you&#39;re building the site, not when the site is live. That&#39;s the static part of not just the StaticQuery, but Gatsby in general. PageQueries may not have the &#39;static&#39; in them, but they, too, run a build time. The only difference is that they do allow for the use of arguments, be it in a different way than you&#39;re trying to do it here.\r\n\r\nIf this is on some automatically generated page using the `createPages` API, you should pass some identifier down to the page, which it can then use in a PageQuery to fetch the data. From what I can tell here, this doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s your page element. Is this the bottom of the blogpost where you show some details on the author? It looks like you have a separate entity for your authors, and for your blog pages. That&#39;s good. One way to pull this off is by making sure you query all necessary information in your PageQuery. If you have the data in your page component, you can simply pass it down to its children. You just need to get all the necessary identifiers to the PageComponent using the context. This is how it&#39;s shown in the Gatsby docs:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) =&gt; {\r\n  const { createPage } = actions\r\n  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/blog-post.js`)\r\n\r\n  return graphql(`\r\n    query loadPagesQuery ($limit: Int!) {\r\n      allMarkdownRemark(limit: $limit) {\r\n        edges {\r\n          node {\r\n            frontmatter {\r\n              slug\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  `, { limit: 1000 }).then(result =&gt; {\r\n    if (result.errors) {\r\n      throw result.errors\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges.forEach(edge =&gt; {\r\n      createPage({\r\n        path: `${edge.node.frontmatter.slug}`,\r\n        component: blogPostTemplate,\r\n        context: {\r\n          // You need the something to query the author by, and something to query\r\n          // the blog post by.\r\n          author: edge.node.frontmatter.authorId, // or whatever you use to identify authors\r\n          slug: edge.node.frontmatter.slug\r\n        },\r\n      })\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the two variables passed inside the context object. Now inside your page element, you have these two variables that you can pass to your query. The $autorId variable, and the $slug variable. On the blog page you will need the blog post contents, but I&#39;m sure you already have that part taken care of, as well as the author details to show the info on the author. In the PageQuery you can simply ask for two entities. One for the blogpost, the other for the author.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460378/use-a-react-prop-string-in-graphql-query-template/58472244#58472244","title":"Use a React prop (string) in GraphQL query template"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11796074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CDzwBtwlUiY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/UBBIurNBWSs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brad Stewart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11796074/brad-stewart"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571789783,"creation_date":1571789783,"answer_id":58513837,"question_id":58460378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513837","body_markdown":"Thanks to all the above answers; I didn&#39;t have success with my limited GraphQL knowledge and at this stage it&#39;s not something I want to dive into - I only have one use case for GraphQL. \r\n\r\nSo I dived into the docs some more and found this: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/#mapping-node-types which is working perfectly and is very simple to implement and is designed for the exact reason I needed it (blog author bio information).\r\n\r\nI regret not finding this earlier and preventing an unnecessary question but I hope this help someone in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks again.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460378/use-a-react-prop-string-in-graphql-query-template/58513837#58513837","title":"Use a React prop (string) in GraphQL query template"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11796074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CDzwBtwlUiY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/UBBIurNBWSs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brad Stewart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11796074/brad-stewart"},"last_editor":{"reputation":270,"user_id":6792485,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/699df4fcd7a69a711b286ffed5f938b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karan Kiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6792485/karan-kiri"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571789783,"creation_date":1571457148,"last_edit_date":1571472592,"question_id":58460378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58460378","body_markdown":"I am making a reusable component in a Gatsby blog to go at the end of blog articles which takes the authorName of the article, and renders an &#39;About the Author&#39; section, pulling the info from the author&#39;s bio stored elsewhere on the site. \r\n\r\nI have made the component which works when the authorName is hard coded as a string, but I am stuck on how to get the author name from the article component (passed as props.author) into the GraphQl query. \r\n\r\nI can confirm that:\r\n1.

I have a program that is reading a file into a buffer. It then reads the buffer and attempts to replace every newline character with a null character so I can make an array of pointers, which I am trying to implement as a pointer to pointers, to the lines read from disk into memory for use later. The initial value of the string in memory is the loop walks along is:\r\n\r\n    buffer = 0x555555757030 &quot;file1.i\\nfile2.i\\n&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is the correct contents of the file that were read in. When the first newline is encountered, the \\n is replaces with the \\0 character and after assignment, the next loop iteration on reads part of the string. It looks like this in memory for all subsequent loops after:\r\n\r\n    buffer = 0x555555757030 &quot;file1.i&quot;\r\n\r\nWhy is this? Here is the code that opens and reads a filed into a buffer. It then stores the pointers into a structure variable which is a pointer to a pointer. As a side note, if I try to reallocate the buffer to trim the size of the variable in memory to the actual characters read from disk, the loop interestingly terminates immediately after the first instruction to replace a \\n with a \\0 occurs:\r\n\r\n    struct file_list {\r\n    \tchar **files;\r\n    \tint lineCount;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    void readIndex(struct file_list *index){\r\n    \tssize_t readCount, writeCount;\r\n    \tstruct stat *fs;\r\n    \tint fd;\r\n    \tchar *buffer;\r\n    \tint bufSize = 4096;\t\t\t//update with stat to get actual size\r\n    \r\n    \tif ((fd = open(&quot;index.db&quot;, O_RDONLY)) &gt; 0){\r\n    \t\tbuffer = malloc(bufSize);\r\n    \t\tif ((readCount = read(fd, buffer, bufSize)) &gt;= 0) {\r\n    \t\t\twriteCount = write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, readCount);\r\n                //buffer = realloc(buffer, readCount);\t                //Causes sigsegv\r\n    \t\t\tassert(writeCount == readCount);\r\n    \t\t\tint i = 0;\r\n    \t\t\twhile(i &lt; readCount){\r\n    \t\t\t\tif (buffer[i] == &#39;\\n&#39;){\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tbuffer[i] = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tindex-&gt;lineCount++;\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\ti++;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\tbuffer[i] = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tif (index == NULL)\r\n    \t\tindex-&gt;files = malloc(sizeof(char **) * index-&gt;lineCount);\r\n    \r\n    \tindex-&gt;files = &amp;buffer;\r\n    \tfor (int i = 1, j = 1; i &lt; index-&gt;lineCount; i++){\r\n    \t\tif (*(buffer + i) == &#39;\\0&#39;){\r\n    \t\t\tindex-&gt;files[j] = &amp;buffer[i];\r\n    \t\t\tj++;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void main(int argc, char **argv){\r\n    \tstruct file_list *main = readIndex(main);\r\n    \tprintIndex(main);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460360/replacing-n-with-0-truncates-string-in-memory-in-loop","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Replacing \\n with \\0 truncates string (in memory) in loop"},{"tags":["access-control","xacml"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9441,"user_id":1021725,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74b935010f9ac8bee2a8df5b1c6ee6cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"David Brossard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1021725/david-brossard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571458964,"post_id":58460359,"comment_id":103257374,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460359/converting-xacml-digital-policies-into-caspin-rulesets#comment103257374_58460359"},{"owner":{"reputation":9441,"user_id":1021725,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74b935010f9ac8bee2a8df5b1c6ee6cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"David Brossard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1021725/david-brossard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571503692,"post_id":58460359,"comment_id":103266508,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460359/converting-xacml-digital-policies-into-caspin-rulesets#comment103266508_58460359"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":6431726,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/53a064ff08d084f2034e1f24d23dd8c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shortlink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6431726/shortlink"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571456898,"creation_date":1571456898,"question_id":58460359,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58460359","body_markdown":"Is there a tool or method to convert XACML ABAC digital policies into ruleset in CASPIN?

Apparently services.AddControllers only registers routes in the executing assembly, which in the subclassed integrationtest scenario is the test assembly.\r\nBy adding the required controllers as application parts, the routing system picks up the routes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices.AddControllers()\r\n    .AddApplicationPart(typeof(&lt;controllername&gt;).Assembly);\r\n```\r\n\r\nthings will work.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460336/override-startup-in-webapplicationfactory-does-not-map-endpoints/58528200#58528200","title":"Override Startup in WebApplicationFactory does not map endpoints"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":453453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5011a25f114c52457b1afd573b80acd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SamV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/453453/samv"},"last_editor":{"reputation":592,"user_id":12179584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LEA69.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12179584/anna"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571852642,"creation_date":1571456596,"last_edit_date":1571471379,"question_id":58460336,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58460336","body_markdown":"I have configured an xUnit project to test an Identity Server implementation.

This gallery is exactly what I want. It perfectly suits my needs and I do not want to change it. However, I need to have TWO changes in it without which its incomplete for my purpose. But I am not getting how to do it. The required changes are:\r\n\r\n1. On clicking an image in the gallery, the full image pops up in modal format (looks similar to bootstrap modal). The problem is that on clicking anywhere on the screen (including the image) the image closes. But I do not want it to close when the image area is clicked. It should close only when the outside area (dark area) is clicked. How to fix it?\r\n\r\n2. I want to add a white text box just below the image that fits the image size (width) depending upon the image (each image has different width and height). This box will be used to provide a round user DP along with his username which when clicked takes it to another page (say like user&#39;s timeline). How to create this box? \r\n\r\nNow, to note here is that problem 1 relates to problem 2 as the username can&#39;t be clicked because the image closes on any first click anywhere on the screen

present on the other definitions as well.  A semicolon terminates a function forward declaration (at the top of the file) but when defining the function, the braces replace it.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou also declare the three functions `triangle`/`circle`/`rectangle` to return `double` but in the implementation you define them to return `void` which doesn&#39;t match.  This is likely the source of the specific error you&#39;re getting.\r\n\r\nChange either the forward declarations to match the definitions, or vice-versa.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThese three functions also attempt to assign to an `area` variable which is not in scope.  This variable must be declared in those functions if you want to use it there.\r\n\r\nNote that the `area` variable in `main()` is not reachable from these functions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe definition for `rectangle` begins with a variable declaration, which makes no sense:\r\n\r\n    double fc = rectangle(double length, double width);\r\n\r\nThis is parsed as a declaration of a global `fc` variable which is initialized to the result of calling the `rectangle` function, but the argument syntax is incorrect so parsing would fail there.  Presumably this should read:\r\n\r\n    void rectangle(double length, double width)\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    double rectangle(double length, double width)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe function `circle()` refers to a symbol `PI` but this is not in scope.

Although the ts compilers just match the files with the module names, by themselves even without placing them adjacent.\r\n\r\nIt should work the same with webpack, the compiler just knows how to find the typings, if you just point it to where they are.\r\n\r\nExample, I have a folder called typings where I place all my custom typings for my express application. And my tsconfig looks like\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;noImplicitAny&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;esModuleInterop&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;\r\n    },\r\n    &quot;include&quot;: [\r\n        &quot;app/**/*&quot;\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd since my typings folder is in `./app`, the compiler has no problems, finding my `.d.ts` files and my gulpfile.js looks like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar gulp = require(&#39;gulp&#39;);\r\nvar ts = require(&#39;gulp-typescript&#39;);\r\nvar tsProject = ts.createProject(&#39;tsconfig.json&#39;);\r\n\r\ngulp.task(&#39;buildTS&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n    return tsProject.src()\r\n        .pipe(tsProject())\r\n        .js.pipe(gulp.dest(&#39;build&#39;));\r\n});\r\n\r\ngulp.task(&#39;ts:watch&#39;, function (cb) {\r\n    gulp.watch(&#39;./app/**/*.ts&#39;, gulp.series([&#39;buildTS&#39;, &#39;server&#39;]))\r\n    cb(null);\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I wanted to use a package called custom-env which has no ts typings in @types repo. so I just created a `custom-env.d.ts` with the contents\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module &#39;custom-env&#39;;\r\n// This is a workaround.

48 and this is causing doubts in my mind for the slowness of these queries.\r\n\r\nNote:- If I just grab the ES query from slow-log and directly hit using `kopf` or `curl`, in response, it shows

you can use `item.getTitle()` for that\r\n\r\nTo to so:\r\n\r\n    picker.setListener(new BubblePickerListener() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onBubbleSelected(@NotNull PickerItem item) {\r\n\r\n            if (item.getTitle() != null) {\r\n                switch(item.getTitle()) {\r\n                    \r\n                    case &quot;item1&quot;:\r\n                        // start activity of item1 \r\n                        break;\r\n                        \r\n                    case &quot;item2&quot;:\r\n                        // start activity of item2\r\n                        break;\r\n                        \r\n                    case &quot;item3&quot;:\r\n                        // start activity of item3\r\n                        break;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onBubbleDeselected(@NotNull PickerItem item) {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAnd below is the full example semplified with a single activity for all items, but passing in a different value (item title) for each item.\r\n\r\n**How it looks like**\r\n\r\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/J2VOaQgNhIViw5RrJb/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Layout**\r\n\r\nactivity_main.xml\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

I keep a running total variable called &#39;total&#39;. In my for-loop, I will loop from 0 to num. The reason why I chose 0 is because I don&#39;t want the first iteration to have more than one str(num). On the first iteration, i=0, effectively taking that  str(num) its multiplying out, leaving only one str(num) and then converting that to a int datatype by doing int(str(num)). \r\n\r\nThe second iteration, i=1, it&#39;ll look like this:\r\n```\r\ntotal += int(str(num) + 1*str(num))\r\n```\r\nwhich should be interpreted as (if the user entered 3 and is on their second iteration):\r\n```\r\n3 += int(str(3) + 2*str(3))\r\n```\r\nTotal at this point would equal 36 and then on its third and final iteration, total will become 369.

The idea is a universal navbar at the top, and a page specific navbar on the left. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    List&lt;object&gt; navElements = new List&lt;object&gt; {\r\n        new {text = &quot;Test1&quot;, location = &quot;test1&quot;, subElements = new List&lt;object&gt; {\r\n            new {text = &quot;Test1-1&quot;, location = &quot;test1-1&quot;, subElements = new List&lt;object&gt; {\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-1-1&quot;, location = &quot;test1-1-1&quot;},\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-1-2&quot;, location = &quot;test1-1-2&quot;},\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-1-3&quot;, location = &quot;test1-1-3&quot;}\r\n            } },\r\n            new {text = &quot;Test1-2&quot;, location = &quot;test1-2&quot;, subElements = new List&lt;object&gt; {\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-2-1&quot;, location = &quot;test1-2-1&quot;},\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-2-2&quot;, location = &quot;test1-2-2&quot;},\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-2-3&quot;, location = &quot;test1-2-3&quot;}\r\n            } },\r\n            new {text = &quot;Test1-3&quot;, location = &quot;test1-3&quot;, subElements = new List&lt;object&gt; {\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-3-1&quot;, location = &quot;test1-3-1&quot;},\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-3-2&quot;, location = &quot;test1-3-2&quot;},\r\n                new {text = &quot;Test1-3-3&quot;, location = &quot;test1-3-3&quot;}\r\n            } }\r\n\r\n        } }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice this test definition is attempting to delve three levels in. I&#39;ve built a recursive function to catch every layer of subElements contained within the list. The problem arises that because subElement doesn&#39;t exist on the final layer, it throws a `\r\n&#39;object&#39; does not contain a definition for &#39;subElements&#39; and no accessible extension method &#39;subElements&#39; accepting a first argument of type &#39;object&#39; could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) `\r\n\r\nIt can find both universal properties (text and location).\r\n\r\nFound [this Stackflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23076296/how-to-check-if-property-exists) that suggested to use `OBJECT.GetType().GetProperty(&quot;PROPERTYNAME&quot;) != null`, and that seems to be working just fine, however I still am unable to compile when calling that property after this if block.\r\n\r\nHow am I able to check for, and call, a variably existing property inside of a generic object?\r\n\r\nThis check needs to catch for two actions: \r\n\r\n1. Assigns necessary stylesheet code to allow for the drop box in each layer. Since the existence of the drop box is dependent on the existence of a sub layer. \r\n2. To trigger the recursion of lower layers. This would enable infinite layers of drop boxes since it&#39;s functionized. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the general appearance of the functionized builder.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@{\r\n    void navLeftBuilder(List&lt;object&gt; elements)\r\n    {\r\n        foreach (object element in elements)\r\n        {\r\n            @if (element.subElements) { navLeftBuilder(element.subElement); }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve even tried changing the object call to\r\n\r\n```\r\n@{\r\n    void navLeftBuilder(List&lt;object&gt; elements)\r\n    {\r\n        object obj;\r\n        foreach (int element in elements)\r\n        {\r\n            obj = elements[element];\r\n            @if (obj.subElements) { navLeftBuilder(obj.subElement); }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460269/c-checking-and-calling-object-properties-that-may-or-may-not-exist","title":"C# Checking and calling object properties that may, or may not exist"},{"tags":["mysql","count","grouping","distinct","having"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":153,"user_id":4126370,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c37b46af03d6ab4e3c89042a85044862?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kushan Mehta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4126370/kushan-mehta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571461527,"post_id":58460268,"comment_id":103257718,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460268/mysql-return-the-count-of-a-distinct-rows-of-a-group#comment103257718_58460268"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":12208910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/348b28729db3ddba24a0366f8dcf61a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12208910/mike"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":12208910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/348b28729db3ddba24a0366f8dcf61a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12208910/mike"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571461349,"last_edit_date":1571461349,"creation_date":1571456301,"answer_id":58460312,"question_id":58460268,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58460312","body_markdown":"I think what you are looking for is something like this:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT orderId, COUNT(DISTINCT burgerId) \r\nFROM BurgerOrders \r\nGROUP BY orderId;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe HAVING syntax requires a condition, see for example here:  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460268/mysql-return-the-count-of-a-distinct-rows-of-a-group/58460312#58460312","title":"MySQL: Return the Count of a distinct rows of a group"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12227310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e4722f30caf735612ba3d0152d03706?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AllenPeck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12227310/allenpeck"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571461349,"creation_date":1571455702,"question_id":58460268,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58460268","body_markdown":"I&#39;m having trouble with combining the count/grouping feature with the distinct feature.

answer, yes, you still unsubscribe to your observables in your component to [avoid subscription leaks][1]. One of my preferred ways of doing so would be to make use of the [takeUntil()][2] operator.\r\n\r\nThis is how you can use it in your component.\r\n\r\n    private unsubscribe: Subject&lt;void&gt; = new Subject();\r\n\r\n    ngOnDestroy() {\r\n      this.unsubscribe.next();\r\n      this.unsubscribe.complete();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    getContacts() {\r\n      this.httpService.getContactsHttp()\r\n        .pipe(\r\n          takeUntil(this.unsubscribe),\r\n        ).subscribe((data:ContactSearch[])=&gt;{      \r\n          this.contacts$.next(data);\r\n        });\r\n     }\r\n\r\nAs explained by [Brian Love][3], \r\n\r\n&gt; - First, we import the takeUntil() operator as well as the Subject\r\n&gt; class. \r\n- Next, we define a private instance property named unsubscribe,\r\n&gt; which is a Subject. \r\n- We also create a new instance of Subject, defining\r\n&gt; the generic type as void. We use the takeUntil() operator in the\r\n&gt; pipe() method before invoking subscribe(), providing the unsubscribe\r\n&gt; observable. \r\n- In the ngOnDestroy() lifecycle method we emit a next()\r\n&gt; notification, and then complete() the unsubscribe observable. The\r\n&gt; subscription is now complete, and we have immediately unsubscribed\r\n&gt; when the ngOnDestroy() method is invoked during the lifecycle of our\r\n&gt; component.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://medium.com/@benlesh/rxjs-dont-unsubscribe-6753ed4fda87\r\n  [2]: https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/filtering/takeuntil.html\r\n  [3]: https://brianflove.com/2016/12/11/anguar-2-unsubscribe-observables/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460256/angular-observables-do-i-need-unsubscribe-if-no-subscription/58460534#58460534","title":"Angular observables - Do I need unsubscribe if no subscription?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3329,"user_id":4376500,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d75a13c3ee9b9b1719de430d80b664?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ka Tech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4376500/ka-tech"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571466553,"post_id":58460778,"comment_id":103258388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460256/angular-observables-do-i-need-unsubscribe-if-no-subscription/58460778#comment103258388_58460778"},{"owner":{"reputation":3329,"user_id":4376500,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d75a13c3ee9b9b1719de430d80b664?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ka Tech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4376500/ka-tech"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571470749,"post_id":58460778,"comment_id":103259129,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460256/angular-observables-do-i-need-unsubscribe-if-no-subscription/58460778#comment103259129_58460778"},{"owner":{"reputation":3329,"user_id":4376500,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d75a13c3ee9b9b1719de430d80b664?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ka Tech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4376500/ka-tech"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571528665,"post_id":58460778,"comment_id":103272059,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460256/angular-observables-do-i-need-unsubscribe-if-no-subscription/58460778#comment103272059_58460778"},{"owner":{"reputation":2167,"user_id":5262452,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jhxYe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pato Vargas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5262452/pato-vargas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3329,"user_id":4376500,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d75a13c3ee9b9b1719de430d80b664?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ka Tech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4376500/ka-tech"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571532029,"post_id":58460778,"comment_id":103272480,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460256/angular-observables-do-i-need-unsubscribe-if-no-subscription/58460778#comment103272480_58460778"},{"owner":{"reputation":3329,"user_id":4376500,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d75a13c3ee9b9b1719de430d80b664?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ka Tech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4376500/ka-tech"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571541512,"post_id":58460778,"comment_id":103273558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460256/angular-observables-do-i-need-unsubscribe-if-no-subscription/58460778#comment103273558_58460778"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2167,"user_id":5262452,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jhxYe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pato Vargas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5262452/pato-vargas"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571462950,"creation_date":1571462950,"answer_id":58460778,"question_id":58460256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58460778","body_markdown":"Yes always unsubscribe.

Even if the component get&#39;s destroyed, the overhead with the subscription finishing after the destruction is insignificant.\r\nYou&#39;d need to unsubscribe here if switching your components rapidly. Also unsubscribing cancels the http request, so if that&#39;s desired, then unsubscribe.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribing does not do any harm. If you&#39;re not sure, always unsubscribe.\r\n\r\n2) You do need to unsubscribe when subscribing to an observable that does not complete when your compoment gets destroyed. Otherwise this would cause a memory (and performance) leak. Because the observable itself holds a reference to the subscription and the subscription holds the reference to the component, the component will never get cleared from the memory and the action described in the subscription will be running until the observable completes, which in your case is never. That will happend for every instance of your component.\r\n\r\n##Solutions\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll share two popular options on simplifying the burden of unsubscribing. Expanding on the @amanagg1204 answer, you could create a base component from which you&#39;d extend all of your future components. You can have a custom operator in it. There is one downside to that - you always have to call `super.ngOnDestroy()` if you need to use `ngOnDestroy` in your component.\r\n\r\n    import { OnDestroy } from &quot;@angular/core&quot;;\r\n    import { Subject, MonotypeOperatorFunction } from &quot;rxjs&quot;;\r\n    import { takeUntil } from &quot;rxjs/operators&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    export abstract class UnsubscribeComponent implements OnDestroy {\r\n      protected destroyed$: Subject&lt;void&gt; = new Subject();\r\n    \r\n      ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n        this.destroyed$.next();\r\n        this.destroyed$.complete();\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      takeUntilDestroyed&lt;T&gt;(): MonotypeOperatorFunction&lt;T&gt; {\r\n          return takeUntil(this.destroyed$);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    export class Component extends UnsubscribeComponent {\r\n       ngOnInit() {\r\n          this.contacts$.pipe(\r\n                  this.takeUntilDestroyed(),\r\n              ).subscribe((data:any[])=&gt;{\r\n              this.records = this.sortData(data);\r\n          });\r\n       }\r\n\r\n      // WARNING - if you declare your ngOnDestroy in the component\r\n      ngOnDestroy() {\r\n         // DO NOT FORGET to call this\r\n         super.ngOnDestroy();\r\n         doYourStuff();\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOther option (my prefered) is not to have a parent abstract class (although it could also be implemented like that), but to use an utility called [`subsink`](https://github.com/wardbell/subsink) (`npm i subsink --save`)\r\n\r\n    import { SubSink } from &#39;subsink&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    export class SampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n      private subs = new SubSink();\r\n    \r\n      ngOnInit(): void {\r\n        // Just put it into sink.\r\n        this.subs.sink = this.contacts$.subscribe((data:any[])=&gt;{\r\n          this.records = this.sortData(data);\r\n        });\r\n        // call repeatedly\r\n        this.subs.sink = this.otherService$.subscribe((data:any[])=&gt;{\r\n          this.things = this.sortData(data);\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n        // this will unsubscribe all\r\n        this.subs.unsubscribe();\r\n      }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460256/angular-observables-do-i-need-unsubscribe-if-no-subscription/58461425#58461425","title":"Angular observables - Do I need unsubscribe if no subscription?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3329,"user_id":4376500,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d75a13c3ee9b9b1719de430d80b664?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ka Tech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4376500/ka-tech"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8396,"user_id":10959940,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cfe2af4009a4fe0acb46a707c8d5eab3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wentjun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10959940/wentjun"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":5,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571653556,"creation_date":1571455574,"last_edit_date":1571459766,"question_id":58460256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58460256","body_markdown":"I am using latest angular 8 and am new to the concept of observables.

Here’s the line that makes it happen\r\n```\r\nwindow.alert = function(txt) {\r\n\t\tcreateCustomAlert(txt);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nWhat this does is make the `alert()` function into your own custom function instead of the default. They used a separate function, `createCustomAlert`. You’ll want to create your own function.\r\n\r\nI would just set the container of the alert’s `style` property through JS. Instead of `display:block;`, use `display:none;`. There are other ways to accomplish this, of course. Here’s an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocument.getElementById(‘container-id’).style = ‘display:none;’;\r\n```\r\nAnother way is to create a class that is always hidden. You would then add or remove this class when you would like to toggle hiding the alert.\r\nThis requires JavaScript, which I see you’re not yet using.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460242/alert-in-mac-os-design-in-javascript/58460299#58460299","title":"alert() in mac OS design in Javascript"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12241478,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6f70cad97cc5eb9f35160679b66942?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"John Cart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12241478/john-cart"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571459067,"post_id":58460330,"comment_id":103257395,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460242/alert-in-mac-os-design-in-javascript/58460330#comment103257395_58460330"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":447,"user_id":4249232,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ded05ac0839a5adb998fa9f7516843c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sanil Khurana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4249232/sanil-khurana"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571456505,"creation_date":1571456505,"answer_id":58460330,"question_id":58460242,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58460330","body_markdown":"You need to create a JS file as well.

But even unchanged parts seems to have different hash and file names.\r\n\r\nIs there a proper way to achieve this idea ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460235/how-to-customize-nuxt-build-so-that-to-upload-changes-only","title":"How to customize nuxt build so that to upload changes only?"},{"tags":["javascript","vue.js","go","cookies"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571456792,"post_id":58460234,"comment_id":103257117,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460234/setting-cookie-in-golang#comment103257117_58460234"},{"owner":{"reputation":23639,"user_id":1266756,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/52eb9d81540fd9e91b82435b194ec9df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Volker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1266756/volker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571468375,"post_id":58460234,"comment_id":103258670,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460234/setting-cookie-in-golang#comment103258670_58460234"},{"owner":{"reputation":751,"user_id":3788340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f395b8e76dda8e86df20ae339e7a70b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"QtRoS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3788340/qtros"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571487164,"post_id":58460234,"comment_id":103262549,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460234/setting-cookie-in-golang#comment103262549_58460234"},{"owner":{"reputation":899,"user_id":413026,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sn0TL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tornike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/413026/tornike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571571001,"post_id":58460234,"comment_id":103278306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460234/setting-cookie-in-golang#comment103278306_58460234"},{"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":9240773,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a7fd90d8f55f1ef5bc2111c92868acd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julia12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9240773/julia12"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":899,"user_id":413026,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sn0TL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tornike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/413026/tornike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571614100,"post_id":58460234,"comment_id":103288678,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460234/setting-cookie-in-golang#comment103288678_58460234"},{"owner":{"reputation":899,"user_id":413026,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sn0TL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tornike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/413026/tornike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571738717,"post_id":58460234,"comment_id":103332312,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58460234/setting-cookie-in-golang#comment103332312_58460234"}],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":9240773,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a7fd90d8f55f1ef5bc2111c92868acd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julia12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9240773/julia12"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571455220,"creation_date":1571455220,"question_id":58460234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58460234","body_markdown":"I have a Vue.js app that makes a login request (POST) to a golang server.
