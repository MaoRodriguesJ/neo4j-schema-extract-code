Well, partly.\r\n\r\nYour protobuf implementations are under `target/{yourArch}/build/{yourCrateName}-{hash}/out`.\r\n\r\nThis would be extremely hard to get to if it wasn&#39;t for environment variables. The important part of the documentation is the following snippet of code highlights the inclusion:\r\n\r\n    pub mod items {\r\n        include!(concat!(env!(&quot;OUT_DIR&quot;), &quot;/snazzy.items.rs&quot;));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis includes the file available at `OUT_DIR` (the directory specified above, filled in automatically during compilation) and the name of the protobuf implementation (your package name in the protobuf file), and makes all its content structs available under `crate::items`.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense for the files to reside in the build directory, as they are a build artefact. Code generation in the `src` folder of your crate would lead to chaos, both when it comes to version control and project sanity (you&#39;d have a duplication of information, and the protobuf implementation, provided that it is sane, isn&#39;t *that* important to you. The functional blueprint is, however).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040435/how-to-generate-codes-using-prost-in-rust/58045074#58045074","title":"How to generate codes using prost in

fundamental problem with this proposal is that Python is interpreted whilst C is compiled.  \r\n\r\nWhile you pass the C source through the pre-processor once, and it is default behaviour for a C build toolchain, for Python you would have to build a tool that would pass the .py file through the C pre-processor, and hen pass the output to the Python interpreter every time you wanted to run the code.\r\n\r\nYour runtime would require both the Python interpreter and your special tool, and the code would no longer be portable to system without that dependency.\r\n\r\nIt is a complicated

writing a small module, which will be used in both Python and C. I can write a Python version and a C version, or I can compile the C version and then integrate in Python. But since the module is mostly math calculations, which are basically the same in Python and C, I&#39;m considering writing a single file that can both import in Python and compile as C source.\r\n\r\nHere is a basic trick:\r\n\r\n    #if 1 /*\r\n        write Python code here\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39; */\r\n        write C code here\r\n    #endif // &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n\r\nSo the Python interpreter will ignore the C part while the C compiler will ignore the Python part.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following `foo.py`:\r\n\r\n    #if 1 /*\r\n    from math import sin, cos, sqrt\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39; */\r\n    #include &lt;math.h&gt;\r\n    #endif // &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n\r\n    #if 1 /*\r\n    def rotation(axis, angle):\r\n        matrix = [0.] * 9\r\n        &#39;&#39;&#39; */\r\n    void rotation(double *axis, double angle, double *matrix) {\r\n        double sa, ca, ia, r, x, y, z, xx, yy, zz;\r\n        double cayz, caxz, caxy, iayz, iaxy, iaxz, sax, say, saz;\r\n    #endif // &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n        sa = sin(angle);\r\n        ca = cos(angle);\r\n        ia = 1. - ca;\r\n        r = sqrt(axis[0] * axis[0] + axis[1] * axis[1] + axis[2] * axis[2]);\r\n        x = axis[0] / r;\r\n        y = axis[1] / r;\r\n        z = axis[2] / r;\r\n        xx = x * x;\r\n        yy = y * y;\r\n        zz = z * z;\r\n        cayz = ca * (yy + zz);\r\n        caxz = ca * (xx + zz);\r\n        caxy = ca * (xx + yy);\r\n        iayz = ia * y * z;\r\n        iaxz = ia * x * z;\r\n        iaxy = ia * x * y;\r\n        sax = sa * x;\r\n        say = sa * y;\r\n        saz = sa * z;\r\n        matrix[0] = cayz + xx;\r\n        matrix[1] = iaxy - saz;\r\n        matrix[2] = iaxz + say;\r\n        matrix[3] = iaxy + saz;\r\n        matrix[4] = caxz + yy;\r\n        matrix[5] = iayz - sax;\r\n        matrix[6] = iaxz - say;\r\n        matrix[7] = iayz + sax;\r\n        matrix[8] = caxy + zz;\r\n    #if 1 /*\r\n        return matrix\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39; */\r\n        }\r\n    #endif // &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n\r\nIn Python:\r\n\r\n    from foo import rotation\r\n\r\n    print(rotation([1., 2., 3.], 4.))\r\n\r\nIn C:\r\n\r\n    #include &quot;foo.py&quot;\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n        double axis[3] = {1., 2., 3.};\r\n        double angle = 4.;\r\n        double matrix[9];\r\n        rotation(axis, angle, matrix);\r\n        printf(&quot;[%lf, %lf, %lf, %lf, %lf, %lf, %lf, %lf, %lf]&quot;,\r\n               matrix[0], matrix[1], matrix[2],\r\n               matrix[3], matrix[4], matrix[5],\r\n               matrix[6], matrix[7], matrix[8]);\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m wondering if I can go a little bit further, to use some better patterns such as macros, to define:\r\n\r\n* global (const) arrays and matrices\r\n* simple control flow, conditions and loops\r\n\r\nor some other improvements.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040403/single-source-file-for-both-python-and-c","title":"Single source file for both Python and

the_prop;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n       S s;\r\n       s.the_prop = 5;\r\n       return s.the_prop;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs there any way to define property declaration attribute with clang or gcc?\r\nIf I search for `__declspec`, all I find is `__declspec(dllexport)`, but I am not looking for that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040401/is-there-an-alternative-for-visual-c-declspec-property-declaration-attribut","title":"Is there an alternative for visual C++ __declspec

array(21, 22, 23, 24);\r\n$array3 = array(31, 32, 33, 34);\r\n$array4 = array(41, 42, 43, 44);\r\n\r\n$parentArray = array($array1, $array2, $array3, $array4);\r\n\r\n// the array where all subArrays

I dunno?  I decompiled it to C#.  If possible I&#39;d love to make this code work by changing project settings.  I know it&#39;s god awful code, but it&#39;s not mine and I really only need to comment out a few lines to make it work how I need.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040331/did-the-behavior-of-goto-statements-and-their-scope-change-and-when","title":"Did the behavior of goto statements and their scope

can be done in **Power Query** with a few clicks.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to this [article][1] to find out how to use **Power Query** on your version of Excel. It is available in **Excel 2010 Professional Plus and later versions**. My demonstration is using **Excel 2016**.\r\n\r\nThe steps are:\r\n\r\n 1. Add your original table to the **Power Query Editor**. You will notice the merged cells are &quot;un-merged&quot; automatically;\r\n\r\n[![Step 1][2]][2]\r\n\r\n 2. Right click the Header of the first column and go to **Fill** then select `Down`;\r\n\r\n[![Step 2][3]][3]\r\n\r\n 3. Use **Merge Columns** function under the `Transform` tab to merge the first two columns with a standard delimiter such as semicolon `;` ;\r\n\r\n[![Step 3][4]][4]\r\n\r\n 4. Use **Unpivot Columns** function under `Transform` tab to unpivot all other columns except the merged one, then you should the following;\r\n\r\n[![Step 4][5]][5]\r\n\r\n 5. Use **Split Column** function under the `Transform` tab to split the merged column using the same delimiter as used in Step 3;\r\n\r\n[![Step 5][6]][6]\r\n\r\n 6. **Pivot** the first column and select `Value` for the Values Column;\r\n\r\n[![Step 6][7]][7]\r\n\r\n 7. Change the format of `Attribute` column to **whole number**, then sort this column ascending, and then sort the first column ascending as well;\r\n\r\n[![Step 7][8]][8]\r\n\r\n 8. **Rename and Rearrange** the columns as desired, and then **Close and Load** the table to a new worksheet (by default).\r\n\r\n[![Step 8][9]][9]\r\n\r\n&gt;Please note the first column of the output table is not merged. You cannot manually merge them within a **Table**. As this table is linked to the source table, if you are going to make any changes to the source data, you can simply **refresh** the output table to have an updated result as shown below:\r\n\r\n[![Refreshed][10]][10] \r\n\r\nHere are the Power Query **M Codes** behind the scene for reference only. All steps are using `built-in` functions of the editor which is quite straight forward.\r\n\r\n    let\r\n        Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=&quot;Table3&quot;]}[Content],\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source,{{&quot;Names&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Date&quot;, type text}, {&quot;1&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;2&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;3&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;4&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;5&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;6&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;7&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;8&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;9&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;10&quot;, Int64.Type}}),\r\n        #&quot;Filled Down&quot; = Table.FillDown(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;,{&quot;Names&quot;}),\r\n        #&quot;Merged Columns&quot; = Table.CombineColumns(#&quot;Filled Down&quot;,{&quot;Names&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;},Combiner.CombineTextByDelimiter(&quot;;&quot;, QuoteStyle.None),&quot;Merged&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Unpivoted Columns&quot; = Table.UnpivotOtherColumns(#&quot;Merged Columns&quot;, {&quot;Merged&quot;}, &quot;Attribute&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Split Column by Delimiter&quot; = Table.SplitColumn(#&quot;Unpivoted Columns&quot;, &quot;Merged&quot;, Splitter.SplitTextByDelimiter(&quot;;&quot;, QuoteStyle.Csv), {&quot;Merged.1&quot;, &quot;Merged.2&quot;}),\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type1&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Split Column by Delimiter&quot;,{{&quot;Merged.1&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Merged.2&quot;, type text}}),\r\n        #&quot;Pivoted Column&quot; = Table.Pivot(#&quot;Changed Type1&quot;, List.Distinct(#&quot;Changed Type1&quot;[Merged.1]), &quot;Merged.1&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;, List.Sum),\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type2&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Pivoted Column&quot;,{{&quot;Attribute&quot;, Int64.Type}}),\r\n        #&quot;Sorted Rows&quot; = Table.Sort(#&quot;Changed Type2&quot;,{{&quot;Attribute&quot;, Order.Ascending}, {&quot;Merged.2&quot;, Order.Ascending}}),\r\n        #&quot;Reordered Columns&quot; = Table.ReorderColumns(#&quot;Sorted Rows&quot;,{&quot;Attribute&quot;, &quot;Merged.2&quot;, &quot;Rahul&quot;, &quot;Akash&quot;, &quot;Sumit&quot;, &quot;Mohan&quot;, &quot;Rathod&quot;, &quot;Nikhil&quot;}),\r\n        #&quot;Renamed Columns&quot; = Table.RenameColumns(#&quot;Reordered Columns&quot;,{{&quot;Attribute&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;}, {&quot;Merged.2&quot;, &quot;Names&quot;}})\r\n    in\r\n        #&quot;Renamed Columns&quot;\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

Sharing files between containers is tricky (requires startup-time options, there are lurking permission issues), one container can&#39;t directly run a command in another, and one container can&#39;t start another container without being trusted with unrestricted root-level access over the whole system.\r\n\r\nRebuilding this into a form that would work well with Docker would involve some reengineering, that&#39;s kind of secondary to the actual problem you&#39;re trying to solve.  Two typical approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of the Java tool being a tool that&#39;s run once and exits, make it be a long-running process with an HTTP interface.  The Django front-end would HTTP POST a file it wants processed, and get the results back in the HTTP response.\r\n\r\n2. Deploy a job queue like RabbitMQ.  When the Django application has a file it wants processed, it posts it into the job queue.  Wrap the Java tool in a worker that reads from the request queue, does its processing, and writes to a response queue.  The Django application is then able to pick up the response.\r\n\r\nThe last option is &quot;most industrial&quot; -- if you needed to process thousands of files  at a time, scale up and down the number of Java workers you had based on the workload, and generally run this as a production network service, it&#39;s a good way to go.  That doesn&#39;t sound like the scale you&#39;re aiming for.\r\n\r\nFinally: you should _never_ `eval()` anything, and you should _especially_ never `eval()` something you&#39;re getting from an HTTP request.  That&#39;s a massive security disaster waiting to happen.  (Anyone who can reach your service would be able to read or write any file your service could, and potentially even change the code the service is running; this could very easily become a scenario where someone takes over your entire system.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040314/how-to-manage-java-and-python-apps-on-docker/58040875#58040875","title":"How to manage Java and Python apps on docker?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zmuWV7gxuv8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reh-_pvT8uMC8eFo8lHVAyIdMejfA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"magsul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099422/magsul"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569073355,"creation_date":1569069186,"question_id":58040314,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040314","body_markdown":"I have a Python app based on Django that I run over a docker container.

And possibly make the wrapper handle a GET request that would use `eval()` to run the tool?\r\n- Is there another way I could enhance this architecture?\r\n\r\nEdit: The tool I&#39;m using: https://github.com/AbletonDevTools/groovylint","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040314/how-to-manage-java-and-python-apps-on-docker","title":"How to manage Java and Python apps on docker?"},{"tags":["java","arrays","random","java-8","java-stream"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14998,"user_id":4108590,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qDozH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ravindra Ranwala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4108590/ravindra-ranwala"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569074686,"post_id":58040310,"comment_id":102482558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040310/how-to-get-5-random-objects-from-list-using-streams-only-with-a-return-statement#comment102482558_58040310"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10821302,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S4lC1TUR4Zk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbch03jScVWXlXFucCUCPj21kTzvg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Oscar Lucena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10821302/oscar-lucena"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10821302,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S4lC1TUR4Zk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbch03jScVWXlXFucCUCPj21kTzvg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Oscar Lucena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10821302/oscar-lucena"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569069423,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569074882,"creation_date":1569069146,"last_edit_date":1569071225,"question_id":58040310,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040310","body_markdown":"I set up a web application using Java-SpringBoot and MySQL on backend side.\r\nI have a RestFUL API that return different info usin AJAX calls from front side. \r\nI have an endpoint that returns a a full list of exercices. Now I&#39;m creating another enpoint that should return only 5 random exercices from all the exercices, and I can&#39;t figure out how to do that using Streams\r\n\r\nThe code is all made using MVC and ORM to get the database, with the controller\r\n\r\nThis is the method to get the full list of exercices:\r\n```\r\npublic List getExercices(String discipline, List&lt;String&gt; group, List&lt;Integer&gt; level){\r\n     if(discipline.equals(&quot;calisthenics&quot;)){\r\n         return exercices_calisthenicsRepository.findAll()\r\n         .stream()\r\n         .filter(el-&gt;group.contains(el.getGroup()) &amp;&amp; level.contains(el.getLevel()))\r\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n```\r\nAnd now I want to filter this full list, and return only 5 random exercices.\r\n\r\nThe way I made it work, is by saving the info in a variable, and then taking 5 random exercices from the list. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//Create two empty list\r\n                List exercices = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n                List routine = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n//Save all the exercices in one of this lists\r\n                exercices = (exercices_calisthenicsRepository.findAll()\r\n                        .stream()\r\n                        .filter(el.getGroup()) &amp;&amp; level.contains(el.getLevel()))\r\n                        .collect(Collectors.toList()));\r\n\r\n//Create 5 random numbers\r\n                Random rand = new Random();\r\n                int random1 = rand.nextInt(exercices.size());\r\n                int random2 = rand.nextInt(exercices.size());\r\n                int random3 = rand.nextInt(exercices.size());\r\n                int random4 = rand.nextInt(exercices.size());\r\n                int random5 = rand.nextInt(exercices.size());\r\n\r\n//Add this elements from first List, to the final list\r\n                routine.add(exercices.get(random1));\r\n                routine.add(exercices.get(random2));\r\n                routine.add(exercices.get(random3));\r\n                routine.add(exercices.get(random4));\r\n                routine.add(exercices.get(random5));\r\n\r\n//Return final list with 5 exercices\r\n        return routine;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would say, there should be a much simpler way to do it just by using Streams, and maybe filtering right there instead of saving all the info in a List, and then generating a second list from it.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know if it&#39;s possible to do it just by using Streams with only one return statement?\r\n\r\nSOmething like this:\r\n```\r\n return exercices_calisthenicsRepository.findAll()\r\n                        .stream()\r\n                        .filter(el-&gt;group.contains(el.getGroup()) &amp;&amp; level.contains(el.getLevel()))\r\n                        .filter*here should filter and get 5 exercices only*\r\n                        .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040310/how-to-get-5-random-objects-from-list-using-streams-only-with-a-return-statement","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How to get 5 random objects from List using Streams only with a return statement"},{"tags":["typo3","typo3-8.x","typo3-extensions"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCPNTnyGDSdLO0bbkDy8foWnuoO19_IEgySNyvycQ=k-s128","display_name":"Oliver Doell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099377/oliver-doell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569081538,"post_id":58041813,"comment_id":102484184,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040309/typo3-8-7-custom-field-is-not-added-into-tt-content-table-from-custom-extension/58041813#comment102484184_58041813"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1290,"user_id":2333754,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v42b5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jo Hasenau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2333754/jo-hasenau"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569081005,"creation_date":1569081005,"answer_id":58041813,"question_id":58040309,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58041813","body_markdown":"    #1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax;\r\n    check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version\r\n    for the right syntax to use near &#39;)&#39; at line 3\r\n\r\nOr in other words: Remove the comma after your field definition to avoid that SQL error.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040309/typo3-8-7-custom-field-is-not-added-into-tt-content-table-from-custom-extension/58041813#58041813","title":"TYPO3 8.7: Custom field is not added into tt_content table from custom extension"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCPNTnyGDSdLO0bbkDy8foWnuoO19_IEgySNyvycQ=k-s128","display_name":"Oliver Doell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099377/oliver-doell"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCPNTnyGDSdLO0bbkDy8foWnuoO19_IEgySNyvycQ=k-s128","display_name":"Oliver Doell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099377/oliver-doell"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569081005,"creation_date":1569069142,"last_edit_date":1569078996,"question_id":58040309,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040309","body_markdown":"i try to add one custom field into the tt_content table in a custom extension.

of all the output of the codes most probably aren&#39;t identical but you didn&#39;t check. `j * j` does not fit in a 32-bit int with numbers larger than 46340, so undefined behaviour is a possibility, but I do not believe that it is the reason here.\r\n\r\nThe first code executes the inner loop *O(i)* times whereas the 2nd executes the inner loop *O(i&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;*) times, hence this is the difference between *O(&lt;sup&gt;n&#178;&lt;/sup&gt;)*  and *O(&lt;sup&gt;3n/2&lt;/sup&gt;)*, which at 1000000 would mean 316-fold execution time for the former (my computer gives 89 s vs 0.20 which is bout ~446 fold difference which is close enough), and that with `-O3`. \r\n\r\nThat you got the same *low* times would have been impossibru, unless the compilation took 89 seconds to inline the code.

I simply used a:\r\n\r\n$ cc number_v1.c\r\n\r\nto compile the first, and a:\r\n\r\n$ cc number_v2.c\r\n\r\nfor the second source code.\r\nI&#39;m on Mac OS X Darwin Kernel Version 18.7.0: Tue Aug 20 16:57:14 PDT 2019; root: xnu-4903.271.2 ~ 2 / RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64.\r\n\r\nIn response I had exactly the same timing result.

I know I can have a seperate controller and can extract the number of count through it. But I need to DRY my code. Open for any suggestions. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040292/counting-number-of-rows-as-per-column-in-laravel","title":"Counting number of rows as per column in Laravel"},{"tags":["java","android","android-studio","configuration","project"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":93,"user_id":4269855,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000132618294/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shasapo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4269855/shasapo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569070010,"post_id":58040287,"comment_id":102481409,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040287/im-getting-a-gradle-error-how-can-i-solve-it#comment102481409_58040287"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12100838,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDMDCFdGPNk8hNvOHJ_rwYqLG_SAHPWCagv6m-D=k-s128","display_name":"Chijioke Aaron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12100838/chijioke-aaron"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569107216,"post_id":58040287,"comment_id":102489554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040287/im-getting-a-gradle-error-how-can-i-solve-it#comment102489554_58040287"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--rlygYS2d64/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/ce0Xcx52XRA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Emanuel Canizales","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099416/emanuel-canizales"},"last_editor":{"reputation":620,"user_id":11383441,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6fe326a8e47283a622c4dc9bf700992?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kalana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11383441/kalana"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":92,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569076556,"creation_date":1569068995,"last_edit_date":1569076556,"question_id":58040287,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040287","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to do a console app in android studio, but when i execute the app it produces an error.\r\n\r\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n* Where:\r\nInitialization script `/private/var/folders/3g/2b70v24d5cqggs_c_tmts3pw0000gn/T/MainApplication_main__.gradle&#39; line: 20`\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nA problem occurred configuring project `:app Could not create task &#39;:app:MainApplication.main()&#39;.SourceSet with name &#39;main&#39;` not found.\r\n\r\n* Try:\r\nRun with `--stacktrace` option to get the stack trace.

Since you have nested logic we need to first unnest it so that it logically reads as \r\n\r\n    if age is null and pclass == 1\r\n    elif age is null and pclass == 2\r\n    elif age is null \r\n    else\r\n\r\n### Sample Data\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;Age&#39;: [50, 60, 70, np.NaN, np.NaN, np.NaN, np.NaN],\r\n                       &#39;Pclass&#39;: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, np.NaN, 1]})\r\n    #    Age  Pclass\r\n    #0  50.0     1.0\r\n    #1  60.0     1.0\r\n    #2  70.0     1.0\r\n    #3   NaN     1.0\r\n    #4   NaN     2.0\r\n    #5   NaN     NaN\r\n    #6   NaN     1.0\r\n\r\n    m = df.Age.isnull()\r\n    conds = [m &amp; df.Pclass.eq(1),\r\n             m &amp; df.Pclass.eq(2),\r\n             m]\r\n    choices = [37, 29, 24]\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;Age&#39;] = np.select(conds, choices, default=df.Age)\r\n                                          # |\r\n                                          # Takes care of else, i.e. Age not null\r\n    print(df)\r\n    #    Age  Pclass\r\n    #0  50.0     1.0\r\n    #1  60.0     1.0\r\n    #2  70.0     1.0\r\n    #3  37.0     1.0\r\n    #4  29.0     2.0\r\n    #5  24.0     NaN\r\n    #6  37.0     1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040272/apply-function-on-a-particular-column-of-a-dataframe/58040479#58040479","title":"Apply function on a particular column of a dataframe"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":765,"user_id":4196726,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wQ86ZJ6sCsA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI8/2dENRfi7v5c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Charles Langlois","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4196726/charles-langlois"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569072622,"creation_date":1569072622,"answer_id":58040774,"question_id":58040272,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58040774","body_markdown":"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html\r\n\r\nWhen you&#39;re using the `apply` method on a panda dataframe, the function you pass to apply is called on every column(or row, depending on the `axis` parameter which defaults to `0`, the column axis). \r\nSo your function must have a parameter for the row which `apply` will pass to it.\r\n\r\n    def include_mean():\r\n        if pd.isnull(&#39;Age&#39;):\r\n            if &#39;Pclass&#39;==1:\r\n                return 38\r\n            elif &#39;Pclass&#39;==2:\r\n                return 30\r\n            elif &#39;Pclass&#39;==3:\r\n                return 25\r\n            else: return &#39;Age&#39;\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues with this. \r\n\r\n1. `&#39;Pclass&#39;==1:` is guaranteed to be `False`, since you&#39;re comparing a string(`&#39;Pclass&#39;`) and an integer(`1`), which cannot be equal. What you want is to compare the value of the `Pclass` entry of a column, which you can retrieve by indexing the column: `col[&quot;Pclass&quot;]`, or `col[1]` if `Pclass` is the second column.\r\n2. if `pd.isnull(&#39;Age&#39;)` is `False`, the function returns `None`. Since the string `&#39;Age&#39;` is not null, this should always be the case. When you do `d.apply(include_mean())`, you&#39;re calling `include_mean`, which returns `None`, and then pass that value to `apply`. But `apply` expects a callable(e.g. a function).\r\n3. In the `else` clause, you&#39;re returning the string `&#39;Age&#39;`. This means your dataframe would have had the value `&#39;Age&#39;` in some cells.\r\n\r\nYour second sample fixes those issues: the impute_age function now takes a parameters for the row(`cols`), the value of the `Age` and `Pclass` columns are looked up and compared, and you pass that function without calling it to the `apply` method.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040272/apply-function-on-a-particular-column-of-a-dataframe/58040774#58040774","title":"Apply function on a particular column of a dataframe"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAGzlTAP3JBW_Ua8azjtk0lc1-s2kpX1SRs6tGcgA=k-s128","display_name":"Saurav Jaswal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099379/saurav-jaswal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2874,"user_id":3987854,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OV64v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"squareskittles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3987854/squareskittles"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569090145,"creation_date":1569068852,"last_edit_date":1569069424,"question_id":58040272,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040272","body_markdown":"    def include_mean():\r\n        if pd.isnull(&#39;Age&#39;):\r\n            if &#39;Pclass&#39;==1:\r\n                return 38\r\n            elif &#39;Pclass&#39;==2:\r\n                return 30\r\n            elif &#39;Pclass&#39;==3:\r\n                return 25\r\n            else: return &#39;Age&#39;\r\n    \r\n    train[&#39;Age&#39;]=train[[&#39;Age&#39;,&#39;Pclass&#39;]].apply(include_mean(),axis=1)\r\n\r\nwhy is the above code giving me a type error.\r\n\r\n     TypeError: (&quot;&#39;NoneType&#39; object is not callable&quot;, &#39;occurred at index 0&#39;)\r\n\r\nI now know the right code which is\r\n\r\n    def impute_age(cols):\r\n        Age = cols[0]\r\n        Pclass = cols[1]\r\n        \r\n        if pd.isnull(Age):\r\n    if Pclass == 1:\r\n                return 37\r\n    elif Pclass == 2:\r\n                return 29\r\n    else:\r\n                return 24\r\n    else:\r\n            return Age\r\n    \r\n    train[&#39;Age&#39;] = train[[&#39;Age&#39;,&#39;Pclass&#39;]].apply(impute_age,axis=1)\r\n\r\nNow I want to know why are the changes required i.e. the exact reasons behind them.

For example you might do:\r\n\r\n    def deactivate_button\r\n       view_context.link_to(&#39;Deactivate&#39;, &#39;...&#39;, disabled: deactivated?)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n&gt; 2) Between pattern 1 and 2, pattern 2 seems easier, since you don&#39;t need to wrap the entire code with a block. Why isn&#39;t this used more often? Is there a downside to using this? vs pattern 1?\r\n\r\nThere is no practical difference other than with the block you get access to both the unpresented user and presented user. But do you need to access the unpresented user? I&#39;d say not and would would prefer to use the non-block option.\r\n\r\n&gt; 3) With pattern 3, why don&#39;t people use this pattern at all? \r\n\r\nThey do and it is preferred to set a var in the controller than do it in the view.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040268/presenter-pattern/58047689#58047689","title":"Presenter Pattern"}],"owner":{"reputation":1913,"user_id":2012677,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d7cb2fe712fb17f44f8c354bf37e7b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2012677","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2012677/user2012677"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11827,"user_id":22237,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hkobD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/22237/kris"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569143176,"creation_date":1569068833,"last_edit_date":1569143176,"question_id":58040268,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040268","body_markdown":"## I have often seen pattern 1 used the most for Rails presenters.\r\n\r\n1) Why does the presenter need a view context? \r\n\r\n2) Between pattern 1 and 2, pattern 2 seems easier, since you don&#39;t need to wrap the entire code with a block.

Therefore, i am calling the cartService to retrieve the basket where the item should be removed from, before i actually remove the CatalogItem out of the cart&#39;s list. My problem is, that with the provided code above, the CatalogItem isnt being deleted out of the database, because somehow the changes to the currentCart object arent saved to the database. As far as i know, the currentCart object is untracked, so before saving the object to the database, i am calling the .Update method to start tracking the item and mark all properties as modified.\r\n\r\n    var itemToDelete = currentCart.Items.Find(model =&gt; model.ProductId == requestItem.CatalogItemId);\r\n    currentCart.Items.Remove(itemToDelete);\r\n    _context.UserCarts.Update(currentCart);\r\n    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\r\n\r\nI played around with the order of the code from above, and somehow saving the changed object to the dababase works with this order of the code:\r\n\r\n    var itemToDelete = currentCart.Items.Find(model =&gt; model.ProductId == requestItem.CatalogItemId);\r\n    _context.UserCarts.Update(currentCart);\r\n    currentCart.Items.Remove(itemToDelete);\r\n    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\r\n\r\nWhy is this solution working but not the first one?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040253/net-core-web-api-updating-a-model-in-the-database-context-wont-work","title":".NET Core Web API Updating a model in the database context wont work"},{"tags":["r","quantitative-finance","portfolio","r-portfolioanalytics"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12097618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788b5cc40dbe275e496d59840db3b9a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"pelumie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097618/pelumie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569089039,"post_id":58041740,"comment_id":102485915,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040250/extracting-weighs-of-relalanced-portfolio/58041740#comment102485915_58041740"},{"owner":{"reputation":657,"user_id":10107864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitali Avagyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10107864/vitali-avagyan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12097618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788b5cc40dbe275e496d59840db3b9a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"pelumie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097618/pelumie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569091095,"post_id":58041740,"comment_id":102486432,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040250/extracting-weighs-of-relalanced-portfolio/58041740#comment102486432_58041740"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12097618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788b5cc40dbe275e496d59840db3b9a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"pelumie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097618/pelumie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569370760,"post_id":58041740,"comment_id":102572368,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040250/extracting-weighs-of-relalanced-portfolio/58041740#comment102572368_58041740"},{"owner":{"reputation":657,"user_id":10107864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitali Avagyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10107864/vitali-avagyan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12097618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788b5cc40dbe275e496d59840db3b9a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"pelumie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097618/pelumie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569886396,"post_id":58041740,"comment_id":102733461,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040250/extracting-weighs-of-relalanced-portfolio/58041740#comment102733461_58041740"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":657,"user_id":10107864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitali Avagyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10107864/vitali-avagyan"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569080355,"creation_date":1569080355,"answer_id":58041740,"question_id":58040250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58041740","body_markdown":"First of all, your code is very messy!\r\n\r\nTherefore, while giving you the solution, I also cleaned it.\r\n\r\nHere are bullet points that cover all aspects of your question:\r\n\r\n 1. **Support plugins**\r\n\r\nSince you are using not only `DEoptim` solver but also `ROI`, you need to download the _recommended_ support plugins for `ROI`:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n    install.packages(c(&quot;fGarch&quot;, \r\n                           &quot;Rglpk&quot;, \r\n                           &quot;ROI.plugin.glpk&quot;, \r\n                           &quot;ROI.plugin.quadprog&quot;, \r\n                           &quot;ROI.plugin.symphony&quot;,\r\n                           &quot;pso&quot;,\r\n                           &quot;GenSA&quot;,\r\n                           &quot;corpcor&quot;,\r\n                           &quot;testthat&quot;,\r\n                           &quot;nloptr&quot;, \r\n                           &quot;MASS&quot;, \r\n                           &quot;robustbase&quot;)\r\n                         )\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. **Use of libraries**\r\n\r\nYou should load libraries **once** and in the correct order since some libraries can mask some functions from each other. Here is the recommended order:\r\n```\r\n    library(ROI)\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    library(quantmod)\r\n    library(PerformanceAnalytics)\r\n    library(random)\r\n    library(DEoptim)\r\n    library(fPortfolio)\r\n    library(PortfolioAnalytics)\r\n    library(dplyr) \r\n```\r\n 3. **Use of _pipe_ operator**\r\n\r\nNotice that there is an additional `dplyr` library loaded which is needed for _piping_ (`%&gt;% `), i.e. making your code more efficient and readable!:\r\n\r\n    #vector of stocks in my portfolio  of \r\n    tickers &lt;- c(&quot;FB&quot;, &quot;AAPL&quot;, &quot;AMZN&quot;, &quot;GM&quot;, &quot;GOOGL&quot;, &quot;SQ&quot;, &quot;NVDA&quot;,&quot;RYAM&quot;, &quot;AMAT&quot;, &quot;IMMR&quot;,&quot;SOI&quot;,&quot;PETS&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    #bind porfolio prices \r\n    portfolioPrices &lt;- NULL\r\n    for(ticker in tickers) {\r\n      portfolioPrices &lt;- cbind(portfolioPrices,\r\n                               getSymbols.yahoo(ticker, from=&#39;2003-01-03&#39;, periodicity = &#39;daily&#39;, auto.assign=FALSE)[,4])\r\n    }\r\n    #portfolio returns\r\n    portfolioReturns &lt;- na.omit(ROC(portfolioPrices))\r\n    print(portfolioReturns)\r\n    \r\n    portf &lt;- portfolio.spec(colnames(portfolioReturns)) %&gt;% \r\n      add.constraint(type=&quot;weight_sum&quot;, min_sum=1, max_sum=1) %&gt;% \r\n      add.constraint(type=&quot;box&quot;, min=.02, max=.60) %&gt;% \r\n      add.constraint(type=&quot;transation_cost&quot;, ptc=.001) %&gt;% \r\n      add.objective(type=&quot;return&quot;, name=&quot;mean&quot;) %&gt;%\r\n      add.objective(type=&quot;risk&quot;, name=&quot;StdDev&quot;,target=.005)\r\n\r\n 4. **Removing redundancies**\r\n\r\nNot sure why you cannot use the previous random portfolio `rp` which was input to `optPort` as an input to `opt_rebal`.\r\n\r\n    rp&lt;-random_portfolios(portf, 10000, &quot;sample&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    #optimize portfolio using the &quot;DEoptim solver&quot;\r\n    optPort &lt;- optimize.portfolio(portfolioReturns, portf, optimize_method = &quot;DEoptim&quot;, trace=TRUE,\r\n                                  rp=rp)\r\n    \r\n    #chart weights of optimized portfolio\r\n    chart.Weights(optPort)\r\n    summary(optPort)\r\n    \r\n    # chart.RiskReward(optPort, risk.col = &quot;StDev&quot;, return.col = &quot;mean&quot;, chart.assets = TRUE)\r\n    \r\n    #not sure why you cannot use the previous random portfolio!!\r\n    rp&lt;-random_portfolios(portf, 10000, &quot;sample&quot;)\r\n\r\n 5. **Understanding the use of Risk-Reward plot**\r\n\r\nThere is an error in this function call which I assume is due to the dual objective in your `portf` as it might prevent you from getting the efficient frontier. Not sure about that; this is not essential but a task for you to explore :-)\r\n\r\n    # chart.RiskReward(optPort, risk.col = &quot;StDev&quot;, return.col = &quot;mean&quot;, chart.assets = TRUE)\r\n\r\n 6. **Understanding _ROI_**\r\n\r\n`ROI` differs from other back-ends and therefore needs a separate portfolio specification `portfolio.spec` and portfolio optimisation `optimize.portfolio` or `optimize.portfolio.rebalancing`. \r\n\r\nHere is one way of implementing it (pay attention to portfolio specification which has no `add.objective` inside): \r\n\r\n    portf2 &lt;- portfolio.spec(colnames(portfolioReturns)) %&gt;% \r\n      add.constraint(type=&quot;weight_sum&quot;, min_sum=1, max_sum=1) %&gt;%\r\n      add.constraint(type=&quot;box&quot;, min=.02, max=.60) %&gt;% \r\n      add.constraint(type=&quot;transation_cost&quot;, ptc=.001) \r\n    \r\n    #this optimises based on Sharpe Ratio\r\n    optPort2 &lt;- optimize.portfolio(portfolioReturns, portf2, optimize_method = &quot;ROI&quot;, trace=TRUE,\r\n                                   maxSR=TRUE)\r\n    \r\n    #rebalance portfolo\r\n    opt_rebal &lt;- optimize.portfolio.rebalancing(portfolioReturns,\r\n                                                portf2,\r\n                                                optimize_method=&quot;ROI&quot;,\r\n                                                rp=rp,\r\n                                                rebalance_on=&quot;years&quot;,\r\n                                                training_period=60,\r\n                                                rolling_window=60)\r\n    \r\n    extractWeights(optPort)\r\n    chart.Weights(optPort)\r\n    \r\n    #extract weights of rebalanced portfolio\r\n    extractWeights(opt_rebal)\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &gt; extractWeights(opt_rebal)\r\n               FB.Close AAPL.Close AMZN.Close GM.Close GOOGL.Close SQ.Close NVDA.Close RYAM.Close AMAT.Close\r\n    2017-12-29      0.6        0.2       0.02     0.02        0.02     0.02       0.02       0.02       0.02\r\n    2018-12-31      0.6        0.2       0.02     0.02        0.02     0.02       0.02       0.02       0.02\r\n    2019-09-20      0.6        0.2       0.02     0.02        0.02     0.02       0.02       0.02       0.02\r\n               IMMR.Close SOI.Close PETS.Close\r\n    2017-12-29       0.02      0.02       0.02\r\n    2018-12-31       0.02      0.02       0.02\r\n    2019-09-20       0.02      0.02       0.02\r\n\r\nYou can read the documentation about `optimize.portfolio` to see what limited type of convex optimization problems it can solve.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040250/extracting-weighs-of-relalanced-portfolio/58041740#58041740","title":"extracting weighs of relalanced portfolio"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12097618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788b5cc40dbe275e496d59840db3b9a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"pelumie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097618/pelumie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":657,"user_id":10107864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitali Avagyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10107864/vitali-avagyan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569080355,"creation_date":1569068673,"last_edit_date":1569072257,"question_id":58040250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040250","body_markdown":"I am running a portfolio optimization on a series of stocks and I am trying to extract the weights of the rebalanced portfolio. \r\n\r\nThe problem I am having: instead of getting the weights of the rebalanced portfolio, I am getting 3 dates.

Every view has request.

You immediately make the check when you construct a view object, and at that time, the `request`, `args` and `kwargs` are *not* yet set. In fact these are set just after the object is constructed. You can see this in the source code of the [**`view`** function [GitHub]](https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.2.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L61:L76):\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        def view(request, *args, **kwargs):\r\n            self = cls(**initkwargs)\r\n            if hasattr(self, &#39;get&#39;) and not hasattr(self, &#39;head&#39;):\r\n                self.head = self.get\r\n            self.&lt;b&gt;setup(&lt;/b&gt;request, *args, **kwargs&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n            if not hasattr(self, &#39;request&#39;):\r\n                raise AttributeError(\r\n                    &amp;quot;%s instance has no &#39;request&#39; attribute. Did you override &amp;quot;\r\n                    &amp;quot;setup() and forget to call super()?&amp;quot; % cls.__name__\r\n                )\r\n            return self.dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\nand the [**`setup`** function [GitHub]](https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.2.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L83:L87) sets the `.request`, `.args` and `.kwargs`:\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    def setup(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Initialize attributes shared by all view methods.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;\r\n        &lt;b&gt;self.request = request&lt;/b&gt;\r\n        self.args = args\r\n        self.kwargs = kwargs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\nEven if there was a request object however, that would not fix the problem, since returning a `redirect` in the `__init__` is not something the underlying view mechanism will anticipate on, and it will thus, likely, somewhere raise another error.\r\n\r\nThat being said, what you here do is already done before.

result you get, is precisely telling you what is happening. Neither of your methods is invoking the constructor.\r\n\r\nAll of your methods have the form\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    @MarkerN\r\n    public void fX() {\r\n        Z.g();\r\n    }\r\nso they contain an invocation of the `static` method `g()` of class `Z`. But no instantiation of `Z`.\r\n\r\nInstead, your classes `A` and `B` are subclasses of `Z`. Since you didn’t declare explicit constructors for them, the compiler generates default constructors for them, like\r\n\r\n    public class A extends Z {\r\n\r\n        public A() {\r\n            super(); // here, the constructor of Z gets called\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n    // the other methods …\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand so, the reflective lookup will tell you that the invocation of `Z`’s constructor happens inside a method named `&lt;init&gt;`, which is `A`’s constructor, resp. `B`’s constructor for `B`.\r\n\r\nIt would be different if the methods did `new Z().g()`, but that would make the questionable design of relying on a constructor being executed before a `static` method invocation even worse.\r\n\r\nThis issue should be solved on the framework side, which is doing both, instantiating `A` and `B` and invoking the methods `f1()` to `f4()` on them. E.g. with JUnit&#160;5, the solution would look like:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    package test;\r\n    \r\n    import java.lang.annotation.*;\r\n    import java.lang.reflect.AnnotatedElement;\r\n    import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;\r\n    \r\n    public class A {\r\n        @BeforeEach\r\n        public void prepare(TestInfo ti) {\r\n            Z.loadConfiguration(ti.getTestMethod().get());\r\n        }\r\n        @Test\r\n        @Marker1\r\n        public void f1() {\r\n            Z.g();\r\n        }\r\n        @Test\r\n        @Marker2\r\n        public void f2() {\r\n            Z.g();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class Z {\r\n        public static void loadConfiguration(AnnotatedElement e) {\r\n            if(e.isAnnotationPresent(Marker1.class)) {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Marker1&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            else if(e.isAnnotationPresent(Marker2.class)) {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Marker2&quot;);\r\n            } \r\n        }\r\n        public static void g() {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Z.g()&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    @interface Marker1 {}\r\n    \r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    @interface Marker2 {}\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n\r\n    Marker1\r\n    Z.g()\r\n    Marker2\r\n    Z.g()\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040218/how-to-get-annotations-of-a-caller-method-from-another-class/58063966#58063966","title":"How to get annotations of a caller method from another class"}],"owner":{"reputation":641,"user_id":5332629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/610vH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hosein Aqajani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5332629/hosein-aqajani"},"last_editor":{"reputation":641,"user_id":5332629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/610vH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hosein Aqajani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5332629/hosein-aqajani"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569246542,"creation_date":1569068491,"last_edit_date":1569219900,"question_id":58040218,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58040218","body_markdown":"I am using `jdk1.8.0_221` and I want to load specific configuration inside the constructor of super class based on calling two different types of methods. I am seeking for the best practice and preferably a convenient approach.\r\n\r\nDue to simplification, I have simulated the code situation as the following snippet:\r\n\r\n    package test;\r\n    public class A extends Z{\r\n        @Test\r\n        @Marker1\r\n        public void f1() {\r\n            Z.g();\r\n        }\r\n        @Test\r\n        @Marker2\r\n        public void f2() {\r\n            Z.g();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    package test;\r\n    public class B extends Z{\r\n        @Test\r\n        @Marker1\r\n        public void f3() {\r\n            Z.g();\r\n        }\r\n        @Test\r\n        @Marker2\r\n        public void f4() {\r\n            Z.g();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    package core;\r\n    public class Z{\r\n        public Z() {\r\n            //I want to determine here that which type of method calls this constructor\r\n            //The caller could be Marker1 or Marker2\r\n            //And based on the caller, load the corresponding configuration\r\n        }\r\n        public static void g(){\r\n            //some code goes here\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Note1:** There are many methods from different classes that calls `Z.g()`, so I could not use the explicit name of class to get methods and its annotations.\r\n\r\n**Note2:** All of configurations should be done inside the constructor of super class of Z.\r\n\r\n**Note3:** The `g()` method is not necessarily static.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following snippet but `getMethodName()` return always `&lt;init&gt;`:\r\n\r\n    public Z() throws NoSuchMethodException, ClassNotFoundException{\r\n        StackTraceElement[] stElements = Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();\r\n        StackTraceElement ste = stElements[3];// or stElements[2]\r\n        Class&lt;?&gt; aClass = Class.forName(ste.getClassName());\r\n        String methodName = ste.getMethodName();\r\n        Method method = aClass.getMethod(methodName);\r\n        Annotation[] annotations = aClass.getAnnotations();\r\n        for (Annotation annotation : annotations) {\r\n            if (annotation.getClass().equals(Marker1.class)) {\r\n                 //load conf1\r\n                 break;\r\n             } else if (annotation.getClass().equals(Marker2.class)) {\r\n                 //load conf2\r\n                 break;\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlso, I have tried many solutions in stackoverflow and other communities which not worked properly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58040218/how-to-get-annotations-of-a-caller-method-from-another-class","title":"How to get annotations of a caller method from another
