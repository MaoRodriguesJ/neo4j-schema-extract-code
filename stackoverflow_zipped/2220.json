 }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach time `onSearchTapped` is called, it fires a request for new games.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s plenty of things going on here - let&#39;s start from `requestGames`.\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;m using **JSONPlaceholder** free API to fetch some data and show it in the List.\r\n\r\n`requestGames` performs the network request, decodes `[Game]` from the received `Data`. In addition to that, the returned array is filtered using the search string (because of the free API limitation - in a real world scenario you&#39;d use a query parameter in the request URL).\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s have a look at the view model constructor.\r\n\r\nThe order of the events is:\r\n\r\n- Get the &quot;search tapped&quot; subject.\r\n- Perform a network request (`flatMap`)\r\n- Inside the `flatMap`, loading logic is handled (dispatched on the main queue as `isLoading` uses a `Publisher` underneath, and there will be a warning if a value is published on a background thread).\r\n- `replaceError` changes the error type of the publisher to `Never`, which is a requirement for the `assign` operator.\r\n- `receiveOn` is necessary as we&#39;re probably still in a background queue, thanks to the network request - we want to publish the results on the main queue.\r\n- `assign` updates the array `games` on the view model.\r\n- `store` saves the `Cancellable` in the `disposeBag`\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the view code (without the loading, for the sake of the demo):\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n\r\n    @ObservedObject var viewModel = GameListViewModel()\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        NavigationView {\r\n            Group {\r\n               VStack {\r\n                    SearchBar(text: $viewModel.searchTerm,\r\n                              onSearchButtonClicked: viewModel.onSearchTapped)\r\n                    List(viewModel.games, id: \\.title) { game in\r\n                        Text(verbatim: game.title)\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            .navigationBarTitle(Text(&quot;Games&quot;))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Search bar implementation**:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct SearchBar: UIViewRepresentable {\r\n\r\n    @Binding var text: String\r\n    var onSearchButtonClicked: (() -&gt; Void)? = nil\r\n\r\n    class Coordinator:

Indeed, except for the two base cases, all other cases will result in two extra calls:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fibGen :: Int -&amp;gt; Int\r\nfibGen 0 = 0\r\nfibGen 1 = 1\r\nfibGen n = &lt;b&gt;fibGen (n-1)&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;fibGen (n-2)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nSo this means that for `fibGen 5` for example, we will evaluate this as:\r\n\r\n    fibGen 5\r\n      - fibGen 4\r\n        - fibGen 3\r\n          - fibGen 2\r\n            - fibGen 1\r\n            - fibGen 0\r\n          - fibGen 1\r\n        - fibGen 2\r\n          - fibGen 1\r\n          - fibGen 0\r\n      - fibGen 3\r\n        - fibGen 2\r\n          - fibGen 1\r\n          - fibGen 0\r\n        - fibGen 1\r\n\r\nSo in order to calculate `fibGen 5`, we thus will make a total of 15 calls. One for `fibGen 4`, two for `fibGen 3`, three for `fibGen 2`, five for `fibGen 1`, and three for `fibGen 0`.\r\n\r\nEach time we increment `n`, we will almost double the amount of calls. It is clear that for a large `n`, the number of calls is that huge that a modern machine can still not process it.\r\n\r\nFurthermore your `stepper` function is defined as an infinite loop. Indeed, a more verbose variant of your function is:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;stepper n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n  | length (show ( fibGen n )) &amp;gt;= 1000 = n\r\n  | otherwise = (&lt;b&gt;stepper n&lt;/b&gt;) + 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nSo that means that if you calculate `stepper n`, and the constraint fails, you call `stepper n` again, and you will later add `1` to that result, but you thus get stuck in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nYou can fix this by adding parenthesis:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;stepper n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n  | length (show ( fibGen n )) &amp;gt;= 1000 = n\r\n  | otherwise = stepper &lt;b&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;n + 1&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nNow eventually the program will terminate, but it will take a lot of time, due to the branching in the recursive definition. Note that each time you call `fibGen`, it will again branch, so that means that even if we fix the infinite loop, if we have called `fibGen 5`, then if we later call `fibGen 6`, we will do all the work again to calculate `fibGen 5` to calculate `fibGen 6`. We thus do not use memoization here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYour second fibonacci program on the other hand generates a list, and it reuses the results in the list. `fib` will thus evaluate as:\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   0 : 1 : zipWith &amp;hellip;\r\n-&gt; 0 : 1 : 1 : zipWith &amp;hellip;\r\n-&gt; 0 : 1 : 1 : 2 : zipWith &amp;hellip;\r\n-&gt; 0 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : zipWith &amp;hellip;\r\n-&gt; 0 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : 5 : zipWith &amp;hellip;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nSo this will not suffer from branching, since it *reuses* results that are already in the list.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012505/slow-solution-to-project-euler-25-using-haskell/58012755#58012755","title":"Slow solution to project euler 25 using haskell"}],"owner":{"reputation":229,"user_id":11118251,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RUR0V.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shadesfear","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11118251/shadesfear"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58012755,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568902355,"creation_date":1568900765,"question_id":58012505,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58012505","body_markdown":"I am new to the Haskell language, and to learn I thought i would jump into some Project Euler.

Moreover, since none of the `rightSidebarTabContents` is relevant in `section C`, I&#39;d also like that (2) the user&#39;s **click on the on the left sidebar menu item C** could **close the rightsidebar**, if it is open. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found a possible hint on how to solve my problems  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52876446/automatic-rightsidebar-popup-when-menuitem-is-clicked-in-shinydashboardplus), and I was indeed able to partially solve my first problem adding/removing some CSS class via `shinyjs` to activate a part of the different tabs in the `rightSidebar` at click on the `menuItems`.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this solution partially works for my first issue, although only the `rightSidebarTabContent` lower part is activated/deactivated in this way, but not the tab header with the icons for navigating between them.  Moreover, possibly due to extra CSS classes added when I apply the shinydashboard theme &quot;dark&quot;, I&#39;m not able to toggle the closing of the `rightSidebar` at click on `section C` menu item (issue # 2).  \r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n 1. Right sidebar item `T_A` should expand when left sidebar item `section A` is selected. Likewise for `T_A` and `section B`.\r\n 2. The right sidebar should collapse when `section C` is selected on the left sidebar\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help with this?

A Parent passes data to the child (think school lunch on first day).\r\n 2. The Child displays Data, mutates data (local copy and not the Prop), or does something special. (Throwing away the vegetables)\r\n 3. The child is so proud of this it wants to let everyone know so it `$emits()` a change.\r\n 4. All parents see this and can do what they want from this point.

The table is defined using: \r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE station_binaries (\r\n       StationID int,\r\n       StationName nvarchar, \r\n       Timestamp datetime2(7), \r\n       InstrumentNumber int, \r\n       Folder nvarchar, \r\n       Filename nvarchar, \r\n       Ensemble varbinary(MAX)\r\n    )\r\n\r\nwhere ```Ensemble``` stores 2 KB of data.

using `FullCalendar 4.3.1` and when I move one task (event) from one day to another I&#39;m receiving the `end` field to null.\r\n\r\nI initialize the calendar like this:\r\n\r\n    document.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, function() {\r\n        let calendarElement = document.getElementById(&#39;calendar&#39;);\r\n        calendar = new

{\r\n            // Not relevant\r\n          },\r\n          editable: true,\r\n          eventLimit: true, // allow &quot;more&quot; link when too many events\r\n          events: [],\r\n          eventRender: function(info) {\r\n          },\r\n          eventDrop: function(info) { &lt;-- (1) \r\n            moveTask(info.event.id, info.event.start, info.event.end);\r\n          },\r\n          eventResize: function(info) {\r\n            moveTask(info.event.id, info.event.start, info.event.end);\r\n          },\r\n          eventClick: function(info) {\r\n             // Not relevant\r\n

**(1)** I get the `id`, the `start` field but then `end` field it&#39;s null.\r\n\r\nReading the [eventDrop docs][1] it says that the `event` field it&#39;s an [eventObject][2] with `start` and `end`.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don&#39;t have `allDay` property. Because it may infer with the `end` value:\r\n\r\n&gt; Something date-parseable. When your event ends. If your event is\r\n&gt; explicitly allDay, hour, minutes, seconds and milliseconds will be\r\n&gt; ignored. If omitted, your events will appear to have the default\r\n&gt; duration. See defaultAllDayEventDuration, defaultTimedEventDuration,\r\n&gt; and forceEventDuration for more info.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Note: This value is exclusive. For example, if you have an all-day\r\n&gt; event that has an end of 2018-09-03, then it will span through\r\n&gt; 2018-09-02 and end before the start of 2018-09-03.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s explained here: [Explanation][3]\r\n\r\nAnd the events are filled from a DDBB where all events have a `start` and an `end` date like this. It&#39;s an array of dicts:\r\n\r\n    {&#39;id&#39;: row[&#39;id&#39;], &#39;title&#39;: row[&#39;title&#39;], &#39;start&#39;: row[&#39;start&#39;], &#39;end&#39;: row[&#39;end&#39;], &#39;backgroundColor&#39;: row[&#39;color&#39;], &#39;borderColor&#39;: row[&#39;color&#39;]}\r\n\r\nSo, what I&#39;m doing wrong that causes get `end` to `null`?\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n-- EDIT:\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve added a picture with the data which it&#39;s populated FullCalendar.\r\n\r\n[![Data debuger][4]][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://fullcalendar.io/docs/eventDrop\r\n  [2]: https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-object\r\n  [3]: https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-parsing\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQk7o.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012424/end-value-is-null-when-moving-event-in-fullcalendar","title":"End value is null when moving event in FullCalendar"},{"tags":["html","css"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7047,"user_id":995800,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EWf5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Constantin Gro&#223;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/995800/constantin-gro%c3%9f"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568900801,"creation_date":1568900801,"answer_id":58012514,"question_id":58012421,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58012514","body_markdown":"For your h4 tag, you&#39;re not setting any `z-index` at all.

You&#39;re right, it is a common technique to decrease computing time of a program. However, as it has been said in the comments, it is not absolutely sure you will save time, because it depends on many factors (compiler, compiler optimisation level, etc...). It is also possible that the compiler does unroll loops itself if you choose a high optimisation level.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget it takes more code size, which is also a valuable resource.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind there are other ways to optimize code.

I work at the science museum and I also want visitors to interact with the exhibition. Vuforia Object3DScanner had no solid build and recognition, so I use a 2D marker, as users will always be facing the experiment, never inside or behind it.\r\nHowever, my exposure is not static, as it is a pendulum in motion. My AR projection must overlay the pendulum with a velocity vector and indicate its velocity. So getting the target position is important, because at the center of the movement the speed is maximum and at its extremes, minimum.

In my scripts I often use such positional argument if there is one option that the user always needs to pass.\r\n - You might even consider changing your way of calling the script to `createfile xyzfile -n 3` or even `createfile xyzfile` where the name is a positional argument and the number of files optional (choose a logical default value, probably 1)...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012341/how-to-call-a-function-with-2-arguments-which-under-the-option-of-getopts/58024369#58024369","title":"how to call a function with 2 arguments which under the option of &quot;getopts&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":11072839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ITpGvCutbWw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/ACNS6sKF7eY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"cchi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11072839/cchi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58016509,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568985197,"creation_date":1568900254,"question_id":58012341,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58012341","body_markdown":"New in Linux bash script. \r\nHere I tried to create some files with ```getopts```.

is a really simple feature which does pretty much what your code does, although it locks the min or max to zero depending if the data is positive or negative:\r\n\r\n            var extent =

(indirectly) before each render and redraw. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s some general purpose advice for when `elasticX` or `elasticY` doesn&#39;t do exactly what you want. I&#39;ve never seen it fail! (Which is saying something in such a quirky codebase as dc.js.)\r\n\r\nFirst, disable `elasticX`. Then create a function which calculates the X domain and sets it:\r\n\r\n    function custom_elastic(chart) {\r\n      var max = chart.dimension().top[1][0].value;\r\n      var min = chart.dimension().top(10)[9].value;\r\n      chart.x().domain([min,max]);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve parameterized it on the chart for generality.\r\n\r\nNow we can have this function called on the [preRender and preRedraw events](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/dc.baseMixin.html#on__anchor). These events will pass the chart when they fire:\r\n\r\n    chart.on(&#39;preRender&#39;, custom_elastic)\r\n         .on(&#39;preRedraw&#39;, custom_elastic);\r\n\r\nAnd that should do it!\r\n\r\nBTW, you probably don&#39;t want to set the range of the scale - this is set automatically by the chart, and it&#39;s a little more complicated than you have it since it takes margins into account.\r\n\r\n### Debugging the min and max\r\n\r\nLooking at [your fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/IsaacThimbleby/y3s0g158/62/) I realized that I hadn&#39;t given a second look to how you are calculating the min and max.\r\n\r\nI also hadn&#39;t noticed that you had the range start at -100.\r\n\r\nGood first step logging it; it reports\r\n\r\n```\r\nmin: 0.81, max: 0.82\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is incorrect. The top ten are from 0.96 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the dimension&#39;s key is the `id`, so the rows returned by `.top()` are in reverse alphabetical order (the &quot;largest&quot; strings).\r\n\r\nAgain you&#39;re on the right track with \r\n\r\n    console.log(Group.top(Infinity))\r\n\r\nYes! The group will give you the top 10 by value.\r\n\r\n    var top10 = thischart.group().top(10);\r\n    var max = top10[0].value;\r\n    var min = top10[9].value;\r\n\r\nNice!\r\n\r\n[![semi-working bar elastic][1]][1]\r\n\r\n[fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gordonwoodhull/1ymrbn8q/11/)\r\n\r\nBut wait, doesn&#39;t it look like the bars are stretching off the left side of the chart?\r\n\r\n### Hacking the row chart with a renderlet to draw bars starting at the left edge\r\n\r\nOkay now it&#39;s clear that the row chart doesn&#39;t support this. Here is a hack to resize the bars to the left edge:\r\n\r\n    chart.on(&#39;renderlet&#39;, function(chart) {\r\n        var transform = chart.select(&#39;g.row rect&#39;).attr(&#39;transform&#39;);\r\n        var tx = +transform.split(&#39;(&#39;)[1].split(&#39;,&#39;)[0];\r\n        chart.selectAll(&#39;g.row rect&#39;)\r\n            .attr(&#39;transform&#39;, null)\r\n            .attr(&#39;width&#39;, function(d) {\r\n                return +d3.select(this).attr(&#39;width&#39;) + tx;\r\n            })\r\n        chart.selectAll(&#39;g.row text.row&#39;)\r\n            .attr(&#39;transform&#39;, null);    \r\n    })\r\n\r\nAll the row rects are going to be offset by a large negative number, which we grab first in `tx`. Then we remove the `transform` from both the rects and the text, and add `tx` to the width of the row rects.\r\n\r\n[![good except for the last bar][2]][2] \r\n\r\n[fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gordonwoodhull/1ymrbn8q/28/)\r\n\r\nGreat! But where&#39;s the last bar? Well, we took the top ten values for the min and max, so the tenth bar is the minimum value.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll have to figure out what works for you, but I found that looking at the top 20 values left the top 10 at good sizes:\r\n\r\n    var N = 20;\r\n    var topN = thischart.group().top(N);\r\n    var max = topN[0].value;\r\n    var min = topN[N-1].value;\r\n\r\n\r\n[![good bounds][3]][3]\r\n\r\n[final fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gordonwoodhull/1ymrbn8q/32/)\r\n\r\nThis hack does not play well with the built-in transitions, so I turned them off for this chart:\r\n\r\n    chart.transitionDuration(0)\r\n\r\nIt would be a lot more work to hack that part, and better to [fix it in the chart itself](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1580).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVCqam.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/invvsm.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mg6Xcm.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012328/dcjs-dynamic-zooming-to-fit-range-of-values/58014434#58014434","title":"dcjs dynamic zooming to fit range of values"}],"owner":{"reputation":168,"user_id":2622511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2a865f05e209ac5feda5207c5571d6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Isaac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2622511/isaac"},"last_editor":{"reputation":168,"user_id":2622511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2a865f05e209ac5feda5207c5571d6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Isaac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2622511/isaac"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58014434,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568994845,"creation_date":1568900213,"last_edit_date":1568973104,"question_id":58012328,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58012328","body_markdown":"I have a rowchart in DCjs that plots the top N values of a given parameter.

Thus, some commas and other important information was lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54383809","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012325/ng-build-prod-throws-unexpected-token-punc-because-of-imported-library-in/58017043#58017043","title":"ng build --prod throws Unexpected token: punc ()) because of imported library in the module list"}],"owner":{"reputation":4563,"user_id":894532,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/epFXH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maihan Nijat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/894532/maihan-nijat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4563,"user_id":894532,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/epFXH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maihan Nijat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/894532/maihan-nijat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58017043,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568922732,"creation_date":1568900199,"last_edit_date":1568922732,"question_id":58012325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58012325","body_markdown":"The app loads fine with `ng serve` but throws `Unexpected token: punc ())` while building with `ng build --prod`.

experimenting with several sklearn classifiers in a Voting Classifier for ensembling. \r\n\r\nTo test, I have a dataframe with set of columns that represent tool skills (a numerical value from 0 to 10 representing how much the person knows about the skill) and a &quot;Fit to Job&quot; column that is the class variable. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(columns=[&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;Scikit-learn&quot;, &quot;Pandas&quot;, &quot;Fit to Job&quot;])\r\ntotal_mock_samples= 100\r\nfor i in range(total_mock_samples):\r\n    df=df.append(mockResults(df.columns, &#39;Fit to Job&#39;, good_values=i &gt; total_mock_samples/2), ignore_index=True)\r\n\r\n#Fills dataframe with mock data\r\n#Output like:\r\nprint(np.array(df))\r\n#[[1. 3. 6. 1.]\r\n# [3. 2. 3. 0.]\r\n# [1. 4. 0. 0.]\r\n# ...\r\n# [7. 8. 8. 1.]\r\n# [8. 7. 9. 1.]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I mount my ensemble classifiers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, VotingClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\r\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nX = np.array(df[df.columns[:-1]])\r\ny = np.array(df[df.columns[-1]])\r\nrfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)\r\nsvc = SVC(kernel=&#39;linear&#39;)\r\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)\r\nnb = GaussianNB()\r\nlr = LinearRegression()\r\n\r\nensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[(&quot;Random forest&quot;, rfc), (&quot;KNN&quot;,knn), (&quot;Naive Bayes&quot;, nb), (&quot;SVC&quot;,svc), (&quot;Linear Reg.&quot;,lr)])\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, I try to evaluate it with Cross validation, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncval_score = cross_val_score(ensemble, X, y, cv=10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I&#39;m getting the following error:\r\n\r\n    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n    &lt;ipython-input-13-f7c01fa872d2&gt; in &lt;module&gt;\r\n        182 ensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[(&quot;Random forest&quot;, rfc), (&quot;KNN&quot;,knn), (&quot;Naive Bayes&quot;, nb), (&quot;SVC&quot;,svc), (&quot;Linear Reg.&quot;,lr)])\r\n        183 \r\n    --&gt; 184 cval_score = cross_val_score(ensemble, X, y, cv=10)\r\n    [...]\r\n    \r\n    TypeError: Cannot cast array data from dtype(&#39;float64&#39;) to dtype(&#39;int64&#39;) according to the rule &#39;safe&#39;\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve checked other answers, but they all refer to numpy data conversions.

Quoting [the spec](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2801997):\r\n\r\n&gt; Concatenating two YAML streams requires both to use the same character encoding. In addition, it is necessary to separate the last document of the first stream and the first document of the second stream. This is easily ensured by inserting a document end marker between the two streams. Note that this is safe regardless of the content of either stream. In particular, either or both may be empty, and the first stream may or may not already contain such a marker.\r\n\r\nThe *document end marker* is `...` (followed by a newline). Joining the contents of both files with this marker will do the trick. This works since YAML allows a document to be ended by multiple document end markers. On the other hand, the *directives end marker* (`---`) you use always starts a document, so it is not save to join the documents with it since the second document may already start with one, leading to the creation of an empty document in between.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012285/yaml-library-which-supports-writing-multiple-documents/58013778#58013778","title":"yaml library which supports writing multiple documents"}],"owner":{"reputation":558,"user_id":2122950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f41d436a8d052ea4f45a8f83bdd9c40d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Homewrecker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2122950/homewrecker"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58013778,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568904804,"creation_date":1568900069,"question_id":58012285,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58012285","body_markdown":"I have a small NodeJS app which generates two `YAML`-files.\r\nI want to merge them into one file so that I have one file with two Document nodes.

sure why you need to do it this way - I&#39;m pretty sure there are other ways to render `Link`s based on an array into your DOM. \r\n\r\nHowever if you insist, you should use `ReactDOM` \r\n\r\nIn your loop:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// create an empty div to hold our links:\r\nconst tempDiv = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n\r\n// render links into the empty div\r\nReactDOM.render(eventLinks, tempDiv);\r\n\r\n// append the link, since you don&#39;t want the div in cell\r\ncell.appendChild(tempDiv.firstChild); // there is only 1 child\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very &quot;hacky&quot; - I&#39;d highly recommend looking for a real &quot;React&quot; way of doing this.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nyour updated code won&#39;t work. `react-router` relies on an internal context to navigate, and the `*Router` components provide that context - your code renders a `BrowserRouter` for each link meaning each link will has its own context. Multiple routers probably won&#39;t work well in one page as they will fight control over the browser.\r\n\r\nFirst of all you probably shouldn&#39;t call `ReactDOM.render` in each iteration of your loop. `ReactDOM.render` takes control of all the content inside your `cell` - rendering it again and again meaning only the last call works. \r\n\r\nSecondly, your `BrowserRouter` should be placed at the top level of your App (e.g. in your root component).\r\n\r\nAgain, manipulating dom like that is not how you should use React. I&#39;m curious what kind of app you are building and how it is structured? \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s what I think you should do - since you are already using react, I imagine there is a component tree (e.g. you have a top level component that renders other components, etc.)\r\n\r\nSo at the very top of your app, you should wrap everything in the BrowserRouter.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// index.js, maybe.\r\n\r\n// assuming App is your &quot;top level component&quot;\r\nimport App from &#39;./App.jsx&#39;;\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;\r\n    &lt;App /&gt;\r\n  &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;\r\n, document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, now, create a `EventLinks` component that renders all the links:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// EventLinks.jsx\r\n\r\nconst EventLinks = ({ events }) =&gt; (\r\n  events.map((event) =&gt; (\r\n    &lt;li key={event.eventId}&gt;\r\n      &lt;Link to={`/events/${event.eventId}`}&gt;\r\n        {event.title}\r\n      &lt;/Link&gt;\r\n    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n  ))\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your component where `cell` lives, render the links directly. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// Cell component\r\n\r\nconst Cell = ({ events }) =&gt; {\r\n  // filter events if you need to here, since you have that `if` logic originally\r\n\r\n  const visibleEvents = events.filter(filterFunction);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;ul&gt;\r\n      &lt;EventLinks events={visibleEvents} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is probably not exactly match your app&#39;s structure but I hope you get the idea.\r\n\r\nso your `App` renders a layout and `Cell` component, and then your `Cell` renders `EventLinks`.\r\n\r\nHonestly you shouldn&#39;t be using ReactDOM at all except for the only entry point of your app.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012284/react-appendchild-a-react-link-tag-to-existing-li-appends-object-object/58013228#58013228","title":"React - appendChild() a React Link tag to existing li appends [object, object]"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":10702010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-v8kPunfEirk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWw/AYFz3Nt7H40/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ryan Carville","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10702010/ryan-carville"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23,"user_id":10702010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-v8kPunfEirk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWw/AYFz3Nt7H40/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ryan Carville","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10702010/ryan-carville"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58013228,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568988701,"creation_date":1568900052,"last_edit_date":1568917728,"question_id":58012284,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58012284","body_markdown":"Have a loop that qualifies if an objects date key/value matches a date on a calendar.
