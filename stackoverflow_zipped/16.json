I&#39;ve added in AWX under `Inventory script` a new script:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\ncurl -s GET &quot;https://myserver/inventory&quot; -H  &quot;accept: application/json&quot; --user $INVENTORY_CREDENTIALS &amp;&gt; /dev/stdout\r\n\r\n#eof\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis script works well, when I use it locally with `ansible-playbook -i inventory.sh ...`, the variable is really replaced - I can see the request on the server. The result is a JSON inventory (data is coming from a DB in the backend). It is well-formed (generated)\r\n\r\nWhen I add the custom script as Inventory and run a sync job, the job is &quot;succesful&quot; - but the inventory is empty. When I have a look into the log of the job - it shows the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    1.779 INFO     Updating inventory 3: test\r\n    2.072 INFO     Reading Ansible inventory source: /tmp/awx_1302_0cicirws/tmpsgddb_k3\r\n    2.074 INFO     Using VIRTUAL_ENV: /var/lib/awx/venv/ansible\r\n    2.074 INFO     Using PATH: /var/lib/awx/venv/ansible/bin:/var/lib/awx/venv/awx/bin:/opt/rh/rh-postgresql10/root/usr/bin:/var/lib/awx/venv/awx/bin:/var/lib/awx/venv/awx/bin:/opt/rh/rh-postgresql10/root/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\r\n    2.074 INFO     Using PYTHONPATH: /var/lib/awx/venv/ansible/lib/python2.7/site-packages:\r\n    2.807 ERROR    ansible-inventory 2.8.6\r\n    2.808 ERROR      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg\r\n    2.808 ERROR      configured module search path = [u&#39;/var/lib/awx/.ansible/plugins/modules&#39;, u&#39;/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules&#39;]\r\n    2.808 ERROR      ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible\r\n    2.808 ERROR      executable location = /usr/bin/ansible-inventory\r\n    2.808 ERROR      python version = 2.7.5 (default, Aug  7 2019, 00:51:29) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39)]\r\n    2.808 ERROR    Using /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as config file\r\n    2.808 ERROR    host_list declined parsing /tmp/awx_1302_0cicirws/tmpsgddb_k3 as it did not pass it&#39;s verify_file() method\r\n    2.808 ERROR    auto declined parsing /tmp/awx_1302_0cicirws/tmpsgddb_k3 as it did not pass it&#39;s verify_file() method\r\n    2.808 ERROR    [WARNING]: Skipping &#39;curl -s GET &quot;https://myserver/inventory&quot; -H\r\n    2.808 ERROR    &quot;accept&#39; as this is not a valid group definition\r\n    2.808 ERROR    \r\n    2.808 ERROR    Parsed /tmp/awx_1302_0cicirws/tmpsgddb_k3 inventory source with yaml plugin\r\n    2.808 INFO     Processing JSON output...\r\n    2.809 INFO     Loaded 0 groups, 0 hosts\r\n2019-10-23 17:29:24,999 DEBUG    awx.main.models.inventory Going to update inventory computed fields, pk=3\r\n2019-10-23 17:29:25,038 DEBUG    awx.main.models.inventory Finished updating inventory computed fields, pk=3, in 0.035 seconds\r\n    2.897 INFO     Inventory import completed for test in 1.1s\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know, that the AWX output is a little bit strange, because it detects some output in the curl line and marks that as an error. It calls the URL and the result has the same size and is 200 OK. But I don&#39;t understand, where is the bug. Is there a different way to parse the JSON output to get the info from the JSON response, but I don&#39;t know another tool to verify a inventory-file (error seams to be not syntax but semantic).\r\n\r\nAlso funny - when I remove the accept-header from curl AWX fails during sync. I tries to load YAML. But the backend always returns &quot;Content-type: application/json&quot;. That is strange to me.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure, where is the problem - and I&#39;m still not sure if it is the JSON output or the script itself. Locally it works, for example `ansible-inventory -i inventory.sh --graph` shows everything from the remote inventory JSON.

As the image and text are together, you can put them inside one div so that will become 1 item and all the 4 items can be wrapped inside one parent container. Now there are multiple ways to achieve this. *I&#39;ve created 2 examples for you on CodePen.*\r\nOne way is to let the items flow inside a Flex container (parent) and give the parent a width or max-width, then items will come one after the other.\r\nAnother way is to have two child items inside the parent Flex which you can imagine as columns, and your content goes inside of those two columns.\r\nBe careful with giving fixed widths, especially if you want to make it responsive.\r\n\r\n**example 1** : https://codepen.io/gzaman/pen/ExxWGgy?editors=1100\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      background: pink;\r\n      max-width: 460px;\r\n      flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n      justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .flexitem {\r\n      margin: 4px;\r\n      padding: 8px;\r\n      background: salmon;\r\n      width: 200px;\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      align-items: center;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .thumbnailSmallImage {\r\n      height: 20px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;flexitem&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;thumbnailLeftSmallIconTop&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;img class=&quot;thumbnailSmallImage&quot;

the error is `%` operator cannot be used with float values, it can only be used with integer(`int`) data types.\r\n\r\nYou need to typecast `float` to an `int`, one method is by using `static_cast&lt;int&gt;(yourFloatNumber)` so that your calculation code line looks like this:\r\n\r\n    computerNumber = rand( ) % (static_cast&lt;int&gt;(rangeLow) - static_cast&lt;int&gt;(rangeHigh + 1)) + 10;\r\n\r\n&gt; The modulus operator (%) has a stricter requirement in that its\r\n&gt; operands must be of integral type.\r\n\r\nAnother solution enlightened by @NathanOliver in the comments: If you are ok with using `int` instead of `float` for `rangeLow` and `rangeHigh` all across your code then typecasting wouldn&#39;t be required at all.\r\n\r\n[Reference][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

is the modulus operator for integer values. Your range endpoints are floating point variables. In your exercise, you should make the endpoints, `computerNumber` and `guess` into `int` variables.\r\n\r\n```\r\nint rangeLow, rangeHigh, computerNumber, guess;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen take a look at the computer&#39;s number generator and insert some values to try it out:\r\n```\r\ncomputerNumber = rand() % (rangeLow - rangeHigh + 1) + 10;\r\n                 rand() % (   5     -    20     + 1) + 10;\r\n                 rand() %          -14               + 10;\r\n```\r\nSo, you&#39;ll have `rand() % -14 + 10`. That doesn&#39;t look correct. Reverse the range endpoints:\r\n```\r\ncomputerNumber = rand() % (rangeHigh - rangeLow + 1) + 10;\r\n                 rand() % (   20     -    5     + 1) + 10;\r\n                 rand() %            16              + 10;\r\n```\r\nThis, `rand() % 16 + 10`, is better, but will obviously create a number in the range `[10, 10+16)`, or to put it differently (as a closed interval), `[10, 25]`. If you replace `+10` with `+rangeLow` like this:\r\n```\r\ncomputerNumber = rand() % (rangeHigh - rangeLow + 1) + rangeLow;\r\n```\r\nYou now get the range like this:\r\n```\r\n[rangeLow, rangeLow + rangeHigh - rangeLow + 1)                             =&gt;\r\n[rangeLow, rangeHigh + 1)                          (left-closed interval)   =&gt;\r\n[rangeLow, rangeHigh]                              (closed interval)\r\n```\r\nWhich means `[5, 20]` with the example values I used.\r\n\r\nNow, take a look at &lt;[random](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/random)&gt;.\r\nThat part of the standard library contains classes and functions to make all this much simpler:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528782/c-using-variables-in-equations-error-expression-must-have-integral-or-unscop/58529386#58529386","title":"C++ Using variables in equations; error: expression must have integral or unscoped enum type &amp; others"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12264833,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBVezEYL4AyRRsg-KpWLb5_ZfQdpncGcxeXVp8p7A=k-s128","display_name":"Gut wrenched","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12264833/gut-wrenched"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571858911,"creation_date":1571854387,"question_id":58528782,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528782","body_markdown":"    srand( 0 );\r\n\tint points; // number of points\r\n\tfloat computerNumber; // number generated by the computer\r\n\tfloat guess; // user&#39;s guess\r\n\tchar quit; // What the user enters when they want to quit\r\n\tint totalPoints; //the total score of all of the games played\r\n\tint avgPoints; // the average score of all games played\r\n\tint gamesPlayed; // how many games have been played\r\n\tfloat rangeLow; // the lower end of the range\r\n\tfloat rangeHigh; // the higher end of the range\r\n\tpoints = 5;\r\n\tquit = &#39;n&#39;;\r\n\tgamesPlayed = 0;\r\n\ttotalPoints = 0;\r\n\twhile ( quit != &#39;q&#39; )\r\n\t{\r\n\r\n\t\tgamesPlayed++;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Welcome to Guessing Game! \\n&quot;;\r\n\t\tpoints = 5;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;What would you like your range to be? \\n&quot;;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Low number: \\n&quot;;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; rangeLow;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;High number: \\n&quot;;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; rangeHigh;\r\n\t\tif ( rangeLow &gt; rangeHigh )\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Please use a high number that is greater than the low number. \\n&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Low number: \\n&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tcin &gt;&gt; rangeLow;\r\n\t\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;High number: \\n&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tcin &gt;&gt; rangeHigh;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tcomputerNumber = rand( ) % (rangeLow - rangeHigh + 1) + 10;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Computer Number: &quot; &lt;&lt; computerNumber &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Points:&quot; &lt;&lt; points &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;what is your guess? \\n&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; guess;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Your guess is: &quot; &lt;&lt; guess &lt;&lt; endl;\r\nWhen I input this code (among other error-free lines of code that don&#39;t affect these lines), it won&#39;t compile and outputs two error messages- &quot;expression must have integral or unscoped enum type&quot; and &quot;&#39;%&#39; is illegal, right operand has type &#39;float&#39;&quot;\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that it has something to do with using variables in my equation, but that shouldn&#39;t be a problem?

I would like to have at the very least a legend which shows a circle size which indicates that the function is 1 so that there is some scale to judge the size of the circles. \r\n\r\nmarker = &#39;o&#39; means circles to represent data points and the size of the circle indicates the size of the function at each point.\r\n\r\n    ax.plot(x,y\r\n            ,ls=&#39;none&#39;\r\n            ,marker=&#39;o&#39;\r\n            ,color=&#39;r&#39;\r\n            ,markersize=function value at specific point, alpha=0.1)\r\n    \r\n    ax.legend(&#39;A&#39;,loc=&#39;lower right&#39;) \r\n\r\n# I need the legend to show a circle for which the function is = 1 or at a maximum.\r\n\r\nno error messages, makes plot fine, just need size of circle in legend to represent value of the function and since the function ranges between 0 and 1 the functions maximum = 1, if that helps. Please Help!

I installed pm2 to start the app and keep it alive. It&#39;s listening on port 4000. It shows no errors in the logs, but I&#39;m getting a 403 when I go to the website.\r\n\r\nI think something in the .htaccess file is incorrect or something needs to be configured in the httpd.conf file. I&#39;m confused as to what exactly needs to be in those files, because several links/articles I&#39;ve read show different configurations. Some say you only need the .htaccess file. Other say you also need to configure a virtual host in the httpd.conf file (which I can&#39;t reach, because I don&#39;t have root privileges on the server).\r\n\r\nThis is how the folder structure looks like:\r\n```txt\r\ndomains\r\n    - appname.com\r\n        - public_html\r\n            - .htaccess\r\n            - browser\r\n                - index.html\r\n                - other files...\r\n            - server\r\n            - server.js\r\n            - package.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is my current .htaccess file, which should work for https and redirects to browser/index.html:\r\n``` txt\r\nRewriteEngine On  \r\n\r\n# If an existing asset or directory is requested go to it as it is\r\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]\r\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d\r\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\r\n\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\r\nRewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/browser/index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried [this configuration](https://blog.daudr.me/painless-angular-ssr/) which places a virtual host inside the .htaccess file, but that doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\n**To summarize my question:**\r\nWhat exactly needs to be in the .htaccess file for Angular app to work?\r\nIs the virtual host tag supposed to by in the .htaccess as well or does that only work from the httpd.conf file?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528763/what-should-be-in-htaccess-for-angular-universal-app-on-apache-web-host-server","title":"What should be in .htaccess for Angular Universal app on Apache web host server?"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","minitest","fixtures"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5848410,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1263733e32f04be85bcce32a4e79af94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CaptainAwesomeDi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5848410/captainawesomedi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571864858,"creation_date":1571864858,"answer_id":58530999,"question_id":58528761,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58530999","body_markdown":"I just realized how bad this is.\r\n\r\nI could just not use the fixture to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire &quot;test_helper&quot;\r\nUserMessageTest &lt; AcitveSupport::TestCase\r\n  def setup\r\n   @user_message = UserMessage.new(user_id: User.first.id,\r\n                                   message_id: Message.first.id)\r\n\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  test &quot;could save successfully&quot; do\r\n   assert @user_message.save\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the test passes!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528761/rails-minitest-has-many-and-belongs-to-model-test-activerecordunknownprimaryke/58530999#58530999","title":"Rails Minitest Has Many And Belongs To Model Test ActiveRecord::UnknownPrimaryKey Error"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5848410,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1263733e32f04be85bcce32a4e79af94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CaptainAwesomeDi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5848410/captainawesomedi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":139859,"user_id":128421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71770d043c0f7e3c7bc5f74190015c26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"the Tin Man","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/128421/the-tin-man"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571867056,"creation_date":1571854301,"last_edit_date":1571867056,"question_id":58528761,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528761","body_markdown":"When I try to run minitest with simpleCov, I want the join table model `UserMessages` to be covered.\r\n\r\nI have setup fixture, to run test and keep getting an `ActiveRecord::UnknownPrimaryKey` error.

I wrote a program with the help of this community, which has been very informative, every time that I hit a roadblock in my code. Thank you, graciously. \r\n\r\nSituation: \r\n\r\nI create a program that interacts with IE. It&#39;s an automation process that handles data based on the functionality of the site. In the automation process, when I click on a link, it opens a pop-up window. Here is where the problems being. Sometimes, the pop-window takes anywhere between 5 seconds to 30 seconds to load. However, I am unable to determine the length of time that it takes for the pop-window to load, nor does the program, which crashes every time it reaches outside the scope of the waiting period I set it for in the program. \r\n\r\nEverything else works perfectly, except for this small little delete that is the ultimate death of my program and sends it spiraling downhill. \r\n\r\nThe pop-window has to load first before I am able to assign the popWindow (IE) object. \r\n\r\n```\r\n Dim popWindow As InternetExplorer \r\n Set popWindow = oGetIEWindowFromTitle(&quot;Site Name&quot;)\r\n Set deviceWindow = popWindow.Document\r\n```\r\n```\r\nFunction oGetIEWindowFromTitle(sTitle As String, _\r\n                               Optional bCaseSensitive As Boolean = False, _\r\n                               Optional bExact As Boolean = False) As Shdocvw.InternetExplorer\r\n\r\n    Dim objShellWindows As New Shdocvw.ShellWindows\r\n    Dim found As Boolean\r\n    Dim startTime As Single\r\n\r\n    found = False\r\n    &#39;Loop through shell windows\r\n    For Each oGetIEWindowFromTitle In objShellWindows\r\n        found = oGetIEWindowFromTitleHandler(oGetIEWindowFromTitle, sTitle, bCaseSensitive, bExact)\r\n        If found Then Exit For\r\n    Next\r\n\r\n    &#39;Check whether a window was found\r\n    If Not found Then\r\n        Set oGetIEWindowFromTitle = Nothing\r\n    Else\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Do While oGetIEWindowFromTitle.Busy &#39;----- this is what I have tried\r\n        Application.Wait (Now + TimeValue(&quot;00:00:01&quot;))\r\n        Loop\r\n\r\n\r\n        Do While oGetIEWindowFromTitle.Busy = True Or oGetIEWindowFromTitle.ReadyState &lt;&gt; 4: DoEvents: Loop &#39;------ this is what I have tried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    End If\r\n\r\nEnd Function\r\n```\r\n```\r\nPrivate Function oGetIEWindowFromTitleHandler(win As Shdocvw.InternetExplorer, _\r\n                                      sTitle As String, _\r\n                                      bCaseSensitive As Boolean, _\r\n                                      bExact As Boolean) As Boolean\r\n\r\n    oGetIEWindowFromTitleHandler = False\r\n\r\n    On Error GoTo handler\r\n    &#39;If the document is of type HTMLDocument, it is an IE window\r\n    If TypeName(win.Document) = &quot;HTMLDocument&quot; Then\r\n        &#39;Check whether the title contains the passed title\r\n        If bExact Then\r\n            If (win.Document.Title = sTitle) Or ((Not bCaseSensitive) And (LCase(sTitle) = LCase(win.Document.Title))) Then oGetIEWindowFromTitleHandler = True\r\n        Else\r\n            If InStr(1, win.Document.Title, sTitle) Or ((Not bCaseSensitive) And (InStr(1, LCase(win.Document.Title), LCase(sTitle), vbTextCompare) &lt;&gt; 0)) Then oGetIEWindowFromTitleHandler = True\r\n        End If\r\n    End If\r\nhandler:\r\n    &#39;We assume here that if an error is raised it&#39;s because\r\n    &#39;the window is not of the correct type.

Positively identifying the DATE fields is difficult just because of scale.\r\n\r\n**Post-processing**:  \r\nCreate the table with the date fields as VARCHAR and use the STR_TO_DATE SQL function populate the date columns.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO mytable(DATELastDetected, DATEFirstDetected) \r\n  SELECT STR_TO_DATE(LastDetected, &#39;%c/%e/%Y %H:%i&#39;), \r\n  STR_TO_DATE(FirstDetected, &#39;%c/%e/%Y %H:%i&#39;) \r\nfrom mytable;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Third Option?**  \r\nI&#39;ve wondered whether I might specify the expected format of the input data for that DATE columns in the CREATE TABLE statement, which would render the whole discussion moot.  I&#39;ve seen [another question][1] that mentions the use of DATEFORMAT in a CREATE TABLE statement, but I have not found the right syntax to use.  \r\n\r\nAppreciate any thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29184398/mysql-date-format-in-create-table","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528722/reformat-input-date-data","title":"Reformat input DATE data"},{"tags":["acumatica"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5187,"user_id":7376238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w8IBj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HB_ACUMATICA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7376238/hb-acumatica"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571856488,"creation_date":1571856488,"answer_id":58529303,"question_id":58528721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58529303","body_markdown":"I could not reproduce that behavior in Acumatica version 19.106.0020 so I manually tweaked the CSS in order to reproduce that glitch. \r\n\r\nSetting &#39;display: block&#39; CSS property on GridPagerLink CSS class reproduces the same rendering.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIn file &#39;\\App_Themes\\Default\\00_Controls.css&#39; it is set as &#39;display: inline-block;&#39;.\r\nInline option will make them stack horizontally so I don&#39;t have this glitch on my side.\r\n\r\nWhich exact Acumatica version are you running? \r\n\r\nUse browser HTML inspect element feature to inspect the GridPagerLink. \r\n\r\nDoes it look like the default style below?\r\n\r\n    .GridPagerLink {\r\n      display: inline-block;\r\n      color: RGBA(0, 0, 0, 0.87);\r\n      text-decoration: none;\r\n      font-size: 15px;\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n      padding: 5px 10px;\r\n      height: 18px;\r\n      border: solid 1px transparent;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cPxbR.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528721/pagersetting-at-the-bottom-of-a-grid-does-not-display-correct/58529303#58529303","title":"PagerSetting at the bottom of a grid does not display correct"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":594017,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06fffa04178f221ab87a35e109c13ac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kurt Bauer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/594017/kurt-bauer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571856488,"creation_date":1571854155,"question_id":58528721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528721","body_markdown":"Is there a way to fix the vertical layout of the PagerSettings when displayed at the bottom of a grid?\r\n\r\nI am trying to add numbers to the bottom of a grid using the PagerSettings tag described in the post https://stackoverflow.com/q/37886240/594017.

am currently using an extension called [StyleBot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en) to help automate tasks based on coloring elements on webpages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how the StyleBot extension injects css, it adds a style between the `&lt;head&gt;` code and the `&lt;body&gt;` code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; id=&quot;stylebot-global-css&quot;&gt;.test {font: black !important;}&lt;/style&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\nImage here: https://i.imgur.com/pC5ouLw.png\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I have found that Google, and other websites such as Twitter have developed ways to change all the IDs and classes of their elements on reload so such activities are rendered impossible or near impossible, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;zQJV3&quot; jsname=&quot;DH6Rkf&quot; jscontroller=&quot;QEg9te&quot; jsaction=&quot;rcuQ6b:rcuQ6b;JIbuQc:vjx2Ld(Njthtb),ChoyC(eBSUOb),mzsPGd(bCkDte),VaKChb(gVmDzc),nCZam(W3Rzrc),Tzaumc(uRHG6),RSKJgd(z5mH8d),JGhSzd;LEpEAf:dE26Sc(lqvTlf);h4C2te:JGhSzd;&quot; data-primary-action-label=&quot;Next&quot; data-secondary-action-label=&quot;&quot; jsshadow=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nThis makes it impossible to custom-style an element based on a class name or ID name.\r\n\r\nImage here: https://i.imgur.com/uoh62Fs.png\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that said, I would like to know if it&#39;s possible for a website to detect my use of StyleBot (not the extension in itself being active) but the actual injection of CSS into the page. If yes, what is the level of complexity of the task? I am aware of websites detecting client-side automation scripts such as JS but what about a `&lt;style&gt;` injected in the HTML of the page?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528707/detect-extensions-that-inject-css","title":"Detect extensions that inject CSS"},{"tags":["express","session","cookies","storage"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":752,"user_id":4541434,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQSU4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tania Rascia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4541434/tania-rascia"},"last_editor":{"reputation":752,"user_id":4541434,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQSU4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tania Rascia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4541434/tania-rascia"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571856333,"last_edit_date":1571856333,"creation_date":1571854954,"answer_id":58528913,"question_id":58528706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58528913","body_markdown":"I had to use cookieParser.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst cookieParser = require(&#39;cookie-parser&#39;)\r\n\r\napp.use(cookieParser())\r\n\r\n// set a cookie\r\nresponse.cookie(&#39;nameOfCookie&#39;, &#39;cookieValue&#39;, {\r\n  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour\r\n  httpOnly: true,\r\n  secure: isProduction,\r\n})\r\n\r\n// get a cookie\r\nrequest.cookies.nameOfCookie\r\n\r\n// destroy cookie\r\nresponse.clearCookie(&#39;nameOfCookie&#39;)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528706/how-to-save-persistent-data-in-express/58528913#58528913","title":"How to save persistent data in Express?"}],"owner":{"reputation":752,"user_id":4541434,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQSU4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tania Rascia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4541434/tania-rascia"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571856333,"creation_date":1571854095,"question_id":58528706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528706","body_markdown":"I have a simple requirement to store an access token/refresh token in Express (without using `localStorage` or anything).

And if we have a `Parser` built to return `[(a, String)]`, this applies `f` to each of the `result`s returned in the list. \r\n\r\nWe can instance `Applicative`, `Monad`, `MonadPlus`, and `Alternative` is similarly generic ways (so that they work either for `Maybe` or `[]`). \r\n\r\n**Question.** If I parameterize `Parser` based on the type used to wrap the result, how can I instance it for `Functor` and friends?\r\n\r\n```\r\nnewtype Parser m a = Parser (String -&gt; m (a, String))\r\n\r\n-- How do I instance `Parser` as a Functor if `m` is a Functor?\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528701/how-can-i-instance-functor-for-a-type-with-two-parameters","title":"How can I instance `Functor` for a type with two parameters?"},{"tags":["apache","apache-spark","apache-spark-sql","kafka-consumer-api","spark-structured-streaming"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":172,"user_id":5606318,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59c68181122d164a4f5fa7fc1e6cd948?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SanBan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5606318/sanban"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571855936,"post_id":58528698,"comment_id":103382268,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528698/parsing-nested-json-in-apache-spark-which-contains-struct-array-struct-and-a#comment103382268_58528698"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9322610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65a1526282b3409cd86c87c1db5e03bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yaswanth Kumar Alla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9322610/yaswanth-kumar-alla"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":172,"user_id":5606318,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59c68181122d164a4f5fa7fc1e6cd948?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SanBan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5606318/sanban"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571856497,"post_id":58528698,"comment_id":103382497,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528698/parsing-nested-json-in-apache-spark-which-contains-struct-array-struct-and-a#comment103382497_58528698"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9322610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65a1526282b3409cd86c87c1db5e03bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yaswanth Kumar Alla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9322610/yaswanth-kumar-alla"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9322610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65a1526282b3409cd86c87c1db5e03bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yaswanth Kumar Alla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9322610/yaswanth-kumar-alla"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571856457,"creation_date":1571854063,"last_edit_date":1571856457,"question_id":58528698,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528698","body_markdown":" My JSON schema contains datatypes with Struct, Array, Struct, and Array.\r\nWhen I explode this JSON message itself creating multiple rows for a column-product which contains features(Array type) in this we have family(struct) &amp;

is one attempt. It is slightly more complicated due to the `(` and `)` that surround your numbers. \r\n\r\nFirst, use [textscan](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/textscan.html) to read the file. Since I guess you don&#39;t know how many numers are in the file, read everything into a singe string. Will work with mutiple lines, too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilename = &#39;data.csv&#39;;\r\nfid = fopen(filename);\r\ncontent = textscan(fid, &#39;%s&#39;);\r\nfclose(fid);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, `content` now is a slightly weird `cell` array (look at the `textscan`-docs for details). Just initialize the variable `nums` which will store the numbers and loop through `content` (if you know a bit more about your csv file, you might pre-allocate `nums`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nnums = []; \r\nfor c1 = 1:numel(content{1})\r\n```\r\nNext, split the string at every occurence of `,`:\r\n```\r\n    string_list = strsplit(content{1}{c1},&#39;,&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives another cell array. Loop through it to convert the strings to numbers (and end the outer loop):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    for c2 = 1 : numel(string_list)\r\n        nums(end+1) = str2num(string_list{c2});\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nLast, just store the real and the imaginary part of the numbers in separate columns:\r\n\r\n```\r\nout = [];\r\nout(:,1) = real(nums);\r\nout(:,2) = imag(nums);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand save it to `data.out`:\r\n```\r\ncsvwrite(&#39;data.out&#39;, out);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that one could have done this without cenverting the strings to numbers, but the way above would allow you to use the data in Matlab instead of just saving it.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528662/convert-csv-to-out-complex-numbers/58529699#58529699","title":"Convert .csv to .out (complex numbers)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11391735,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be074e56b6852c280e8bace96fc7f888?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sara.m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11391735/sara-m"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":3750257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KF8gx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pppery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3750257/pppery"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571858841,"creation_date":1571853919,"last_edit_date":1571858841,"question_id":58528662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528662","body_markdown":"I have a csv file that has complex numbers.\r\n\r\nThis is sample of some numbers I have in the csv file:\r\n````\r\n(0.12825663763789857+0.20327998150393212j),(0.21890748607218197+0.160563964013564j),(0.28205414129281525+0.09884068776334366j),(0.030927026479380615+0.26334550583848626j)\r\n````\r\nI want to read this file and then save in (.out) file all the real parts in the first column and all the imaginary parts in the second column (without the imaginary letter j).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528662/convert-csv-to-out-complex-numbers","title":"Convert .csv to .out (complex numbers)"},{"tags":["ios","objective-c","swift","metal","metalkit"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4550,"user_id":1032372,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDjul.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1032372/shim"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571854457,"post_id":58528661,"comment_id":103381646,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528661/what-the-difference-between-metal-2-and-metal-1#comment103381646_58528661"}],"owner":{"reputation":3228,"user_id":1114043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EwPfY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"loki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1114043/loki"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571860888,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571853917,"creation_date":1571853917,"question_id":58528661,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528661","body_markdown":"What is the difference between metal 2 and metal 1?

I am have the same error either way.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith open(&#39;/sarcasm.json&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\r\n    datastore = json.load(f)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither way I am having the same error &#39;&#39;&#39;FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:&#39;&#39;&#39;. I have read other similar questions and have followed the mentioned procedures where tthey have suggested to use relative path and I still have the error.

I set 10 and get proper results:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;math.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    const int TERMS = 10;\r\n    const double PI =  3.14159265358979;\r\n    \r\n    long long fact(int n) {\r\n        return n&lt;= 0 ? 1 : n * fact(n-1);\r\n    }\r\n    double powd(double x,int n) {\r\n        return n&lt;= 0 ? 1 : x * powd(x,n-1);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    double sine(int x) {\r\n        double rad = x * (PI / 180);\r\n        double sin = 0;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        int n;\r\n        int sign = 1;\r\n        for(n = 0; n &lt; TERMS; n++) { // That&#39;s Taylor series!!\r\n            sin += sign  * powd(rad, (2 * n) + 1)/ fact((2 * n) + 1);\r\n            sign = -sign;\r\n        }\r\n        return sin;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    double cosine(int x) {\r\n        double rad = x * (PI / 180);\r\n        double cos = 0;\r\n    \r\n        int n;\r\n        int sign = 1;\r\n        for(n = 0; n &lt; TERMS; n++) { // That&#39;s also Taylor series!\r\n             cos += sign * powd(rad, 2 * n) / fact(2 * n);\r\n             sign = -sign;\r\n        }\r\n        return cos;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    int main(void){\r\n       int y;\r\n       scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;y);\r\n       printf(&quot;sine(%d)= %lf\\n&quot;,y, sine(y));\r\n       printf(&quot;cosine(%d)= %lf\\n&quot;,y, cosine(y));\r\n    \r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n    240\r\n    sine(240)= -0.866026\r\n    cosine(240)= -0.500001\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- my recusive implementation of `pow` using successive multiplications is probably not needed, since we&#39;re dealing with floating point. It introduces accumulation error if n is big.\r\n- `fact` could be using floating point to allow bigger numbers and better precision. Actually I suggested `long long` but it would be better not to assume that the size will be enough. Better use standard type like `int64_t` for that.\r\n- `fact` and `pow` results could be pre-computed/hardcoded as well. This would save computation time.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528609/taylor-series-in-c-problem-with-sin240-and-sin300/58528854#58528854","title":"Taylor Series in C (problem with sin(240) and sin(300))"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":82538,"user_id":2509,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9100fb18460057e68cadc6132add0f7f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dmckee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2509/dmckee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571868272,"post_id":58530467,"comment_id":103386881,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528609/taylor-series-in-c-problem-with-sin240-and-sin300/58530467#comment103386881_58530467"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":41791,"user_id":1250772,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/633e1f643d2c9b043231b4a32b078907?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1250772/kaz"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571862068,"creation_date":1571862068,"answer_id":58530467,"question_id":58528609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58530467","body_markdown":"You should calculate the functions in the first quadrant only [0, pi/2).
