These functions have some common code, but not published modules. I assumed I could turn this common stuff into a versioned layer.  With a directory to the effect as follows:\r\n\r\n- Project\r\n    - LambdaFunc1\r\n         - package.json\r\n         - node_modules\r\n         - func1.js\r\n    - LambdaFunc2\r\n         - package.json\r\n         - node_modules\r\n         - func2.js\r\n    - common-stuff\r\n         - package.json\r\n         - my-common.js\r\n    - template.yaml\r\n    - node_modules\r\n\r\nAfter testing, I copy common-stuff into the Projects/node_modules directory and my other LambdaFuncs resolve require(&#39;common-stuff&#39;) based on Node moving up the directory structure for not found modules.\r\n\r\nTo have SAM do the build/package/deploy, I noticed SAM doesn&#39;t touch the common-stuff however creates an .aws-sam/build structure with the two other Lambda functions.  I had to create a structure for SAM&#39;s CodeURI to zip up.\r\n\r\nPackage/common-stuff/packaged/nodejs/node_modules/common-stuff/ with my package.json and my-common.js.\r\nMy package.json uses name: &quot;common-stuff&quot;, main: &quot;my-common.js&quot;\r\n\r\nThere are no other files - nothing under nodejs as I&#39;m only packaging the modules. This appears to me the reason for Layers.  I have verified SAM packages a zip file containing nodejs/node_modules/common-stuff/... by downloading the Layer zip file.\r\n\r\nIn the Lambda function template def, I add the permission to allow &#39;lambda:GetLayerVersion&#39;.  When I view the Lambda function in the console, I see this permission along with the others.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, aws lambda get-layer-version-policy --layer-name MyLayer --version-number 8 --output text\r\nreturns an error that there are no policies attached.  My guess is that is because I&#39;ve directly added it to the function, as I see it on the Lambda function with the correct Allow/GetLayerVersion.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to satisfy what I&#39;ve read, however Node doesn&#39;t find the module.  CloudWatch logs just say it can&#39;t find the module, nothing about permissions or syntax.  Also, these functions worked until I added the Layer approach.\r\n\r\n&#39;sam local start-api&#39; doesn&#39;t work either, same error.  When I look in the Windows 10 default layer cache directory C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\AWS SAM\\ there is an empty layers-pkg directory.\r\n\r\nIs there some other magic I&#39;m missing?  Is there a better approach for sharing common code across Node Lambda functions?  \r\n\r\nI can&#39;t tell if AWS can&#39;t get the Layer, or the zip structure is wrong, or the require(&#39;common-stuff&#39;) is different (hope not).\r\n\r\nScott","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314786/sam-lambda-layer-module-not-found-for-shared-nodejs-code","title":"SAM Lambda Layer module not found for shared nodejs code"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css","drop-down-menu"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":551,"user_id":11700321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/REacU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EGC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11700321/egc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570676555,"post_id":58314785,"comment_id":102990221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314785/drop-down-menu-automatically-closing-after-first-click-on-atom-html-preview-only#comment102990221_58314785"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13467,"user_id":4665,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f83c3e22eab30856c803b1d96e1a04f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jon P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4665/jon-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570676856,"post_id":58314854,"comment_id":102990275,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314785/drop-down-menu-automatically-closing-after-first-click-on-atom-html-preview-only/58314854#comment102990275_58314854"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11930305,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156167002912251/picture?type=large","display_name":"Normajean","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11930305/normajean"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13467,"user_id":4665,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f83c3e22eab30856c803b1d96e1a04f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jon P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4665/jon-p"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570676754,"last_edit_date":1570676754,"creation_date":1570676527,"answer_id":58314854,"question_id":58314785,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314854","body_markdown":"I was going to post my question earlier and ended up figuring it out in the interim.

These tags act as a link. The &quot;#&quot; specifies an element on the page to which to scroll. So if you have these tags around the main menu item that needs to make the drop down menu appear, the browser MIGHT try to read the link and scroll to that particular position on the page. I believe this is why the menu disappears on the first go through. I don&#39;t know why the issue would only happen the first time through though. But nonetheless, removing those tags solved the problem for me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314785/drop-down-menu-automatically-closing-after-first-click-on-atom-html-preview-only/58314854#58314854","title":"Drop down menu automatically closing after first click ON ATOM HTML PREVIEW ONLY (NOT BROWSERS)"}],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11930305,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156167002912251/picture?type=large","display_name":"Normajean","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11930305/normajean"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570676754,"creation_date":1570675998,"question_id":58314785,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58314785","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using Atom and have enabled the html preview feature. This problem is isolated to the html preview within Atom and is not happening at all in Chrome or IE.\r\n\r\nI have a horizontal main menu in the header.

have multithreaded process out of which two threads (T1, T2) uses real time signal (SIGRTMIN) to schedule a specific set of tasks for other threads say every 20 msec. Only T1 scheduls the task, T2 does not perform anything except to go back in the loop. In top, the process&#39;s PR value is rt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     //T1\r\n    int result  = sigwait(sigset_test, &amp;sig)\r\n    if (result == 0)\r\n    {\r\n          Log(LOG_DEBUG, string(&quot;Updating other thread&quot;));\r\n          //enqueues tasks to other threads\r\n          PostUpdateToOtherThreads();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n     //T2\r\n     while(1)\r\n     {\r\n         int sig;\r\n         int result = sigwait(signal_set, &amp;sig)\r\n         if (shutdown)\r\n             break;\r\n     }\r\n\r\nthe Log() function implementation is somewhat like:\r\n   \r\n    void Log(int loglevel, string s)\r\n    {\r\n         boost::shared_lock&lt;boost::shared_mutex&gt; Lock(Lock_);\r\n         //log stuff to stream or file based log level\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOther threads call the Log function to log. There is another thread say T4 that updates the log level using unique_lock. Only this thread is allowed to update the log levels,\r\n\r\n    void UpdateLogLevel(int newLevel)\r\n    {\r\n     //exclusive access to shared mutex. other threads calling the \r\n     //Log function would block until this is complete\r\n     boost::unique_lock&lt;boost::shared_mutex&gt; WriteLock(Lock_); \r\n     //update log level, also do some more stuff like log rotate etc.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problem is while T4 doing more stuff in UpdateLogLevel function, the T1 thread gets RT signals and that causes it to block indefinitely, there by other threads kind of get stuck as well, since they are depending on PostUpdateToOtherThreads() function. This does not happen if total time spent by T4 in UpdateLogLevel is less than 20 ms (i.e. duration of RT signal). time spent is large, then the threads kind of get stuck and only way to recover the process is to kill it or interrupt it. \r\n\r\nThe workaround to fix is for T1 thread to not call the Log function at all, but I could not find a better way to fix it.

Back in those days, the client regions were memory views of the actual scanout buffer.\r\n\r\nOf course OpenGL already back then didn&#39;t specify any relationship between when drawing commands were issued and when or in which order they were executed; as long as the *&quot;the result looks exactly as-if things were executed in this order&quot;* rule was adhered to, any reordering was fair game. So already then you couldn&#39;t practically use OpenGL to race the beam. And neither you could with Direct3D, I might add.\r\n\r\nWhat you was possible however is using DirectDraw in *exclusive* mode, which would actually give you direct access to the whole of the scanout buffer, in a way that&#39;d you&#39;d actually could race the beam.\r\n\r\nBut given the modern graphics stacks, even with that racing the beam no longer works, because:\r\n\r\n&gt; No buffer swapping, no windowing system - directly rendering to the buffer from which pixels get copied to the wire.\r\n\r\nWell, if you can get hold of ancient hardware that actually works that way. These days it&#39;s all about swap chains. On current generation Intel integrated graphics for example, even in text mode the display wouldn&#39;t even update if something wasn&#39;t pumping the swap chain.\r\n\r\nOf course you can still issue a swap while mid frame-scanout, thus tearing the frame. (which is part of the reason, why to this date double buffering in X.Org usually tears moving pictures (video)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn your comment:\r\n\r\n&gt; Looking at VR headsets, the VIVE for example, it can run in ‚extended mode‘, in which the headset is just treated as a secondary monitor, or ‚direct mode‘\r\n\r\nThis direct mode is nothing special. Two things are happening:\r\n\r\n1. The HMD is simply hidden from the selection of displays you can expand the desktop to.\r\n\r\n2. To access the display a direct mode graphics context (using DirectX or Vulkan) is created, which mostly behaves as a fullscreen window, complete with a swap chain.\r\n\r\nVulkan (that text referring to an older version of Vulkan but still applies):\r\nhttps://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.0.30.0/linux/vkspec.chunked/ch29s03.html\r\n\r\nDRM leases on Linux:\r\nhttps://keithp.com/blogs/DRM-lease/\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314747/windows-how-to-render-to-video-scan-out-memory-directly/58327014#58327014","title":"Windows, how to render to video scan-out memory directly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1187,"user_id":1282931,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b791ae1aab5bff71cc3a93f59e2f19ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1282931","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1282931/user1282931"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43551,"user_id":44729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyWaU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"genpfault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/44729/genpfault"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570723485,"creation_date":1570675643,"last_edit_date":1570677715,"question_id":58314747,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58314747","body_markdown":"On Windows and optimally using OpenGL, can I render directly to video scan-out memory (hdmi port of the graphics card)?

have a linked list which will be processed by ***n*** instances of the same ***pthread***.\r\n\r\nThe thread will continuously remove an item from the list and depending on the type will move it to a second list, assigning it a sequential reference number which is generated by a function. The numbers must be assigned in the same sequence as the items are removed from the list. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate some ideas on how to go about this. The problem is that the threads are assigning out of order reference numbers to the items removed from the list. Please consider a list containing A1, A2, A3. Thread ***n1*** removes A1, gets reference number 1 and associates it with item A1. Thread ***n2*** removes item A2 and thread ***n3*** removes item A3; before thread ***n2*** can get reference number 2, thread ***n3*** already got it and therefore when thread ***n2*** gets the reference number it will be reference number 3. \r\n\r\nThe result is: {{A1, 1}, {A2, 3}, {A3, 2}} which is incorrect. I have tried using a condition variable, but the only way that it makes sense to me would be to call *pthread_cond_broadcast()* before calling *pthread_cond_wait()*, which obviously is illogical, the idea being something like *do not let any thread get an item from the list until the last item is processed*. I have implemented a version which skips the pthread_cond_signal() if it&#39;s the very first thread to run and then hits the pthread_cond_wait() until the second thread runs pthread_cond_broadcast(); it works better than without the condition variable but the results are not constant. Sometimes will work perfectly for 2 or 3 threads, sometimes for 2 or 4, but obviously it&#39;s not working. I have also used a mutex variable but was not able to accomplish the objective.\r\n\r\nThank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314724/how-to-control-multiple-instances-of-the-same-pthread-to-process-a-sequential-li","title":"How to control multiple instances of the same pthread to process a sequential list"},{"tags":["python","json","flask"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":10411973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc14f92747ee25d795838e052fe65252?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chenoi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10411973/chenoi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570678294,"post_id":58314937,"comment_id":102990590,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314718/how-to-pass-for-loop-output-list-to-html-page/58314937#comment102990590_58314937"},{"owner":{"reputation":102,"user_id":12192183,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc72b55ded7c70b745d320b5531ef891?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mindless-overflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12192183/mindless-overflow"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":92,"user_id":10411973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc14f92747ee25d795838e052fe65252?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chenoi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10411973/chenoi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570742093,"post_id":58314937,"comment_id":103020170,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314718/how-to-pass-for-loop-output-list-to-html-page/58314937#comment103020170_58314937"},{"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":10411973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc14f92747ee25d795838e052fe65252?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chenoi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10411973/chenoi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570761700,"post_id":58314937,"comment_id":103024467,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314718/how-to-pass-for-loop-output-list-to-html-page/58314937#comment103024467_58314937"},{"owner":{"reputation":102,"user_id":12192183,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc72b55ded7c70b745d320b5531ef891?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mindless-overflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12192183/mindless-overflow"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":92,"user_id":10411973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc14f92747ee25d795838e052fe65252?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chenoi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10411973/chenoi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570761946,"post_id":58314937,"comment_id":103024505,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314718/how-to-pass-for-loop-output-list-to-html-page/58314937#comment103024505_58314937"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":102,"user_id":12192183,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc72b55ded7c70b745d320b5531ef891?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mindless-overflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12192183/mindless-overflow"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570677281,"creation_date":1570677281,"answer_id":58314937,"question_id":58314718,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314937","body_markdown":"Your issue is in your for loop.

actually quite straightforward! Rather than using a `stack` to push then pop your &quot;found&quot; strings path, just use a `vector` and `push_back` the strings; then you can print the values off in either order! In this code, I&#39;ve switched to the &#39;other&#39; order from what you had:\r\n\r\n    if (found) {\r\n        //traverse the word path from the end word back to the start word\r\n        int i = words.size() - 1;\r\n    /// stack&lt;string&gt; wordPath;\r\n        vector&lt;string&gt; wordPath;\r\n        while (i != -1) {\r\n            // push the current word into a vector ...\r\n    ///     wordPath.push(words[i].first);\r\n            wordPath.push_back(words[i].first);\r\n\t\t\t//go to the previous word\r\n            i = words[i].second;\r\n        }\r\n        // now retrieve the words from the vector and print them ...\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Word path:&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    /// while (!wordPath.empty()) {\r\n    ///     cout &lt;&lt; wordPath.top() &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;\r\n    ///     wordPath.pop();\r\n    /// }\r\n        ///\r\n        for (size_t w = 0; w &lt; wordPath.size(); ++w) {\r\n            string text = wordPath[w];\r\n            size_t index = 0;\r\n            for (index = 0; index &lt; dictionary.size(); ++index) {\r\n                if (text == dictionary[index]) break;\r\n            }\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; &quot;[&quot; &lt;&lt; index &lt;&lt; &quot;] &quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        ///\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou could even put a choice in here!

am doing some bitwise manipulation.\r\n\r\nI am adding a 32 bit number to another 32 bit number with |= instead of += because I was thinking the number might be getting messed up when it converts to 32 bit (binary wasn&#39;t showing up right).\r\n\r\nBasically, the number at the end of my operations is the two&#39;s complement interpretation of the bitwise manipulation i&#39;ve performed. I think the original binary I was trying to get out of my operations is getting kicked out when it takes that two&#39;s complement number and converts it into the standard 64 bit float (when the operation is complete). As in, the binary stops being considered and it just tries to take the result, say -5, and make a 64 bit binary representation for that. But the bit representation of -5 in twos complement and the standard 64 bit number is quite different, obviously.\r\n\r\nI only care about the binary, the number that it gets interpreted as is not an issue to me at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nI just want to be sure my binary won&#39;t get kicked out. How can I preserve my binary in my operations without having to break out how I step into my binary string? \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t really want to break my 32 bit numbers into 8-bit or 16-bit but is that the only way?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m still trying to understand what exactly goes on when javascript is doing its bitwise stuff, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I&#39;ve muddied an important detail.\r\n\r\nPlease help! I need to understand what is going on here and how to work around it.\r\n\r\nEdit: in the debugger, after manipulation, the number gets displayed as the two&#39;s complement interpretation of my bits, which is confusing to me because i thought it converts back to a 64 bit number before ever returning the value to any user code.\r\n\r\nI really didn&#39;t want to provide my code because I didn&#39;t want to have to get into the details of why I&#39;m doing each little step, but basically i have the binary of an integer number of increment &quot;counts&quot; that is an argument to a binary string. sbs is an abbreviation for startBits, which is an array of the position of the first bit (MSB) from left to right (left being MSB). Basically, the start bit is the 1-based position that the first bit OCCUPIES (hence some weird -1&#39;s or +1&#39;s here or there) and the tot bits is the total number of bits that the arguemnt contains. If there are more than one elements in the startbit array (sbs) then the number of bits in each placement of bits to a startbit is just the total bits divided by the length of the startbit array. so if there are two elements in the startbit array and a tot bit of 4 then the 2 MSB bits of the &quot;counts&quot; value will be placed at sbs[0] and the 2 LSB bits at sbs[1]. Hopefully that is clear enough.\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function getHexCode(thing){\r\n        return parseInt(thing.hexCode.slice(0,8), 16);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      function constructArglessBinaryString(thing){\r\n        return getHexCode(thing);\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      function constructBinaryStringWithArgs(thing, counts){\r\n        var bin = []\r\n        bin.push(constructArglessBinaryString(thing));\r\n        bin.push(0);\r\n        let tbs = thing.args[0].totBits;\r\n        let sbs = thing.args[0].startBits;\r\n        let mask = (1 &lt;&lt; tbs/sbs.length) - 1; // make mask a continguous length of 1 bits\r\n        let i = 0;\r\n        do{\r\n          let a = counts &amp; (mask &lt;&lt; (tbs/sbs.length * i)); // &amp; the mask with the counts at a sequential location along the counts total bits length\r\n          let b = a &gt;&gt;&gt; (tbs/sbs.length * i); // shift the result back before incorporating into binary string\r\n          if (sbs[i] &lt;= 32){\r\n            var x = (b &lt;&lt; (32 - sbs[i] - tbs/sbs.length + 1));\r\n            bin[0] |= (b &lt;&lt; (32 - sbs[i] - tbs/sbs.length + 1));        // place into binary string at respective sb location\r\n          }\r\n            else \r\n            bin[1] |= (b &lt;&lt; (32 - (sbs[i]-32) - tbs/sbs.length + 1));   // case in which the arg bits go in the second 32 bits\r\n          i++;\r\n        }while(i&lt;sbs.length)\r\n        return bin;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314714/converting-a-twos-complement-number-to-its-binary-representation","title":"Converting a Twos-complement number to its binary representation"},{"tags":["c#","selenium"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17672,"user_id":3181933,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LkHtH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3181933/john"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570677287,"post_id":58314710,"comment_id":102990361,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314710/trying-to-grab-each-reddit-title-to-decide-what-to-click#comment102990361_58314710"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":813,"user_id":11843739,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kaKuhwUHPr8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/HCb_rFE1EG0/photo.jpg=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"fenixil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11843739/fenixil"},"last_editor":{"reputation":813,"user_id":11843739,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kaKuhwUHPr8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/HCb_rFE1EG0/photo.jpg=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"fenixil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11843739/fenixil"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570677051,"last_edit_date":1570677051,"creation_date":1570676669,"answer_id":58314873,"question_id":58314710,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314873","body_markdown":"You page might not fully loaded yet when you try find an element.

If you&#39;re using **Python3** then you can just use the Python bytes type. For example: \r\n\r\n\r\n    data = b&quot;Ats\\\\Quote\\\\Model\\\\Quote&quot;\r\n    collection.update_many({}, {&quot;$set&quot;:{&quot;__class&quot;: data }})\r\n\r\nThis will result in value `BinData(0, &quot;QXRzXFF1b3RlXE1vZGVsXFF1b3Rl&quot;)` in the MongoDB collection. \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using **Python2**, the data must be wrapped as an instance of `bson.binary.Binary` from the [bson module](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/bson/index.html#module-bson). \r\n\r\n&gt; BinData(128, &quot;QXRzXFF1b3RlXE1vZGVsXFF1b3Rl&quot;)\r\n\r\nAlso, worth mentioning that the way you construct `BinData` is not common BSON (although you may have a special reason). \r\n\r\n`BinData` takes parameters in the form of `BinData(subtype, base64str)`. The subtype is utilised to indicate what kind of data is in the byte array. According to the [BSON specifications](http://bsonspec.org/spec.html) generic binary subtype is `0`. This is the most commonly used binary subtype and should be the &#39;default&#39; for MongoDB drivers (i.e. PyMongo) and tools. \r\n\r\nWhile subtypes from zero to 127 are predefined or reserved, subtypes from 128-255 are user-defined. Unless you&#39;re purposely specifying 128 to define your own type, I would suggest to use `0`. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314653/using-mongoclient-i-am-unable-to-add-a-key-of-type-bindata-in-mongo-collection-f/58442437#58442437","title":"Using mongoclient I am unable to add a key of type BinData in mongo collection from python"}],"owner":{"reputation":241,"user_id":5114898,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GaSzs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Surendranath Reddy K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5114898/surendranath-reddy-k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":830,"user_id":10003710,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8zTS-w1y-AA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAN8c/dkHCDLhexh4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amit Yadav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10003710/amit-yadav"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571359094,"creation_date":1570674796,"last_edit_date":1570735440,"question_id":58314653,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58314653","body_markdown":"when I run this query in console it works fine.\r\n\r\n    db.testColl.updateMany({},{ &quot;$set&quot;: {&quot;__class&quot;

The iodbctest program seemed like a good candidate, as it has a function where you hit ? and it lists the data sources.\r\n\r\n**Don&#39;t mix installs of iodbc and unixodbc**.  iodbc isn&#39;t an abstract set of tools and tests for ODBC, it is a [completely independent implementation of ODBC from unixodbc.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7548825/what-are-the-functional-differences-between-iodbc-and-unixodbc)\r\n\r\nIn my case, I first installed unixodbc.  So that&#39;s what `myodbc-installer` asked to register the drivers and data sources, via shared library functions.  But it wrote the .INI files in a way that doesn&#39;t match what `iodbc` would have written.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the `iodbctest` client appears to not be dynamically linked to use whatever ODBC provider is on your system.  It is statically linked to iodbc routines that [look explicitly in the `odbc.ini` file for an `[ODBC Data Sources]` section](https://github.com/openlink/iODBC/blob/789a2df6b715edf73a145752e40b73e92a7df9fe/iodbcinst/SQLGetInstalledDrivers.c#L89).  This index does not appear to be made automatically by the unixodbc registration process.\r\n\r\n*(Note: This may be a bug in either unixodbc or mysql-installer&#39;s usage of it, as [the documentation says](http://www.unixodbc.org/internals.html) &quot;An `[ODBC Data Sources]` section is maintained in each odbc.ini and may or may not be used by the odbcinst library.&quot;)*\r\n\r\nInterestingly, while the mysql-installer tells you how to use it to register a data source, a different suggestion on the MySQL website tells you to [edit the INI file by hand](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-configuration-dsn-unix.html).  This contradicts [what unixodbc says](http://www.unixodbc.org/internals.html), which is **&quot;NOTE: odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini are considered to be ODBC System Information. All access (read or write) to this System Information should occur via the Driver Manager or the ODBCINST share library. Do not access these INI files directly!&quot;** (emphasis theirs)\r\n\r\nBeyond the issue of not being able to get the index, even if you do connect to a data source on Linux, iODBC uses `wchar_t` and not `SQLWCHAR`.  So with a unicode driver, you&#39;ll get a bunch of gibberish back from your queries.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58314640/myodbc-installer-lists-data-sources-but-iodbctest-shows-no-dsns/58314880#58314880","title":"myodbc-installer lists data sources, but iodbctest shows no DSNs"}],"owner":{"reputation":26230,"user_id":211160,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VWHTU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HostileFork","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/211160/hostilefork"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570676764,"creation_date":1570674654,"question_id":58314640,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58314640","body_markdown":"I was following the instructions for registering a driver and data source given here: [&quot;Installing Connector/ODBC from a Binary Tarball Distribution&quot;](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-installation-binary-unix-tarball.html)\r\n\r\nAfter realizing I had to [use sudo when running `myodbc-installer`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58306739/), I could successfully get the driver I installed to show as registered, with:\r\n\r\n    shell&gt; myodbc-installer -d -l\r\n    MySQL ODBC 8.0 Driver\r\n\r\nWhen you run `myodbc-installer` with no arguments, it lists the command line switches and also tells you how to register a data source.

other folks have already pointed out that you need to have position set to relative, left set to 0, and only one value defined for the &#39;bottom&#39; property. I don&#39;t want to steal their thunder. While looking through your code, I noticed that a lot of dimensions are hard-coded, though, and you seem to be doing your grid system from scratch.
