I&#39;m assuming, as you said, it can be only 3 or 4.\r\n\r\n 2. Create two details sections: A and B.\r\n\r\n 3. Use section expert to suppress detail section A when {?NumberOfColumns} = 4.\r\n\r\n 4. Use section expert to suppress detail section B when {?NumberOfColumns} = 3.\r\n\r\n 5. Use section expert on section A. Mark &quot;format with multiple columns&quot;. On tab &quot;Layout&quot;, set the width to fit only 3 columns in section (~page width/3).\r\n\r\n 6. Use section expert on section B. Mark &quot;format with multiple columns&quot;. On tab &quot;Layout&quot;, set the width to fit only 4 columns in section (~page width/4).\r\n\r\n 7.

I will write for 3 columns. You will need to adapt for 4 columns (or just create another rpt for 4 columns).\r\n\r\n1. Forget the &quot;format with multiple columns&quot; option. Just create a normal detail section.\r\n\r\n2. Create the following boring formula. Let&#39;s call it as &quot;fieldsFiller&quot;:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n    shared stringvar address1;\r\n    shared stringvar address2;\r\n    shared stringvar address3;\r\n    shared stringvar name1;\r\n    shared stringvar name2;\r\n    shared stringvar name3;\r\n    shared stringvar surname1;\r\n    shared stringvar surname2;\r\n    shared stringvar surname3;\r\n    shared stringvar zip1;\r\n    shared stringvar zip2;\r\n    shared stringvar zip3;\r\n    shared stringvar city1;\r\n    shared stringvar city2;\r\n    shared stringvar city3;\r\n    //TODO do the same for the others fields you need\r\n    \r\n    if recordnumber mod 3 = 1 then (\r\n        address1 := {YourDataSource.Address};\r\n        name1 := {YourDataSource.Name};\r\n        surname1 := {YourDataSource.Surname};\r\n        zip1 := {YourDataSource.Zip};\r\n        city1 := {YourDataSource.City};\r\n        //TODO do the same for the others fields you need\r\n    )\r\n    else if recordnumber mod 3 = 2 then (\r\n        address2 := {YourDataSource.Address};\r\n        name2 := {YourDataSource.Name};\r\n        surname2 := {YourDataSource.Surname};\r\n        zip2 := {YourDataSource.Zip};\r\n        city2 := {YourDataSource.City};\r\n        //TODO do the same for the others fields you need\r\n    )\r\n    else if recordnumber mod 3 = 0 then (\r\n        address3 := {YourDataSource.Address};\r\n        name3 := {YourDataSource.Name};\r\n        surname3 := {YourDataSource.Surname};\r\n        zip3 := {YourDataSource.Zip};\r\n        city3 := {YourDataSource.City};\r\n        //TODO do the same for the others fields you need\r\n    )\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n3. Put the &quot;fieldsFiller&quot; formula in details section and suppress it.\r\n4. Use section expert on detail section to suppress it according to the following formula:\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n  recordnumber mod 3 &gt; 0\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n5. This will be too boring... Create one formula for each shared variable you declared in &quot;fieldsFiller&quot; formula. For example, create a formula named &quot;address1&quot; with this content:\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n  shared stringvar address1;\r\n  address1;\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n6. Put the formulas in the details section. Put them as fields, side by side.\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nname1 surname1   name2 surname2     name3 surname3\r\naddress1         address2           address3\r\nzip1 city1       zip2 city2         zip3 city3\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n7.

the lines must be parsed. Looking at the line format we can conclude the following:\r\n\r\n* It is not trivial to parse using simple string manipulation (indices, splits, partitioning, ...) \r\n* Using a full-fledged parser like [pyparsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing) or [ply](https://pypi.org/project/ply/) might is overkill if the lines don&#39;t vary in structure too much.\r\n* [Regular Expressions](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) are a good fit for this\r\n\r\nHere is an example function which parses the line into named-tuples using the [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport re\r\nfrom collections import namedtuple\r\n\r\nimport rapidtables\r\n\r\nRow = namedtuple(&#39;Row&#39;, &#39;title age st visual chest lv hv&#39;)\r\nPATTERN = re.compile(\r\n    r&#39;^(.*?): &#39;\r\n    r&#39;(\\d+) is &#39;\r\n    r&#39;ST#: (\\d+), &#39;\r\n    r&#39;VISUAL: (\\d+), &#39;\r\n    r&#39;Chest: (\\d+), &#39;\r\n    r&#39;EYES\\((\\d+): LV, &#39;\r\n    r&#39;(\\d+): HV\\): &#39;\r\n    r&#39;(\\d+)&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef parse_line(line):\r\n    # type: (str) -&gt; Optional[Row]\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    Parses a line into a named-tuple\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_line(&#39;The Physical Study of DEEPAK Barin: 34 is ST#: 3, VISUAL: 593, Chest: 56, EYES(0: LV, 1: HV): 0&#39;)\r\n    Row(title=&#39;The Physical Study of DEEPAK Barin&#39;, age=34, st=3, visual=593, chest=56, lv=0, hv=1)\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    match = PATTERN.match(line)\r\n    if not match:\r\n        # Line did not match the expected pattern\r\n        return None\r\n\r\n    # As we have a match, we can now unpack the groups from the regex\r\n    title, age, st, visual, chest, lv, hv, unknown = match.groups()\r\n\r\n    # The regex returns strings, we convert them to more manageable data-types\r\n    # here, because this should be part of the parsing, and should not be\r\n    # forced upon downstream code.\r\n    output = Row(\r\n        title,\r\n        int(age),\r\n        int(st),\r\n        int(visual),\r\n        int(chest),\r\n        int(lv),\r\n        int(hv)\r\n    )\r\n    return output\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing this parsing function, you can use [rapidtables](https://github.com/alttch/rapidtables) to easily format data like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport rapidtables\r\n\r\nwith open(&#39;textfile&#39;) as infile:\r\n    parsed_lines = [parse_line(line.strip()) for line in infile]\r\ntable = rapidtables.make_table(parsed_lines , tablefmt=&#39;simple&#39;)\r\nprint(table)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023802/in-a-line-specific-word-convert-to-table-format/58023991#58023991","title":"In a line specific word convert to table format"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4948216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9b4a4603c619ad98981c9bb38b4dc66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Deepak Kumar Nayak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4948216/deepak-kumar-nayak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":761,"user_id":10763029,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5SKQw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CodeRed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10763029/codered"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568985132,"creation_date":1568964837,"last_edit_date":1568965278,"question_id":58023802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58023802","body_markdown":"***The Physical Study of DEEPAK  Barin: 34 is ST#: 3, VISUAL: 593, Chest: 56, EYES(0: LV, 1: HV): 0***\r\n\r\nLike this, so many lines are here.

lines of code should be enough?\r\npseudo code could be like this:\r\n\r\n    int MinTimeToWait = 1000;\r\n    var TimerTask = StartTimer(MinTimeToWait);\r\n    // do work…\r\n    await Task.WhenAny(TimerTask);\r\n\r\nI searched a lot but I can&#39;t figure what classes I can use to write this code in a concise, async way..\r\nWhat do you think? Any proposal?\r\nthanks,\r\nStefano\r\n\r\nCorrect answer is from Theodor (see comments)… if a moderator see this, please, flag his comment as the correct answer :)\r\n\r\n\r\n    int MinTimeToWait = 1000;\r\n    Task TimerTask = Task.Delay(MinTimeToWait);\r\n    // process data\r\n    await TimerTask;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023781/async-wait-a-timer-in-a-concise-way-using-net-4-5-and-c","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Async wait a timer... in a

is not a message queue, it is a pub/sub system.\r\n\r\nBut you can get something close to what you describe. Using a hight subscriber QOS (1 or 2) you can get the broker to queue messages for client that is offline until it reconnects.\r\n\r\nTo do this you must do the following:\r\n\r\n - Use a fixed client id for the client\r\n - Ensure the Clean Session flag is set to false when the client reconnects to the broker.\r\n - When the client subscribes to the topic it must include a QOS greater than 0 (using 1 may result in some messages being delivered multiple times, 2 should be only once)\r\n\r\nALL messages published while the client is offline will be delivered, there is no way to get any window on this from the client side. Depending on the broker it may be possible to set either a byte limit or time limit on what the broker stores (but this is outside the MQTT spec, which implies the data should be stored forever). (As of MQTT v5 it is possible for the publisher of the message to set TTL value that will have the message removed if it expires)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023741/mqtt-vernemq-create-streaming/58025176#58025176","title":"Mqtt vernemq Create

would help if you could `console.log` the result of `wrapper.instance()` so we can see what is actually being returned. \r\n\r\nMy guess would be that your component is wrapped inside multiple HOCs,

new to React unit testing and I&#39;m trying to write a test for a component method.\r\n\r\nTaking the below example, I need to write a test for the `changeHandler` method of `ComponentA`:\r\n\r\n    import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import PropTypes from &#39;prop-types&#39;;\r\n    import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    class ComponentA extends

goal:\r\n\r\n    import React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import ComponentA from &#39;./ComponentA&#39;;\r\n    import { createMount } from &#39;@material-ui/core/test-utils&#39;;\r\n    import

 });\r\n\r\nBut running the tests I&#39;m getting\r\n&gt; TypeError: wrapper.instance(...).changeHandler is not a function` \r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong... am I missing something?\r\n\r\nAdditional details:  \r\n  \r\nusing `shallow().dive().dive().dive().dive().dive().dive().dive()` the `changeHandler` method shows up, but I&#39;m getting `undefined` when doing

really not sure what problem you want fixed or what your goal is, but what you&#39;re saying you want to do can be done. But you&#39;re already given the answer in the question, so I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re getting stuck.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s take your first statement:\r\n\r\n&gt;Here I have a dataset with date, time and one input column. Here I want to select the time for specific value in input column. Then I convert that time into &quot;00:00:00&#39;\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s what your code already does. I&#39;ve cleaned it up here and make it executable:\r\n\r\n    # Here I&#39;ve added the preliminary bits so it&#39;s executable.\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    data = pd.read_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;, delimiter=&#39;\\t&#39;)\r\n    # Here I&#39;ve fixed the line wrapping, added .str.strip() because your data has trailing\r\n    # spaces, and removed dayfirst because it doesn&#39;t make sense if you&#39;re specifying format\r\n    data[&#39;date&#39;]= pd.to_datetime(data[&#39;date&#39;] + &quot; &quot; + data[&#39;time&#39;].str.strip(), format=&#39;%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S&#39;)\r\n    mask = data[&#39;X3&#39;].eq(7)\r\n    data[&#39;t1&#39;] = data[&#39;date&#39;].mask(mask, data[&#39;date&#39;].dt.floor(&#39;d&#39;))\r\n    # And you&#39;re done. You can print the results, for example:\r\n    data[data[&#39;X3&#39;] == 7][&#39;t1&#39;]\r\n\r\nThat gives\r\n\r\n    0    2018-03-10\r\n    2    2018-03-10\r\n    3    2018-03-10\r\n    4    2018-03-10\r\n    6    2018-03-10\r\n    7    2018-03-10\r\n    8    2018-03-10\r\n    10   2018-03-10\r\n    11   2018-03-10\r\n    12   2018-03-10\r\n    13   2018-03-10\r\n    15   2018-03-10\r\n    16   2018-03-10\r\n    17   2018-03-10\r\n    19   2018-03-10\r\n    20   2018-04-10\r\n    21   2018-04-10\r\n    Name: t1, dtype: datetime64[ns]\r\n\r\nWhich shows that all the rows that match your condition now have their time changed to `00:00:00`. Note that pandas decides to suppress showing the time when they&#39;re all the same. You can print all the data with `data` to force the time to be printed.\r\n\r\nThen you say you want to\r\n\r\n&gt; for that time add time delta(hours=5).\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s ambiguous, and since you don&#39;t show any attempt at it or include it in your expected output, I can&#39;t be sure. But assuming you just want to 5 hours to your datetime column, this will do:\r\n\r\n    data[&#39;t1&#39;] = data[&#39;t1&#39;] + pd.DateOffset(hours=5)\r\n\r\nOr if you only want to do it to your selected rows:\r\n\r\n    data.loc[data[&#39;X3&#39;] == 7, &#39;t1&#39;] = data[&#39;t1&#39;] + pd.DateOffset(hours=5)\r\n\r\nAnd then you say\r\n\r\n&gt; I tried a code but it just show me only time. date is missing.\r\n\r\nWhich is what your code (in particular, `f(x)`) does. So if you don&#39;t want it to do that, don&#39;t use that code.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. What might help more, in future, is to start with a [minimum, reproducible example (MRE)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). There was a bunch of stuff in your question that wasn&#39;t helping, and it&#39;s likely that as you started to strip it down the the MRE you would find what you wanted anyway.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023686/how-to-add-timedelta-into-datetime-while-time-is-in-000000-using-python/58037493#58037493","title":"How to add timedelta into datetime while time is in &quot;00:00:00&#39; using python"}],"owner":{"reputation":313,"user_id":11781947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69a275c24e08f76702c763d8d44796db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"team","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11781947/team"},"last_editor":{"reputation":313,"user_id":11781947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69a275c24e08f76702c763d8d44796db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"team","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11781947/team"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58037493,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569043238,"creation_date":1568964372,"last_edit_date":1568967906,"question_id":58023686,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58023686","body_markdown":"Here I have a dataset with date, time and one input column.

After setting up the code, I have the template project that they give you with MVC. So on the &quot;About&quot; page I have the following controller class `AboutController.cs` with the method found on Microsofts website:\r\n\r\n    [HttpPost(&quot;UploadFiles&quot;)]\r\n    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Post(List&lt;IFormFile&gt; files)\r\n    {\r\n        long size = files.Sum(f =&gt; f.Length);\r\n        string filePath = Path.GetTempFileName();\r\n    \r\n        if (files.Count &gt; 0)\r\n        {\r\n            IFormFile file = files[0];\r\n            if (file.Length &gt; 0)\r\n            {\r\n                using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create))\r\n                {\r\n                    await file.CopyToAsync(stream);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return View();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe only &quot;big&quot; difference is that I return the view, not an &quot;Ok&quot; because I&#39;m not really interested in that. I want to modify the view I&#39;m looking at not go to a completely new view (maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding how MVC works?).\r\n\r\nNow my HTML looks like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; asp-controller=&quot;About&quot; asp-action=&quot;Post&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-10&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;p&gt;Upload one image using this form:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;files&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-10&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Upload&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\nThis produces the form, also as seen in their documentation linked earlier. When I click the &quot;Browse&quot; button to find a picture, it works fine and when I click &quot;Open&quot; so I can upload it, the Visual Studio debugger stops running immediately. No error anywhere that I can see.\r\n\r\nAny idea what causes this behaviour?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/file-uploads?view=aspnetcore-2.2\r\n\r\n**Update 1**\r\n\r\nIt appears that just calling return View(); exhibits the same behaviour and Nuget says it&#39;s AspNetCore.Mvc 2.1.1\r\n\r\n**Update 2**\r\n\r\nTurns out the debugger does not work in this particular instance with the browser called &quot;Brave&quot; which is a chromium browser that I use (which If forgot to mention)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023683/visual-studio-debugging-stop-immediately-on-file-upload-in-mvc","title":"Visual Studio debugging stop immediately on file upload in mvc?"},{"tags":["regex","c++11","tinyxml2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":365176,"user_id":3832970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64323e6cf08401474da3bf770ea13b58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wiktor Stribiżew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832970/wiktor-stribi%c5%bcew"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568964700,"post_id":58023681,"comment_id":102450092,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023681/after-valid-the-data-how-to-get-data-from-xml-file#comment102450092_58023681"},{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11901795,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vY-BqUt8_Xw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rduQK3qb1Om6OvsnoOCVD04K2VXVg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Soumaya Mondal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901795/soumaya-mondal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568965926,"post_id":58023681,"comment_id":102450696,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023681/after-valid-the-data-how-to-get-data-from-xml-file#comment102450696_58023681"},{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11901795,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vY-BqUt8_Xw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rduQK3qb1Om6OvsnoOCVD04K2VXVg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Soumaya Mondal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901795/soumaya-mondal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568969278,"post_id":58023681,"comment_id":102452222,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023681/after-valid-the-data-how-to-get-data-from-xml-file#comment102452222_58023681"},{"owner":{"reputation":169,"user_id":7316866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qKpWK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7316866/ana"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568972265,"post_id":58023681,"comment_id":102453805,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023681/after-valid-the-data-how-to-get-data-from-xml-file#comment102453805_58023681"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11901795,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vY-BqUt8_Xw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rduQK3qb1Om6OvsnoOCVD04K2VXVg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Soumaya Mondal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901795/soumaya-mondal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11901795,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vY-BqUt8_Xw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rduQK3qb1Om6OvsnoOCVD04K2VXVg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Soumaya Mondal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901795/soumaya-mondal"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568969244,"creation_date":1568964357,"last_edit_date":1568969244,"question_id":58023681,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58023681","body_markdown":"I write a program , and i used the (regex) operation and the valid a xml pattern ... but after validate how to store the data from the string and store it into the xml file and how to grab data from the xml file, i can not implement this please help me..... i will share the code!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my question is that if i enter the cofr in the if block the code is not working???

I was looking for a programmatic solution for the conversion and removing whitespace.\r\n\r\n    console.log(blockedOffers.map(String).trim());\r\n    \r\n    node mycode.js &gt; formattedcode.txt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023625/trying-to-use-mapstring-to-convert-large-array-of-numbers","title":"Trying to use .map(String) to convert large array of numbers"},{"tags":["android","android-drawable","android-appcompat","android-resources"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4469,"user_id":10271334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2ijZhRVumwM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACes/Tjw_JgqObGI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeel Vankhede","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10271334/jeel-vankhede"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568964597,"post_id":58023623,"comment_id":102450044,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023623/why-appcompatresources-getdrawablecontext-context-int-resid-marked-as-nullab#comment102450044_58023623"},{"owner":{"reputation":2068,"user_id":5868421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6EqgS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maksim Turaev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5868421/maksim-turaev"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4469,"user_id":10271334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2ijZhRVumwM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACes/Tjw_JgqObGI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeel Vankhede","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10271334/jeel-vankhede"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568964685,"post_id":58023623,"comment_id":102450083,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023623/why-appcompatresources-getdrawablecontext-context-int-resid-marked-as-nullab#comment102450083_58023623"},{"owner":{"reputation":4469,"user_id":10271334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2ijZhRVumwM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACes/Tjw_JgqObGI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeel Vankhede","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10271334/jeel-vankhede"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568964808,"post_id":58023623,"comment_id":102450146,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023623/why-appcompatresources-getdrawablecontext-context-int-resid-marked-as-nullab#comment102450146_58023623"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2068,"user_id":5868421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6EqgS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maksim Turaev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5868421/maksim-turaev"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568965344,"post_id":58023911,"comment_id":102450420,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023623/why-appcompatresources-getdrawablecontext-context-int-resid-marked-as-nullab/58023911#comment102450420_58023911"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":52659,"user_id":236465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IoAkG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Diego Torres Milano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/236465/diego-torres-milano"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568965203,"creation_date":1568965203,"answer_id":58023911,"question_id":58023623,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023911","body_markdown":"This is because of `AppCompatDrawableManager.getDrawable()` can return `null`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public Drawable getDrawable(@NonNull Context context, @DrawableRes int resId,\r\n            boolean failIfNotKnown) {\r\n        checkVectorDrawableSetup(context);\r\n        Drawable drawable = loadDrawableFromDelegates(context, resId);\r\n        if (drawable == null) {\r\n            drawable = createDrawableIfNeeded(context, resId);\r\n        }\r\n        if (drawable == null) {\r\n            drawable = ContextCompat.getDrawable(context, resId);\r\n        }\r\n        if (drawable != null) {\r\n            // Tint it if needed\r\n            drawable = tintDrawable(context, resId, failIfNotKnown, drawable);\r\n        }\r\n        if (drawable != null) {\r\n            // See if we need to &#39;fix&#39;

tell me where is my fault?\r\nthis is my code:\r\n````\r\n\r\n//membuat object batu\r\nvar Batumc:batu_mc = new batu_mc(); // creates a instance of the movieclip, i.e, an object\r\nvar Batumc1:batu_mc

(Why i am saying this is because i am getting exact same accuracy logs for all the combination of learning Rates and decay_after_epoch ).  However , i want to train different loops with same initial parameters for the C.N.N layers which are given by S1  \r\nI have tried closing the session with  `sess.close()` , after each loop and then restoring the saved model(which was trained in part1 of the code) with  `model.restore_model(sess)` but it still does not give the expected result.  How should i be proceeding ?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023585/tensorflow-fine-tuning-only-the-fully-connected-layer-for-different-learning-r","title":"TensorFlow : Fine tuning only the Fully Connected Layer for Different learning rates with a single python file"},{"tags":["python","machine-learning","scikit-learn","linear-regression","log-likelihood"],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":9820561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8874a9d5b872df17474c1303a9379460?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mr.OY","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9820561/mr-oy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":61,"user_id":9820561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8874a9d5b872df17474c1303a9379460?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mr.OY","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9820561/mr-oy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568964785,"creation_date":1568964012,"last_edit_date":1568964785,"question_id":58023584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58023584","body_markdown":"**I&#39;m new to this material**\r\n\r\nI trying to reconstruct a procedure from an article that I read. \r\nFirst, I had to build 4 models to my raw data (points of X and Y)- one model is constant, second is linear, third is constant and then at X_0 linear and fourth is piecewise- linear regression and then at X_0 other linear regression with other slope.\r\n\r\nI used sklearn.linear_model to import LinearRegression to build the parts that are linear in the models.\r\n\r\nThe second stage is to choose a model, and in this part I find it difficult to understand what to do according to the article:\r\n\r\n&gt; We tested the fit of model predictions to our data by assuming an\r\n&gt; additive Gaussian error (with zero mean and fitted maximal-likelihood\r\n&gt; variance) and obtained p values by using a chi-square test of the log\r\n&gt; likelihood ratios for a nested hypothesis testing.

The datespec is a\r\n&gt; string of the form YYYY MM DD HH  MM  SS[ DST].  The contents of the\r\n&gt; string are six or seven numbers representing respectively the full\r\n&gt; year including century, the month from 1 to 12, the day of the month\r\n&gt; from 1 to 31, the hour of the day from 0 to 23, the minute from 0 to\r\n&gt; 59, the second from 0 to 60, and an optional day-light  saving flag. \r\n&gt; The values of these numbers need not be within the ranges specified;\r\n&gt; for example, an hour of -1 means 1 hour before midnight. The\r\n&gt; origin-zero Gregorian calendar is assumed, with year 0 preceding year\r\n&gt; 1 and year -1 preceding year 0.  The time is assumed to be in the \r\n&gt; local            timezone.   If  the  daylight saving flag is\r\n&gt; positive, the time is assumed to be daylight saving time; if zero, the\r\n&gt; time is assumed to be standard time; and if negative (the default),\r\n&gt; mktime() attempts to determine whether daylight saving time is in\r\n&gt; effect for the specified time.

To resolve that you will then have to call `.collate``\r\n\r\n```\r\nhmap11 = hv.HoloMap(latlon_selPLot, kdims=&#39;Lat and Lon :&#39; ).collate()\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023542/nesting-a-dynamicmap-inside-a-dynamicmap-is-not-supported/58024904#58024904","title":"Nesting a DynamicMap inside a DynamicMap is not supported"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11502075,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Eec5btv9ID4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfwtVxLaZrQJf9mvqNeeE7hehvD-Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MSA msa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11502075/msa-msa"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568984366,"creation_date":1568984366,"answer_id":58028875,"question_id":58023542,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58028875","body_markdown":"For selecting only the selected lat lon range i am doing another process of panel.select.\r\nbut first select.value is getting selected and when i change the select.value of another then the plot is not getting changed. \r\nwhere i am doing wrong ? how i can link with jlink , is my jlink correct ?\r\n\r\n    tiles = gv.tile_sources.Wikipedia\r\n    hmap1 = hv.HoloMap(allplot, kdims=&#39;Date and Time :&#39; )\r\n    hmap2 = hv.HoloMap(allplot2, kdims=&#39;Date and Time :&#39;)\r\n    finalplot=tiles*rasterize(hmap1).options(**opts)*hmap2\r\n    dd=df_div.opts(width=200, height=100)\r\n\r\n    select = pn.widgets.Select(name=&#39;States&#39;, options=[&#39;TN&#39;,&#39;AP&#39;, &#39;Odisha&#39;])\r\n     latmin = [7, 13, 19]\r\n     latmax = [14, 19, 22]\r\n     longmin = [77, 79, 85]\r\n     longmax = [83, 85, 88]\r\n    if (select.value==&#39;TN&#39;):\r\n        hhmap = rasterize(hmap1.redim.range(Latitude=(latmin[0],latmax[0]), Longitude= \r\n     (longmin[0], longmax[0])))\r\n       select.jslink(finalplot, value=&#39;object&#39;)\r\n        finalplot=tiles*hhmap*hmap2\r\n    \r\n     elif (select.value==&#39;AP&#39;):\r\n          hhmap =rasterize(hmap1.redim.range(Latitude=(latmin[1],latmax[1]), Longitude= \r\n     (longmin[1], longmax[1]))).options(**opts)\r\n       select.jslink(finalplot, value=&#39;object&#39;)\r\n        finalplot=tiles*rasterize(hhmap)*hmap2\r\n    \r\n    else:\r\n        hhmap = rasterize(hmap1.redim.range(Latitude=(latmin[2],latmax[2]), Longitude= \r\n       (longmin[2], longmax[2]))).options(**opts)\r\n        select.jslink(finalplot, value=&#39;Odisha&#39;)\r\n        finalplot=tiles*rasterize(hhmap)*hmap2\r\n     # else:\r\n     #     tiles*rasterize(hmap1).options(**opts)*hmap2\r\n\r\n     finalplot=tiles*rasterize(hhmap).options(**opts)*hmap2\r\n      finalplot=pn.Column(dd, finalplot, select).servable()    \r\n      # finalplot=pn.Column(dd, finalplot).servable()\r\n     finalplot\r\n    \r\n\r\nHow i can link up another select.value options , so that different plot come when select.value change ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58023542/nesting-a-dynamicmap-inside-a-dynamicmap-is-not-supported/58028875#58028875","title":"Nesting a DynamicMap inside a DynamicMap is not supported"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11502075,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Eec5btv9ID4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfwtVxLaZrQJf9mvqNeeE7hehvD-Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MSA msa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11502075/msa-msa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568984366,"creation_date":1568963847,"question_id":58023542,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58023542","body_markdown":"I have different timeseries plot for different time series i made holomap , now i am plotting different lat lon range holomap then i am getting exception :- \r\nException: Nesting a DynamicMap inside a DynamicMap is not supported.
