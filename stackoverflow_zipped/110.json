I&#39;m running aground on Account Linking because I can&#39;t figure out how to get Login with Amazon (LWA) to ask for alexa::skills:account_linking scope. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve included the Amazon API library in my application and set that all up correctly and I&#39;m invoking the process using the (globally available) amazon object as follows (typescript):\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    const options: any = {};\r\n    options.scope = [&#39;profile&#39;, &#39;alexa::skills:account_linking&#39;];\r\n    options.scope_data = {\r\n        profile : {essential: false}\r\n    };    \r\n    options.response_type = &#39;code&#39;;\r\n\r\n    const self = this;\r\n    amazon.Login.authorize(options, (response) =&gt; {\r\n      if (!response || !response.code) {\r\n        throw { error: response };\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // ... send the response code to my server \r\n      // ... to be exchanged for bearer and refresh tokens\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I would expect to happen from that is a popup Amazon login process to be spawned which (1) has the user log in to Amazon, and (2) collects the user&#39;s consent to link their Amazon account to my Alexa skill (i.e. linked to my credentialed hosted service), so that we get back (in the browser) an authorization code that we can exchange (on our server) for bearer and refresh tokens to act on behalf of the user.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, that code above immediately fails and never pops up a process. The message that is thrown says: &quot;An unknown scope was requested&quot;. If I remove the &#39;alexa::skills:account_linking&#39; string from the options.scope array, I get to an Amazon login screen, and if I log in to Amazon, my server does get an authorization code, etc. But no Account Linking has taken place, so I&#39;m stuck.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried to reconcile [this documentation][1] (which also talks about including a Skill ID somehow), with [this documentation][2] but I&#39;m just not seeing how to make it work. Can anyone please help point me in the right direction about what I&#39;m doing wrong here?

getting GLFW to work so that I can start on my project.

I have the path of the lib file coming from `C:\\Users\\herrigdy\\Desktop\\Visual Studio 2017\\BB\\Dependencies\\include\\GLFW` and I&#39;m using the `$(SolutionDir)` macro. That&#39;s for the header files. \r\n\r\nThen I have `glfw3.lib` linked in the additional dependencies. Looking at the code nothing is immediately wrong, but it still comes up with this error. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried shortening the path for the header files and have followed the third party library part of the msdn site. \r\n\r\nI have the 32-bit binaries for GLFW and I&#39;m building for x86. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I haven&#39;t tried from this site was that the library may have needed other files, but the video I watched to help me set this up didn&#39;t reference any other third party dependencies for GLFW. \r\n\r\nThey also said that we wouldn&#39;t need the `glfw3.dll` or `glfw3lib.dll` (not entirely sure if those are the exact files off the top of my head).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried copying the evaluated value from the additional dependencies, but it keeps saying that access to said file was disallowed. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m working from my school computer so there may be some sort of block that isn&#39;t allowing visual to read those files. I can provide screenshots of code if needed.\r\n\r\nEdit: Here&#39;s code for reference, should also add that the error list says the error is in line 1 file LINK\r\n\r\n````\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n#include &quot;GLFW/glfw3.h&quot;\r\n\r\nint main(void)\r\n{\r\n\tGLFWwindow* window;\r\n\r\n\t/* Initialize the library */\r\n\tif (!glfwInit())\r\n\t\treturn -1;\r\n\r\n\t/* Create a windowed mode window and its OpenGL context */\r\n\twindow = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, &quot;Hello World&quot;, NULL, NULL);\r\n\tif (!window)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tglfwTerminate();\r\n\t\treturn -1;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t/* Make the window&#39;s context current */\r\n\tglfwMakeContextCurrent(window);\r\n\r\n\t/* Loop until the user closes the window */\r\n\twhile (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t/* Render here */\r\n\t\tglClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\r\n\r\n\t\t/* Swap front and back buffers */\r\n\t\tglfwSwapBuffers(window);\r\n\r\n\t\t/* Poll for and process events */\r\n\t\tglfwPollEvents();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tglfwTerminate();\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n````","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508049/lnk-1104-cannot-open-file-glfw3-lib","title":"LNK 1104 cannot open file &#39;glfw3.lib"},{"tags":["r","join","data.table"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":134352,"user_id":2372064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFfVt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFlick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2372064/mrflick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571759737,"post_id":58508047,"comment_id":103344157,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508047/adding-a-sequence-to-every-row-of-a-column-in-r#comment103344157_58508047"},{"owner":{"reputation":134352,"user_id":2372064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFfVt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFlick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2372064/mrflick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571759766,"post_id":58508047,"comment_id":103344168,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508047/adding-a-sequence-to-every-row-of-a-column-in-r#comment103344168_58508047"},{"owner":{"reputation":13717,"user_id":1989480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eacb7843bd819ab7a34299c21fee0873?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chinsoon12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1989480/chinsoon12"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571781128,"post_id":58508047,"comment_id":103352864,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508047/adding-a-sequence-to-every-row-of-a-column-in-r#comment103352864_58508047"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":9422871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Wietse de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9422871/wietse-de-vries"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25763,"user_id":7128934,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oI2SB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"d.b","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128934/d-b"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571759723,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571759625,"creation_date":1571759550,"last_edit_date":1571759625,"question_id":58508047,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508047","body_markdown":"I have two tables that I would like to combine in a certain way, however I have so far been unable to find a way as to how I should tackle this (I would say relatively easy?) problem.\r\n\r\nThe situation can be simplified as follows:\r\n\r\n    dt1:\r\n    1\r\n    2\r\n    3\r\n    \r\n    dt2:\r\n    A\r\n    B\r\n    C\r\n    D\r\n\r\nMy goal:\r\n\r\n    dt12:\r\n    1 A\r\n    1 B\r\n    1 C\r\n    1 D\r\n    2 A\r\n    2 B\r\n    2 C\r\n    2 D\r\n    3 A\r\n    3 B\r\n    3 C\r\n    3 D\r\n\r\nI tried different things but I am starting to feel like I am overlooking something very basic.

It&#39;s essentially a `try catch finally` block where I dispatch a series of actions. Instead of copying and pasting this pattern everywhere, I&#39;d like to create a wrapper function where all I pass in are the necessary parameters, api function, and dispatch actions.\r\n\r\nMy try call block function looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function getTokenAPI(username, password) {\r\n  return async function action(dispatch) {\r\n    try {\r\n\r\n      dispatch(loadingActions.loadingInProgress(true));\r\n\r\n\r\n      const { data } = await API.authGetToken(username, password);\r\n      const { success } = data;\r\n\r\n      console.log(&#39;get token api data&#39;, data);\r\n      if (success) {\r\n\r\n\r\n        dispatch(setData(data));\r\n\r\n        dispatch(setTokenSuccess());\r\n      } else if (!success) {\r\n        const { errorMessage } = data;\r\n        throw Error(errorMessage || &#39;You broke it, not my fault&#39;);\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (e) {\r\n      dispatch(errorActions.addError(e.message));\r\n      dispatch(errorActions.removeError());\r\n    } finally {\r\n      dispatch(loadingActions.loadingInProgress(false));\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the wrapper I tried to create looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction wrapper(apiFunction, dispatchAction) {\r\n  return async function action(dispatch) {\r\n    try {\r\n      dispatch(loadingActions.loadingInProgress(true));\r\n      const { data } = await apiFunction(arg1, arg2);\r\n      const { success } = data;\r\n      if (success) {\r\n        dispatch(dispatchAction(data));\r\n      } else if (!success) {\r\n        const { errorMessage } = data;\r\n        throw Error(errorMessage || &#39;meh&#39;);\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (e) {\r\n      dispatch(errorActions.addError(e.message));\r\n      dispatch(errorActions.removeError());\r\n    } finally {\r\n      dispatch(loadingActions.loadingInProgress(false));\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that I can eventually just run\r\n```\r\nwrapper(apiFunction(username, password), setData)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I&#39;m getting a `TypeError Cannot read property type of undefined`. I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m going about this the right way at all. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions or recommendations?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508013/having-trouble-creating-a-wrapper-function-for-api-calls","title":"Having trouble creating a wrapper function for api calls"},{"tags":["c#","signalr","sqldependency"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":611,"user_id":6263514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1eb773f7db0e32093667e1479b360694?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6263514/frank-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571777044,"post_id":58508009,"comment_id":103351523,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508009/tracking-updated-list-from-database-without-sqldependency#comment103351523_58508009"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12060532,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e27b7c4cdfd36ec92fcb7b312e5a0d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12060532/stephen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571773459,"creation_date":1571759374,"last_edit_date":1571773459,"question_id":58508009,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508009","body_markdown":"In my current internship, I am not allowed to change up some of the stored procedures enough to match the limitations of SQLDependency.

displayed. However, I need some of the functionality in a `PHP` variable or I want to to be able to use the `JSON` data inside my `Blade` functions. \r\n\r\nI have tried to return an array from my `searchCategories()` function like so:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function searchCategories(Request $request) {\r\n\t$results = (new Search())\r\n\t\t-&gt;registerModel(Category::class, [&#39;title&#39;])\r\n\t\t-&gt;search($request-&gt;input(&#39;query&#39;));\r\n\r\n\t$res = response()-&gt;json($results);\r\n\r\n\treturn array($results, $res);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I have no idea how to retrieve the `JSON` data now.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n-------\r\nI would like to be able to use both the `PHP` variable and the `JSON` data that my function returns. \r\n\r\nExample of the usage I have in mind: \r\nFor instance, there&#39;s a background image inside my results, like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;course-image&quot; style=&quot;background: url({{asset(&#39;./img/categories/ . $res-&gt;image_name&#39;)}});&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can ( as far as i know ) only be achieved by having access to the `PHP` variable besides the `JSON` data. Or being able to use this `JSON` data inside my `blade` `asset()` function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508007/retrieving-both-json-and-php-values-from-a-function","title":"Retrieving both JSON and PHP values from a function"},{"tags":["visual-studio-code","arduino","azure-iot-sdk","iot-devkit","mxchip"],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":2286179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83b98d01254b6c521214ce83a42c71e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"James Whittred","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2286179/james-whittred"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571759354,"creation_date":1571759354,"question_id":58508003,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508003","body_markdown":"I am trying to debug a device (MXChip) solution but I am unable to view the LogTrace and LogInfo messages in the VS Code IDE.

code seems to much complicated.\r\nI understand that you get one random number and you allow the user to guess it three times. Then if it is wrong, the user may quit or start a new game with a new random number and three more tries\r\n\r\nCheck the following code. I explain the most of the blocks below the code.\r\n\r\n     public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Enter a nickname&quot;);\r\n        String name = s.nextLine();\r\n\r\n        while(true) {\r\n            int tries=0;\r\n            int randomNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 15)+1; \r\n            while (tries &lt; 3) {\r\n\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Enter a number between 1 and 15&quot;);\r\n                int number = Integer.parseInt(s.nextLine());\r\n                if (randomNumber == number) {\r\n                    System.out.println(&quot;You win! &quot; + name);\r\n                    break;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    System.out.println(&quot;You lose &quot; + name);\r\n                }\r\n                tries++;\r\n            }\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;The number is:&quot; + randomNumber);\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;To quit the program enter q &quot;);\r\n            String quit = s.nextLine();\r\n            if (&quot;q&quot;.equals(quit)) {\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nGenerally, you can use one Scanner to read every user&#39;s input. As the nextInt reads until the next token, its better to read a line at once. Instead of nextInt() do a nextLine() and parse the String to int -&gt; `int number = Integer.parseInt(s.nextLine());`\r\n\r\nI cannot understand the use of an array, in my example I use the tries integer that is increased every time a guess is made. While loop runs until the tries is equal to 3, so the user has done tries 0,1,2 (3 tries).\r\n\r\nThe outer loop `while(true)` runs the game forever, until the user input is &#39;q&#39; where that loop breaks and the game ends.\r\n\r\nInside the game&#39;s while loop, a randomNumber is taken from Math.random() and the user&#39;s input is validated in the if else for that specific input. Note that if you want to get a random number between 1-15 you should use `int randomNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 15)+1;` as the Math.random() * 15 returns a random number between 0-14. \r\n\r\nYou dont want the game to ask for a next guess if the correct number is guessed, so add a `break;` after the &#39;You win&#39; System.out. That way the inner loop is ended and the user is asked to quit or not.\r\n\r\nIf the tries is increased to 3, the game prints the correct number and asks the user to enter q to quit the program. You read the line and if \r\n`&quot;q&quot;.equals(quit)` you break the outer loop and quit. If the user press any other text the outer loop continues, tries is set to 0, a new random number is taken and so on.\r\n\r\nUpdated: Code changed to support 3 guesses in one single random number and quit message after the 3 guesses are done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nOutput with 3 wrong guesses:\r\n\r\n    Enter a nickname\r\n    joe\r\n    Enter a number between 1 and 15\r\n    2\r\n    You lose joe\r\n    Enter a number between 1 and 15\r\n    3\r\n    You lose joe\r\n    Enter a number between 1 and 15\r\n    4\r\n    You lose joe\r\n    The number is:12\r\n    To quit the program enter q \r\n    q\r\n\r\nOutput with a correct guess:\r\n\r\n    Enter a nickname\r\n    Joe\r\n    Enter a number between 1 and 15\r\n    1\r\n    You lose Joe\r\n    Enter a number between 1 and 15\r\n    2\r\n    You win! Joe\r\n    The number is:2\r\n    To quit the program enter q ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508000/if-else-statement-is-not-working-properly/58508448#58508448","title":"If else statement is not working properly"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1394,"user_id":10819573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NTSf7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arvind Kumar Avinash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10819573/arvind-kumar-avinash"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1394,"user_id":10819573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NTSf7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arvind Kumar Avinash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10819573/arvind-kumar-avinash"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571774391,"last_edit_date":1571774391,"creation_date":1571761580,"answer_id":58508589,"question_id":58508000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58508589","body_markdown":"You have mentioned the size of your array as `1` and therefore I suggest you do not use an array; use a non-array variable instead.

answer is very simple. Your OIDC provider configuration is missing the thumbprint. It is essential for Iam to work correctly. \r\nNormally if you create OIDC provider in AWS console that thumbprint gets populated automatically, however it is not the case when you do it through terraform.\r\n\r\nI have been caught by this as well so I have written a blog about this that you can find here: https://medium.com/@marcincuber/amazon-eks-with-oidc-provider-iam-roles-for-kubernetes-services-accounts-59015d15cb0c\r\n\r\n\r\nTo solve your issue simply add the following:\r\n\r\n9E99A48A9960B14926BB7F3B02E22DA2B0AB7280\r\n\r\nThe above is the hashed root CA that doesn’t change for another 10+ years and it is the same across all regions. How to acquire it, you can read the blog I added link to above.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ensure to use the latest autoscaler version which is matching the version of your kubernetes. Also, try adding security context with fsGroup: 65534. That is the current workaround to make the OIDC work properly for some apps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507993/eks-iam-roles-for-services-account-not-working/58519269#58519269","title":"eks iam roles for services account not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":1214,"user_id":6588456,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FIX2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"night-gold","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6588456/night-gold"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58519269,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571852244,"creation_date":1571759328,"question_id":58507993,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507993","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying my hand on iam roles for services account to secure the autoscaller.

This part is basic, no issue there.\r\n\r\nI also activated the openid provider in terraform:\r\n\r\n    resource &quot;aws_iam_openid_connect_provider&quot; &quot;example&quot; {\r\n      client_id_list  = [&quot;sts.amazonaws.com&quot;]\r\n      thumbprint_list = []\r\n      url             = aws_eks_cluster.eks.identity.0.oidc.0.issuer\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNo issue the cluster is creating itself with no issue.\r\n\r\nNo I added the annotation to service account for the autoscalling:\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    apiVersion: v1\r\n    kind: ServiceAccount\r\n    metadata:\r\n      annotations:\r\n        eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::ID:role/terraform-eks-autoscaller\r\n      labels:\r\n        k8s-addon: cluster-autoscaler.addons.k8s.io\r\n        k8s-app: cluster-autoscaler\r\n      name: cluster-autoscaler\r\n      namespace: kube-system\r\n\r\nMy problem is that it does not seems to works and the pod is still trying to use the new IAM role but still using the node role:\r\n\r\n    Failed to create AWS Manager: cannot autodiscover ASGs: AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::ID:assumed-role/terraform-eks-node/i-ID is not authorized to perform: autoscaling:DescribeTags\r\n\r\nDoes someone know what step I&#39;m missing here?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-service-accounts/\r\n  [2]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507993/eks-iam-roles-for-services-account-not-working","title":"eks iam roles for services account not working"},{"tags":["asp.net-core","serilog"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":10803696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fa1039cbd7b27ea2b26a4e69990218d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jade","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10803696/jade"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571761185,"post_id":58508285,"comment_id":103344864,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507991/why-cant-i-see-my-console-logs-from-serilog/58508285#comment103344864_58508285"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7504,"user_id":211672,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ylsqi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Caio Proiete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/211672/caio-proiete"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571760372,"creation_date":1571760372,"answer_id":58508285,"question_id":58507991,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58508285","body_markdown":"The [documentation of the Serilog.Console sink][1] (screenshot below) has all the settings you need to configure.\r\n\r\nIt also looks like you are confusing Console output with Debug output.

Should a user&#39;s access need to be revoked at a point where the `exp` claim in his token not already be expired, the administrator would then add his JWT to a cache.  This also means that part of the authorization and/or authentication process now would involve hitting this blacklist cache, to make sure that any incoming JWT has not already been revoked.  However, if you structure things well, the penalty for hitting the cache would be small (about 1/100 the penalty for hitting a database).\r\n\r\nThis blacklist cache can also be used to store the JWT of users who have signed out with valid tokens still extant.  Again, this is a scenario where a user has logically signed out, but the `exp` claim in his token still says the JWT is alive.  Adding the JWT to the same blacklist cache is one way of also handling this use case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507986/automatic-token-invalidation/58508046#58508046","title":"Automatic Token Invalidation"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7932506,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b6ccadcb0647ef84e4ea4dbc38092b85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gayathiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7932506/gayathiri"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571759549,"creation_date":1571759292,"question_id":58507986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507986","body_markdown":"I have a scenario where a user&#39;s role is authorized using the JWT claims. \r\nHowever, how to invalidate the JWT token when the user&#39;s role is revoked by an administrator\r\nand prompt the user to login again?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507986/automatic-token-invalidation","title":"Automatic Token Invalidation"},{"tags":["google-sheets","google-api","google-oauth2"],"owner":{"reputation":107,"user_id":1505832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQFTV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"laloune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1505832/laloune"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571759288,"creation_date":1571759288,"question_id":58507984,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507984","body_markdown":"I set up a oAuth Client ID and authorized it for my google sheets :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6cYBS.png\r\n  \r\nThis works like a charm, but the client Id has access to all of my worksheets (the ones where the share options are set to &quot;anyone with the link can edit&quot;)\r\n\r\nIs this possible to restrict with the option &quot;Specific people&quot; and add the client id there ?

If I understand the Java Memory Model correctly, there is no guarantee that if one thread initializes the switch table (through a call to `get()`), a second thread sees an up to date switch table value. Instead it might see a stale value which does not have the correct elements.\r\n\r\nFollowup question: Since there are no _happens-before_  relations, would a JVM also be allowed to reorder the assignment to the `$SWITCH_TABLE$` in front of the element changes? If this was possible there could be race conditions where one thread sees the array while the other thread is still modifying the elements.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507978/is-eclipses-switch-table-thread-safe","title":"Is Eclipse&#39;s $SWITCH_TABLE$ thread-safe?"},{"tags":["postgresql","function","stored-procedures","postgresql-11"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2909,"user_id":895640,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88d07e00078ce8f667f192a46c25b08c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeremy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/895640/jeremy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571759575,"post_id":58507979,"comment_id":103344064,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507979/how-to-get-result-set-from-postgresql-stored-procedure#comment103344064_58507979"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":5332736,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/421378361380307/picture?type=large","display_name":"Nafees Sardar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5332736/nafees-sardar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2909,"user_id":895640,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88d07e00078ce8f667f192a46c25b08c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeremy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/895640/jeremy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571759822,"post_id":58507979,"comment_id":103344196,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507979/how-to-get-result-set-from-postgresql-stored-procedure#comment103344196_58507979"},{"owner":{"reputation":1100,"user_id":12022565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c2c8a3b0ce2375f236807e8cf806043?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Islingre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12022565/islingre"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571774329,"post_id":58507979,"comment_id":103350408,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507979/how-to-get-result-set-from-postgresql-stored-procedure#comment103350408_58507979"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":385730,"user_id":939860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7cecf2bd835cf5670d271d0d104f51?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Erwin Brandstetter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/939860/erwin-brandstetter"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571789440,"creation_date":1571789440,"answer_id":58513796,"question_id":58507979,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513796","body_markdown":"As of Postgres 12 it&#39;s not possible to return anything directly from a [**procedure**][1].\r\n\r\nMost likely, you fell for the widespread misnomer &quot;stored procedure&quot; and really want a [**`function`**][2] instead, which can return a value, a row or a set according to its declaration.\r\n\r\n- [In PostgreSQL, what is the difference between a “Stored Procedure” and other types of functions?][3]\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7945932/how-to-return-result-of-a-select-inside-a-function-in-postgresql/7945958#7945958\r\n\r\nWould work like this:\r\n\r\n    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.testSpCrud(\r\n        fnam text,\r\n        lnam text,\r\n        id integer,\r\n        condition integer)\r\n      RETURNS SETOF Employee LANGUAGE plpgsql AS\r\n    $func$\r\n    BEGIN\r\n       CASE condition\r\n       WHEN 1 THEN\r\n          INSERT INTO public.employee(\r\n           employeeid, lname, fname, securitylevel, employeepassword, hphonearea, hphone, cphonearea, cphone, street, city, state, zipcode, extzip, name, email, groomerid, type, commission, inactive, carrierid, notoallemployees, languageid, isdogwalker, ispetsitter, ismobilegroomer, ssma_timestamp)\r\n           VALUES (4,  &#39;Test&#39;, &#39;Test&#39;, 2, 2, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,32, 32, 32, 22, 22, 2, 2, 2, false, 223,true, 223, true, true, true, &#39;2019-08-27&#39;);\r\n    \r\n       WHEN 2 THEN\r\n          DELETE FROM Employee WHERE employeeid=id;\r\n    \r\n       WHEN 3 THEN\r\n          UPDATE Employee SET fname=&#39;Test&#39; WHERE employeeid=id;\r\n    \r\n       WHEN 4 THEN\r\n          RETURN QUERY\r\n          SELECT * FROM Employee;\r\n    \r\n       ELSE\r\n          RAISE EXCEPTION &#39;Unexpected condition value %!&#39;, condition;\r\n       END CASE;\r\n    END\r\n    $func$;\r\n\r\nSimplified with a [`CASE`][4] construct while being at it, and added an `ELSE` clause.

I&#39;m admittedly not well-versed with K8S, but a colleague of mine had started to use it in AWS so I&#39;ve been piggybacking on some of the work he&#39;s done. He&#39;s been able to answer most of my questions, but this one seems to have us a little stumped.\r\n\r\nIn our bare-metal setup, there are about 20k unique sites with individual SSL certificates. In doing a small scale test with a few sites and certs, it works. However, at full scale, it does not.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was able to script importing the certificates into K8S and create a voyager ingress configuration yaml file from it, but when I try to apply it, I get the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash-5.0# kubectl apply -f generated-ingress.yaml\r\nThe Ingress &quot;generated-ingress&quot; is invalid: metadata.annotations: Too long: must have at most 262144 characters\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the ingress configuration is too large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generated ingress looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\napiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1\r\nkind: Ingress\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: generated-ingress\r\n  namespace: default\r\nspec:\r\n  tls:\r\n    - secretName: ssl-cert-eample-domain.com\r\n      hosts:\r\n        - example-domain.com\r\n    # Repeated for each domain using SSL\r\n  rules:\r\n    - host: &#39;*&#39;\r\n      http:\r\n        paths:\r\n        - backend:\r\n            serviceName: the-backend\r\n            servicePort: &#39;80&#39;\r\n    - host: example-domain.com\r\n      http:\r\n        paths:\r\n        - backend:\r\n            serviceName: the-backend\r\n            servicePort: &#39;80&#39;\r\n            headerRules:\r\n            - X-HTTPS YES \r\n    # Repeated for each domain using SSL\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI the `X-HTTPS` header is needed for our backend to generate absolute urls correctly using `https` instead of `http`. It would be nice if this could be specified for all SSL connections instead of having to specify it for each individual domain, making the configuration more lean.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case, is there a way to increase the limit for the configuration? Or is there a better way to configure the ingress for numerous SSL certificates?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507952/a-workaround-this-kubernetes-error-the-ingress-generated-ingress-is-invalid","title":"A workaround this kubernetes error: The

pivoted a Spark dataframe, which works correctly for all columns except one, even though they&#39;re all almost exactly the same.\r\n\r\nI have a dataframe which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-------+------------+---------+\r\n|     id|       cf_id|    value|\r\n+-------+------------+---------+\r\n|3688634|300016666252|telephone|\r\n|3688634|300019829932|

values, but in this example only two)\r\n\r\nwhen I run:  \r\n\r\n    df.groupBy(&quot;id&quot;).pivot(&quot;cf_id&quot;).agg(first(&quot;value&quot;)).show\r\n\r\nI&#39;d expect to see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-------+------------+------------+\r\n|     id|300016666252|300019829932|\r\n+-------+------------+------------+\r\n|3634121|       email|       false|\r\n|3634192|       email|

false|\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll columns work correctly except the final one displayed here (300019829932), which converts all values to null.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve extracted the single problem column as a separate dataframe and ran the pivot function on it, which transforms all the values to null.  \r\nI ran the same function on another column, which works as expected.  \r\nBoth columns have a single string for the data, and their names are strings of 12 digits (which are aliased later).  \r\nI presume it can&#39;t be due to the whole column name being digits as it works for all except one.\r\nI&#39;ve also tried collect_set as the pivot aggregate function, which returns an empty set.\r\n\r\nSpark version 2.2.0.2.6.4.0-91  \r\nScala version 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_77)\r\n\r\n\r\nAm I missing something here? The titles &amp; values are very similar across columns, and the functions applied to them are exactly the same, yet the column always returns null values.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507951/pivot-on-spark-dataframe-returns-unexpected-nulls-on-only-one-of-several-columns","title":"Pivot on Spark dataframe returns unexpected nulls on only one of several columns"},{"tags":["c#","authentication","asp.net-core","asp.net-core-2.0","windows-authentication"],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":5935314,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7xEwst872qs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACT4/WRcXz94FhnI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Elia Zoffoli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5935314/elia-zoffoli"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571759158,"creation_date":1571759158,"question_id":58507947,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507947","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to make a .net core web api application with authentication.\r\nI need to implement windows authentication, cookie authentication, ldap active directory authentication and jwt bearer authentication.\r\nEvery authentication work fine alone but if I try to enable all together s it does&#39;t work as I expect.\r\nTo make work windows authentication I&#39;ve write a custom  ```ForwardDefaultSelector``` as follows:\r\n ```\r\nservices.AddAuthentication(optons =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                optons.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                optons.DefaultSignOutScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                optons.DefaultForbidScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                optons.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                optons.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = &quot;smart&quot;;\r\n                optons.DefaultChallengeScheme = &quot;smart&quot;;\r\n                optons.DefaultScheme = &quot;smart&quot;;\r\n                //optons.AddScheme(&quot;Windows&quot;, config =&gt; config.HandlerType = IISDefaults.)\r\n            })\r\n            .AddPolicyScheme(&quot;smart&quot;, &quot;&quot;, options =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                options.ForwardDefaultSelector = context =&gt;\r\n                {\r\n                    var authHeader = context.Request.Headers[HeaderNames.Authorization].FirstOrDefault();\r\n                    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(authHeader))\r\n                    {\r\n                        if (authHeader.StartsWith(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme) == true)\r\n                            return JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                        else if (authHeader.StartsWith(IISDefaults.Negotiate) == true || authHeader.StartsWith(IISDefaults.Ntlm) == true)\r\n                            return IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n\r\n                    }\r\n                    else\r\n                    {\r\n                        if (context.Request.Cookies.ContainsKey(string.IsNullOrEmpty(Configuration[&quot;ApplicationName&quot;]) ?

have a react form (.tsx) that i am making that pre-loads all of a user&#39;s account information and then allows them to make edits. i am using a functional component with hooks to handle state. i have a couple elements that will be conditionally rendered based on whether the form has been altered. overall, the isAltered method gets called three times per render. it seems it would be more efficient to calculate and hold the value once per render.  my question is - where, when, and how is the best way to calculate and store this value? \r\n\r\nthe code that checks for changes: \r\n```\r\n  const isAltered = () =&gt; {\r\n    const formValues = Object.keys(values).filter(k =&gt; k !== &#39;passwordConfirm&#39;);\r\n\r\n    let i;\r\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; formValues.length; i++) {\r\n      let key = formValues[i];\r\n      if (values[key] !== user[key]) {\r\n        return true;\r\n      } else {\r\n        continue;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe react elements: \r\n``` \r\n&lt;Button\r\n  disabled={!isAltered()}\r\n  className={classes.button}\r\n  type=&quot;submit&quot;\r\n/&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div className={`${isAltered()

let altered = false;\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    altered = isAltered();\r\n  }, [formValues]);\r\n```\r\nthis doesn&#39;t work because the &quot;altered&quot; variable loses its value between renders and therefore isn&#39;t useful. so i tried storing &quot;altered&quot; in useRef as follows :\r\n\r\n```\r\n  let altered = React.useRef(false);\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    altered = isAltered();\r\n  }, [values]);\r\n```\r\nbut now &quot;altered&quot; inside of useEffect returns me this error: \r\n&gt;Type &#39;boolean&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;MutableRefObject&lt;boolean&gt;&#39;.&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507932/how-where-and-when-to-best-calculate-a-value-to-conditionally-render-react-ele","title":"how,

`selectionMode=&quot;multiple&quot;` ,code has some more complexy),you can edit code for focus on every element in datatable. if your elements have `RowIndex`, pass it true in invoke function(dierection of table maybe effect on code!).

so before I ask my question or post any code i&#39;m going to explain what i&#39;m trying to do.\r\n\r\nI am using windows 10 and XAMPP. I am trying to create a register form which is mostly made of HTML and PHP however I have decided that it makes more sense to make the browser check if the password chosen by the user and it&#39;s confirmation match before even submitting it to the server rather than doing the same with PHP on backend.\r\n\r\nfor this purpose I have decided to use a simple JS code. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am trying to bind the text written in the password field and confirmation field to two variables and then use if to check if they match however even when I intentionally type wrong confirmation, the form submits.\r\n\r\nI tried using google chrome console to find out why.  turns out that the variable I am using for password and confirmation are always equal to &quot;&quot; and since &quot;&quot; = &quot;&quot; the form always submits.\r\n\r\nwhen I type in the console &quot;btn&quot; it shows me the correct HTML element which means that DOM was loaded before JS so that can&#39;t be the problem also I have written my js codes after the HTML form.\r\n\r\nalso I have noticed that in the console when I type &quot; password.value&quot; it always shows correctly what I have written in the field. \r\n\r\nis it because I am writing all this in a php file? if so how can I mix JS and PHP to prevent this problem. I will post the form and the js code here.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I undertand that my question is a bit vague so I need this edit, I know that I am not stopping the script so the form submits anyways BUT I must get the alert because I intentionally make so that password and confirm don&#39;t match!\r\n \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language:

When I click tab B, it will show B page which contains a floating action button. When floating action button is clicked, it will call `add_B.dart`. My problem is when I click the back button in `add_B.dart`, it will back to `main_activity` and open tab C page. How can I make it open tab B page instead?\r\n\r\n**add_B.dart**\r\n\r\n    onWillPop: (){\r\n            _backToPreviousPage(context);\r\n          },\r\n    \r\n     void _backToPreviousPage(BuildContext context) {\r\n        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed(MainPage.ROUTE);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507903/remember-the-state-of-bottomnavigation-bar-when-back-to-a-page-flutter","title":"Remember the state of bottomNavigation bar when back to a page flutter"},{"tags":["javascript","d3.js","histogram","data-visualization"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":9409317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8d3bd88acb49e699db6cd8392d86a94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"6lackrules","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9409317/6lackrules"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571843890,"post_id":58513862,"comment_id":103376782,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507902/histogram-with-ordinal-data/58513862#comment103376782_58513862"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76227,"user_id":5768908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjGM7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gerardo Furtado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768908/gerardo-furtado"},"last_editor":{"reputation":76227,"user_id":5768908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjGM7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gerardo Furtado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768908/gerardo-furtado"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571821945,"last_edit_date":1571821945,"creation_date":1571790022,"answer_id":58513862,"question_id":58507902,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513862","body_markdown":"**TL;DR**: A histogram shows the distribution of a continuous variable, while a bar chart compares categorical/ordinal variables.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nUnfortunately a *&quot;histogram with ordinal data&quot;* is, by definition, impossible. What you want is a **bar chart** instead. Quoting the [Wikipedia article][1] about histogram,\r\n\r\n&gt; A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a **continuous variable** and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis on **continuous variable** is mine. \r\n\r\nIf you look at `d3.histogram` [source code][2] (now renamed as `d3.bin`), you&#39;ll see that it expect numerical values:\r\n\r\n    // Assign data to bins by value, ignoring any outside the domain.\r\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\r\n      x = values[i];\r\n      if (x0 &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= x1) {\r\n        bins[bisect(tz, x, 0, m)].push(data[i]);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHave a look at `x0 &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= x1` specifically.\r\n\r\nI can see that you wrote *&quot;I don&#39;t want to use bar chart, the whole reason of this experiment is to learn how to use d3 histogram&quot;*. In that case, chose the **correct data**, that is, a dataset with a continuous variable instead.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Solution for a bar chart:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nAll that being said, ditch that histogram generator and create a good old bar chart. For that to work, all you&#39;ll need is manipulating tour data. For instance, let&#39;s use [`Array.prototype.reduce`][3] to create an array of objects, with `colour` and `count`.\r\n\r\nSuppose this data array:\r\n\r\n    const colors = [&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;green&#39;];\r\n\r\nWe can manipulate it like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const colors = [\r\n      &#39;red&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;blue&#39;,\r\n      &#39;red&#39;,\r\n      &#39;red&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;yellow&#39;,\r\n      &#39;pink&#39;,\r\n      &#39;red&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;yellow&#39;,\r\n      &#39;pink&#39;,\r\n      &#39;pink&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;blue&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;blue&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;,\r\n      &#39;green&#39;\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    const data = colors.reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; {\r\n      const foundObject = acc.find(e =&gt; e.colour === curr);\r\n      if (foundObject) ++foundObject.count;\r\n      else acc.push({\r\n        colour: curr,\r\n        count: 1\r\n      });\r\n      return acc;\r\n    }, []);\r\n\r\n    console.log(data)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nNow you can use this data array to create your bar chart, with `colours` as the categorical variable in the `x` axis, and `count` as the quantitative variable in the `y` axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/ce9507c360c3a016eb3f015ff2bc68909674c381/src/bin.js#L53\r\n  [3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507902/histogram-with-ordinal-data/58513862#58513862","title":"Histogram with ordinal data"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":9409317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8d3bd88acb49e699db6cd8392d86a94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"6lackrules","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9409317/6lackrules"},"last_editor":{"reputation":146,"user_id":9974904,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d183b6c27e1754f42d2457dc787580e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Umbro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9974904/umbro"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571828017,"creation_date":1571759012,"last_edit_date":1571828017,"question_id":58507902,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507902","body_markdown":"I have dataset with colors and I want to show how many entries of each color I have in current dataset.\r\n\r\nAfter formatting my dataset it is an array of string \r\n\r\n**js**\r\n\r\n    const colors = [\r\n        &#39;red&#39;,\r\n        &#39;green&#39;,\r\n        &#39;blue&#39;,\r\n        &#39;red&#39;,\r\n        &#39;red&#39;,\r\n        &#39;green&#39;\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nI want to make a scale that I can feed into histogram layout.

The result is `x =&gt; (Convert(Convert(x).Material) == 1)` instead of `x =&gt; (Convert(x).Material == 1)`\r\n\r\nI created sample code to reproduce the problem. It has two objects - `House` and `Apartment`. They *implements* `IAddItem`. Interface `IAddItem` contains only one field, the *enumeration* `Material`. `Material` has two members `Bricks` and `Woods`.  `Building` class has one generic method `MaterialBuilding&lt;T&gt;`, which can receive `House` or`Apartment` or any other object that is implemented with `IAddItem`. And when the expression is created the result is `x =&gt; (Convert(Convert(x).Material) == 1)`\r\n\r\nWhy there are two converts instead of one, why is this happening? \r\nAnd is there any way to get around it?\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Linq.Expressions;\r\n\r\nnamespace Buildings\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            HouseObject ho = new HouseObject();\r\n            ho.color = &quot;red&quot;;\r\n            ho.Material = Material.Woods;\r\n            Building.MaterialBuilding(ho);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n   \r\n    public class Building\r\n    {\r\n        public static void MaterialBuilding&lt;T&gt;(T building) where T : IAddItem\r\n        {\r\n            Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt;

As it happens you often want to organize your data. In this case I would like to have the ability to move a range of cells up or down the list. (No data is being deleted, just shifting the range up or down) I am simply trying to cut and paste the data up or down one row at a time. I have an Up Arrow and Down Arrow for users to click on to activate the macro, one for up and one for down.\r\n\r\nI have successfully written the macro code to make this happen, however it uses the select command and is very slow. I have used the same code before on another project and it was much faster, almost instant, the only difference that I can think of is that I was selecting the the ENTIRE row. In this particular instance I am only wanting to move the data in Columns B thru N. Columns O thru Y have fixed inputs and cannot be moved.\r\n\r\nBelow is the working code to move the range up.\r\n\r\n    Sub MoveUp()\r\n    Application.ScreenUpdating = False\r\n    ActiveSheet.Unprotect &#39;Unprotects The Sheet\r\n        If Not Intersect(ActiveCell, Range(&quot;B12:F98&quot;)) Is Nothing Then &#39;Makes sure you are within the correct range, cannot move top row up\r\n            \r\n        Range(&quot;B&quot; &amp; ActiveCell.Row &amp; &quot;:&quot; &amp; &quot;N&quot; &amp; ActiveCell.Row).Select &#39;Selects only area you want to move\r\n        Selection.Rows(Selection.Rows.Count + 1).Insert Shift:=xlDown\r\n        Selection.Rows(1).Offset(-1).Cut Selection.Rows(Selection.Rows.Count + 1)\r\n        Selection.Rows(1).Offset(-1).Delete Shift:=xlUp\r\n        Selection.Offset(-1).Select &#39;This keeps the cell you moved selected so you can keep moving it without having to reselect\r\n        \r\n        Else\r\n            MsgBox &quot;You Can&#39;t Move That Row Up&quot;\r\n        End If\r\n        \r\n        Call ResetRanges &#39;Resets the named ranges\r\n        Call ProtectWorkSheet &#39;Protects The Sheet\r\n    Application.ScreenUpdating = True\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nI wrote an alternative macro **without using select**, trying to use defined ranges and use offsets to make the shift happen, but it was still just as slow as the above code.

This is what the screen looks like:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever any of the buttons are pressed, every button on the screen redraws.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThis is the code that I&#39;m using:\r\n\r\n      @override\r\n      Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n        return Scaffold(\r\n          appBar: AppBar(\r\n            title: Text(&#39;Button Testing&#39;),\r\n          ),\r\n          body: Center(\r\n            child: Padding(\r\n              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),\r\n              child: Column(\r\n                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\r\n                crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,\r\n                children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                  Text(\r\n                    buttonPressed,\r\n                    textAlign: TextAlign.center,\r\n                  ),\r\n                  SizedBox(\r\n                    height: 10.0,\r\n                  ),\r\n                  RaisedButton(\r\n                    child: Text(&#39;Button One&#39;),\r\n                    onPressed: () {\r\n                      setState(() {\r\n                        buttonPressed = &#39;Button One Was Pressed&#39;;\r\n                      });\r\n                    },\r\n                  ),\r\n                  RaisedButton(\r\n                    child: Text(&#39;Button Two&#39;),\r\n                    onPressed: () {\r\n                      setState(() {\r\n                        buttonPressed = &#39;Button Two Was Pressed&#39;;\r\n                      });\r\n                    },\r\n                  ),\r\n                  RaisedButton(\r\n                    child: Text(&#39;Button Three&#39;),\r\n                    onPressed: () {\r\n                      setState(() {\r\n                        buttonPressed = &#39;Button Three Was Pressed&#39;;\r\n                      });\r\n                    },\r\n                  ),\r\n                  RaisedButton(\r\n                    child: Text(&#39;Button Four&#39;),\r\n                    onPressed: () {\r\n                      setState(() {\r\n                        buttonPressed = &#39;Button Four Was Pressed&#39;;\r\n                      });\r\n                    },\r\n                  ),\r\n                ],\r\n              ),\r\n            ),\r\n          ),\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried breaking the button area out into a separate widget and nothing I&#39;ve done matters.  My question is, is there something else that I should be doing?  Is this expected and acceptable behavior?  Does it even matter that everything is redrawing whenever any buttons are tapped?  I thought that in Flutter, only the things that needed to be redrawn were redrawn.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/v6Ipg.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptDxK.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507845/flutter-click-one-raisedbutton-and-all-raisedbuttons-update","title":"Flutter - click one RaisedButton and all RaisedButtons update"},{"tags":["php","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20516,"user_id":3603681,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aeBV3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RamRaider","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3603681/ramraider"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571758927,"post_id":58507844,"comment_id":103343678,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507844/how-to-pass-an-html-code-from-embedded-php-to-html#comment103343678_58507844"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":65,"user_id":8923974,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1502810126499352/picture?type=large","display_name":"Victor Jacobsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8923974/victor-jacobsen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":65,"user_id":8923974,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1502810126499352/picture?type=large","display_name":"Victor Jacobsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8923974/victor-jacobsen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571760962,"last_edit_date":1571760962,"creation_date":1571760527,"answer_id":58508316,"question_id":58507844,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58508316","body_markdown":"Use quotation marks correctly:\r\n\r\n    echo &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39;. action(&quot;Controller@ins&quot;) .&#39;&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Insert&lt;/a&gt;&#39;;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507844/how-to-pass-an-html-code-from-embedded-php-to-html/58508316#58508316","title":"How to pass an html code from embedded php to html?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8663274,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01a1954944929a76d076353347a5a29c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ken Graham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8663274/ken-graham"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8663274,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01a1954944929a76d076353347a5a29c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ken Graham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8663274/ken-graham"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571790630,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571760962,"creation_date":1571758796,"last_edit_date":1571759071,"question_id":58507844,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507844","body_markdown":"I want an html hyperlink to appear under a specific php condition.
