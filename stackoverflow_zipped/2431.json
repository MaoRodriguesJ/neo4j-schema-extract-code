Any other client CL would have problems (e.g. cl=local_quorum of 4 is 3, allowing only a single node to be down).\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume the RF=1 or 2. If CL=ONE or LOCAL_ONE, the application would be unaffected by queries that only manipulate data on the available nodes. However, any access to rows that only exist on the unavailable nodes would be impacted. In other words, CL=ONE or LOCAL_ONE only works if you&#39;re manipulating data that has at least one node available to return the response (You only need ONE to respond in this scenario). If the rows you&#39;re querying are on both of the unavailable nodes, you&#39;ll get an error stating something like: Expected response of 1, received 0.\r\n\r\nMany applications configure CL to be some sort of quorum (local or not) - so in that case, the application would certainly fail unless you had RF=5 (so at least 5 nodes).

x in range(sku.max_row):\r\n\r\n    duplicate_count = 0\r\n\r\n    for i in range(x):\r\n        if sku.cell(row =i + 2, column = 1).value == sku.cell(row = x + 2, column = 1).value:\r\n            duplicate_count = duplicate_column[i] + 1\r\n            sku.cell(row =i+2, column = 1).value = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this portion, you are rechecking the same values over and over. Assuming these should be unique totally, which is how I think your code is written, then you should instead implement a cache of a hashed type (dict or set) to do these subsequent lookups instead of doing the lookup via `sku.cell` every time.\r\n\r\nSo it would be something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nxl_cache = {}\r\nduplicate_count = {}\r\ndelete_set = set()\r\nfor x in range(sku.max_row):\r\n    x_val = sku.cell(row = x, column = 1).value\r\n    if x_val in xl_cache:   # then this is not first time\r\n        xl_cache[x_val][1] += 1   # increase duplicate count\r\n        delete_set.add(x)\r\n    else:\r\n        xl_cache[x_val] = x   # key is value for duplicate cache, value is row number\r\n        duplicate_count[x] = 0   # key is row number, value is duplicate count\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo now you have a dictionary of originals with duplicate counts, you need to go back and delete your rows that you don&#39;t want plus change the duplicate counts in the sheet. So go backwards through the range and delete the row or update the duplicate count. You can do this by going to your max first and reducing by 1, check for delete first, otherwise change the duplicate. \r\n\r\n```python\r\ny = sku.max_row\r\nfor i in range(y, 0, -1):\r\n    if i in delete_set:\r\n        sku.delete_rows(i,1)\r\n    else:\r\n        sku.cell(row=i, column=3) = duplicate_count[i]\r\n```\r\nIn theory, this would only traverse your range twice in total, and lookups from the cache would be O(1) on average. You need to traverse this in reverse to maintain row order as you delete rows.\r\n\r\nSince I don&#39;t actually have your sample data I can&#39;t test this code completely so there could be minor issues but I tried to use the structures that you have in your code to make it easily usable for you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958641/is-there-a-faster-way-on-reading-writing-and-saving-excel-files/57964267#57964267","title":"Is there a faster way on reading, writing and saving excel files?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12074688,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_bGD3OHQ2Bs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reN5s-0R4xmJ3pJ3KtFjmDl3I70Lw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jordan Liu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12074688/jordan-liu"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568680458,"creation_date":1568642909,"question_id":57958641,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958641","body_markdown":"I am new to Python.

following scenarios:\r\n\r\n\\[SP = $000F\\]&lt;br&gt;\r\n`ADD SP,$01`\r\n\r\n\\[SP = $00F0\\]&lt;br&gt;\r\n`ADD SP,$10`\r\n\r\n\\[SP = $0FF0\\]&lt;br&gt;\r\n`ADD SP,$10`\r\n\r\nFor each case I store the value of register `F` after the `ADD` in memory, and I later display bit 5 (the H-flag) of each of those bytes on the screen.\r\n\r\nI ran this on 3 different models (Gameboy Pocket, Gameboy Color, and Gameboy Advance SP), and got the following output on all 3 devices: `1 0 0`.

Like a normal Z80 CPU, it also has a dedicated 16-bit increment/decrement/load unit, which can handle certain 16-bit operations quickly but can&#39;t update the flags. Basically:\r\n\r\n* if flags are updated, a 16-bit operation definitely involves the ALU, so it actually uses two 8-bit ALU operations under the hood\r\n* if flags are not updated, and the 16-bit operation is just +1 / -1 / load, it&#39;s done with the 16-bit incrementer unit\r\n\r\nSo, whenever you&#39;re dealing with flags, try to think in terms of 8-bit operations (low byte first, then the high byte) if you want to reason about the operation.\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. How does the half-carry flag behave in opcode 0xE8?\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in the other answer, H is set when there&#39;s a carry from bit 3. (And C is set when there&#39;s a carry from bit 7).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an interesting thought exercise: if `SP=$FFFF` and you execute `ADD SP, -1`, you get `SP=$FFFE` *and both H and C are set*. Can you understand why?\r\n\r\n&gt;! Due to how signed numbers work, the low byte operation is in this case basically just a normal addition. `-1` = `$FF`, so it&#39;s calculating `$FF`+ `$FF`.\r\n\r\nHint above ↑\r\n\r\n&gt; 2. How is the opcode 0xE8 implemented in the physical hardware?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t yet have a full understanding of it at the lowest possible level, but I know that there are two 8-bit operations. With my Game Boy testbench system I&#39;ve confirmed that there&#39;s first an ALU operation that updates the flags (H, C) but not SP, then some other operation, and finally SP is updated atomically in one go. This suggests that `ADD SP, e` might actually calculate the result into some temporary register (for example, a real Z80 has an invisible WZ temporary register for some ALU operations) in two separate 8-bit operations, and then load SP from it.\r\n\r\nI think `ADD HL, BC` is a bit more interesting example...with my testbench I&#39;ve confirmed that it updates L first and then H, and *flags are updated twice*. This means that it literally executes something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nADD L, C\r\nADC H, B\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter 8-bit operation updates the flags, so we never see the resulting flags of `ADD L, C`. But the half-carry flag might be temporarily set if there&#39;s a carry from L bit 3!\r\n\r\n&gt; 3. Which is right, that half-carry occurs from bit 7 to bit 8 or that half-carry occurs from bit 11 to bit 12 (in the case of 16-bit instructions)?\r\n\r\nIt depends on the instruction, but the flags are always updated based on the same bit positions if you think in terms of 8-bit values...it just varies whether we&#39;re talking about the high or low byte of the 16-bit value.

How does the half-carry flag behave in opcode 0xE8?\r\n2. How is the opcode 0xE8 implemented in the physical hardware?\r\n3. Which is right, that half-carry occurs from bit 7 to bit 8 or that half-carry occurs from bit 11 to bit 12 (in the case of 16-bit instructions)?\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy/hardware.html\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8868396/gbz80-what-constitutes-a-half-carry\r\n  [3]: https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/4ycoix/a_guide_to_the_gameboys_halfcarry_flag/\r\n  [4]: http://marc.rawer.de/Gameboy/Docs/GBCPUman.pdf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958631/game-boy-half-carry-flag-and-16-bit-instructions-especially-opcode-0xe8","title":"Game Boy: half-carry flag and 16-bit instructions (especially opcode 0xE8)"},{"tags":["python","api","dataframe","null","nonetype"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":8584774,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--YI1yi9uOlA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADI/B82fFt-EqtA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Galih","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8584774/galih"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568897300,"post_id":57961696,"comment_id":102426894,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958623/how-to-proceed-api-data-input-process-to-pythons-dataframe-if-nonetype-missin/57961696#comment102426894_57961696"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":338,"user_id":9607338,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"abheet22","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9607338/abheet22"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568654735,"creation_date":1568654735,"answer_id":57961696,"question_id":57958623,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961696","body_markdown":"Below is snippet containing the condition for checking NoneType:\r\n\r\n    for element in inlst:\r\n        if element.text:\r\n            instr.append(element.text)\r\n    datum = &#39;-&#39;.join(instr)\r\n\r\nAlso posting the whole testing code:\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error\r\n    import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\r\n    \r\n    columns = [&#39;id&#39;,\r\n               &#39;title&#39;,\r\n               &#39;authors/author/name&#39;,\r\n               &#39;average_rating&#39;,\r\n               &#39;isbn&#39;,\r\n               &#39;isbn13&#39;,\r\n               &#39;language_code&#39;,\r\n               &#39;num_pages&#39;,\r\n               &#39;ratings_count&#39;,\r\n               &#39;text_reviews_count&#39;,]\r\n    index = list(range(6,7))\r\n    table = pd.DataFrame(index=index, columns=columns)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    #Here&#39;s the mining to DataFrame\r\n    for row in index:\r\n        for path in columns:        \r\n            \r\n            data = &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n            &lt;book&gt;\r\n              &lt;id&gt;6&lt;/id&gt;\r\n              &lt;title&gt;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)&lt;/title&gt;\r\n              &lt;isbn&gt;4&lt;/isbn&gt;\r\n              &lt;isbn13&gt;&lt;/isbn13&gt;\r\n            &lt;/book&gt;\r\n            &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n            #DATA MINING PROCESS\r\n            #parsing the &#39;data&#39;

Then, I want to take the rows I’ve copied and insert them after row `A4156` or before row `A4157`. I then take a separate list of August dates and write them to each of the lower 22 from `A4178` to `A4200`. July is then complete and rows for August are ready to go.\r\n\r\nI retain the last row because additional calculations on other worksheets in the same workbook refer to the last row for data and they will index automatically from `A4178` to `A4200` doing it this way.\r\n\r\nAs each entry made during the month, its data are copied down to the last row so the last row is always up to date.  Another sheet in the workbook uses up-to-date data in its summary.\r\n\r\nSo far, I can open the Excel workbook and get the right sheet.\r\n\r\nThe following does highlight the proper row but I get a runtime error. I’m not sure what that means.  \r\n\r\nI’ve commented out the “select” line and run the “copy” line with the same result.  I’m now into my second week trying to work out this problem.

think what you want is this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval dsl: OWrites[Foo] = (__ \\ &quot;foo&quot;).writeOptionWithNull[String]\r\n  .contramap(_.option)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if using an older play-json version that doesn&#39;t have `writeOptionWithNull`:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval dsl: OWrites[Foo] = (__ \\ &quot;foo&quot;).write[JsValue]\r\n  .contramap(_.option match {\r\n    case None =&gt; JsNull\r\n    case Some(string) =&gt; JsString(string)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, `play.api.libs.json.JsNull`, and `null`, are two completely different and unrelated concepts, and should never be confused or mixed. The convention across the whole Scala ecosystem in Scala-only APIs is to never, ever use `null`, to the extent where most libraries simply pretend that it doesn&#39;t even exist. So, you won&#39;t find many Scala libraries that do null checks, they just assume everything is non null, and the moment you start using null, you&#39;re in the wild west of untested and unsupported edge cases. The only time you use or deal with nulls is if working with a Java API, because they use nulls, and the convention there is to wrap anything that can produce a `null` in `Option` as early as possible, and unwrap `Option` using `orNull` as late as possible, so that at least internally in the Scala code that doesn&#39;t directly interface to Java code, everything is using `Option`, rather than `null`. But play-json is designed for Scala use only, so like the rest of the Scala-only ecosystem, it just assumes `null` doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nOf course, in json, `null` does exist, and there may be valid reasons to use it (especially when integrating with other systems that require it). So play-json does model it, but it models it in a very strongly typed way - nothing will ever automatically go from being `null` in Scala to being `null` in JSON, it&#39;s always very explicit, this is in line with Scala being strongly typed. Also, use of `null` in JSON doesn&#39;t tend to be that common, so most of the default methods (ie, the `writeNullable` method) map `Option` to a non-existent value, so you have to be a little more explicit when you want to write a JSON `null`, as shown above.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958586/play-json-jsnull-is-not-equal-to-jsstringnull-how-to-get-around-this-issue/58020495#58020495","title":"play-json: JsNull is not equal to JsString(null), how to get around this issue?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1340,"user_id":1208786,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a4a99f784c9912e991d7902dafdee25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mhogerheijde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1208786/mhogerheijde"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1340,"user_id":1208786,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a4a99f784c9912e991d7902dafdee25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mhogerheijde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1208786/mhogerheijde"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58020495,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568941409,"creation_date":1568642728,"last_edit_date":1568711849,"question_id":57958586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958586","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on some largeish JSON output. We&#39;ve got a bunch of tests to check the output. We&#39;ve created the tests by having a copy of the JSON on disk, performing a `Json.parse()` on the `InputStream` and comparing that to the JsObject we have build in memory.\r\n\r\nThis worked well until I started converting some of our `Writes` to using the functional syntax (i.e. instead of overriding the `writes` method in the trait, use the builders).\r\n\r\nSuddenly, tests started failing: complaining about `null` fields that were not equal.\r\n\r\nApparently, when using functional syntax, an `Option[String]` will convert to a `JsString(null)` instead of `JsNull`.

I&#39;m only interested in the in-memory representation of the `JsValue` so I can use its equality during testing.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958586/play-json-jsnull-is-not-equal-to-jsstringnull-how-to-get-around-this-issue","title":"play-json: JsNull is not equal to JsString(null), how to get around this issue?"},{"tags":["elasticsearch"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3585,"user_id":4428471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ceac56f804df75cd11bc4871d10fbf3c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zhuguowei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4428471/zhuguowei"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568682104,"post_id":57960098,"comment_id":102342864,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958582/how-to-aggs-for-group-by-result-in-elasticsearch/57960098#comment102342864_57960098"},{"owner":{"reputation":18918,"user_id":23388,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca187415943d751998228574c066c94f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nimrodm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/23388/nimrodm"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3585,"user_id":4428471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ceac56f804df75cd11bc4871d10fbf3c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zhuguowei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4428471/zhuguowei"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568694558,"post_id":57960098,"comment_id":102345054,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958582/how-to-aggs-for-group-by-result-in-elasticsearch/57960098#comment102345054_57960098"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18918,"user_id":23388,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca187415943d751998228574c066c94f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nimrodm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/23388/nimrodm"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568647783,"creation_date":1568647783,"answer_id":57960098,"question_id":57958582,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960098","body_markdown":"The answer to this question relies on [Pipeline aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-pipeline.html) -- these aggregations operate on the output of another aggregation.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have many documents, each with a different `hostVersion` and use the following to find the max, min and average number of documents per host version:\r\n\r\n    &quot;aggs&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;per_hostver&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;terms&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;field&quot;: &quot;hostVersion&quot;\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;avg_docs_per_version&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;avg_bucket&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;buckets_path&quot;: &quot;per_hostver&gt;_count&quot;\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;max_docs_per_version&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;max_bucket&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;buckets_path&quot;: &quot;per_hostver&gt;_count&quot;\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;min_docs_per_version&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;min_bucket&quot;: {\r\n             &quot;buckets_path&quot;: &quot;per_hostver&gt;_count&quot;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe syntax `per_hostver&gt;_count` refers to the `_count` field generated by each bucket of the aggregation `per_hostver`. `_count` is how you refer to the special document count field generated by all ES aggregations.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958582/how-to-aggs-for-group-by-result-in-elasticsearch/57960098#57960098","title":"How to aggs for group by result in elasticsearch"}],"owner":{"reputation":3585,"user_id":4428471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ceac56f804df75cd11bc4871d10fbf3c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zhuguowei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4428471/zhuguowei"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57960098,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568647783,"creation_date":1568642725,"question_id":57958582,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958582","body_markdown":"There is an index: person\r\n\r\n    &quot;_source&quot;

Instead you allocate an array of pointers and for each of these pointer, you allocate an array. That last array should be an array of char. However, your code is:\r\n\r\n    upper[i]= malloc(size2*sizeof(char*));\r\n                                  ^^^^^\r\n                                  Should be char, not char*\r\n\r\nBut that is not the cause of the seg fault - it&#39;s just allocating more memory than needed.\r\n\r\nThe outer array, i.e. `upper` is allocated using `length` like:\r\n\r\n    char ** upper =malloc(length*sizeof(char*));\r\n                          ^^^^^^\r\n\r\nbut later you iterate it using `size2` - here:\r\n\r\n        for(i =0; i&lt;=size2; i++){\r\n\r\nSo in case `size2` is greater than or equal to `length`, you access out of bounds. That may cause a seg fault.\r\n\r\nThen this part:\r\n\r\n    sizeof(word[i])/sizeof(word[i][0])\r\n\r\nAre you sure that is doing what you want?\r\n\r\nIt is the same as:\r\n\r\n    sizeof(char*)/sizeof(char)\r\n\r\nor just \r\n\r\n    sizeof(char*)\r\n\r\nI doubt that is what you want.\r\n\r\nThen you have this code:\r\n\r\n                        if(isupper(word[i][i2])!=0){     \r\n                            upper[i]=word[i];\r\n                        }\r\n\r\nHere you change the pointer value held by `upper[i]`. That makes no sense and it&#39;s a memory leak because you overwrite a pointer that points to dynamic allocated memory with another pointer.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958579/returning-a-2d-array-from-a-function-in-c/57959054#57959054","title":"Returning a 2d array from a function in C"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":11745489,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xkC4qTgl6tE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfO76XHRX3OAdfGo26E-yHgT7WCoA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"cLax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11745489/clax"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568644835,"creation_date":1568642721,"question_id":57958579,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958579","body_markdown":"I am trying to return a 2d array from a function but for some reason when I call the function in my main it causes a segmentation fault.\r\n```\r\nchar **upper_case_word(char **word,int size){\r\n        int i =0;\r\n        int i2=0;\r\n        // this gets the number of words\r\n        int length = upper_counter(word,size);\r\n        //this gets the size of the largest word\r\n        int size2 = length_upper(word,size);\r\n        \r\n        char ** upper =malloc(length*sizeof(char*));\r\n        \r\n        for(i =0; i &lt;length; i++){\r\n                upper[i]= malloc(size2*sizeof(char*));\r\n        }\r\n        i =0;\r\n        \r\n        for(i =0; i&lt;=size2; i++){\r\n                \r\n                for(i2 =0; i2&lt;(sizeof(word[i])/sizeof(word[i][0])); i2++){   \r\n                             if(isupper(word[i][i2])!=0){     \r\n                                upper[i]=word[i];\r\n                        }\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n        return upper;\r\n}\r\nint main(){\r\n   //this is causing the segmentation fault.\r\n   char ** upper = upper_case_word(words,size);\r\n\r\n return(0);\r\n}\r\n``` ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958579/returning-a-2d-array-from-a-function-in-c","title":"Returning a 2d array from a function in C"},{"tags":["drop-down-menu","zurb-foundation"],"owner":{"reputation":130,"user_id":11894683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa1502e4c0e7412e234e2a7281ab5b3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"baryon123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11894683/baryon123"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568642712,"creation_date":1568642712,"question_id":57958577,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958577","body_markdown":"The situation is as follows:\r\n\r\nI want a page where the admin can change attributes of products. \r\nTherefore, the admin is supposed to select the respective product from a dropdown menu and THEN enter new attributes for name, manufacturer and category into textinput. \r\n\r\nNow I really find the different types of dropdown(like) menus which zurb Foundation has appealing.\r\nHowever, currently, these menus dont work the way I know usual dropdown menus. \r\n\r\nThe dropdown menus Ive worked with so far open up a list with their contents, and then u select one item and it gets &quot;selected&quot;. \r\nThen, when I hit the submit button, I want the item with the &quot;selected&quot; value inside the dropdown menu to be accessed and its value submitted (via AJAX). \r\n\r\nBut this behavior doesnt seem to hold true for the menus in ZURB FOUNDATION 6.4.1+.\r\nI can perfectly navigate through the multiple levels of nested menus (see here:\r\nhttps://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/dropdown-menu.html )\r\nbut for some reason, it doesnt have a built-in &quot;apply selected to clicked item&quot; functionality.\r\nThis seems quite odd to me, since I don&#39;t really understand how the menu can then fulfill the above described functionality without rather &quot;unsexy&quot; housemade solutions to grab the desired data when clicking an item from the menu. \r\n\r\nAm I missing something?

Then, activate your swizzling, say in `AppDelegate&#39;s` didFinishLaunching method like: `ViewController.setViewControllerSwizzlingActive(true)`\r\n\r\nIf you want Swift version - this would be a task for you.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/\r\n  [2]: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-create-an-objective-c-bridging-header-to-use-code-in-swift","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958572/how-to-find-out-when-the-method-of-an-object-has-been-called/57973056#57973056","title":"How to find out when the method of an object has been called?"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11497206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2af88886a4bea8cd419e8828174ceba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11497206","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11497206/user11497206"},"last_editor":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11497206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2af88886a4bea8cd419e8828174ceba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11497206","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11497206/user11497206"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57973056,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568719317,"creation_date":1568642689,"last_edit_date":1568703637,"question_id":57958572,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958572","body_markdown":"I have an `UIViewController` object.\r\nI would like to know when the `viewDidLoad` method has been called.\r\n\r\nI understand that I can override this method in the subclass and find out when it is called.\r\n\r\nIs there another to know when the `viewDidLoad` method is called?\r\n\r\nEdit-\r\n\r\nI have several view controllers that are pushed onto an `UINavigationController`.\r\nSome of these view controllers hide the navigation bars.

Second example for good measure [Table Setup][3]\r\n\r\n[Table Setup][4]. This is how it should look. Or at least something similar. You can add more columns to do more comparisons.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your calendar table set up, its a matter of comparing the date you want to the table.\r\n\r\nThis is how you can grab the first week of the next month based on a date table\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @Date DATE = &#39;8/2/2019&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    SELECT       [dt].Date\r\n    \t   FROM  [Datetbl] AS [dt]\r\n    \t   WHERE [dt].[Weekday] = DATEPART([weekday], DATEADD(day, -1, @Date)) -- is same day of the week\r\n    \t\t\t AND [dt].Month = DATEPART(month, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date)) -- Grab the month number for &quot;Next Month&quot;\r\n    \t\t\t AND [dt].Year = DATEPART(year, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date)) -- Grab year of next month since that will be different for December\r\n    \t\t\t AND [dt].[WeekOfMonth] IN\r\n    \t (SELECT       MIN([WeekOfMonth])\r\n    \t\t\t FROM  [Datetbl] AS [dt1]\r\n    \t\t\t WHERE [dt1].[Weekday] = DATEPART([weekday], DATEADD(day, -1, @Date))\r\n    \t\t\t\t   AND [dt1].Month = DATEPART(month, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date))\r\n    \t\t\t\t   AND [dt1].Year = DATEPART(year, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date))\r\n    \t ); -- returns Sept 6\r\n\r\nThis is how you would go about getting the last weekday of the month based on a date table\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @Date DATE = &#39;9/26/2019&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    SELECT       [dt].Date\r\n           FROM  [Datetbl] AS [dt]\r\n           WHERE [dt].[Weekday] = DATEPART([weekday], DATEADD(day, -1, @Date)) -- is same day of the week\r\n                 AND [dt].Month = DATEPART(month, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date)) -- Grab the month number for &quot;Next Month&quot;\r\n                 AND [dt].Year = DATEPART(year, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date)) -- Grab year of next month since that will be different for December\r\n                 AND [dt].[WeekOfMonth] IN\r\n         (SELECT       MAX([WeekOfMonth])\r\n                 FROM  [Datetbl] AS [dt1]\r\n                 WHERE [dt1].[Weekday] = DATEPART([weekday], DATEADD(day, -1, @Date))\r\n                       AND [dt1].Month = DATEPART(month, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date))\r\n                       AND [dt1].Year = DATEPART(year, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, @Date))\r\n         ); -- returns Oct 31st\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.sqlshack.com/designing-a-calendar-table/\r\n  [2]: http://www.sqlserver.info/database-design/how-to-create-a-date-table/\r\n  [3]: https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/4054/creating-a-date-dimension-or-calendar-table-in-sql-server/\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/scJeP.png\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958552/in-mssql-get-first-second-third-weekdate-of-current-month-what-date-would-it/58015136#58015136","title":"in mssql get first, second, third weekdate of current month, what date would it be the next month"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":1512150,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e395107df927ed91104ec074b4f18c99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Uday Patel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1512150/uday-patel"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568909654,"creation_date":1568642623,"question_id":57958552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958552","body_markdown":"Given a date lets say Aug 2, 2019 which is first friday of the month. what would be the first friday of next month (sept 6th).

far the solution I found is to use query string parameters and use the `IHttpContextAccessor` to search for the tenant parameter.\r\nFor this purpose I created a base abstract implementation of `IHealthCheck`.\r\n\r\n    public abstract class BaseTenantHealthCheck : IHealthCheck\r\n    {\r\n    \tprivate IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic BaseTenantHealthCheck(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t_httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tprotected string GetTenant()\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\treturn _httpContextAccessor?.HttpContext?.Request?.Query[&quot;tenant&quot;].ToString();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tprotected bool IsTenantSpecificCheck() =&gt;

BaseTenantHealthCheck\r\n    {\r\n        public MyAvailabilityHealthCheck(IOptionsMonitor&lt;MyAvailabilityCheckOptions&gt; options, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)\r\n        : base(httpContextAccessor)\r\n        {\r\n            [..]\r\n\r\nTo access the health check I use:\r\n\r\n - `http://{url}/health` [for multi tenant checks]\r\n -

started using Health checks from Asp.net Core, I love them but I could not find an easy way to wire it up with tenant based routing, for example supporting:\r\n\r\n - /health [generic non tenant

configure the routing for the request.\r\n\r\n    app.UseEndpointRouting();\r\n    app.UseHealthChecks(&quot;/{tenant}/health&quot;, new HealthCheckOptions\r\n        {\r\n            ResponseWriter =

The data is stored in firebase realtime database and the athentificacion also works via firebase. I wanted to add a &quot;Delete Profile&quot; button, so the user information is deleted from firebase. I figuered out how to delete the user from the autentification process. Now I tried to call the remove() function to the Uid, so now the data gets deleted in the real time database but is still in the Firebase authentification and the app crashes if you delete the userdata. So only one of the deleting processes works... either the autentification or deleting the user from the database.\r\nMaybe the problem is about structure and child/parent relation in the realtimedatabase? My suggestion is that the order in onClickListener() could be incorrect?\r\nHow can i delete both of it at once and get this process working?\r\nThx in advance :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class

So even if you could use new Date(1900, 2, 30) and not get an exception, the result would not be Feb 30, 1900, but some other valid date.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958419/can-you-force-values-into-the-date-type/57978947#57978947","title":"Can you force values into the Date type?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5754,"user_id":8367626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlgmz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8367626/mary"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568779612,"creation_date":1568779612,"answer_id":57984949,"question_id":57958419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57984949","body_markdown":"There are lots of fun methods in DateTime.\r\n\r\n    Private Function GetLastDayInFebruary(YearToTest As Integer) As Integer\r\n        Return Date.DaysInMonth(YearToTest, 2)\r\n    End Function\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958419/can-you-force-values-into-the-date-type/57984949#57984949","title":"Can you force values into the Date type?"}],"owner":{"reputation":65,"user_id":3030870,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUgbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shmink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3030870/shmink"},"last_editor":{"reputation":65,"user_id":3030870,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUgbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shmink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3030870/shmink"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57959364,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568779612,"creation_date":1568642217,"last_edit_date":1568642627,"question_id":57958419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57958419","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve come across a bug where the expedient solution would be to somehow *force* certain values into the `Date` type. \r\n\r\nIt would include being able to do the following `Dim myDate As Date = New Date(1900, 2, 29)`. \r\n\r\nThe 29th of February is a leap day but 1900 is not a leap year, therefore, this is not a valid date and it doesn&#39;t allow it to even be created.

have a main window viewmodel that is creating an instance of the usercontrol, and in a specific function, setting a property of the usercontrol via code i.e. \r\n\r\n            // Set Button Width

= (potentialHeight &lt; potentialWidth) ? potentialHeight : potentialWidth;\r\n\r\nWhen this is called, the properties in the usercontrol change (you can see the setter is called).
