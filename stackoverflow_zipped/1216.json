I have a modal window which, when up, presents an UpdatePanel which has several Panel&#39;s within it, and on one of them, is a plain button.  Clicking the button isn&#39;t providing ANY postback (partial or full).  Ideally, I&#39;d like to just do a partial postback, but I can&#39;t get any type of postback now.  Here&#39;s some of my code:\r\n\r\nFor the ScriptManager:\r\n\r\n    myScriptManager.ID = &quot;ScriptManager1&quot;\r\n    myScriptManager.EnablePageMethods = True\t\r\n    myScriptManager.EnablePartialRendering = True\r\n    MainForm.Controls.Add(myScriptManager)\r\n\r\nFor the UpdatePanel:\r\n\r\n\tWith BeginBroadcastPanel\r\n\t\t.ID = &quot;BeginBroadcastPanel&quot;\r\n\t\t.Attributes.Add(&quot;style&quot;, &quot;display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-contents:center;align-items:center;&quot;)\r\n\t\t&#39;.UpdateMode = UpdatePanelUpdateMode.Conditional\r\n\t\t&#39;.ChildrenAsTriggers = True\r\n\tEnd With\r\n\r\nFor the Button:\r\n\r\n\tWith lblBroadcastPanelLoginButton\t\r\n\t\t.ID = &quot;lblBroadcastPanelLoginButton&quot;\r\n\t\t.Text = &quot;LOG IN&quot;\r\n\t\t.Attributes.Add(&quot;style&quot;, &quot;font-weight:bold;margin:20px;width:50%;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;font-size:20pt;background:lightgray;border-radius:4px;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;border:0px solid darkgray;&quot;)\r\n\t\t&#39;.Attributes.Add(&quot;onclick&quot;, &quot;__doPostBack(&#39;&lt;%=BeginBroadcastPanel.ClientID %&gt;&#39;, null);&quot;)\r\n\t\t&#39;Dim t As New AsyncPostBackTrigger\r\n\t\t&#39;t.ControlID = lblBroadcastPanelLoginButton.ClientID\r\n\t\t&#39;t.EventName = &quot;Click&quot;\r\n\t\t&#39;BeginBroadcastPanel.Triggers.Add(t)\r\n\tEnd With\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I&#39;ve tried many different solutions, such as setting the UpdateMode, ChildrenAsTriggers, adding an AsyncPostBackTrigger.  Only the Javascript kind of worked, but it&#39;ll only do a full postback (and it&#39;s my understanding that Javascript shouldn&#39;t be necessary to do the partial postback).  To check if a partial postback is happening, I have a field which displays the current datetime.  Any ideas what&#39;s wrong here?\r\n\r\nEDIT:  I discovered that a postback is occurring, but the textfield that was showing the datetime was not updating.  If I display the datetime in a label, it shows that the datetime is increasing.  Oddly enough, both IsPostBack and IsInAsyncPostBack evaluate to True with each postback.  Also odd, if I increment a public integer (see example below), it only fires on the first postback but not any subsequent postbacks.\r\n\r\n    Public test As Integer\r\n    Public dttm As DateTime = DateTime.Now\r\n\r\n\tDim b As New Button\r\n\tWith b\r\n\t\ttest = test + 1 \r\n\t\t.Text = dttm.ToString(&quot;MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss&quot;) &amp; &quot; - &quot; &amp; test.ToString &amp; &quot; - &quot; &amp; Page.IsPostBack\r\n\tEnd With\r\n\tBeginBroadcastPanel.ContentTemplateContainer.Controls.Add(b)\r\n\r\nIn the code above, I&#39;m showing both the dttm and test variables on the button.  The dttm is incrementing up, but the test variable is not.  Why is that?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253152/asp-net-updatepanel-and-button-not-doing-full-and-or-partial-postback","title":"ASP.NET UpdatePanel and Button Not Doing Full and/or Partial Postback"},{"tags":["python","sql-server","pyodbc"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1016,"user_id":10656054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vmZPu.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"san","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10656054/san"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570331400,"creation_date":1570331400,"answer_id":58253928,"question_id":58253148,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253928","body_markdown":"When you called sample_contact_cursor.fetchall() , you already exhausted the contents of the cursor.

Wrap the function in a class.\r\n\r\nIn a class, the &quot;static int pos&quot; function variable can become a simple data attribute of the wrapper.\r\n\r\nBelow are several code samples.\r\n\r\n1) The first is to demonstrate your issue is repeatable.\r\n\r\n2) A simple class wrapper called class FillAryOddFirstClass_t. The function is very much the same as your original, but pos is not static.\r\n\r\n3) A simple Functor wrapper, called class FillAryOddFirstFunctor_t.  Functors have a simpler invocation.\r\n\r\n4) Because you have declared this post as a C++ question, item 4 uses a vector instead of an array -- BUT note that the code uses the same class to run the recursion as item 2, FillAryOddFirstClass_t, which expects an array!  The vector data resides in dynamic memory, and by specifying &quot;&amp;iVec[0]&#39; (instead of ary), the address passed is the beginning element of the vector data in heap.\r\n\r\n5) This is item 2 with extras.  class FillAryOddFirstClass2_t is internally complicated with 2 report functions.  The report functions build strings to display progress of the recursion / decursion execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    using std::cout, std::endl; // c++17\r\n    \r\n    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;\r\n    using std::setw;\r\n    \r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    using std::string, std::to_string;\r\n    \r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    using std::vector;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    // original - with static\r\n    void fillAryOddFirst ( int ary[], int size )\r\n    {\r\n       static int pos;

(source is Cloud Pub/Sub, sink is BigQuery table, tried both on DirectRunner and DataFlowRunner, Python 3.7, apache-beam v2.15.0)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [comments][1] in the code says:\r\n&gt; batch_size (int): Number of rows to be written to BQ per streaming API insert. The default is 500.\r\n\r\nIn my pipeline code, I had set value to 100 in my PTransform (default value is 500)\r\n\r\n```python\r\npipeline | &quot;read_sub&quot; &gt;&gt;

published to pub/sub\r\n- no Streaming API method `tabledata.insertAll` will be consumed from the project&#39;s API Quota \r\neven checked the [code here][2] for `process()` function of BigQueryWriteFn which is called by WriteToBigQuery PTransform and believe my interpretation of this parameter makes sense (nothing flushed \r\n\r\n**ACTUAL BEHAVIOR** that I&#39;m seeing is after publishing just 10 elements to the pub/sub topic:\r\n\r\n- each of those elements are successfully streamed to BigQuery table with-in seconds \r\n- From Project&#39;s API quota, the pipeline also consumed 3 requests to streaming method bigquery.tabledata.insertAll (I&#39;d still expect 1, considering only 1 streaming api could be used to stream just 10 messages with `batch_size =100`\r\n\r\nCan someone clarify pls. why i&#39;m seeing this unexpected behavior? or, is there something that I mis-understood how this parameter settings behave?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

are a couple of things wrong with the code.\r\n\r\n**First**, the string formatting:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(&#39;First word: &#39; %s (new_tokens[0]))\r\nprint(&#39;Second word: &#39; %s (new_tokens[1]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython has [many ways to format strings](https://stackoverflow.com/q/13451989/2745495). You seem to be trying to use the [`printf`-style formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting) from C, but you&#39;ve misplaced the `%s` character. It should be `format % values`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(&#39;First word: %s&#39; % (new_tokens[0]))\r\nprint(&#39;Second word: %s&#39; % (new_tokens[1]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, while there is no problem with `%`-style, if you are already on Python3, it&#39;s better to use the `.format()` syntax or the newer the f-strings syntax introduced in Python3.6.\r\n\r\n**Second**, the input prompts:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nuser_string = (input(&#39;Enter input string: \\n&#39;))\r\n\r\nif &#39;,&#39; not in user_string:\r\n    print (&#39;Error: No comma in string.\\nEnter input string: &#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy understanding is, you&#39;re prompting the user for a string but it needs to have a comma. If the input does not have a comma, you prompt the user again. But the problem with your code is that **you don&#39;t update `user_string`**. It does not magically or automatically get updated, you need to re-assign the `input` value again to `user_string`. \r\n\r\nIf you have a predefined number of attempts the user can make (it looks to be 3 based on your example), you can make a loop that prompts until max attempts are made or until the user provides correct input. It would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nuser_string = &quot;&quot;\r\n\r\nmax_attempts = 3\r\ncurrent_attempt = 0\r\nwhile (current_attempt &lt; max_attempts):\r\n    # Get user input\r\n    # Python2\r\n    user_string = raw_input(&#39;Enter input string: \\n&#39;)\r\n    # Python3\r\n    #user_string = input(&#39;Enter input string: \\n&#39;)\r\n    # Check if user input is correct\r\n    if &#39;,&#39; not in user_string:\r\n        print(&#39;Error: No comma in string.&#39;)\r\n        current_attempt += 1\r\n    else:\r\n        # Stop the loop\r\n        break\r\n\r\nprint(user_string)\r\nif current_attempt == max_attempts:\r\n    print(&#39;Error: I told you to input string with comma&#39;)\r\nelse:\r\n    # rest of the code\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253106/typeerror-not-all-arguments-converted-during-string-formatting-2-0/58254722#58254722","title":"TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting 2.0"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12170432,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/3464489033568729/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ryan Dejesus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170432/ryan-dejesus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3992,"user_id":2745495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bbcd267235bab78ec6710ef6654ba87?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gino Mempin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2745495/gino-mempin"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58254722,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570407579,"creation_date":1570318218,"last_edit_date":1570320208,"question_id":58253106,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253106","body_markdown":"I am attempting to call back to a split list I made and am getting this error:\r\n\r\n    TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n\r\n    user_string = (input(&#39;Enter input string: \\n&#39;))\r\n    \r\n    if &#39;,&#39; not in user_string:\r\n        print (&#39;Error: No comma in string.\\nEnter input string: &#39;)\r\n    \r\n    if &#39;,&#39; not in user_string:\r\n        print (&#39;Error: No comma in string.\\nEnter input string: &#39;)\r\n    \r\n    if &#39;,&#39; not in user_string:\r\n        print (&#39;Error: No comma in string.\\nEnter input string: &#39;)    \r\n        \r\n    else:\r\n        print (user_string)\r\n        \r\n    new_tokens = user_string.split (&#39;,&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    print(&#39;First word: &#39; %s (new_tokens[0]))\r\n    \r\n    print(&#39;Second word: &#39; %s (new_tokens[1]))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253106/typeerror-not-all-arguments-converted-during-string-formatting-2-0","title":"TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting 2.0"},{"tags":["ios","swift","metal","metalkit"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":108098,"user_id":299924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71fc84230717311db1410d7106273128?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"trojanfoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/299924/trojanfoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570344202,"post_id":58253104,"comment_id":102879206,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253104/what-exactly-does-the-function-setviewport#comment102879206_58253104"}],"owner":{"reputation":3228,"user_id":1114043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EwPfY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"loki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1114043/loki"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570318182,"creation_date":1570318182,"question_id":58253104,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253104","body_markdown":"In metal, what is exactly the purpose of the function setViewport? the doc says \r\n\r\n&gt; The viewport transforms vertices from normalized device coordinates to\r\n&gt; window coordinates.

de css con un prop, pero hasta el momento no he tenido resultado, si alguno aqui sabe\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Menu.js**\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport React, {Component} from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { Menu, Image

have a timer that I want to loop as soon as it reaches 0.\r\n\r\nResetting the timer in onFinish() seems to be slower than manually resetting the timer via the timer&#39;s reset button.\r\n\r\nWhen the timer finishes, it doesn&#39;t restart until &quot;0&quot; has shown for a second (maybe at the end of the tick,) effectively adding an extra second to the timer that I don&#39;t want.\r\n\r\nHow can I make this timer restart the instant &quot;0&quot; is displayed? \r\n\r\n**Imports and fragment**\r\n\r\n    package com.example.datacollector;\r\n    \r\n    import android.content.Context;\r\n

easy to access the database so the only way I can see that it could be used is as a tool for properly object oriented models to query the database.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if this is the opinion

I&#39;m using Reactive Forms and the Form elements are rendered dynamically.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that I can access the element that has been changed using either `@ViewChildren(AppTag) ipt!: QueryList&lt;AppTag&gt;` which lets me filter on the element I want, but then I don&#39;t know how to grab that element using `nativeElement`, or I can use `@ViewChildren(AppTag) ipt!: QueryList&lt;ElementRef&gt;`, which (surprisingly) seems to be letting me filter the element in question, but (also surprisingly) I&#39;m still unable to manipulate the DOM element.

following works for me on Windows. It incorporates all the changes I suggested in my comments under your question, including the final one about separate memory-spaces.\r\n\r\nSomething similar should also work under ubuntu using its version of `getch()`, although I haven&#39;t tested it. on The main process creates the `Queue` and passes it as an argument to the `get_input()` target function so they&#39;re both using the same object to exchange data.\r\n\r\nI also `decode()` the [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects) object returned from `msvcrt.getch()` to convert it into a (1 character) Unicode UTF-8 string.\r\n```\r\nimport msvcrt\r\nimport time\r\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue\r\n\r\nprev_user_input = &#39; &#39;\r\nuser_input = &#39; &#39;\r\n\r\n\r\ndef get_input(queue):\r\n    char = &#39; &#39;\r\n    while char != b&#39;x&#39;:\r\n        char = msvcrt.getch()\r\n        queue.put(char.decode())  # Convert to utf-8 string.\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n    # Getting input from the user.\r\n    queue = Queue(1)\r\n\r\n    # Starting the process that gets user input.\r\n    proc = Process(target=get_input, args=(queue,))\r\n    proc.start()\r\n\r\n\r\n    while True:\r\n\r\n        # Getting the users last input\r\n        while not queue.empty():\r\n            user_input = queue.get()\r\n\r\n        # Only print user_input if it changes\r\n        if prev_user_input != user_input:\r\n            print(user_input)\r\n            prev_user_input = user_input\r\n\r\n        time.sleep(1/10)\r\n```\r\n###Update\r\n\r\nTo hide the OS differences and make the code more portable, you could do the `import`ing as shown below, which would also allow you to define the `get_input()` function more like you did in the code in your question:\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport time\r\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    import msvcrt\r\n    getch = msvcrt.getwch  # Wide char variant of getch() that returns Unicode.\r\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError:  # Not Windows OS - no msvcrt.\r\n    from getch import getch\r\n\r\nprev_user_input = &#39; &#39;\r\nuser_input = &#39; &#39;\r\n\r\n\r\ndef get_input(queue):\r\n    char = &#39; &#39;\r\n    while char != &#39;x&#39;:\r\n        char = getch()\r\n        queue.put(char)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n    # For getting input from the user.\r\n    queue = Queue(1)\r\n\r\n    # Starting the process that gets user input.\r\n\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253057/how-to-rewrite-this-multiprocessing-code-for-windows/58255888#58255888","title":"How to rewrite this multiprocessing code for Windows?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11994416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/add4294c80ced948e8c184e5ed65471d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ra314","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11994416/ra314"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77063,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58255888,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570398197,"creation_date":1570317582,"last_edit_date":1570397311,"question_id":58253057,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253057","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently using multiprocessing so I can obtain user input while running other code.

like the paths you are specifying for include files (with `-I`) and for libraries (with `-L`) are *relative* paths, not *absolute*. So you&#39;re telling it to look under the *current* directory.

I didn&#39;t mention prior that I&#39;m compiling two projects both with their own respective properties but one is a .dll and the other is the .exe which depends on the .dll. The only lib that they both need to share is Box2D.lib. I&#39;m guessing that the problem goes there, they share a static library and when Compiling it&#39;s only giving once the location of the library. That&#39;s all I know for now, it works, kinda with msbuild, but I would still rather use the gnu compiler.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253051/undefined-reference-only-for-box2d-when-compiling-with-terminal-gcc-g","title":"Undefined Reference only for Box2D when compiling with Terminal GCC &amp;

see at least two options for this situation. One option is to send the base64 encoded command to Powershell.exe using the `-EncodedCommand` parameter. The second option is to create your decoding script to accept another script that contains the base64 encoded command as a parameter value.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Option 1: Passing the Encoded Command**\r\n\r\nThis assumes your base64 encoded command is a string version of your PowerShell commands formatted using UTF-16LE character encoding (Unicode). Let&#39;s also assume that you have a script called `Encoded.ps1` that contains your base64 encoded command. With the prerequisites met, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n    Powershell.exe -EncodedCommand (Get-Content Encoded.ps1)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Option 2: Running a Decode Script Against the Encoded Script**\r\n\r\nThe unicode requirement does not matter in this case (you can use ANSI if you like). You just need to know your original command string encoding so you can properly decode it. We will assume ASCII character set. Let&#39;s also assume that `Encoded.ps1` contains your base64 encoded command. \r\n\r\nFirst, let&#39;s create the decode script called Decode.ps1.\r\n\r\n    # Decode.ps1\r\n    param([string]$FilePath)\r\n    \r\n    $64EncodedData = Get-Content $FilePath\t\r\n    $DecodedData = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($64EncodedData))\r\n    \r\n    &amp; ([scriptblock]::Create($DecodedData))\r\n\r\nSecond, let&#39;s run the Powershell.exe command to decode `Encoded.ps1` and execute the decoded command.\r\n\r\n    Powershell.exe -File Decoded.ps1 -FilePath Encoded.ps1\r\n\r\nThe code above is not intended to display the contents of the decoded commands but rather execute the decoded commands. `$FilePath` is the path to your `Encoded.ps1` file, which contains a base64 encoded string from an ASCII encoded character set. You can change to whichever encoding applies to your situation in the `Decode.ps1` file. `$DecodedData` contains the original command strings. Finally, a script block is created containing `$DecodedData` and then called with the call operator `&amp;`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253022/running-a-self-decrypting-base64-powershelll-script-locally-with-powershell-fil/58253980#58253980","title":"Running a self decrypting base64 powershelll script locally with powershell -file /path/to/ps1"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12167398,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d35237a51cf6a29d4a6812c8cb1b09b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"confuzzled","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167398/confuzzled"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58253980,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570332463,"creation_date":1570317092,"question_id":58253022,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253022","body_markdown":"I want to keep my powershell scripts on my local server in base64 but when run from schtasks or locally using powershell -file /path/to/ps1 they self decode.

I came to realize after a day of debugging and looking into the [Android Developers&#39; Documentation][1] about the ComponentName.\r\n\r\nI was implementing it in the debug mode and my packageName is - **applicationId + suffix.**\r\nas you can see yours in **build.gradle**.\r\n\r\nPreviously, I was doing something like\r\n\r\n    PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();\r\n            ComponentName compName =\r\n                    new ComponentName(this, getPackageName() + &quot;.AliasSplashScreen&quot;);\r\n            pm.setComponentEnabledSetting(\r\n                    compName,\r\n                    PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED,\r\n                    PackageManager.DONT_KILL_APP);\r\n\r\nNow you see that I was using get package name() which is different for each build but My Class name has no effect due to this. \r\n\r\nMy class Name is and will always be **originalpackagename.classname** or more clearly **applicationid.className.** no matter the build variant(debug or release).\r\n\r\nThe Correct way is - \r\n\r\n    PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();\r\n            ComponentName compName =\r\n                    new ComponentName(this, applicationid + &quot;.AliasSplashScreen&quot;);\r\n            pm.setComponentEnabledSetting(\r\n                    compName,\r\n                    PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED,\r\n                    PackageManager.DONT_KILL_APP);\r\n\r\nAnd as CommonsWare pointed out you have to create an `activity-alias` in Android Manifest keeping the original one and `targetActivity` should be the one whose alias you are creating with the desired `intent-filter` inside that and use the above code to disable it in the onCreate() of the Next Activity and to enable it use **`PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_ENABLED`**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Now let’s say I have a simple module as below\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass mymodel(nn.Module):\r\n\tdef __init__(self, input_channels):\r\n\t\tsuper(mymodel, self).__init__()\r\n\t\tself.fc = nn.Linear(input_channels, input_channels)\r\n\tdef forward(self, x):\r\n\t\tout = self.fc(x)\r\n\t\tout += x\r\n\t\treturn out\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n\tnet = mymodel(5)\r\n\r\n\tfor mod in net.modules():\r\n\t\tprint(mod) \r\n\r\n```\r\nHere the output yields:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmymodel(\r\n  (fc): Linear(in_features=5, out_features=5, bias=True)\r\n)\r\nLinear(in_features=5, out_features=5, bias=True)\r\n```\r\nas you can see the information about the plus equals operation or plus operation is not captured as it is not a nnmodule in the forward function. My goal is to be able to create a graph connection from the pytorch module object to say something like this in json :\r\n\r\n```\r\nlayers {\r\n&quot;fc&quot;: {\r\n&quot;inputTensor&quot; : &quot;t0&quot;,\r\n&quot;outputTensor&quot;: &quot;t1&quot;\r\n}\r\n&quot;addOp&quot; : {\r\n&quot;inputTensor&quot; : &quot;t1&quot;,\r\n&quot;outputTensor&quot; : &quot;t2&quot;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe input tensor names are arbitrary but it captures the essence of the graph and the connections between layers. \r\n\r\nMy question is, is there a way to extract the information from a pytorch object? I was thinking to use the .modules() but then realized that hand written operations are not captured this way as a module. I guess if everything is an nn.module then the .modules() might give me the network layer arrangement. Looking for some help here.

Especially since the titles change correctly.\r\n\r\nA little baffled, and been going about this for hours.

It obviously should be calling a controller method, but it just won&#39;t work. If I hit that url with the project running and put anything at the end of it, like https://localhost:44321/CreateNewChat/CreateChat?ChatName=TestName, that test name variable will get to the controller without a problem. If I hardcode to the code the &quot;TestName&quot; instead of passing the chatName variable I define earlier, it will get to the controller, no problem. Hell, if I debug the script, the chatName variable gets loaded correctly with my input, and if I console.log the url it will show up correctly (in fact, I can copy/paste that url and it will hit the controller method correctly). But, as the code is presented above, it will never, by any means, hit the controller. It will reach that point, and cut the execution as if there was an error in the JS code.

In this language, there are functor objects, these are kind of structs that can be called like a function:\r\n\r\n     struct Wrapper\r\n     {\r\n         /* this is what allows the struct to be called like a function: */\r\n         void operator()(/* can define arbitrary parameters here */)\r\n         { /* some implementation */ }\r\n     };\r\n\r\nIn other words, this would allow you to write code like:\r\n\r\n     Wrapper w; // actually, C++ does more here than C, but that&#39;s out of\r\n                // scope of this question...\r\n     w(); // possible due to the operator() defined above\r\n\r\nOK, now let&#39;s extend that a bit:\r\n\r\n     struct Wrapper\r\n     {\r\n         void(*m_f)(void); /* !!! */\r\n\r\n         void operator()(void) /* don&#39;t want any parameters... */\r\n         {\r\n             printf(&quot;before\\n&quot;);\r\n             m_f();\r\n             printf(&quot;after\\n&quot;);\r\n         }\r\n     };\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t want to go any deeper, a C++ developer would now deal with accessibility (such that the member `m_f` can only be used inside the class) and would provide a so-called constructor (for initialising `m_f` member appropriately). With all that, the final C++ code using the wrapper class might look like:\r\n\r\n     Wrapper decorate(void(*f)(void))\r\n     {\r\n         return Wrapper(f); // the fore-mentioned constructor gets called    \r\n     }\r\n\r\n     void test(void) { /* do something */ }\r\n\r\n     void demo(void)\r\n     {\r\n          Wrapper w = decorate(&amp;test);\r\n          w();\r\n     }\r\n\r\nWhy that excursion? Well, have a close look at one specific line:\r\n\r\n     void(*m_f)(void);\r\n\r\nYes, there is a member variable! Python actually does something similar internally.\r\n\r\nThe &#39;problem&#39; with C is that you cannot define your own function call operators. There&#39;s only the native one. So the big question is: *Where to store the function pointer?*\r\n\r\nYou could have a struct, storing the function pointer (analogously to the C++ solution), and pass that one to your own function emulating the function call operator. Actually, the C++ solution doesn&#39;t do anything else either, solely that all this is hidden behind syntactic sugar!\r\n\r\nAn equivalent C solution might look like this:\r\n\r\n    struct Wrapper\r\n    {\r\n        void(*m_f)(void);\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    void executeDecorated(Wrapper w)\r\n    {\r\n        printf(&quot;before\\n&quot;);\r\n        w.m_f();\r\n        printf(&quot;after\\n&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void demo(void)\r\n    {\r\n        Wrapper w = { &amp;someFunction };\r\n        executeDecorated(w);\r\n        /* do whatever else ... */\r\n        executeDecorated(w);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is probably the closest you can get in C (apart from that you might perhaps find better names).\r\n\r\nIf having a separate struct to store a function pointer brings you sufficient benefit or if you just want to pass the function pointer directly (`executeDecorated(&amp;someFunction)`, assuming the function was adjusted appropriately) is up to you to decide...\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252959/python-like-function-decorators-in-c/58253344#58253344","title":"Python-like function decorators in C"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12167984,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7f971cfad94f2f7a25e0cbcd300def8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ivancerosi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167984/ivancerosi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58253344,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570321987,"creation_date":1570316176,"question_id":58252959,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58252959","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to implement a Python-like function decorator in C using function pointers but I&#39;m getting weird segmentation fault error.\r\n\r\nIdea is that we have a **decorator** function which has inner function **wrapper**. Decorator then takes **some_function** as an argument, puts it inside the **wrapper** along with additional code and returns the **wrapper** function.\r\n\r\nVery simple function decorator in Python:\r\n```\r\ndef decorator(f):\r\n  def wrapper():\r\n    #do something before\r\n    f()\r\n    #do something after\r\n  return wrapper\r\n\r\ndef some_func():\r\n  print(&#39;Hello&#39;)\r\n\r\nsome_func = decorator(some_func)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that Python, unlike C, treats functions as first class objects but I&#39;m wondering if the same sort of functionality can be emulated in C by using **function pointers**.\r\n\r\nI tried this\r\n```\r\nvoid* do_twice(void (*func)())\r\n{\r\n  auto void wrapper()\r\n  { \r\n    func();\r\n    func(); \r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return &amp;wrapper;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid some_func()\r\n{ printf(&quot;Hello\\n&quot;); }\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n  void (*fun_ptr)() = &amp;some_func;\r\n  fun_ptr = decorator(fun_ptr);\r\n  fun_ptr();\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n```\r\nHello\r\nSegmentation fault\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow here is the funny bit. If I declare a variable inside **wrapper** like this:\r\n```\r\n  auto void wrapper()\r\n  {\r\n    int blah=5;\r\n    func();\r\n    func();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThen segmentation fault is fixed. Can someone explain why is this so? Apparently I&#39;m doing something wrong with the pointers and code is very unstable - seemingly unrelated additions to the main function will cause segmentation fault to pop again.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252959/python-like-function-decorators-in-c","title":"Python-like function decorators in C"},{"tags":["c++","dictionary","vector"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":26639,"user_id":3133316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30f0b31e22bec21f12f31cd30ae5b148?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PaulMcKenzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3133316/paulmckenzie"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570317749,"post_id":58252956,"comment_id":102876225,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252956/im-trying-to-access-specific-elements-in-a-vector-of-maps-in-c#comment102876225_58252956"},{"owner":{"reputation":1714,"user_id":2208372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce0f8d54e87a4835f7cf67694cad247f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Phil1970","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2208372/phil1970"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570317799,"post_id":58252956,"comment_id":102876232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252956/im-trying-to-access-specific-elements-in-a-vector-of-maps-in-c#comment102876232_58252956"},{"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":5763833,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":21,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ade086bb80c54b1a3fe567d5fd9720e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike1982","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5763833/mike1982"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570320045,"post_id":58252956,"comment_id":102876530,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252956/im-trying-to-access-specific-elements-in-a-vector-of-maps-in-c#comment102876530_58252956"},{"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":5763833,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":21,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ade086bb80c54b1a3fe567d5fd9720e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike1982","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5763833/mike1982"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570401005,"post_id":58252956,"comment_id":102891860,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252956/im-trying-to-access-specific-elements-in-a-vector-of-maps-in-c#comment102891860_58252956"},{"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":5763833,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":21,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ade086bb80c54b1a3fe567d5fd9720e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike1982","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5763833/mike1982"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570406456,"post_id":58252956,"comment_id":102892710,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252956/im-trying-to-access-specific-elements-in-a-vector-of-maps-in-c#comment102892710_58252956"}],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":5763833,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":21,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ade086bb80c54b1a3fe567d5fd9720e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike1982","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5763833/mike1982"},"last_editor":{"reputation":86,"user_id":5763833,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":21,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ade086bb80c54b1a3fe567d5fd9720e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike1982","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5763833/mike1982"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570402563,"creation_date":1570316156,"last_edit_date":1570402563,"question_id":58252956,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58252956","body_markdown":"I&#39;m having trouble with logic for this problem.

From 4 to 1 should be 0.5.

Just wanted to make sure everyone had a clear picture and all the details. Thanks in advance\r\n\r\nEdit: I updated code based on recommended and turn it into a 2d vector of maps.

In case you actually want an external redirection, so the visible URL in the browser to change, then that variant would do the job: \r\n\r\n    RewriteEngine on\r\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^admin\\.\r\n    RewriteRule ^/?(.*)$ https://www.example.com/admin/$1 [R=301]\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to start out with a 302 temporary redirection and only change that to a 301 permanent redirection later, once you are certain everything is correctly set up. That prevents caching issues while trying things out...\r\n\r\nIn case you receive an internal server error (http status 500) using the rule above then chances are that you operate a very old version of the apache http server. You will see a definite hint to an unsupported `[END]` flag in your http servers error log file in that case. You can either try to upgrade or use the older `[L]` flag, it probably will work the same in this situation, though that depends a bit on your setup. \r\n\r\nThis implementation will work likewise in the http servers host configuration or inside a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; file). Obviously the rewriting module needs to be loaded inside the http server and enabled in the http host. In case you use a dynamic configuration file you need to take care that it&#39;s interpretation is enabled at all in the host configuration and that it is located in the host&#39;s `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder. \r\n\r\nAnd a general remark: you should always prefer to place such rules in the http servers host configuration instead of using dynamic configuration files (&quot;.htaccess&quot;). Those dynamic configuration files add complexity, are often a cause of unexpected behavior, hard to debug and they really slow down the http server. They are only provided as a last option for situations where you do not have access to the real http servers host configuration (read: really cheap service providers) or for applications insisting on writing their own rules (which is an obvious security nightmare).

It&#39;s much more likely in asm, though.\r\n\r\nYou debug asm with a debugger, GDB for example.  See tips at the bottom of https://stackoverflow.com/tags/x86/info.  And if you make any system calls, use `strace` to see what your program is actually doing.\r\n\r\nTo debug this, you&#39;d run it under GDB and notice that it segfaulted on the first instruction, `movl $255, %ebx`.  It doesn&#39;t access memory so code-fetch must have faulted.  So there must be something wrong with your sections that resulted in your code in section linked into a non-executable segment of your executable.\r\n\r\n`objdump -d` would also have given you a hint: it disassembles the `.text` section by default, and this program doesn&#39;t have one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe reason `text` instead of `.text` causes this problem is that the defaults for sections with random names that aren&#39;t one of the few specially-recognized ones are read+write without exec.\r\n\r\nIn GAS, **use `.text` or `.data`**, special shortcut directives for `.section .text` or .data which avoid this problem for those sections.  https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Text.html  \r\n\r\n\r\nBut not all &quot;standard&quot; sections have special directives, you do still need `.section .rodata` to switch to the read-only data section, where you *should* have put your array.  (read, no write.  On newer toolchains, also no exec).  Instead of switching to the `.bss` section, though, you can use `.comm` or `.lcomm`  (https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/bss.html)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother possible problem is that you&#39;re building this 32-bit code as a 64-bit executable (unless you&#39;re using a 32-bit-only install where `as --32` is the default).  Using 32-bit addressing modes works in 64-bit modes, truncating the address to 32 bits.  That works when accessing static data in a position-dependent executable on Linux, because all code+data is linked into the low 2GiB of virtual address space.\r\n\r\nBut any access to `(%esp)` or `-4(%ebp)` or whatever would fault because the stack in a 64-bit process is mapped to a high address with non-zero bits outside the low 32.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d notice that problem in GDB because `layout reg` would show all 16 64-bit integer registers, RAX..R15.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252925/writing-and-debugging-a-min-program-in-asm/58252979#58252979","title":"Writing and debugging a min program in asm"}],"owner":{"reputation":217,"user_id":12050586,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eda18e4ccd41fabed19dbb80dd35db5b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tag C198","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12050586/tag-c198"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58252979,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570316832,"creation_date":1570315732,"last_edit_date":1570316088,"question_id":58252925,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58252925","body_markdown":"I am trying to write a program to find the minimum value of a list of integers in asm.

In cases where your ultimate goal is to generate alerts to feed orders to a third-party order execution app, and if your strategy happens to use fixed trade management parameters (as seems to be your case) then you may be able to get away with transferring those parameters into the third-party&#39;s order syntax through the alert messages your script generates, and thus delegate that part of trade management to the third-party app.\r\n\r\n2. Code all your trade management *manually* in Pine so that it works both in study and strategy modes and only relies on `strategy.*()` calls to have your strategy execute simple, generic market orders using none of the trade management `strategy.*()` parameters you are currently using. Once you&#39;ve achieved that, converting between study and strategy mode is a simple matter of commenting/uncommenting a few lines of code which are incompatible between study and strategy script modes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A good example of this is the *PineCoders Backtesting &amp; Trading Engine* here: https://www.tradingview.com/script/dYqL95JB-Backtesting-Trading-Engine-PineCoders/ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A simpler example of hybrid code that easily converts between strategy and study mode, but contains only elementary trade management logic is this: https://www.tradingview.com/script/pjZKWnHl-Volatility-System-by-Wilder-LucF/\r\n\r\nNote: A soon to be released dynamic message feature for alerts will allow you to generate alerts with series values (variable information). While this will still not allow automatic conversion of broker emulator logic into studies, it should make the conversion easier.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252918/converting-pine-script-into-study/58253362#58253362","title":"Converting Pine Script Into Study?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12170350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB53S8ijIPeo8bJikC-0WHumUcovtMRhN3D4U5L=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"omelly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170350/omelly"},"last_editor":{"reputation":600,"user_id":11806240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKD9K.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LucF - PineCoders","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11806240/lucf-pinecoders"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570385766,"creation_date":1570315666,"last_edit_date":1570385766,"question_id":58252918,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58252918","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to convert a TradingView strategy into a study with alerts.
