Here&#39;s a kludgy example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: swift --&gt;\r\n\r\n    class LeftSegmentedControl: UISegmentedControl {\r\n    \r\n        var margin : CGFloat = 10\r\n    \r\n        override func layoutSubviews() {\r\n            super.layoutSubviews()\r\n            leftJustifyItems()\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        func leftJustifyItems() {\r\n            let fontAttributes = titleTextAttributes(for: .normal)\r\n            let segments = numberOfSegments - 1\r\n            let controlWidth = frame.size.width\r\n            let segmentWidth = controlWidth / CGFloat(numberOfSegments)\r\n            for segment in 0...segments {\r\n                let title = titleForSegment(at: segment)\r\n                setWidth(segmentWidth, forSegmentAt: segment)\r\n                if let t = title {\r\n                    let titleSize = t.size(withAttributes: fontAttributes)\r\n                    let offset = (segmentWidth - titleSize.width) / 2 - margin\r\n                    self.setContentOffset(CGSize(width: -offset, height: 0), forSegmentAt: segment)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what it looks like:\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KgvR4.png&quot; width=&quot;310&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are a few caveats:\r\n\r\n- This version sets the segments to all have equal width, which might not be what you want.\r\n\r\n- I used a fixed left margin of 10px because it seems unlikely that you&#39;d want to vary that, but you can obviously change it or make it a settable property.\r\n\r\n- **Just because you *can* do this doesn&#39;t mean you should.** Personally, I don&#39;t think it looks great, and it suffers in the usability department too. Users expect segmented control items to be centered, and left-justifying the items will make it harder for them to know where to tap to hit the segment. That seems particularly true for short items like the one labelled &quot;3rd&quot; in the example. It&#39;s not terrible, it just seems a little weird.\r\n\r\n**Original answer:**\r\n\r\nUIControl (of which UISegmentedControl is a subclass) has a `contentHorizontalAlignment` property that&#39;s supposed to tell the control to align its content a certain way, so the logical thing to do would be to set it like this:\r\n\r\n    let segmented = UISegmentedControl(items: [&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Maybe&quot;])\r\n    segmented.frame = CGRect(x:75, y:250, width:250, height:35)\r\n    segmented.contentHorizontalAlignment = .left\r\n\r\nBut that doesn&#39;t work —&#160;you still get the labels centered. If you&#39;ve got a compelling use case for left-aligned segments, you should send the request to Apple.\r\n\r\nOne way you could work around this problem is to render your labels into images and then use the images as the segment labels instead of plain strings. Starting from the code in https://stackoverflow.com/q/30696307/643383, you could easily subclass UISegmentedControl to create images from the item strings.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015302/is-it-possible-to-set-the-alignment-of-segmented-control-titles-to-the-left/58028947#58028947","title":"Is it possible to set the alignment of segmented Control titles to the left?"}],"owner":{"reputation":161,"user_id":2826880,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":14,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fba751155c8a69bb5f6902a901ac62de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2826880/martin"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":83,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569247721,"creation_date":1568910355,"question_id":58015302,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015302","body_markdown":"I have been looking around for a way to set the alignment of the segmented control titles to the left but I don&#39;t seem to be able to achieve what I want.\r\n\r\nI have created this little function to change the frame of the subviews of the segment control.\r\nIt works at first.\r\n\r\n    \tfunc modifyFrameOfSegment() {\r\n\t\t   for segment in segmentedControl.subviews {\r\n\t\t      guard segment.subviews.isNotEmpty else { return }\r\n\t\t\t  segment.contentMode = .left\r\n\t\t\t   for label in segment.subviews where label is UILabel {\r\n\t\t\t\t  label.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: label.frame.origin.y, width: label.frame.size.width, height: label.frame.size.height)\r\n                  (label as!

Do any have faced the same problem or any idea about it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015301/when-ever-i-make-me-accounts-api-call-my-fb-app-gives-me-app-request-limit-re","title":"when ever i make &quot;me/accounts&quot; api call, my fb app gives me app request limit reached error.

assistance for assertions over siblings or ancestors of the element on which an assertion appears, XMLSpy should not be reporting differing validation results depending upon sibling or ancestor state.\r\n\r\n[W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 1: Structures][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; [**Validation Rule: Assertion Satisfied**][2]\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [...]\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1.3 From the &quot;partial&quot; &#183;post-schema-validation infoset&#183;, a data model instance is constructed as described in [XDM].

It is unclear to me where and how I execute this code such that it is active on my existing cluster. In addition to this, I want to have an ingress rule such that another ec2 instance I have can connect to the cluster and execute code within an aws VPC to maintain security and network performance. \r\n\r\nSo far I have managed to get a functional k8s cluster running with dask and jupyterhub running on it. I am using the sample helm chart found [here][2] which reference the docker image [here][3].  I can see this image does not even install dask-kubernetes. With that being said, I am able to connect to this cluster from my other ec2 instance using the exposed AWS dns server and execute custom code but this is not the kubernetes native dask cluster.\r\n\r\nI have worked on modifying the deploy yaml for kubernetes but it is unclear to me what I would need to change to have it use the proper kubernetes cluster/schedulers. I do know I need to modify the docker image I am using to have in install dask-kubernetes, but this still does not help me.

It means: I have a constant body of my Python scripts, which is exactly the same in all the different conditions, but due to the fact that I have several different conditions, there are some regions in those Python scripts that should be changed. Let&#39;s say this is my constant part, which is similar for all the conditions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nvariables = []\r\n\r\nfor i in range(100):\r\n variables.append(tempVariable)\r\n\r\nprint variables\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I have 4 different conditions, where `tempVariable` is calculated differently as:\r\n\r\nCondition 1: `tempVariable = i`\r\n\r\nCondition 2: `tempVariable = i**2`\r\n\r\nCondition 3: `tempVariable = i**3`\r\n\r\nCondition 4: `tempVariable = i + 4.34`\r\n\r\nNote that I don&#39;t want to use `if` statement to switch over these four conditions cause these conditions are in fact different cases and are not related together. At the end, I want to have `variables` for these four different conditions and cases independently. My idea is that to put these four cases or conditions into a txt file and treat the constant part of the Python script as an another txt file and iterate over all these four conditions or cases and add the necessary part for calculating the `tempVariable` before appending it into `variables`. Of course, it looks pretty ugly and more importantly I want to ship it to other people to be able to use it. I appreciate if there is any more nice and generic approach to it. In my real application, I have 94 different conditions or cases, which would be really ugly, if I want to put them under some `if` or `elif` statements.

Can we try a 256 x 256 framebuffer? \r\n\r\nyes, you&#39;d make 256x256 texture if you want to know the totals for each of the 65536 possible values \r\n\r\n&gt; 2) How to read through the pixels inside the vertex shader in case of 16 bit, below code is for 8-bit data, will it work for 16 bit as well? As I can&#39;t debug, so can&#39;t say whether it works or not:\r\n\r\nOf course you can debug. You try it and see if the results are correct. If they aren&#39;t you look at your code and or the error messages and try to figure out why. That&#39;s called debugging. Make a 1x1 texture, call your function, check if the histogram has the correct count of 1 for that 1x1 pixel input by calling `gl.readPixels`. Then try 2x1 or 2x2.\r\n\r\nIn any case you can&#39;t read `gl.RGBA16UI` textures with GLSL 1.0 es. You have to use version 300 es so if you actually want to create a separate bucket for all 65536 values then\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s some a WebGL2 GLSL 3.00 ES shader that will fill out the totals for values from 0 to 65535 in a 256x256 texture\r\n\r\n```\r\n#version 300 es\r\n\r\nuniform usampler2D u_texture;\r\nuniform uvec4 u_colorMult;\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  const int mipLevel = 0;\r\n\r\n  ivec2 size = textureSize(u_texture, mipLevel);\r\n\r\n  // based on an id (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) compute the pixel x, y for the source image\r\n  vec2 pixel = vec2(\r\n     gl_VertexID % size.x,\r\n     gl_VertexID / size.x);\r\n\r\n  // get the pixels but 0 out channels we don&#39;t want\r\n  uvec4 color = texelFetch(u_texture, pixel, mipLevel) * u_colorMult;\r\n\r\n  // add up all the channels. Since 3 are zeroed out we&#39;ll get just one channel\r\n  uint colorSum = color.r + color.g + color.b + color.a;\r\n\r\n  vec2 outputPixel = vec2(\r\n     colorSum % 256u,\r\n     colorSum / 256u);\r\n\r\n  // set the position to be over a single pixel in the 256x256 destination texture\r\n  gl_Position = vec4((outputPixel + 0.5) / 256.0 * 2.0 - 1.0, 0, 1);\r\n\r\n  gl_PointSize = 1.0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Example](https://jsfiddle.net/greggman/sawx4507/)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* In WebGL2 you don&#39;t need pixelID, you can use `gl_VertexID` so no need to setup any buffers or attributes. Just call \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    const numPixels = img.width * img.height;\r\n    gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS, 0, numPixels);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* You can use `textureSize` to get the size of a texture so no need to pass it in. \r\n\r\n* You can use `texelFetch` to get a single texel(pixel) from a texture. It takes integer pixel coordinates.\r\n\r\n* To read an unsigned integer texture format like RGBA16UI you have to use a `usampler2D` otherwise you&#39;ll get an error at draw time drawing to use an `RGBA16UI` texture on a `sampler2D` (this is how I know you weren&#39;t actually using a `RGBA16UI` texture because you would have gotten an error in the JavaScript console telling you and leading you to change your shader.\r\n\r\n* You still need to use a floating point texture as the target because the technique used requires blending but blending doesn&#39; work with integer textures (just in case you got the idea to try to use an integer based texture in the framebuffer)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015221/how-to-create-a-histogram-in-webgl2-using-16-bit-data/58036819#58036819","title":"How to create a histogram in WebGL2 using 16 bit data?"}],"owner":{"reputation":494,"user_id":3085578,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000754170769/picture?type=large","display_name":"subhfyu546754","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3085578/subhfyu546754"},"last_editor":{"reputation":494,"user_id":3085578,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000754170769/picture?type=large","display_name":"subhfyu546754","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3085578/subhfyu546754"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569216645,"creation_date":1568910027,"last_edit_date":1568977967,"question_id":58015221,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015221","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var gl, utils, pseudoImg, vertices;\r\n    var img = null;\r\n    document.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, () =&gt;

But I need to generate a 16 bit histogram using 16 bit texture.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how am sending the texture to GPU:\r\n\r\n\tvar tex = gl.createTexture(); // create empty texture\r\n\tgl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, tex);\r\n\tgl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.NEAREST);\r\n\tgl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, gl.NEAREST);\r\n\tgl.texImage2D(\r\n\t\tgl.TEXTURE_2D, // target\r\n\t\t0, // mip level\r\n\t\tgl.RGBA16UI, // internal format -&gt; gl.RGBA16UI\r\n\t\tw, h, // width and height\r\n\t\t0, // border\r\n\t\tgl.RGBA_INTEGER, //format -&gt; gl.RGBA_INTEGER\r\n\t\tgl.UNSIGNED_SHORT, // type -&gt; gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT\r\n\t\timg // texture data\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, take the working [example](https://jsfiddle.net/greggman/9amgpndt/) in mind, I am stuck with few things :\r\n\r\n1) How to create a 65536 X 1 framebuffer/texture to keep the 16 bit histogram as WebGL clearly says : `WebGL: INVALID_VALUE: texImage2D: width or height out of range`. Can we try a 256 x 256 framebuffer? I tried but stuck in point no. 2 below.\r\n\r\n2) How to read through the pixels inside the vertex shader in case of 16 bit, below code is for 8-bit data, will it work for 16 bit as well? As I can&#39;t debug, so can&#39;t say whether it works or not: \r\n\r\n\t&lt;script id=&quot;hist-vs&quot; type=&quot;not-js&quot;&gt;\r\n\tattribute float pixelId;\r\n\r\n\tuniform vec2 u_resolution;\r\n\tuniform sampler2D u_texture;\r\n\tuniform vec4 u_colorMult;\r\n\r\n\tvoid main() {\r\n\t// based on an id (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) compute the pixel x, y for the source image\r\n\tvec2 pixel = vec2(mod(pixelId, u_resolution.x), floor(pixelId / u_resolution.x));\r\n\r\n\t// compute corresponding uv center of that pixel\r\n\tvec2 uv = (pixel + 0.5) / u_resolution;\r\n\r\n\t// get the pixels but 0 out channels we don&#39;t want\r\n\tvec4 color = texture2D(u_texture, uv) * u_colorMult;\r\n\r\n\t// add up all the channels. Since 3 are zeroed out we&#39;ll get just one channel\r\n\tfloat colorSum = color.r + color.g + color.b + color.a;\r\n\r\n\t// set the position to be over a single pixel in the 256x1 destination texture\r\n\tgl_Position = vec4((colorSum * 255.0 + 0.5) / 256.0 * 2.0 - 1.0, 0.5, 0, 1);\r\n\r\n\tgl_PointSize = 1.0;\r\n\t}\r\n\t&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015221/how-to-create-a-histogram-in-webgl2-using-16-bit-data","title":"How to create a histogram in WebGL2

Thus, a URL `/api/v1/clients/client1/departments/department1/users` would work fine for those permissions.\r\n\r\nAlthough what I have works, I would like to use a more declarative way to deal with this if it is possible, ideally something based on Spring Security annotations and having into account I need to access PathVariable parameters, something like (I&#39;m making it up):\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RestController\r\n@RequestMapping(&quot;/api/v1/clients/{clientId}/departments/{departmentId}/users&quot;)\r\nclass UserRestController(private val userService: UserService) {\r\n\r\n    @PreAuthorize(&quot;#{principal.roles.contains(clientId:departmentId)}&quot;)\r\n    @GetMapping\r\n    fun getAll(principal: Principal, response: ServerHttpResponse,\r\n               @PathVariable clientId: String, @PathVariable departmentId: String): Flux&lt;Users&gt; {\r\n        return userService.getAll(clientId, departmentId)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes Spring Security support a way to do this?\r\nIf not, could you suggest any ideas to achieve it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015211/secure-a-spring-webflux-controller-considering-dynamic-parameters-with-spring-se","title":"Secure a Spring Webflux controller considering dynamic parameters with Spring Security annotations"},{"tags":["vue.js","webpack","vue-cli","vue2-google-maps"],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11329034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d02352d68a9d3796413d64482fcbdd22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"botivegh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11329034/botivegh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568909959,"creation_date":1568909959,"question_id":58015210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015210","body_markdown":"After installing vue2-google-maps with npm, I&#39;m trying to import the component to my main.js.

My code is here:\r\n```\r\n# Main function\r\ndef Mapdisplay(center, dicc, Tiles=&#39;OpenStreetMap&#39;, zoom_start=10):\r\n  mapViz = folium.Map(location=center, tiles=Tiles, zoom_start=zoom_start, control_scale=True)\r\n  for k, v in dicc.items():\r\n    if ee.image.Image in [type(x) for x in v.values()]:\r\n      folium.TileLayer(\r\n          tiles = EE_TILES.format(**v),\r\n          attr = &#39;Google Earth Engine&#39;,\r\n          overlay = True,\r\n          name = k\r\n      ).add_to(mapViz)\r\n    else:\r\n      folium.GeoJson(\r\n          data = v,\r\n          name = k\r\n      ).add_to(mapViz)\r\n  mapViz.add_child(folium.LayerControl())\r\n  return mapViz\r\n\r\n# NDWI calculation\r\nimage = ee.Image(&#39;LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_TOA/LC08_044034_20140318&#39;)\r\nndwi = image.normalizedDifference([&#39;B3&#39;, &#39;B5&#39;])\r\nndwiMasked = ndwi.updateMask(ndwi.gte(0.4))\r\nndwiId = ndwiMasked.getMapId({&#39;min&#39;: 0.5, &#39;max&#39;: 1, &#39;palette&#39;: [&#39;00ffff&#39;, &#39;0000ff&#39;]})\r\n\r\n# Function call\r\nMapdisplay([28.2096,83.9856], {&#39;NDWI masked&#39;: ndwiId})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://colab.research.google.com\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/csaybar/EEwPython/blob/master/2_eeImage.ipynb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015202/why-image-layer-is-not-displaying-in-google-earth-engine-using-jupyter-notebook","title":"Why image layer is not displaying in Google Earth Engine using jupyter notebook?"},{"tags":["mdx","mdx-query"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3741,"user_id":11461,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dTWcb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Magnus Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11461/magnus-smith"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569424862,"post_id":58015200,"comment_id":102595018,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015200/mdx-filter-crossjoin-having-count-different-from-one#comment102595018_58015200"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12091465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z4f0ihAwNYc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdPD6LZgRN9clTeTuC7qoXRI62oGw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mattia Fornale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12091465/mattia-fornale"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568909923,"creation_date":1568909923,"question_id":58015200,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015200","body_markdown":"I am very new to MDX and I am trying to do a crossoin and oil retrieve the entries which have a count different from one.

I have noticed a difference in returned values when using prepared statements vs a direct call to `query` on a `mysqli` object.\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$mysqli = new \\mysqli($host, $username, $pass, $db);\r\n$testSql = &#39;SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6)&#39;;\r\n\r\n$result = $mysqli-&gt;query($testSql);\r\n\r\n$returnedTimetime = $result-&gt;fetch_row()[0];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns a value in the format `Y-m-d H:i:s.u` - which you would expect.\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n```\r\n$mysqli = new \\mysqli($host, $username, $pass, $db);\r\n$testSql = &#39;SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6)&#39;;\r\n$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare($testSql);\r\n\r\n$stmt-&gt;execute();\r\n$result = $stmt-&gt;get_result();\r\n$row = $result-&gt;fetch_row();\r\n\r\n$returnedTimestamp = $row[0];\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow for some reason, this returns a value in the format `Y-m-d H:i:s` and honestly I have no idea why.\r\n\r\nI may be missing some sort of setting here, but any insight would be greatly appreciated - thanks.\r\n\r\nNote: I came across this because I am using doctrine (2.5.13).\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nThere is more info found here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22026570/php-how-to-return-datetime6-from-mysql \r\n\r\nbut no direct answer to using the mysqli adapter, rather this answers for using a PDO adapter.\r\n\r\n**Edit

I am very new to web development and I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this problem.  \r\n\r\nIs there a setting I need to enable in visual studio 2010?\r\nDoes the development server need to be configured a certain kind of way?\r\nWhat Am I missing?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, I&#39;ve literally never wrote or worked with javascript or html. So even the most basic solutions may be correct.  I was kind of thrown into this project, and it may be something fundamental that I am missing.\r\n\r\noh and for good measure here is where I think the definition is\r\n\r\n\r\n    var $JssorCaptionSlideo$ = window.$JssorCaptionSlideo$ = function (j, c, i){ $JssorDebug$.$Execute(function () { if (!c.$Transitions) $JssorDebug$.$Error(&quot;&#39;$CaptionSlideoOptions&#39; option

&#39;$CaptionSlideoOptions.$Transitions&#39; is not an array.&quot;) });\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015171/jssorcaptionslideo-is-undefined","title":"JssorCaptionSlideo is

select one radio button option and submit all selections in one instance in order to store back into the database. Also, questions are on different pages so basically user can move back and forth in order to edit its selection. There are 20 questions in total. I am unable to understand where shall I put my array logic. My best guess would be in a TestController.

The user can choose to deploy a single lambda or a group of lambdas, the code below, based on that input then determines which lambdas will be processed and uploaded to AWS.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the IF statement will check if the user is only deploying a single or more than one lambda.

If I switch to deploy the lambdas in group B (lambda-B) I get the above error.  However, if I deploy a single lambda from either of the groups the job deploys fine.\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior should be that a user can kick off the Jenkins job and deploy the Lambdas in group A and then proceed to trigger the job again to deploy the Lambdas in group B with no issues.\r\n\r\nAny help you folks can provide would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015161/jenkins-pipeline-question-using-if-statements","title":"Jenkins Pipeline question using IF

{search.value = matchList.textContent.trim()})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works if there&#39;s only one suggestion, if there&#39;s more, all the suggestions are inserted together.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be the fact that ```matchList``` is an object which returns a single HTML element.\r\nHow do I return an object which I can iterate over and place an ```onclick``` on every HTML suggestion within that object?\r\n\r\nOr, how do I return multiple objects, each containing one HTML suggestion on which I can then place an ```onclick```?\r\n\r\nOr some third option?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015157/inserting-autocomplete-html-suggestions-into-the-search-bar","title":"Inserting autocomplete HTML suggestions into the search bar"},{"tags":["django","search","filter","view","searchbar"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11304,"user_id":1252711,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08b41a1b3d93fd1233a518e340de31b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dirkgroten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1252711/dirkgroten"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568912286,"post_id":58015156,"comment_id":102435271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015156/searchbar-in-django-not-working-like-query-is-not-executed#comment102435271_58015156"},{"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":7658051,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb7iZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tms91","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7658051/tms91"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11304,"user_id":1252711,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08b41a1b3d93fd1233a518e340de31b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dirkgroten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1252711/dirkgroten"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568976399,"post_id":58015156,"comment_id":102455988,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015156/searchbar-in-django-not-working-like-query-is-not-executed#comment102455988_58015156"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":9557949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ji_AkXhjlTo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAt8/QBb6pAwbb4g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MUGOYA DIHFAHSIH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9557949/mugoya-dihfahsih"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568955489,"creation_date":1568955489,"answer_id":58022009,"question_id":58015156,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58022009","body_markdown":"I have been working on a similar project like yours but mine is a school management system.\r\nI have implemented a search bar and it is working perfectly.\r\n\r\nin **views.py**\r\n\r\n    def search_student(request):\r\n    student_list = DataStudent.objects.all()\r\n    student_filter = StudentFilter(request.GET, queryset=student_list)\r\n    return render(request, &#39;accounts/Students/Search/student_list.html&#39;, {&#39;filter&#39;: student_filter})\r\n\r\nand in **urls.py**\r\n\r\n    from django.conf.urls import url, include\r\n    from . import views\r\n    urlpatterns=[\r\n    url(r&#39;^search_student&#39;, views.search_student, name=&quot;search_student&quot;)\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nin **student_list.html**\r\n\r\n        {% extends &#39;base.html&#39;

This program is written in Delphi 5.  I have tried to update it to a newer release but several of the libraries I use no longer exist and it is a huge program with lots of libraries used.  \r\n\r\nThe program uses the ACAX##ENU.TLB type library that is provided with AutoCAD. Where ## changes for each AutoCAD release. Every time Autodesk sends out a new AutoCAD version I import the new type library and life goes on.  \r\n\r\nNow I am faced with Windows 10.  For some reason the automation links between my program and AutoCAD are not working in Windows 10.  Did something change about the way the type libraries work between Windows 7 and Windows 10?  Something that Delphi 5 is no longer compatible with?  Maybe it&#39;s a 16bit vs 32bit vs 64bit issue.  That is all over my head but I understand that Windows 10 dropped support for some 16bit operations.  But my program itself runs perfectly.  Even the BDE can be made to work which is amazing to me.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do for an experiment?  I am really lost about what to even experiment on.\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015114/autocad-type-library-not-working-in-windows-10","title":"AutoCAD type library not working in Windows 10"},{"tags":["apache-spark","java-8","apache-spark-sql","spark-java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3541,"user_id":638764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb4a7bc70d75f6aae16be8dddfa6f771?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mazaneicha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/638764/mazaneicha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568926062,"post_id":58015112,"comment_id":102440985,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015112/iterating-over-multiple-csvs-and-joining-with-spark-sql#comment102440985_58015112"},{"owner":{"reputation":314,"user_id":3058703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5127a4b53ffa1907f41985b0b6f61fc1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3058703","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3058703/user3058703"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3541,"user_id":638764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb4a7bc70d75f6aae16be8dddfa6f771?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mazaneicha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/638764/mazaneicha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568932327,"post_id":58015112,"comment_id":102442652,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015112/iterating-over-multiple-csvs-and-joining-with-spark-sql#comment102442652_58015112"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":314,"user_id":3058703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5127a4b53ffa1907f41985b0b6f61fc1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3058703","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3058703/user3058703"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568973210,"post_id":58019710,"comment_id":102454336,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015112/iterating-over-multiple-csvs-and-joining-with-spark-sql/58019710#comment102454336_58019710"},{"owner":{"reputation":314,"user_id":3058703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5127a4b53ffa1907f41985b0b6f61fc1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3058703","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3058703/user3058703"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568974573,"post_id":58019710,"comment_id":102455084,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015112/iterating-over-multiple-csvs-and-joining-with-spark-sql/58019710#comment102455084_58019710"},{"owner":{"reputation":3541,"user_id":638764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb4a7bc70d75f6aae16be8dddfa6f771?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mazaneicha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/638764/mazaneicha"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":314,"user_id":3058703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5127a4b53ffa1907f41985b0b6f61fc1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3058703","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3058703/user3058703"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568984141,"post_id":58019710,"comment_id":102459970,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015112/iterating-over-multiple-csvs-and-joining-with-spark-sql/58019710#comment102459970_58019710"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3541,"user_id":638764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb4a7bc70d75f6aae16be8dddfa6f771?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mazaneicha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/638764/mazaneicha"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3541,"user_id":638764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb4a7bc70d75f6aae16be8dddfa6f771?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mazaneicha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/638764/mazaneicha"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568983990,"last_edit_date":1568983990,"creation_date":1568933101,"answer_id":58019710,"question_id":58015112,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58019710","body_markdown":"**EDITED** based on feedback in the comments.\r\n\r\nFollowing your pattern, something like this would work:\r\n\r\n    Dataset&lt;Row&gt;

A new requirement is to create a graphQL interface to access the xmldocument. \r\nI have implemented the graphQL interface with extensions:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet\r\nhttps://github.com/graphql-dotnet/server\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I can create the fields dynamically from the XML file:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic ReferenceType(IRepository repository)\r\n{\r\n    var searchResult = repository.GetExampleForSchema();\r\n\r\n    foreach(var field in searchResult.Root.Elements())\r\n    {\r\n        if (!field.HasElements &amp;&amp; field.Attribute(json + &quot;Array&quot;) == null)\r\n        {\r\n            Field&lt;StringGraphType&gt;(field.Name.LocalName);\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            //TODO: Create child ObjectGraphTypes\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I can&#39;t find out how to return the result in my repository:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic dynamic Search()\r\n{\r\n    var searchResult = new ExpandoObject() as IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;;\r\n    //var searchResult = new { recordCount = 124345};\r\n    var xDocSearch = InternalSearch();\r\n    foreach (var field in xDocSearch.Root.Elements())\r\n    {\r\n        if (!field.HasElements &amp;&amp; field.Attribute(json + &quot;Array&quot;) == null)\r\n        {\r\n            var fieldName = field.Name.LocalName;\r\n            searchResult[fieldName] = field.Value;\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            //TODO: Create child objects\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return searchResult;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is, that GraphQL works with Reflection and uses this logic to read the field:\r\nhttps://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/blob/master/src/GraphQL/Resolvers/NameFieldResolver.cs\r\n\r\nThe ExpandoObject does not have my example recordCount as a property. When I create an anonymous type (see the commented line) it works.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a possibility to create a type with dynamic properties which can be accessed by reflections? (Can&#39;t influence how the value is read)\r\n\r\n2. Is there maybe another way in the GraphQL Extension to solve this issue? Can I configure how the value is read?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to some hints and tips! \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMichael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015107/asp-net-core-graphql-from-xml-document","title":"Asp.net core GraphQL from XML Document"},{"tags":["ios","core-graphics","uislider"],"owner":{"reputation":6953,"user_id":436976,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca5523dd495f8c0a6a6b20db65db2ef4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"stevendesu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/436976/stevendesu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568909519,"creation_date":1568909519,"question_id":58015106,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015106","body_markdown":"In an attempt to resolve https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58013924/uislider-height-not-adjusting-correctly myself, I did a bunch of research and experimentation and found that I can override the UISlider class and implement my own `thumbImageForState` and `trackRectForBounds` methods to draw everything at my desired size. For now, I have the following\r\n\r\n```\r\n@implementation SeekBar\r\n- (CGRect)trackRectForBounds:(CGRect)bounds\r\n{\r\n    // Creates a track that is 1/4th the height of the View,\r\n    // centered in the View&#39;s bounds\r\n    return CGRectMake(0, bounds.size.height * 3 / 8, bounds.size.width, bounds.size.height / 4);\r\n}\r\n\r\n- (UIImage *)thumbImageForState:(UIControlState)state\r\n{\r\n    // For all states, just generate a circle whose height\r\n    // and width is based on our bounds\r\n    float radius = MIN(self.bounds.size.height, self.bounds.size.width);\r\n    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(CGSizeMake(radius, radius));\r\n    CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\r\n    CGContextSetRGBFillColor(context, 1, 1, 1, 1);\r\n    CGContextFillEllipseInRect(context, CGRectMake(0, 0, radius, radius));\r\n    UIImage *thumbRect = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();\r\n    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();\r\n    return thumbRect;\r\n}\r\n@end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis &quot;works&quot;, in that I&#39;m able to override the UISlider class, and I can observe changes to the appearance of the bar as I modify these two methods. I can change the circle&#39;s color, I can change the track&#39;s width, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever the final circle being generated by `thumbImageForState` exceeds the bounds of the slider and is getting clipped. See the image below (ignore the UILabels, getting their sizing correct is my ***next*** project):\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nLook carefully at the left and bottom of the circle and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s cropped. Why is this happening? I&#39;m setting the bounding rectangle for the ellipse to exactly match the height of the slider, so it shouldn&#39;t be too tall. Furthermore the slider is much wider than the ellipse, so it shouldn&#39;t be too wide.\r\n\r\n  [1]:
