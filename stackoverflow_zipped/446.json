All we would like to do is be able to keep track of when this memory dump happens and on what server, as indicated by the existence of these files. However, as far as I know, Splunk would not be able to track these files, since it would be scanning a folder looking for new .dmp files, and not indexing a log file that is then searched on.\r\n\r\nWe have indexes set up for wineventlog, perfmon, and mssql, but to my knowledge, a SQL server memory dump event is not actually logged in any of the related sources types like the general SQL server error log (a related event might, but it would not indicate itself as being related to a memory dump). I might be wrong about this though, and perhaps someone can correct me that this is logged somewhere common that Splunk would be able to consume.\r\n\r\nI have also considered that there is a view (sys.dm_server_memory_dumps) that records these events, but we only know of two ways to get that into splunk. One is to set up a sql agent job that would query that table and output it as a file that splunk can then ingest, or to use the sql db connection plugin with splunk, but this has the issue that as far as I know it doesn&#39;t use a connection pool, which is a problem for us.\r\n\r\nI am wondering how the community has approached this problem, any input appreciated, thank you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433471/using-splunk-to-track-memory-dumps-in-sql-server","title":"Using splunk to track memory dumps in sql server?"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","try-catch","referenceerror"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":189,"user_id":2140009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d43b8ed0d4593e9221f0a0f6364a5ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vipul Patil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2140009/vipul-patil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318078,"post_id":58433470,"comment_id":103207544,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block#comment103207544_58433470"},{"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318386,"post_id":58433470,"comment_id":103207748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block#comment103207748_58433470"},{"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":11008341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/418616dad06c014091a6f85c66ffe61a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jens G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11008341/jens-g"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":189,"user_id":2140009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d43b8ed0d4593e9221f0a0f6364a5ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vipul Patil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2140009/vipul-patil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318586,"post_id":58433470,"comment_id":103207873,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block#comment103207873_58433470"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":503,"user_id":3662748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8acc15309c4109ea00f420a59be35a47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3662748/sam"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571318781,"creation_date":1571318781,"answer_id":58433823,"question_id":58433470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433823","body_markdown":"inside your customFile.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst sendErrorNotification = (source, reason, scriptposition) =&gt; { \r\n  ...something and write a mail... \r\n}\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  sendErrorNotification: sendErrorNotification\r\n}\r\n  \r\n```\r\n\r\nthen, in your main.js file, call it like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst ourCustomClassFile = require(&#39;./customFile&#39;);\r\n...\r\nourCustomClassFile.sendErrorNotification(..)\r\n...\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block/58433823#58433823","title":"Used Reference in javascript is not available inside the catch-Block"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":11008341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/418616dad06c014091a6f85c66ffe61a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jens G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11008341/jens-g"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58433823,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571318781,"creation_date":1571317756,"question_id":58433470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58433470","body_markdown":"Inside our Javascript-Code we have a try...catch-block.

Specifically, the Remarks.\r\n&gt;This method is implemented by using deferred execution. The immediate return value is an object that stores all the information that is required to perform the action. The query represented by this method is not executed until the object is enumerated either by calling its GetEnumerator method directly or by using foreach in Visual C# or For Each in Visual Basic.\r\n\r\nWhich means that when you call `Where` you&#39;re not necessarily getting back an object such as a `List` or `Array` that just has X number of items in it. You&#39;re getting back an object that knows how to filter the `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` you called `Where` on, based on the predicate you provided. When you iterate that object, such as with a `foreach` loop or a call to `Enumerable.Count()` each item in the source `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` is evaluated against the predicate you provided and only the items that satisfy that predicate are returned.\r\n\r\nSince the predicate you&#39;re providing checks the `Sequence` property, and you&#39;re modifying that property inside the first `foreach` loop, the second time you iterate `entitiesToUpdateSequence` fewer items match the predicate you provided and so you get a lower count. If you were to increment `Sequence` instead of decrement it, you might end up with a higher count the second time you iterate `entitiesToUpdateSequence`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433455/one-item-gets-deleted-while-iterating-an-ienumerablet/58434797#58434797","title":"One item gets deleted while iterating an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;"}],"owner":{"reputation":580,"user_id":6602469,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b72328705a6443ee9ea8f1722e41ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ravi kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6602469/ravi-kumar"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58434797,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571322464,"creation_date":1571317698,"question_id":58433455,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58433455","body_markdown":"I have a method that takes an IEnumerable&lt;Entity&gt;, filters it further and loops through the filtered collection\r\nto modify one property.\r\n\r\nI am observing a very weird behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhile the method loops through the filtered `IEnumerable&lt;Entity&gt;`, after a few iterations (I&#39;ve not exactly counted how many), \r\none of the items in it gets deleted.\r\n\r\n    private async Task&lt;bool&gt; UpdateSomeValue(IEnumerable&lt;BusinessEntity&gt; entities, BusinessEntity entityToDelete)\r\n    {\r\n    \t//FIlter the IENumerable\r\n    \t\tvar entitiesToUpdateSequence = entities\r\n    \t\t\t\t.Where(f =&gt; f.Sequence &gt; entityToDelete.Sequence);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tif (entitiesToUpdateSequence.Any())\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\tvar testList = new List&lt;FormBE&gt;(entitiesToUpdateSequence);\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(entitiesToUpdateSequence.Count()); // 5\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\t//DUring this loop, after a few iterations, one item gets deleted\r\n    \t\t\t\tforeach (var entity in testList)\r\n    \t\t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\tentity.Sequence -= 1;\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(entitiesToUpdateSequence.Count()); // 4\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn await _someRepo.UpdateEntitySequence(entityToDelete.Id1, entityToDelete.ID2, testList);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\treturn await Task.FromResult(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTHis method is called like this:\r\n\r\n    var entities = await entitiesTask.ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n    var entityToDelete = entities.Single(f =&gt; f.Key.Equals(&quot;someValue&quot;));\r\n    var updated = await UpdateSomeValue(entities, entityToDelete);\r\n\r\nand that&#39;s it, there&#39;s no other reference to the `entities` collection.

Human resource management Talent development was one of our strategic priorities in FY 19 and the focus was on talent refactoring on the new age skills and getting our leadership talent ready to take on larger roles as we expanded across geographies and delivered new services. 466 leaders at level senior managers and above were covered in focused leadership programs such as business storytelling, consulting skills, executive presence, digital transformation, etc. Talent refactoring was a major focus with coverage of 12500+ BPM employees across all levels trained on new age skills like RPA, analytics and digital. This had a huge impact on our talent and business metrics. 100% of the nominated resources from the pool of reskilled workforce, have either progressed or promoted in their roles. 55% of the ‘Be The Navigator Projects’ in FY 19 were led by reskilled employees, which translated into benefits of USD 65.8 mil; FTE reduction: 321.5. Lex Adoption was another key area where we saw 45% of the employees using Lex for continuous development. To support clients and business, the teams worked collaboratively between the client, Infosys sales business teams, other partners and various functions of HR to ensure smooth and noise free people transfers from other organizations to Infosys. There were 3 major people transfer solutions conceptualized and smoothly executed with sensitivity during the course of the year. It has been a flagship year for BPM in terms of commitment to the Employee Value Proposition of careers for two reasons – 1. Launch of Project Ascent for succession planning and pipeline building. 2. Revamping of Internal Job Posting policy to cater to new age talent and their aspirations. The performance management. practice strived to enable mangers through MOT (Moment of Truth) – the performance calibration sessions. There are 8 units which have covered some milestones in this journey. The Talent Acquisition function despite increasing spread and focus on niche and disparate skill sets, has performed quite admirably in delivering what is expected by the organization. This year saw many new skill sets as part of requirements including latest technologies, digital, automation, analytics, in line with our overall vision. Several new initiatives were implemented including new assessment methods and automation initiatives to ensure focus on internal processes and external compliance. &quot;\r\nsents=nltk.sent_tokenize(para)\r\n#print(sents)\r\n\r\nrd=nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar.CFG)\r\nfor sent in sents:\r\n    tokens=list(nltk.word_tokenize(sent))\r\n    print(tokens)\r\n    for tree in rd.parse(tokens):\r\n        print(tree)\r\n\r\nBut i am receiving the error \r\nTypeError: __init__() missing 2 required positional arguments: &#39;start&#39; and &#39;productions\r\nNot sure how to instantiate the grammar.CFG class.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433452/instantiate-grammar-cfg-class-in-nltk","title":"instantiate grammar.CFG class in nltk"},{"tags":["json","flask","numpy-ndarray"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":627,"user_id":4032503,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XZyGYGtRux0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACPo/xgHTSkTRldM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"noslenkwah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4032503/noslenkwah"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571318057,"creation_date":1571318057,"answer_id":58433558,"question_id":58433450,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433558","body_markdown":"I think you forgot the json step\r\n\r\n    return jsonify({&#39;predictions&#39; : predictionsIm.tolist()})","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433450/how-to-send-ndarray-response-from-flask-server-to-python-client/58433558#58433558","title":"How to send ndarray response from flask server to python client?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7272379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8072a94417d2631e764c25c0629b823?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fariha Abbasi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7272379/fariha-abbasi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571320690,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571320775,"creation_date":1571317686,"question_id":58433450,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58433450","body_markdown":"I am trying to send ndarray (predictionsIm) of shape (1536,1536,3) from flask server to the python client.\r\nI read around for converting predictionsIm (ndarray) to list and then return the json, so I did as below:\r\n\r\n    return {&#39;predictions&#39; : predictionsIm.tolist()}\r\n\r\nbut I don&#39;t know how to handle it on client slide, can someone help in this approach?\r\n\r\nor suggest a better approach?

looks pretty straight forward, actually: \r\n\r\n    RewriteEngine on\r\n    RewriteRule ^/?api/dev/v1/(.*)$ /api/v1/$1 [END]\r\n\r\nIn case you receive an internal server error (http status 500) using the rule above then chances are that you operate a very old version of the apache http server. You will see a definite hint to an unsupported `[END]` flag in your http servers error log file in that case. You can either try to upgrade or use the older `[L]` flag, it probably will work the same in this situation, though that depends a bit on your setup. \r\n\r\nThis implementation will work likewise in the http servers host configuration or inside a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; file). Obviously the rewriting module needs to be loaded inside the http server and enabled in the http host. In case you use a dynamic configuration file you need to take care that it&#39;s interpretation is enabled at all in the host configuration and that it is located in the host&#39;s `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder. \r\n\r\nAnd a general remark: you should always prefer to place such rules in the http servers host configuration instead of using dynamic configuration files (&quot;.htaccess&quot;). Those dynamic configuration files add complexity, are often a cause of unexpected behavior, hard to debug and they really slow down the http server. They are only provided as a last option for situations where you do not have access to the real http servers host configuration (read: really cheap service providers) or for applications insisting on writing their own rules (which is an obvious security nightmare). \r\n\r\nFor this to work the rewriting module needs to be loaded into the http server, obviously. In addition, if you decide to use a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; style file) despite what I explained above, then you need to enable the interpretation of such file for the requested location (look for `AllowOverride` in the apache documentation). The file needs to be placed in the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder of the http host responding to the request and it needs to be readable by the http server process. And of course it needs to have valid syntax. If all that is given and things still do not work, then you definitely should take a look into your http server&#39;s error log file. That is where the engine will log all issues it runs into. You need to monitor that file anyway when working on implementations in a web environment, no way around that.

I mean, if the job of 1:00 PM is still running and retrieving the records from 12:00 AM to 1:00PM, can the 2:00 PM job start and retrieve the records from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433409/overlapping-cron-scheduled-job-on-nifi","title":"Overlapping CRON scheduled job on NiFi"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","material-ui"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318144,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103207590,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103207590_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318833,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103208027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103208027_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":2308,"user_id":4605629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/741edb45b2f1d3e3c3d9555085004ad1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Greg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4605629/greg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571319153,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103208224,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103208224_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":2308,"user_id":4605629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/741edb45b2f1d3e3c3d9555085004ad1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Greg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4605629/greg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571320898,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103209246,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103209246_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571321493,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103209645,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103209645_58433408"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":9128145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1069597106462814/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sibasish Mohanty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9128145/sibasish-mohanty"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571317954,"creation_date":1571317954,"answer_id":58433535,"question_id":58433408,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433535","body_markdown":"Your ```&lt;TextField /&gt;``` component needs to be wrapped inside ```&lt;form&gt;

Right not the link only works if you press is on the `a` tag only. Is it possible to do it, without changing the HTML structure?\r\n\r\n**So the main things:**\r\n\r\n 1. The height of the `&lt;li&gt;` item can vary, because of the contents inside, but not the width and I am trying to make all of them the same height.\r\n 2. Make the whole `&lt;li&gt;` area clickable, so it would redirect to the `&lt;a&gt;` tag reference page. Without changing the current structure.\r\n 3. Center the content in `&lt;li&gt;` tag and don&#39;t overflow the container.\r\n 4. In the example, the content inside the last `&lt;li&gt;` element, the text, and the `&lt;a&gt;` tag is in the same line. How could I properly make them in different lines?\r\n\r\nIn the example below, it is the typical structure I need to style.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .ul {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .test1 {\r\n      display: inline-flex;\r\n      min-height: 100px;\r\n      width: 100px;\r\n      list-style: none;\r\n      background-color: #9affda;\r\n      color: black;\r\n      margin: 0px 10px;\r\n      border-radius: 10px;\r\n      align-items: center;\r\n      vertical-align: top;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;ul&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;Test text &lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;Test text &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nI have tried multiple approaches but every time something would go wrong [*look at the main things I am trying to do*].

trying to work with Audio on Python 3.7 on Mac(Catalina) only with the built-in Microphone and Speakers.\r\nMy Problem is that with any code I tried, when recording I receive nothing and when playing sound nothing comes out. \r\nI tried the answers from this [question][1]: first I tried with PyAudio like this:\r\n```\r\nimport pyaudio\r\nimport wave\r\n\r\nCHUNK = 1024\r\nFORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16\r\nCHANNELS = 2\r\nRATE = 44100\r\nRECORD_SECONDS = 5\r\nWAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = &quot;output.wav&quot;\r\n\r\np = pyaudio.PyAudio()\r\nstream = p.open(format=FORMAT,\r\n                channels=CHANNELS,\r\n                rate=RATE,\r\n                input=True,\r\n                frames_per_buffer=CHUNK)\r\n\r\nprint(&quot;* recording&quot;)\r\nframes = []\r\nfor i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)):\r\n    data = stream.read(CHUNK)\r\n    frames.append(data)\r\nprint(&quot;* done recording&quot;)\r\n\r\nstream.stop_stream()\r\nstream.close()\r\np.terminate()\r\nwf = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, &#39;wb&#39;)\r\nwf.setnchannels(CHANNELS)\r\nwf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT))\r\nwf.setframerate(RATE)\r\nwf.writeframes(b&#39;&#39;.join(frames))\r\nwf.close()\r\n ```\r\nWhich returns me a silent file.\r\n\r\nThen I tried with SoundDevice:\r\n```\r\nimport sounddevice as sd\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nfs = 44100                      # frames per sec\r\nsd.default.samplerate = fs\r\nsd.default.channels = 2\r\n\r\nduration = 3.0                  # Aufnahmezeit\r\nrecording = sd.rec( int( duration * fs) )\r\nprint(&quot;* recording&quot;)\r\nsd.wait()\r\nprint(&quot;* done!&quot;)\r\n\r\nt = [ i for i in range( int( duration * fs) )]\r\n\r\nplt.plot(t, recording, &#39;r-&#39;)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\nWich returns an array filled with zeros: [Screenshot of the Plot][2].\r\n Both didn&#39;t cause any errors or warnings.\r\n\r\nAfter that I tried to play a simple Sin-Wave with 440 Hz, the speaker stayed silent.\r\n\r\nThe same code, works on my friends mac without problems. The Microphone &amp; Speakers are also working fine. And in System Preferences I allowed every app to use the microphone. \r\n\r\nThis [person][3] seems to have a similar issue. Also tried [this code][4] without result. :(\r\n\r\nI have no idea what else I could try to fix this.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Then I decided to develop an asynchronous GUI chat program. \r\n\r\nThe server side is running on console. The server is managing the communication process between clients. \r\n\r\nI have two client programs. One of them is a console, the other one is a GUI program. When the console program sends messages, they are printed on the Text widget of the GUI program. \r\n\r\nHowever when I sent messages on the GUI program, the messages are displayed on the console window of the other client program only after the client which runs on console writes messages to the other client.\r\n\r\nThe `write` function of the console program is as follows:\r\n```\r\n    async def write(self, writer):\r\n        t = threading.Thread(\r\n            target=lambda: writer.write(\r\n                f&quot;{self.nick}: {sys.stdin.readline()}&quot;.encode()\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n        t.daemon = True\r\n        t.start()\r\n        t.join(0.1)\r\n        await writer.drain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function accomplishes the task as I want.\r\n\r\nThe `write` function of the GUI program is as follows:\r\n```\r\n    async def write(self, writer):\r\n        if self.data:\r\n            data = self.data\r\n            self.data = &quot;&quot;\r\n            t = threading.Thread(\r\n                target=lambda: writer.write(\r\n                    f&quot;{self.nick}: {data}\\n&quot;.encode()\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n            t.daemon = True\r\n            t.start()\r\n            t.join(0.1)\r\n            await writer.drain()\r\n        else:\r\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\r\n```\r\nAnd this function is not working as I want.\r\n\r\n`self.data` is a variable that gets the text in the `tk.Entry` field. It was defined in the `__init__` function of the class.\r\n```\r\n        self.entry = tk.Entry(\r\n            master=self.bottom_frame,\r\n            width=50\r\n        )\r\n        self.entry.pack()\r\n        self.entry.bind(&quot;&lt;Return&gt;&quot;, lambda event: self.callback())\r\n\r\n        self.data = &quot;&quot;\r\n```\r\nThe `self.callback()` function is as follows:\r\n```\r\n    def callback(self):\r\n        self.data = self.entry.get()\r\n        self.entry.delete(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;end&quot;)\r\n        self.update()\r\n        self.update_idletasks()\r\n```\r\nSo, what I was trying to do here was, when I press the `&lt;Return&gt;`, the content of the `self.entry` is passed to `self.data` variable. According to the `self.write` function, there&#39;s a condition like `if self.data` which is used for sending messages when `self.data` is not an empty value. If the condition is not met, I decided to wait the function with `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)`.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the gui program reads the messages without any problem, however it can&#39;t send messages asynchronously to the console client program. The console client program needs to send a new message to see the messages come from the GUI client.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do to send messages asynchronously on GUI application?\r\n\r\nBelow are the whole codes:\r\n\r\n**Server:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/q04w3et3huegrao/server.py\r\n\r\n**Client1:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/h7seeuoylvnpezq/client1.py\r\n\r\n**Client2:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/uz4zn3vjfcc3mrj/client2.py","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433322/using-entry-widget-as-stdin-in-asynchronous-chat-program","title":"Using entry widget as stdin in asynchronous chat program"},{"tags":["flutter","flutter-layout"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1032,"user_id":6045409,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1127001433f2ab5bbab9523853e3e4e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tokenyet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6045409/tokenyet"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571320204,"post_id":58433320,"comment_id":103208874,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433320/flutter-how-catch-back-buttonhardware-event#comment103208874_58433320"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":3908065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002559418634/picture?type=large","display_name":"Igor Kharakhordin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3908065/igor-kharakhordin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571317811,"creation_date":1571317811,"answer_id":58433491,"question_id":58433320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433491","body_markdown":"I guess you can wrap your widgetB in [WillPopScope][1] widget.

not sure if this question was asked before, but I&#39;ve been always wondering why every instance of `Throwable`, unless the `fillInStackTrace` method is overridden/suppressed, fills its stacktrace in the constructor while being instantiated by default.\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    final class ThrowableTest {\r\n    \r\n        private ThrowableTest() {}\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(final String... args) throws Throwable { throw go(); }\r\n        private static Throwable go() { return goDeep(); }\r\n        private static Throwable goDeep() { return goDeeper(); }\r\n        private static Throwable goDeeper() { return goEvenDeeper(); }\r\n        private static Throwable goEvenDeeper() { return new Throwable(); }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\nExecuting the code above would produce the following output:\r\n\r\n    Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Throwable\r\n        at ThrowableTest.goEvenDeeper(scratch.java:9)\r\n        at ThrowableTest.goDeeper(scratch.java:8)\r\n        at ThrowableTest.goDeep(scratch.java:7)\r\n        at ThrowableTest.go(scratch.java:6)\r\n        at ThrowableTest.main(scratch.java:5)\r\n        \r\nI would find the following hypothetical stacktrace more intuitive (assuming the `fillInStackTrace` method is not overridden and the `Throwable` constructor does not invoke it in such a &quot;special&quot; JRE): \r\n\r\n    Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Throwable\r\n        at ThrowableTest.main(scratch.java:5)\r\n        \r\nI&#39;m wondering: why is the stacktrace filled in the constructor (in its simplest scenario) rather than at the exception throwing site using `throw`?\r\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, there are some scenarios when `fillInStackTrace` can be used to configure the exception to be (re)thrown, and the `throw` as described would re-write the stacktrace to the current one.\r\nBut if so, the `throw` statement (and the `athrow` instruction) might check if the stacktrace of the exception is set to `null` before filling it up on its own (assuming that throwing something other than an instance of `Throwable` is undefined as it&#39;s described in the specification).\r\nWhat was the design choice behind it?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433278/why-do-throwable-instances-get-their-stacktrace-filled-in-during-instantiation-r","title":"Why do Throwable instances get their stacktrace

Therefore, I have tried to import the data with wp-import-all pro plugin on my  website. The website is running wordpress and woocommerce with the extension woocommerce products. I have bought a theme from envato which comes along with its own plugins and one that I have to mention: shortcodes.\r\n\r\nNow my website was giving 500 internal server error in first place after importing all the product. No any errors where showed/logged (although I had turned on WP_DEBUG, WP_DEBUG_LOG and WP_DISPLAY ERRORS) on the apache error_log and wp-conent/debug.log.\r\n\r\nStill, I managed to figure out by trying step by step my own debug method. I turned off all plugins one by one and it turned out that the automatic_shortcode plugin that comes along with the theme was causing the error. Then I tried the plugin before importing the data and that worked out well. No 500 error was thrown. Consequently, I imported the data again in segments in hope to see that some of the data was containing bad content. And as a result I found out after 400 records that one record was causing the issue. \r\n\r\nIn my database I removed every field on that record expect the ID cell. Strangly this empty record with a specific ID was causing the issue. I changed the ID to somewhere in ten thousands and my website worked again. After that I import the rest of my product but the same error occured again. Later I figured out that the ID was a mismatch, and I found out that the post_status of these records where causing the issue. But I checked all the values of these records and all are set on post_status = publish.\r\n\r\nWhen I update the records with post_status = empty my site works well, but as you already guessed the post are then not shown.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMy question is now if someone experienced sees a the problem in my case? \r\nI am thinking (after I almost read all stackoverflow post) maybe I have to resave the product posts manually so that it can generate something or some (short)code to succesfully open or show it correctly. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433271/internal-server-error-after-importing-products-woocommerce","title":"internal server error after importing products woocommerce"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9170}{"items":[{"tags":["excel","excel-formula"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13469,"user_id":9758194,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2eG6f.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JvdV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9758194/jvdv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571320579,"post_id":58433762,"comment_id":103209083,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433503/excel-nth-smallest-distinct-value/58433762#comment103209083_58433762"},{"owner":{"reputation":104684,"user_id":4851590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xlEi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Craner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4851590/scott-craner"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13469,"user_id":9758194,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2eG6f.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JvdV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9758194/jvdv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571320784,"post_id":58433762,"comment_id":103209193,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433503/excel-nth-smallest-distinct-value/58433762#comment103209193_58433762"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":104684,"user_id":4851590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xlEi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Craner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4851590/scott-craner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":104684,"user_id":4851590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xlEi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Craner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4851590/scott-craner"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571320051,"last_edit_date":1571320051,"creation_date":1571318646,"answer_id":58433762,"question_id":58433503,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433762","body_markdown":"If one has access to the dynamic array formulas (currently only available to office 365 insiders) one can just put this in the first cell and the results will spill across:\r\n\r\n    =SMALL(UNIQUE(A:A),SEQUENCE(,5))\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther wise we need to use some array formula in a specific manner.\r\n\r\nWe must have something besides a number in the cell directly preceding where we put the formula in the first cell.

implements LifecycleObserver {\r\n            private GroupServerRepository repository;\r\n            @Inject\r\n            public GroupPresenter(GroupServerRepository repository){\r\n                this.repository = repository;\r\n            }\r\nComponent:\r\n\r\n        @Component\r\n        interface GroupComponent{\r\n            GroupPresenter getPresenter();\r\n

         return new GroupServerRepository();\r\n        }\r\nBut instead of this, i have next one:\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public GroupPresenter getPresenter() {\r\n            return new GroupPresenter(new GroupServerRepository());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public GroupServerRepository getRepository() {\r\n            return new GroupServerRepository();\r\n

All we would like to do is be able to keep track of when this memory dump happens and on what server, as indicated by the existence of these files. However, as far as I know, Splunk would not be able to track these files, since it would be scanning a folder looking for new .dmp files, and not indexing a log file that is then searched on.\r\n\r\nWe have indexes set up for wineventlog, perfmon, and mssql, but to my knowledge, a SQL server memory dump event is not actually logged in any of the related sources types like the general SQL server error log (a related event might, but it would not indicate itself as being related to a memory dump). I might be wrong about this though, and perhaps someone can correct me that this is logged somewhere common that Splunk would be able to consume.\r\n\r\nI have also considered that there is a view (sys.dm_server_memory_dumps) that records these events, but we only know of two ways to get that into splunk. One is to set up a sql agent job that would query that table and output it as a file that splunk can then ingest, or to use the sql db connection plugin with splunk, but this has the issue that as far as I know it doesn&#39;t use a connection pool, which is a problem for us.\r\n\r\nI am wondering how the community has approached this problem, any input appreciated, thank you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433471/using-splunk-to-track-memory-dumps-in-sql-server","title":"Using splunk to track memory dumps in sql server?"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","try-catch","referenceerror"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":189,"user_id":2140009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d43b8ed0d4593e9221f0a0f6364a5ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vipul Patil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2140009/vipul-patil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318078,"post_id":58433470,"comment_id":103207544,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block#comment103207544_58433470"},{"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318386,"post_id":58433470,"comment_id":103207748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block#comment103207748_58433470"},{"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":11008341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/418616dad06c014091a6f85c66ffe61a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jens G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11008341/jens-g"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":189,"user_id":2140009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d43b8ed0d4593e9221f0a0f6364a5ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vipul Patil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2140009/vipul-patil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318586,"post_id":58433470,"comment_id":103207873,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block#comment103207873_58433470"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":503,"user_id":3662748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8acc15309c4109ea00f420a59be35a47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3662748/sam"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571318781,"creation_date":1571318781,"answer_id":58433823,"question_id":58433470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433823","body_markdown":"inside your customFile.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst sendErrorNotification = (source, reason, scriptposition) =&gt; { \r\n  ...something and write a mail... \r\n}\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  sendErrorNotification: sendErrorNotification\r\n}\r\n  \r\n```\r\n\r\nthen, in your main.js file, call it like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst ourCustomClassFile = require(&#39;./customFile&#39;);\r\n...\r\nourCustomClassFile.sendErrorNotification(..)\r\n...\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433470/used-reference-in-javascript-is-not-available-inside-the-catch-block/58433823#58433823","title":"Used Reference in javascript is not available inside the catch-Block"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":11008341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/418616dad06c014091a6f85c66ffe61a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jens G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11008341/jens-g"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58433823,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571318781,"creation_date":1571317756,"question_id":58433470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58433470","body_markdown":"Inside our Javascript-Code we have a try...catch-block.

Specifically, the Remarks.\r\n&gt;This method is implemented by using deferred execution. The immediate return value is an object that stores all the information that is required to perform the action. The query represented by this method is not executed until the object is enumerated either by calling its GetEnumerator method directly or by using foreach in Visual C# or For Each in Visual Basic.\r\n\r\nWhich means that when you call `Where` you&#39;re not necessarily getting back an object such as a `List` or `Array` that just has X number of items in it. You&#39;re getting back an object that knows how to filter the `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` you called `Where` on, based on the predicate you provided. When you iterate that object, such as with a `foreach` loop or a call to `Enumerable.Count()` each item in the source `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` is evaluated against the predicate you provided and only the items that satisfy that predicate are returned.\r\n\r\nSince the predicate you&#39;re providing checks the `Sequence` property, and you&#39;re modifying that property inside the first `foreach` loop, the second time you iterate `entitiesToUpdateSequence` fewer items match the predicate you provided and so you get a lower count. If you were to increment `Sequence` instead of decrement it, you might end up with a higher count the second time you iterate `entitiesToUpdateSequence`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433455/one-item-gets-deleted-while-iterating-an-ienumerablet/58434797#58434797","title":"One item gets deleted while iterating an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;"}],"owner":{"reputation":580,"user_id":6602469,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b72328705a6443ee9ea8f1722e41ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ravi kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6602469/ravi-kumar"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58434797,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571322464,"creation_date":1571317698,"question_id":58433455,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58433455","body_markdown":"I have a method that takes an IEnumerable&lt;Entity&gt;, filters it further and loops through the filtered collection\r\nto modify one property.\r\n\r\nI am observing a very weird behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhile the method loops through the filtered `IEnumerable&lt;Entity&gt;`, after a few iterations (I&#39;ve not exactly counted how many), \r\none of the items in it gets deleted.\r\n\r\n    private async Task&lt;bool&gt; UpdateSomeValue(IEnumerable&lt;BusinessEntity&gt; entities, BusinessEntity entityToDelete)\r\n    {\r\n    \t//FIlter the IENumerable\r\n    \t\tvar entitiesToUpdateSequence = entities\r\n    \t\t\t\t.Where(f =&gt; f.Sequence &gt; entityToDelete.Sequence);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tif (entitiesToUpdateSequence.Any())\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\tvar testList = new List&lt;FormBE&gt;(entitiesToUpdateSequence);\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(entitiesToUpdateSequence.Count()); // 5\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\t//DUring this loop, after a few iterations, one item gets deleted\r\n    \t\t\t\tforeach (var entity in testList)\r\n    \t\t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\tentity.Sequence -= 1;\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(entitiesToUpdateSequence.Count()); // 4\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn await _someRepo.UpdateEntitySequence(entityToDelete.Id1, entityToDelete.ID2, testList);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\treturn await Task.FromResult(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTHis method is called like this:\r\n\r\n    var entities = await entitiesTask.ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n    var entityToDelete = entities.Single(f =&gt; f.Key.Equals(&quot;someValue&quot;));\r\n    var updated = await UpdateSomeValue(entities, entityToDelete);\r\n\r\nand that&#39;s it, there&#39;s no other reference to the `entities` collection.

Human resource management Talent development was one of our strategic priorities in FY 19 and the focus was on talent refactoring on the new age skills and getting our leadership talent ready to take on larger roles as we expanded across geographies and delivered new services. 466 leaders at level senior managers and above were covered in focused leadership programs such as business storytelling, consulting skills, executive presence, digital transformation, etc. Talent refactoring was a major focus with coverage of 12500+ BPM employees across all levels trained on new age skills like RPA, analytics and digital. This had a huge impact on our talent and business metrics. 100% of the nominated resources from the pool of reskilled workforce, have either progressed or promoted in their roles. 55% of the ‘Be The Navigator Projects’ in FY 19 were led by reskilled employees, which translated into benefits of USD 65.8 mil; FTE reduction: 321.5. Lex Adoption was another key area where we saw 45% of the employees using Lex for continuous development. To support clients and business, the teams worked collaboratively between the client, Infosys sales business teams, other partners and various functions of HR to ensure smooth and noise free people transfers from other organizations to Infosys. There were 3 major people transfer solutions conceptualized and smoothly executed with sensitivity during the course of the year. It has been a flagship year for BPM in terms of commitment to the Employee Value Proposition of careers for two reasons – 1. Launch of Project Ascent for succession planning and pipeline building. 2. Revamping of Internal Job Posting policy to cater to new age talent and their aspirations. The performance management. practice strived to enable mangers through MOT (Moment of Truth) – the performance calibration sessions. There are 8 units which have covered some milestones in this journey. The Talent Acquisition function despite increasing spread and focus on niche and disparate skill sets, has performed quite admirably in delivering what is expected by the organization. This year saw many new skill sets as part of requirements including latest technologies, digital, automation, analytics, in line with our overall vision. Several new initiatives were implemented including new assessment methods and automation initiatives to ensure focus on internal processes and external compliance. &quot;\r\nsents=nltk.sent_tokenize(para)\r\n#print(sents)\r\n\r\nrd=nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar.CFG)\r\nfor sent in sents:\r\n    tokens=list(nltk.word_tokenize(sent))\r\n    print(tokens)\r\n    for tree in rd.parse(tokens):\r\n        print(tree)\r\n\r\nBut i am receiving the error \r\nTypeError: __init__() missing 2 required positional arguments: &#39;start&#39; and &#39;productions\r\nNot sure how to instantiate the grammar.CFG class.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433452/instantiate-grammar-cfg-class-in-nltk","title":"instantiate grammar.CFG class in nltk"},{"tags":["json","flask","numpy-ndarray"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":627,"user_id":4032503,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XZyGYGtRux0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACPo/xgHTSkTRldM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"noslenkwah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4032503/noslenkwah"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571318057,"creation_date":1571318057,"answer_id":58433558,"question_id":58433450,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433558","body_markdown":"I think you forgot the json step\r\n\r\n    return jsonify({&#39;predictions&#39; : predictionsIm.tolist()})","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433450/how-to-send-ndarray-response-from-flask-server-to-python-client/58433558#58433558","title":"How to send ndarray response from flask server to python client?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7272379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8072a94417d2631e764c25c0629b823?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fariha Abbasi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7272379/fariha-abbasi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571320690,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571320775,"creation_date":1571317686,"question_id":58433450,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58433450","body_markdown":"I am trying to send ndarray (predictionsIm) of shape (1536,1536,3) from flask server to the python client.\r\nI read around for converting predictionsIm (ndarray) to list and then return the json, so I did as below:\r\n\r\n    return {&#39;predictions&#39; : predictionsIm.tolist()}\r\n\r\nbut I don&#39;t know how to handle it on client slide, can someone help in this approach?\r\n\r\nor suggest a better approach?

looks pretty straight forward, actually: \r\n\r\n    RewriteEngine on\r\n    RewriteRule ^/?api/dev/v1/(.*)$ /api/v1/$1 [END]\r\n\r\nIn case you receive an internal server error (http status 500) using the rule above then chances are that you operate a very old version of the apache http server. You will see a definite hint to an unsupported `[END]` flag in your http servers error log file in that case. You can either try to upgrade or use the older `[L]` flag, it probably will work the same in this situation, though that depends a bit on your setup. \r\n\r\nThis implementation will work likewise in the http servers host configuration or inside a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; file). Obviously the rewriting module needs to be loaded inside the http server and enabled in the http host. In case you use a dynamic configuration file you need to take care that it&#39;s interpretation is enabled at all in the host configuration and that it is located in the host&#39;s `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder. \r\n\r\nAnd a general remark: you should always prefer to place such rules in the http servers host configuration instead of using dynamic configuration files (&quot;.htaccess&quot;). Those dynamic configuration files add complexity, are often a cause of unexpected behavior, hard to debug and they really slow down the http server. They are only provided as a last option for situations where you do not have access to the real http servers host configuration (read: really cheap service providers) or for applications insisting on writing their own rules (which is an obvious security nightmare). \r\n\r\nFor this to work the rewriting module needs to be loaded into the http server, obviously. In addition, if you decide to use a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; style file) despite what I explained above, then you need to enable the interpretation of such file for the requested location (look for `AllowOverride` in the apache documentation). The file needs to be placed in the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder of the http host responding to the request and it needs to be readable by the http server process. And of course it needs to have valid syntax. If all that is given and things still do not work, then you definitely should take a look into your http server&#39;s error log file. That is where the engine will log all issues it runs into. You need to monitor that file anyway when working on implementations in a web environment, no way around that.

I mean, if the job of 1:00 PM is still running and retrieving the records from 12:00 AM to 1:00PM, can the 2:00 PM job start and retrieve the records from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433409/overlapping-cron-scheduled-job-on-nifi","title":"Overlapping CRON scheduled job on NiFi"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","material-ui"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318144,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103207590,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103207590_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571318833,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103208027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103208027_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":2308,"user_id":4605629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/741edb45b2f1d3e3c3d9555085004ad1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Greg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4605629/greg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571319153,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103208224,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103208224_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":2308,"user_id":4605629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/741edb45b2f1d3e3c3d9555085004ad1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Greg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4605629/greg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571320898,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103209246,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103209246_58433408"},{"owner":{"reputation":8731,"user_id":829493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01caca1a404f12140838f119191902b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jagsler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/829493/jagsler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571321493,"post_id":58433408,"comment_id":103209645,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433408/using-any-material-ui-component-results-in-error-in-the-withstylesforwardreft#comment103209645_58433408"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":9128145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1069597106462814/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sibasish Mohanty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9128145/sibasish-mohanty"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571317954,"creation_date":1571317954,"answer_id":58433535,"question_id":58433408,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433535","body_markdown":"Your ```&lt;TextField /&gt;``` component needs to be wrapped inside ```&lt;form&gt;

Right not the link only works if you press is on the `a` tag only. Is it possible to do it, without changing the HTML structure?\r\n\r\n**So the main things:**\r\n\r\n 1. The height of the `&lt;li&gt;` item can vary, because of the contents inside, but not the width and I am trying to make all of them the same height.\r\n 2. Make the whole `&lt;li&gt;` area clickable, so it would redirect to the `&lt;a&gt;` tag reference page. Without changing the current structure.\r\n 3. Center the content in `&lt;li&gt;` tag and don&#39;t overflow the container.\r\n 4. In the example, the content inside the last `&lt;li&gt;` element, the text, and the `&lt;a&gt;` tag is in the same line. How could I properly make them in different lines?\r\n\r\nIn the example below, it is the typical structure I need to style.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .ul {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .test1 {\r\n      display: inline-flex;\r\n      min-height: 100px;\r\n      width: 100px;\r\n      list-style: none;\r\n      background-color: #9affda;\r\n      color: black;\r\n      margin: 0px 10px;\r\n      border-radius: 10px;\r\n      align-items: center;\r\n      vertical-align: top;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;ul&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;Test text &lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;li class=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;Test text &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nI have tried multiple approaches but every time something would go wrong [*look at the main things I am trying to do*].

trying to work with Audio on Python 3.7 on Mac(Catalina) only with the built-in Microphone and Speakers.\r\nMy Problem is that with any code I tried, when recording I receive nothing and when playing sound nothing comes out. \r\nI tried the answers from this [question][1]: first I tried with PyAudio like this:\r\n```\r\nimport pyaudio\r\nimport wave\r\n\r\nCHUNK = 1024\r\nFORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16\r\nCHANNELS = 2\r\nRATE = 44100\r\nRECORD_SECONDS = 5\r\nWAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = &quot;output.wav&quot;\r\n\r\np = pyaudio.PyAudio()\r\nstream = p.open(format=FORMAT,\r\n                channels=CHANNELS,\r\n                rate=RATE,\r\n                input=True,\r\n                frames_per_buffer=CHUNK)\r\n\r\nprint(&quot;* recording&quot;)\r\nframes = []\r\nfor i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)):\r\n    data = stream.read(CHUNK)\r\n    frames.append(data)\r\nprint(&quot;* done recording&quot;)\r\n\r\nstream.stop_stream()\r\nstream.close()\r\np.terminate()\r\nwf = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, &#39;wb&#39;)\r\nwf.setnchannels(CHANNELS)\r\nwf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT))\r\nwf.setframerate(RATE)\r\nwf.writeframes(b&#39;&#39;.join(frames))\r\nwf.close()\r\n ```\r\nWhich returns me a silent file.\r\n\r\nThen I tried with SoundDevice:\r\n```\r\nimport sounddevice as sd\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nfs = 44100                      # frames per sec\r\nsd.default.samplerate = fs\r\nsd.default.channels = 2\r\n\r\nduration = 3.0                  # Aufnahmezeit\r\nrecording = sd.rec( int( duration * fs) )\r\nprint(&quot;* recording&quot;)\r\nsd.wait()\r\nprint(&quot;* done!&quot;)\r\n\r\nt = [ i for i in range( int( duration * fs) )]\r\n\r\nplt.plot(t, recording, &#39;r-&#39;)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\nWich returns an array filled with zeros: [Screenshot of the Plot][2].\r\n Both didn&#39;t cause any errors or warnings.\r\n\r\nAfter that I tried to play a simple Sin-Wave with 440 Hz, the speaker stayed silent.\r\n\r\nThe same code, works on my friends mac without problems. The Microphone &amp; Speakers are also working fine. And in System Preferences I allowed every app to use the microphone. \r\n\r\nThis [person][3] seems to have a similar issue. Also tried [this code][4] without result. :(\r\n\r\nI have no idea what else I could try to fix this.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Then I decided to develop an asynchronous GUI chat program. \r\n\r\nThe server side is running on console. The server is managing the communication process between clients. \r\n\r\nI have two client programs. One of them is a console, the other one is a GUI program. When the console program sends messages, they are printed on the Text widget of the GUI program. \r\n\r\nHowever when I sent messages on the GUI program, the messages are displayed on the console window of the other client program only after the client which runs on console writes messages to the other client.\r\n\r\nThe `write` function of the console program is as follows:\r\n```\r\n    async def write(self, writer):\r\n        t = threading.Thread(\r\n            target=lambda: writer.write(\r\n                f&quot;{self.nick}: {sys.stdin.readline()}&quot;.encode()\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n        t.daemon = True\r\n        t.start()\r\n        t.join(0.1)\r\n        await writer.drain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function accomplishes the task as I want.\r\n\r\nThe `write` function of the GUI program is as follows:\r\n```\r\n    async def write(self, writer):\r\n        if self.data:\r\n            data = self.data\r\n            self.data = &quot;&quot;\r\n            t = threading.Thread(\r\n                target=lambda: writer.write(\r\n                    f&quot;{self.nick}: {data}\\n&quot;.encode()\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n            t.daemon = True\r\n            t.start()\r\n            t.join(0.1)\r\n            await writer.drain()\r\n        else:\r\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\r\n```\r\nAnd this function is not working as I want.\r\n\r\n`self.data` is a variable that gets the text in the `tk.Entry` field. It was defined in the `__init__` function of the class.\r\n```\r\n        self.entry = tk.Entry(\r\n            master=self.bottom_frame,\r\n            width=50\r\n        )\r\n        self.entry.pack()\r\n        self.entry.bind(&quot;&lt;Return&gt;&quot;, lambda event: self.callback())\r\n\r\n        self.data = &quot;&quot;\r\n```\r\nThe `self.callback()` function is as follows:\r\n```\r\n    def callback(self):\r\n        self.data = self.entry.get()\r\n        self.entry.delete(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;end&quot;)\r\n        self.update()\r\n        self.update_idletasks()\r\n```\r\nSo, what I was trying to do here was, when I press the `&lt;Return&gt;`, the content of the `self.entry` is passed to `self.data` variable. According to the `self.write` function, there&#39;s a condition like `if self.data` which is used for sending messages when `self.data` is not an empty value. If the condition is not met, I decided to wait the function with `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)`.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the gui program reads the messages without any problem, however it can&#39;t send messages asynchronously to the console client program. The console client program needs to send a new message to see the messages come from the GUI client.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do to send messages asynchronously on GUI application?\r\n\r\nBelow are the whole codes:\r\n\r\n**Server:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/q04w3et3huegrao/server.py\r\n\r\n**Client1:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/h7seeuoylvnpezq/client1.py\r\n\r\n**Client2:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/uz4zn3vjfcc3mrj/client2.py","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433322/using-entry-widget-as-stdin-in-asynchronous-chat-program","title":"Using entry widget as stdin in asynchronous chat program"},{"tags":["flutter","flutter-layout"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1032,"user_id":6045409,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1127001433f2ab5bbab9523853e3e4e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tokenyet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6045409/tokenyet"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571320204,"post_id":58433320,"comment_id":103208874,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58433320/flutter-how-catch-back-buttonhardware-event#comment103208874_58433320"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":3908065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002559418634/picture?type=large","display_name":"Igor Kharakhordin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3908065/igor-kharakhordin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571317811,"creation_date":1571317811,"answer_id":58433491,"question_id":58433320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433491","body_markdown":"I guess you can wrap your widgetB in [WillPopScope][1] widget.
