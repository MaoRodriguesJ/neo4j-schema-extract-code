You have a list of style codes and entertainer IDs. You need to go through the list and count how many times the same entertainer ID appears. You have to do this for every distinct entertainer ID in the list. That would mean going through the list several times. What if you could sort the list by entertainer ID? Then you would only need to go through the list once, because all the rows with the same entertainer ID appear together.

As long as the entertainer ID of the current row is the same as that of the previous row, you increment your count. When a new entertainer ID appears, you start a new count, right? Also, when the entertainer ID changes, you have the number of styles for the last entertainer ID. If that count is more than one (1), you need to update the `ATA_ENTERTAINER` table.\r\n\r\nHere is my solution.

I have been able to develop a workaround, but it appears to weaken type-safety.\r\n\r\nA minimal code example of the problem is as follows:\r\n```\r\nimport * as React from &quot;react&quot;;\r\nimport * as ReactDOM from &quot;react-dom&quot;;\r\nimport { Provider } from &quot;react-redux&quot;;\r\nimport { Action, createStore, Reducer, Store } from &quot;redux&quot;;\r\n\r\ninterface IState {\r\n    turns: string[];\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype TAction1 = &quot;ACTION_1&quot;;\r\n\r\ninterface IAction1 extends Action&lt;TAction1&gt; {\r\n    payload: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype TAppAction = IAction1; // Assume other action interfaes will be added via union.\r\n\r\n// The reducer here doesn&#39;t do anything.\r\nconst reducer: Reducer&lt;IState, TAppAction&gt; = (state = { turns: [] }) =&gt; state;\r\n\r\n// The Store type shown is the type returned by createStore.\r\n// A workaround that works is to convert type to Store&lt;IState&gt; which appears to implicitly weaken the type of store.\r\nconst store: Store&lt;IState, TAppAction&gt; = createStore(reducer);\r\n\r\n// A workaround is to use TSX here.\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n    React.createElement(Provider, { store }, // Error here\r\n        React.createElement(&quot;div&quot;)),\r\n    document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error returned from Typescript is as follows:\r\n```\r\nNo overload matches this call.\r\n  The last overload gave the following error.\r\n    Argument of type &#39;{ store: Store&lt;IState, IAction1&gt;; }&#39; is not assignable to parameter of type &#39;Attributes &amp; ProviderProps&lt;Action&lt;any&gt;&gt;&#39;.\r\n      Type &#39;{ store: Store&lt;IState, IAction1&gt;; }&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;ProviderProps&lt;Action&lt;any&gt;&gt;&#39;.\r\n        Types of property &#39;store&#39; are incompatible.\r\n          Type &#39;Store&lt;IState, IAction1&gt;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;Store&lt;any, Action&lt;any&gt;&gt;&#39;.\r\n            Types of property &#39;dispatch&#39; are incompatible.\r\n              Type &#39;Dispatch&lt;IAction1&gt;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;Dispatch&lt;Action&lt;any&gt;&gt;&#39;.\r\n                Type &#39;Action&lt;any&gt;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;IAction1&#39;.ts(2769)\r\nindex copy.ts(13, 5): &#39;payload&#39; is declared here.\r\n```\r\nClearly no overload is found and the last two lines I find confusing and lead me to ask:\r\n\r\n 1. Why `Action&lt;any&gt;` is inferred for `Provider` and subsequently `ProviderProps`? Have I misunderstood what is happening here? In the second last line the types are suddenly appearing in reversed order?\r\n 2. As `Provider` is a generic type, I expected that I might instead specify `Provider&lt;TAppAction&gt;` explicitly, however the expression could not be parsed. Is this an incorrect use of `React.createElement`?\r\n\r\nI am using the following:\r\n```\r\n  &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;@types/react&quot;: &quot;^16.9.3&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@types/react-dom&quot;: &quot;^16.9.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@types/react-redux&quot;: &quot;^7.1.3&quot;,\r\n    &quot;clean-webpack-plugin&quot;: &quot;^3.0.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;css-loader&quot;: &quot;^3.2.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;css-modules-typescript-loader&quot;: &quot;^3.0.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;html-webpack-plugin&quot;: &quot;^3.2.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;source-map-loader&quot;: &quot;^0.2.4&quot;,\r\n    &quot;style-loader&quot;: &quot;^1.0.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;terser-webpack-plugin&quot;: &quot;^1.4.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;ts-loader&quot;: &quot;^6.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;tslint&quot;: &quot;^5.20.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;typescript&quot;: &quot;^3.6.3&quot;,\r\n    &quot;webpack&quot;: &quot;^4.41.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;webpack-cdn-plugin&quot;: &quot;^3.1.4&quot;,\r\n    &quot;webpack-cli&quot;: &quot;^3.3.9&quot;,\r\n    &quot;webpack-dev-server&quot;: &quot;^3.8.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;webpack-merge&quot;: &quot;^4.2.2&quot;\r\n  },\r\n  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;^16.9.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;^16.9.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;react-redux&quot;: &quot;^7.1.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;redux&quot;: &quot;^4.0.4&quot;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nFinally, I classify myself as somewhat of a newbie to TS.

I would suggest that you go with &quot;hidden&quot; as only class.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143246/make-the-list-of-the-hidden-elements-visible/58143423#58143423","title":"Make the list of the hidden elements visible"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":17534,"user_id":2065597,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/72Wwg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gildas.Tambo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2065597/gildas-tambo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":17534,"user_id":2065597,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/72Wwg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gildas.Tambo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2065597/gildas-tambo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569647382,"last_edit_date":1569647382,"creation_date":1569646571,"answer_id":58143483,"question_id":58143246,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58143483","body_markdown":"i think you are trying to create an accordion, you need to hide all `ul` at the very beginning.\r\n\r\nThen you can tell javacsript to show only the `ul` sibling of the button that just got hit.\r\n\r\nHere is an illustration, note that there are many ways to do this, and i am using [the Spread syntax commonly called The Spread Operator: ...][1]  but with the code bellow you can add as much as `page-footer__` as you want following this same HTML structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    var button = [...document.querySelectorAll(&quot;[class^=&#39;open-&#39;]&quot;)];

new to ReactJS.  And somehow, I find my codes awful If I wouldn&#39;t do something about the redundancies. My array had one hundred items. And mapping them costs too much lines. Given the class, my code looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   &quot;lists&quot;: [\r\n       {\r\n          &quot;item1&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;,\r\n          &quot;item2&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;,\r\n          &quot;item3&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;\r\n       }, {\r\n          &quot;item1&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;,\r\n          &quot;item2&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;,\r\n          &quot;item3&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;\r\n       }, {\r\n          &quot;item1&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;,\r\n          &quot;item2&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;,\r\n          &quot;item3&quot;: &quot;Lorem&quot;\r\n       }, //...couple dozens more\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nrender(){\r\n   const lists = this.state.lists\r\n   const list_a = lists.map((lists, i) =&gt; {\r\n      return (\r\n         &lt;div key={i}&gt;\r\n            &lt;div&gt;\r\n               &lt;div&gt;\r\n                  &lt;div&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item1}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item2}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item3}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n               &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      )\r\n   }).slice(0, 5)\r\n\r\n   const list_b = lists.map((lists, i) =&gt; {\r\n      return (\r\n         &lt;div key={i}&gt;\r\n            &lt;div&gt;\r\n               &lt;div&gt;\r\n                  &lt;div&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item1}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item2}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item3}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n               &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      )\r\n   }).slice(5, 10)\r\n\r\n   const list_b = lists.map((lists, i) =&gt; {\r\n      return (\r\n         &lt;div key={i}&gt;\r\n            &lt;div&gt;\r\n               &lt;div&gt;\r\n                  &lt;div&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item1}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item2}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                     &lt;span&gt;{lists.item3}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n               &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      )\r\n   }).slice(10, 15)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it looks ridiculous.  Is there a way where I can somehow manipulate slice like &quot;.slice(0, n)&quot; or something like that?

have a server program and client program, and I&#39;m trying to send messages between the two based on a specified protocol and fixed buffer size of 16 bytes. The procedure works like this:\r\n\r\n1. Client has two individual string expressions defined.\r\n2. Client packs the two expressions into a single struct based on the protocol (using UTF-8 encoding).\r\n3. Client sends packed expression to server.\r\n4. Server received packed expression.\r\n5. Server unpacks packed expression.\r\n6. Server sends back (echoes) the first expression.\r\n7. Client receives the first expression and prints it (decoded by UTF-8).\r\n\r\nEssentially it&#39;s a simple echo procedure, though I&#39;m only sending back the first expression for now (I&#39;ll change this later).\r\n\r\n[Here&#39;s][1] a picture drawn a picture of the protocol I need to use. I pack my struct according to this. That is, the first two values are two-byte ```int```s, followed by a variable-length expression/string, followed by another ```int```, then the second variable-length expression/string. So according to the [struct documentation][2], that corresponds to ```2h{len(exp1)sh{len(exp1)}s```.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m also using [network endianness][3].\r\n\r\nWhen both my expressions are under 16 bytes, the program works fine:\r\n\r\n**CLIENT INPUT:**\r\n\r\n    exp1 = &quot;123456&quot;\r\n    exp2 = &quot;0000&quot;\r\n\r\n**SERVER OUTPUT**:\r\n\r\n    Waiting for connection...\r\n    Connected from (&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;, 51150).\r\n    Server received 16 bytes from (&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;, 51150). The message was b&#39;\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x06123456\\x00\\x040000&#39;.\r\n    The length of the first expression is 6. The length of the second expression is 4.\r\n    Bye!\r\n\r\n**CLIENT OUTPUT:**\r\n\r\n    Client received 123456.  # Correct\r\n\r\nBut the problem is that when the client has input **greater than 16 bytes**, I get an unpack error on the server side:\r\n\r\n**CLIENT INPUT:**\r\n\r\n    exp1 = &quot;123456&quot;\r\n    exp2 = &quot;00001&quot;  # &lt;---- I&#39;ve now added an extra &quot;1&quot; here (but it could be any character).\r\n\r\n**SERVER OUTPUT**:\r\n\r\n    Waiting for connections...\r\n    Connected from (&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;, 51345).\r\n    Server received 16 bytes from (&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;, 51345). The message was b&#39;\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x06123456\\x00\\x050000&#39;.\r\n    The length of the first expression is 6. The length of the second expression is 5.\r\n    Exception in thread Thread-1:\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;D:\\Program Files\\Python\\Python37\\lib\\threading.py&quot;, line 917, in _bootstrap_inner\r\n        self.run()\r\n      File &quot;D:\\Program Files\\Python\\Python37\\lib\\threading.py&quot;, line 865, in run\r\n        self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\r\n      File &quot;temp-server.py&quot;, line 39, in connection_func\r\n        unpacked_response = unpack_data(data)\r\n      File &quot;temp-server.py&quot;, line 21, in unpack_data\r\n        exp2 = struct.unpack(f&#39;!{exp2_length}s&#39;, packed_data[4 + exp1_length + 2:4 + exp1_length + 2 + exp2_length])[0]\r\n    struct.error: unpack requires a buffer of 5 bytes\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this struct error for any input when the total length is over 16 bytes, I suspect it has to do with my buffer size. **But I need to keep the buffer size for ```socket.rev()``` set at 16 bytes as a requirement.

I use private fields for that purpose. Then I use `LINQ` `Join()` to create my view entity. The query may refer ONLY to the fields set to joined entities, nothing else. Such query, if written properly translates clearly to `SQL` `JOIN` and works with full speed. In my application it&#39;s equivalent of a database view.\r\n\r\nWhy private fields and not properties, you may ask. Maybe because joined entities are &quot;implementation details&quot;, but another reason is my presentation code uses reflection to operate on entity public properties, it&#39;s good to have those entities hidden from it. Otherwise I would probably need to use attributes to hide those &quot;columns&quot;.\r\n\r\nBTW, such views can be ordered with `OrderBy()`, filtered with `Where()` at virtually no cost. The constraint is to maintain the collection&#39;s `IQueryable` interface, never refer joined entities indirectly. So even if `X` refers to `A.B`, never refer `X` in a `LINQ` query, always `A.B` where A is direct entity reference assigned in the `Join()` query.\r\n\r\nTo build dynamic queries at runtime one must use expressions.\r\n\r\nThis set of properties of EF Core 3.0 allows to build a database application without using SQL, but with the full SQL speed maintained. However, the database / entity structure must be relatively simple to achieve that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143189/how-to-use-database-views-in-ef-core-3-0/58511474#58511474","title":"How to use database views in EF Core 3.0?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1544,"user_id":126537,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/odHHQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Harry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/126537/harry"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571774327,"creation_date":1569642488,"question_id":58143189,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58143189","body_markdown":"I know the question was asked before, but at the time it was, we had EF Core 2.x.

I have my models created with lot&#39;s of foreign keys and database joins in mind.\r\n\r\nBut here comes the unpleasant surprise (I&#39;m a little new to EF): those joins written in LINQ are pretty slow, as a matter of fact they do not produce database join, but fetch whole tables instead.\r\n\r\nOf course it&#39;s totally unacceptable, I import an old database with millions of records, with the joins I get results in milliseconds, without I get couple of seconds lags - on my very fast internet connection (in real world scenario it would be much worse).\r\n\r\nI need views, and AFAIK EF won&#39;t create them for me, is it STILL true for EF 3.0?\r\n\r\nThen, what would be the best and the most clean way to create views in SQL and to make entities for them? I mean - considering the situation the database models would change over time, and the database structure would have to be updated.\r\n\r\nWell, I would prefer doing my joins not in SQL views, just have queries returned &quot;JOIN&quot; statement results. Especially some not obvious joins. Lets say table B has a column being a foreign key referencing table A. I want to get results from table A joining B for details. With normal SQL JOIN performance.\r\n\r\nI checked the database: there is no significant performance difference between &quot;select * from A&quot; and &quot;select * from A join B...&quot;. In LINQ - the difference is huge.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143189/how-to-use-database-views-in-ef-core-3-0","title":"How to use database views in EF Core 3.0?"},{"tags":["image-processing","computer-vision"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":26335,"user_id":4685471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/327dc718c142e3ea70e5db4b38050a36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"desertnaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4685471/desertnaut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569663781,"post_id":58143188,"comment_id":102675296,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143188/add-specified-percentage-of-color-cast-to-the-underwater-image#comment102675296_58143188"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12133530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBVn4F5PzLqQSiLFmiEggDLJI7TUSORW6uShijJ=k-s128","display_name":"Kushal B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12133530/kushal-b"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12133530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBVn4F5PzLqQSiLFmiEggDLJI7TUSORW6uShijJ=k-s128","display_name":"Kushal B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12133530/kushal-b"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569763290,"creation_date":1569642474,"last_edit_date":1569763290,"question_id":58143188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58143188","body_markdown":"How to add specified percentage of color cast to the underwater image?\r\nI have tried, but I want color cast effect of underwater.

That’s what arrow functions do. To access the `this` from call time (what’s generally intended when adding methods to a prototype), use a non-arrow function:\r\n\r\n    Element.prototype.makeDraggable = function (elem = null) {\r\n        //this.draggable = true;\r\n        this.setAttribute(&quot;draggable&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);\r\n        this.ondragstart = (e) =&gt; { e.dataTransfer.setData(&quot;text&quot;, elem ? elem.id : e.target.id); }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nSee also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34361379/are-arrow-functions-and-functions-equivalent-exchangeable.\r\n\r\nFinally, extending the prototypes you have some of the least control over – browser built-ins – is considered a bad idea.

A standalone function usually works better:\r\n\r\n    const makeDraggable = (target, elem = null) {\r\n        target.draggable = true;\r\n        target.ondragstart = (e) =&gt; { e.dataTransfer.setData(&quot;text&quot;, elem ? elem.id : e.target.id); }\r\n    };","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143168/cant-seem-to-get-element-setattribute-to-work-with-webpack-babel/58143205#58143205","title":"Can&#39;t seem to get Element.setAttribute to work with webpack/babel"}],"owner":{"reputation":1242,"user_id":693943,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bef0b29b7ebaec03aeff8accf444aefe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Matthew Goulart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/693943/matthew-goulart"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58143205,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569642933,"creation_date":1569642056,"question_id":58143168,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58143168","body_markdown":"I have the following: \r\n\r\n    Element.prototype.makeDraggable = (elem = null) =&gt; {\r\n        //this.draggable = true;\r\n        this.setAttribute(&quot;draggable&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);\r\n        this.ondragstart = (e) =&gt; { e.dataTransfer.setData(&quot;text&quot;, elem ? elem.id : e.target.id); }\r\n    };\r\nWhen the browser gets to that function it throws an error on the first line:\r\n\r\n&gt; Drag.js:7 Uncaught TypeError: n.setAttribute is not a function\r\n\r\nWhere `n` is the minified name of the element, or so I thought.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nas you can see in the picture, `this` seems to be an `Element`, but `n` is.. well I don&#39;t know what it is.

You just passed an instance of the `SignUpForm` **form** class to your `SignUpForm`, **not** the `SignUpForm` **model**!\r\n\r\nChange the name of your `SignUpForm` **model**, and you most likely won&#39;t get errors.\r\n\r\nIf this didn&#39;t help please show me your `views.py` for this form.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143151/attributeerror-modelformoptions-object-has-no-attribute-private-fields-erro/58143436#58143436","title":"AttributeError: &#39;ModelFormOptions&#39; object has no attribute &#39;private_fields&#39; error message"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":7328561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b809876172b900a1535abc415404d43a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wpnewbie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7328561/wpnewbie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20,"user_id":7328561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b809876172b900a1535abc415404d43a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wpnewbie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7328561/wpnewbie"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58143436,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569679614,"creation_date":1569641820,"last_edit_date":1569679614,"question_id":58143151,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58143151","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t understand what this error means.

Most important metadata used to detect data in S3 is partition. Athena keeps details about all partitions in metadata. Using this partition info, it reaches to corresponding folder in S3 to fetch data. \r\n\r\n 1. If you add more files to same partition: If partition is already added in athena metadata, all new files will be detected automatically because athena reads all files from folder in S3 by using partition metadata and s3 location.\r\n 2. If u add files in new partition: if partition is not in athena metadata, athana doesn&#39;t know how to locate corresponding folder in S3. Therefore, it doesn&#39;t access data from that folder.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to recognize new partitions:\r\n1. Run Glue crawler over S3 bucket and it will refresh partition metadata.\r\n2. Use `alter table` command in athana to add new partitions\r\n3.

The actual objets are not fetched in the line:\n\n```python\ncontacts = Model.objects.filter(owner=self.owner).order_by(&#39;-date&#39;)\n```\n\nbecause you don’t use a function like `list()`, you don’t iterate the QuerySet yet... It is evaluated later. This is probably the reason of your problem.\n\nSince you need to search an ID in the list of contacts and the find the next object in that list, I think there is no way but fetch all the contact and use a classic Python loop to find yours objects.\n\n```python\n@property\ndef next_object_url(self):\n    contacts = list(Model.objects.filter(owner=self.owner).order_by(&#39;-date&#39;).all())\n    for curr_contact, next_contact in zip(contacts[:-1], contacts[1:]):\n        if curr_contact.id == self.id:\n            return next_contact\n    else:\n        # not found\n        raise ContactNotFoundError(self.id)\n```\n\nAnother solution would be to change your database model in order to add a notion of previous/next contact at database level…\n\n\n  [1]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143128/django-find-item-in-queryset-and-get-next/58143717#58143717","title":"Django find item in queryset and get next"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3504,"user_id":10746224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25bb2589e5ce6b9bd2c2fa2d81961c95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caleb Goodman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10746224/caleb-goodman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569653962,"creation_date":1569653962,"answer_id":58144089,"question_id":58143128,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58144089","body_markdown":"I&#39;m not sure why your code doesn&#39;t work, but I think there is a better approach, use a raw query:\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def next_object_url(self):\r\n        contacts = Model.objects.raw(f&#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n          SELECT \r\n          t1.id, \r\n          DATEDIFF((SELECT t2.date FROM table t2 WHERE t2.id = {self.id}), t1.date) as d\r\n          from table t1\r\n          ORDER BY d asc\r\n          LIMIT 2\r\n        &#39;&#39;&#39;)\r\n\r\nThis is completely untested, and might have to be adapted for your specific database.

But how do I write the code to make the average 5.5, the actual average and not make the code round off at 5.0?\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage javasumavgrange;\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\npublic class JavaSumAvgRange {\r\n   public static final int NUMBER_COUNT = 10;\r\n\r\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n      int sumOfOddNumbers = 0;\r\n      int sumOfEvenNumbers = 0;\r\n      int sumOfAllNumbers = 0;\r\n      int number;\r\n      int minValue = 0;\r\n      int maxValue = 0;\r\n      int inputCounter = 1;\r\n      double averageOfNumbers = 0.0;\r\n      \r\n      Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n      \r\n      //INPUT: numbers\r\n      while (inputCounter &lt;= NUMBER_COUNT){\r\n         System.out.print(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;);\r\n         number = stdin.nextInt();\r\n         //process to detect even/odd numbers:\r\n         if(number%2 == 1){\r\n            sumOfOddNumbers += number;\r\n         }\r\n         else {\r\n            sumOfEvenNumbers += number;\r\n         }\r\n         //process to detect total of all numbers\r\n         sumOfAllNumbers += number;\r\n         \r\n         //determine the range (min, max) of inputs\r\n         if( inputCounter ==1){\r\n            minValue = number;\r\n            maxValue = number;\r\n         }\r\n         else {\r\n            if (number&lt;minValue){\r\n               minValue = number;\r\n            }\r\n            if(number &gt; maxValue){\r\n               maxValue = number;\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n         //keep count of how many numbers were entered\r\n         inputCounter++;\r\n      } // end of while loop\r\n      \r\n      // here I am calculating the average.

There are a few things going on in your code, so I tried to create the simplest example that shows how to get it to work, but exclude things that you were already fine with (like creating an array and populating values).\r\n\r\nThe code below finds where the next pattern starts – `indexOfNextPatternStart` – that would be where ever &quot;ab&quot; occurs next. Then it adds the length of &quot;ab&quot; itself to get whatever index is _after_ that. So in your `text` example, it starts with `&quot;abc&quot;` – &quot;ab&quot; is clearly at the front, but you want the index of `&quot;c&quot;`. That&#39;s what `indexOfCharAfterPattern` contains. At that point, you&#39;ve got the character isolated. In my example, I&#39;m storing that temporarily as `charAfterPattern` and printing it out.\r\n\r\nI added the `if (indexOfCharAfterPattern &lt; text.length())` check to protect against the last &quot;ab&quot; in `text`.

I do this as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(reshape)\r\ndf &lt;- melt(as.matrix(test))\r\n\r\ndf &lt;- melt(as.matrix(test)) \r\ncolnames(df) &lt;- c(&quot;Cohort&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;value&quot;) \r\ndf$Date &lt;- as.Date(df$Date) \r\nggplot(df, aes(x=Date, y= value)) + geom_line(aes(colour = Cohort)) + theme_classic() + \r\nscale_colour_manual(&quot;&quot;,\r\n                    values = c(&quot;25th Pct Cohort 1&quot; = &quot;black&quot;, &quot;50th Pct Cohort 1&quot; = &quot;black&quot;, &quot;75th Pct Cohort 1&quot; = &quot;black&quot;, &quot;25th Pct Cohort 2&quot; = &quot;steel blue&quot;, &quot;50th Pct Cohort 2&quot;= &quot;steelblue&quot; , &quot;75th Pct Cohort 2&quot; = &quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;25th Pct Cohort 3&quot; = &quot;grey&quot;, &quot;50th Pct Cohort 3&quot; = &quot;grey&quot;, &quot;75th Pct Cohort 3&quot; = &quot;grey&quot;),\r\n                    breaks = c(&quot;50th Pct Cohort 1&quot;, &quot;75th Pct Cohort 1&quot;, &quot;25th Pct Cohort 2&quot;, &quot;50th Pct Cohort 2&quot; , &quot;75th Pct Cohort 2&quot;, &quot;25th Pct Cohort 3&quot;, &quot;50th Pct Cohort 3&quot;, &quot;75th Pct Cohort 3&quot;)) +\r\nscale_linetype_manual(&quot;&quot;,\r\n                        values = c(&quot;dotted&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;longdash&quot;, &quot;dotted&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;longdash&quot;, &quot;dotted&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;longdash&quot;),\r\n                        breaks = c(&quot;50th Pct Cohort 1&quot;, &quot;75th Pct Cohort 1&quot;, &quot;25th Pct Cohort 2&quot;, &quot;50th Pct Cohort 2&quot; , &quot;75th Pct Cohort 2&quot;, &quot;25th Pct Cohort 3&quot;, &quot;50th Pct Cohort 3&quot;, &quot;75th Pct Cohort 3&quot;))\r\n\r\n```\r\nBut i am lost after this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143082/plot-rows-of-matrix-ggplot2","title":"Plot rows of matrix ggplot2"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7756}
