At the moment, the code that calls the API and inserts the data looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry\r\n            {\r\n                // Table1\r\n                var table1Response = await httpClient.Value.GetStringAsync(&quot;http://website.com/api/table1&quot;);\r\n                var table1 = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;Table1&gt;&gt;(table1Response);\r\n                using (SQLiteConnection conn = new SQLiteConnection(App.DatabaseLocation))\r\n                {\r\n                    conn.CreateTable&lt;Table1&gt;();\r\n                    conn.DeleteAll&lt;Table1&gt;();\r\n                    conn.InsertAll(table1);\r\n                    conn.Close();\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                // Table2\r\n                var table2Response = await httpClient.Value.GetStringAsync(&quot;http://website.com/api/table2&quot;);\r\n                var table2 = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;Table2&gt;&gt;(table2Response);\r\n                using (SQLiteConnection conn = new SQLiteConnection(App.DatabaseLocation))\r\n                {\r\n                    // Checks for table and creates if doesn&#39;t exist\r\n                    conn.CreateTable&lt;Table2&gt;();\r\n                    // Deletes all old data\r\n                    conn.DeleteAll&lt;Table2&gt;();\r\n                    // Updates with new reference data from API\r\n                    conn.InsertAll(table2);\r\n                    conn.Close();\r\n                }\r\n// Repeats for all tables in the app.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause it has to await the API call, when this method is called in the app&#39;s OnStart() the data loads in table by table, and if you navigate to a page in the app that requires certain data that hasn&#39;t finished being called yet, obviously the app crashes. I asked yesterday for help with a function I was writing to insert the data programmatically using a foreach loop (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387768/xamarin-c-insert-data-into-sqlite-database-programmatically-for-multiple-tabl) and I was informed that that&#39;s not a smart way to do it and defining each table as you need it is a better method. \r\n\r\nMy question now becomes, what can I do to my API calling method to have it make multiple API calls at once and hypothetically load all the data in one shot? Is this even possible to do, or should I try building a Loading screen of sorts that waits until all the data has been retrieved before allowing further use of the app?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404790/xamarin-insert-into-multiple-sqlite-tables-at-once","title":"Xamarin - Insert into multiple SQLite tables at

This is a bit of an odd approach, it would be better to simply `cache()` the `Mono` and then assign it to your field straight away:\r\n\r\n    public void updateTheData() {\r\n        theData = someFluxService.get()\r\n                .collectMap(Data::getId, Function.identity())\r\n                .cache();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTaking that thinking a step further, if your requirement is to update the data every `x` seconds rather than inherently on demand, you can just pass that into the cache function and do away with the separate method entirely:\r\n\r\n    public NewClass() {\r\n        theData = someFluxService.get()\r\n                .collectMap(Data::getId, Function.identity())\r\n                .cache(Duration.ofMinutes(5));\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public Mono&lt;Map&lt;String, Data&gt;&gt; getTheData() {\r\n        return theData;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404786/how-to-create-a-mono-triggered-by-completion-of-a-flux/58411120#58411120","title":"How to create a Mono triggered by completion of a flux"}],"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":3570698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b6f47be06872d6e0d7033dc18a945c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3570698/brian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":181,"user_id":3570698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b6f47be06872d6e0d7033dc18a945c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3570698/brian"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58411120,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571221559,"creation_date":1571191508,"last_edit_date":1571198188,"question_id":58404786,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404786","body_markdown":"I have a class that populates a Map from a Flux source.

code can actually be much cleaner. The following solution suggests some edits that you could do to improve the function `dictmaker`. Since you have not provided any dummy data to test the solution on, I have made some dummy data and presented that below as well. I would suggest that you follow such practices of providing a minimal reproducible problem. \r\n\r\nAs I suggested earlier, there was an inconsistency in naming the variable **`Ineligiblevets`** in the fourth last line of the `dictmaker` code-block. Changing all occurences of **`Ineligible_vets`** to **`Ineligiblevets`** should fix the error. I see that you have made the change in the solution now. And if it did indeed fix the error, please leave a comment under this answer.  \r\n\r\nNow, I do not completely understand your actual logic. So, based on what limited understanding I have of what you are trying to achieve, here&#39;s my solution in making `dictmaker` simpler and producing the dictionary: `countyDict`.   \r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nI made some dummy date (see the section below). The following code will use the dummy data to illustrate the solution.  \r\n&gt;### Short version of your function: `dictmaker`.  \r\nSince your function, `dictmaker` was only assigning column-values from the dataframe to the `dict`, `countyDict`, you can actually do that using `pandas.DataFrame.to_dict` method. In this case, we take a transpose of the dataframe to get the type of representation you seem to look for.

My goal is to edit the code so that I can calculate the drive time for a third group of people `Ineligiblevets`. However, when I add new code for the `Ineligiblevets` group (any instance in the code below where `Ineligiblevets` is visible) to the blocks of code and run the file, I receive the below Key Error.\r\n \r\nThe error references the line of code (displayed below) of the `numpy array` that contains the dictionary `countyDict` so I believe the issue is with the saving of the `dict` to the `numpy array`.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am using Jupyter Notebooks on a Windows computer running Python 3.6. The strange thing is that the other data (`vets` and `SCDvets`) gets passed into the `numpy array` fine, but not the `Ineligiblevets` data. \r\n\r\nI verified that the other data was in the array by using `np.load()` on the array. I have looked for similar questions but I have not been able to find any that have this strange issue.\r\n\r\nAll of the data is saved into the array except for ``#Ineligiblevets``.

was quite a pain point for me!  I left it until most of my app was completed and I had the mind space to deal with the crashing.  \r\n\r\nI think we can all agree that there&#39;s some pretty awesome stuff with SwifUI but that the debugging can be difficult.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say that this is a BUG.  Here is my rationale: \r\n\r\n - If you wrap the presentationMode dismiss call in an asynchronous delay of about a half-second, you should find that the program will no longer crash.\r\n///\r\n\r\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) {\r\n            self.presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()\r\n        } \r\n\r\n - This suggests to me that the bug is an unexpected behaviour way down deep in how SwiftUI interfaces with all the other UIKit code to manage the various views.  Depending on your actual code, you might find that if there is some minor complexity in the view, the crash actually will not happen.  For example, if you are dismissing from a view to one that has a list, and that list is empty, you will get a crash without the asynchronous delay.  On the other hand, if you have even just one entry in that list view, forcing a loop iteration to generate the parent view, you&#39;ll see that the crash will not occur. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m not so sure how robust my solution of wrapping the dismiss call in a delay is.

After the user selects the photos he/she wants to download, the user then clicks the **Download** button to download the photos. The javascript code iterates through the selected photos and simulates a &quot;click&quot; event for each one. Unfortunately, javascript allows only one &quot;click&quot; event to fired and handled at any one time. The result is that only the last photo is downloaded because each subsequent simulated &quot;click&quot; event destroys the previous one. I need a way of pausing the execution of the script, and checking when the file has completed downloading before continuing with the next iteration of the loop. I&#39;ve used the **alert()** function in the code below to simulate this behaviour.\r\n\r\n        function Download() {\r\n            var thm;\r\n            for( thm of thumbnails ) {\r\n                var download_evt = new MouseEvent(&quot;click&quot;, {\r\n                    view: window,\r\n                    bubbles: true,\r\n                    cancelable: true,\r\n                });\r\n                var cancelled;\r\n                try {\r\n                    if (thm.selected == 1 ) {\r\n                        document.getElementById(thm.photo_id).type = &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;;\r\n                        cancelled = !document.getElementById(thm.photo_id).dispatchEvent(download_evt);\r\n                        alert(&quot;wait&quot;);\r\n                    }\r\n                } catch(err) {\r\n                    alert(err.message);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe javascript code below handles the user click on the thumbnail.

The initial migration using Flask-Migrate via command line worked fine and generated the migration script (which was then tweaked to get working). \r\n\r\nThe models with the 3D geometry are defined as follows: \r\n```python\r\nfrom MyProject import db\r\nfrom geoalchemy2 import Geometry\r\n\r\nclass Source(db.Model):\r\n    __tablename__ = &#39;source&#39;\r\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n    project_id = db.Column(db.Integer(), db.ForeignKey(&#39;project.id&#39;))\r\n    project = db.relationship(&#39;Project&#39;, foreign_keys=[project_id])\r\n    category = db.Column(db.String(300))\r\n    geometry = db.Column(Geometry(geometry_type=&#39;POINTZ&#39;, srid=4326, dimension=3))\r\n\r\nclass Building(db.Model):\r\n    __tablename__ = &#39;building&#39;\r\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n    project_id = db.Column(db.Integer(), db.ForeignKey(&#39;project.id&#39;))\r\n    project = db.relationship(&#39;Project&#39;, foreign_keys=[project_id])\r\n    geometry = db.Column(Geometry(geometry_type=&#39;POLYGONZ&#39;, srid=4326, dimension=3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe migrations are done on the command line using the Flask Migrate commands.\r\n```\r\nflask db migrate\r\n```\r\nWhich fails without making a script and produces this geoalchemy2 error\r\n```\r\ngeoalchemy2.exc.ArgumentError: invalid geometry_type &#39;POINTZ&#39; for dimension 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried Flask-Alembic and it gives me the same geoalchemy2 error at the end, so I think it&#39;s something to do with how Alembic views geometry columns. Just not sure what.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be appreciated.
