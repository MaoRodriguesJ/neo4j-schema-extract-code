Or those API requests and displaying them on a webpage?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197722/looking-for-the-right-azure-tools","title":"Looking for the right Azure tools"},{"tags":["sql-server","reporting-services","reportmanager"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1570004431,"post_id":58197720,"comment_id":102773632,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197720/reports-doesnt-use-changes-in-content-with-query#comment102773632_58197720"},{"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":3008415,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42c9c65a7f60585e0f8fe9c50b745450?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3008415/alan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570005052,"post_id":58197720,"comment_id":102773957,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197720/reports-doesnt-use-changes-in-content-with-query#comment102773957_58197720"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3638096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5WoW9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ruby Blue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3638096/ruby-blue"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570178502,"creation_date":1570178502,"answer_id":58232820,"question_id":58197720,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58232820","body_markdown":"You can create a SYNONYM for the old table name to reference the new table name and your reports will still run correctly.\r\n\r\n```    \r\nCREATE SYNONYM OldTableName FOR NewTableName\r\n```\r\nFor more information please see this excellent introduction\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-synonym/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197720/reports-doesnt-use-changes-in-content-with-query/58232820#58232820","title":"Reports doesn&#39;t use changes in content with query"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":3008415,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42c9c65a7f60585e0f8fe9c50b745450?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3008415/alan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570178502,"creation_date":1570004309,"last_edit_date":1570004731,"question_id":58197720,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58197720","body_markdown":"In SSRS I have changed some tablenames and want to change the queries in all the reports that use those tables. \r\n\r\nI have no trouble changing the queries.

I need each function to finish before the next function starts running.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m doing at the moment, which works, is pausing the execution until the end of the previous function, but I&#39;d like for a nicer answer:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    f1 {\r\n        ready1=false\r\n        ...\r\n        ready1=true }\r\n\r\n    f2 {\r\n        ready2=false\r\n        while (!ready1) {Thread.sleep(250);}\r\n        ...\r\n        ready2=true }\r\n\r\n    f3 {\r\n        while (!ready2) {Thread.sleep(250);}\r\n        ...\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there an easy way to do this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197702/only-start-function-when-previous-function-has-completed","title":"Only start function when previous function has completed"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","junit4","spring-repositories"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570004545,"post_id":58197698,"comment_id":102773687,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197698/testing-repositories-which-do-not-extend-any-spring-data-repository#comment102773687_58197698"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11978629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ure7xT5Ll6o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reBaTOtVnigiJvmCu9gertbfAawZw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"arkpas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11978629/arkpas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570005035,"post_id":58197698,"comment_id":102773951,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197698/testing-repositories-which-do-not-extend-any-spring-data-repository#comment102773951_58197698"},{"owner":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570005249,"post_id":58197698,"comment_id":102774052,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197698/testing-repositories-which-do-not-extend-any-spring-data-repository#comment102774052_58197698"},{"owner":{"reputation":77868,"user_id":2696260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WflRS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"M.

What I have is a very common situation. \r\n\r\nI have an app where a user signs up using his phone number. This creates an entry in my `user` table with just a phone number. \r\n\r\nNow when the user logs in next, I want to retrieve the user details. This scenario is applicable for an existing user who has his/her other details (e.g first name) filled up already. \r\n\r\nSo my backend does a `select * from user where phoneNumber= &lt;phoneNumber&gt;` and the mapper tries to map the whole user object something like the following : \r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn new User(resultSet.getString(&quot;first_name&quot;), resultSet.getString(&quot;middle_name&quot;), resultSet.getString(&quot;last_name&quot;), resultSet.getString(&quot;phone_number&quot;), resultSet.getString(&quot;nationality&quot;), resultSet.getString(&quot;mpin&quot;));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the mapper naturally, in case of a fresh signup, would not find anything except the phoneNumber in the DB. So the rest of the `getString()` calls will fail. How do I avoid this and say `get whatever field is not null and form the object and return it to me`. \r\n\r\nI see a documentation here for jdbi3 : http://jdbi.org/#_column_mappers but I am not sure if this will solve the problem. I haven&#39;t tried it yet as I am having some issues understanding it. So wanted a feedback if this is the right solution or is there another way of doing it. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\n[EDIT]: I know there is a method `resultSet.findColumn(&#39;first_name&#39;)` that I can use to find if a column exists before trying to fetch it. But it will make this code pretty shitty looking if I start doing that for every field in the User mapper. Hence the effort to find a different solution.

I want the cursor image to change while hovering above any of the Ball instances, and change back to default Windows mouse cursor while not.\r\n\r\nI have created a function that checks if the MouseEvent is LeftClick:\r\n\r\n    void DisplayManager::mousePressEvent(QMouseEvent* ev) { \r\n\r\n\t    if (ev-&gt;buttons() &amp; Qt::LeftButton) { // Balls Are Green\r\n            if(// CHECK IF THERE IS A BALL AT THE CLICKED COORDINATES) {\r\n                // DISPLAY THE X and Y OF THE BALL AT THE DOCK WIDGET\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is my initializeGL function: (**DisplayManager is the name of my QGLWidget**)\r\n\r\n    void DisplayManager::initializeGL() {\r\n\t    glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL); // Enables the changing of the draw color with glColor() functions\r\n\t    glColor3f(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);\r\n\r\n\t    glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);\r\n\t    glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1); //sets a black background 1 0 0 1\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOn the basis this is a Picking problem and there are several information about it at the internet but I am not using GLUT and I am not using any shader.

might work for you (GNU sed):\r\n\r\n    sed -n &#39;/\\n/bb;/\\\\cite{/!b;s//\\n/;s/.*\\n/\\n/;:a;/}/!{N;s/\\n//2;ba};s//\\n/;D;:b;s/^\\([^\\n]*\\),\\s*/\\1\\n/;P;D&#39; file\r\nThis sed script uses the fact that the `D` command deletes upto and including, the first `\\n` in the pattern space (if there is one) and then presents the remains of the pattern space to the sed cycle. If the pattern space is empty it behaves in the same fashion as the `d` command and fetches the next line (minus its newline) into the pattern space and starts the sed cycle as is usual.\r\n\r\nThe script is in two pieces: if the pattern space contains a newline (only possible if it has already been processed and a newline introduced) it is passed to the `:b` goto marker, otherwise the pattern space is treated in the following way.\r\n\r\nIf the pattern space does not contain `\\\\cite{` it is deleted and the sed cycle repeated. Otherwise the pattern space is shortened upto the beginning of the citation and a newline inserted. The end of the citation marked by the closing `}` is also replaced by a newline (a loop is used in the case that the citation flows over one or more lines) and then the `D` command is used to dispatch the sed to go again. \r\n\r\nOn its return, having deleted the first introduced newline, the citation is now at the start of the pattern space. Separate citations are printed by replacing `,`&#39;s before the second introduced newline by a newline and the sed cycle repeats until the closing of the citation is reached. Then the remainder of the pattern is repeatedly processed until it is empty or does not contain any further citations.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197580/golfing-a-script-that-extract-citations-from-a-latex-document/58210169#58210169","title":"Golfing a script that extract citations from a LaTeX document"}],"owner":{"reputation":281,"user_id":4890944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6584bf69ef530c04cc2f2abc2bba08e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"永劫回帰","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4890944/%e6%b0%b8%e5%8a%ab%e5%9b%9e%e5%b8%b0"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281,"user_id":4890944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6584bf69ef530c04cc2f2abc2bba08e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"永劫回帰","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4890944/%e6%b0%b8%e5%8a%ab%e5%9b%9e%e5%b8%b0"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58198285,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570055650,"creation_date":1570003766,"last_edit_date":1570031503,"question_id":58197580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58197580","body_markdown":"I was trying to extract all the citations from a LaTeX file, that is, being able to extract everything in between the two curly braces following \\cite (ie, `\\cite{bla,blo}` would give me `bla` and `blo`). There are a few corner cases: `\\cite{}` may contain one or more citations separated by comma (and there is no comma if there is only one citation) and the `\\cite{}` command may span over multiple lines.\r\n\r\nSo far, I came up with the following one liner which works well:\r\n```\r\n&lt;file.tex grep -oPz &quot;(?s)(?&lt;=\\\\\\\\cite{).[^}]*?(?=})&quot; | tr &#39;\\n\\0,&#39; &#39; \\n\\n&#39; | tr -d &#39;[:blank:]&#39; | sort | uniq\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I was wondering whether it would be possible to do it only with one tool, be it sed, grep or awk. I think it would be easier to do it in awk (because the sort | uniq part can easily be done in awk but I was stuck on the extracting part).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nHere is a test case:\r\n```\r\nAenean consequat \\cite{acitation} auctor varius.

This works with keeping each gamestate seperate as each element of the array is a different gamestate object. The problem I am having is when I try to update the positionMatrix or the referenceMatrix.\r\n\r\nI am using the following code to create values for them:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) {\r\n     gameState.referenceMatrix[i] = Array(7);\r\n     gameState.positionMatrix[i] = Array(7);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor (var j = 0; j &lt; 7; j++) {\r\n     for (var k = 0; k &lt; 7; k++) {\r\n          // make diagonal buttons, boundary and centre equal to zero\r\n          if ((j == 3) || (k == 3) || (j == k) || (j + k == 6)) {\r\n               gameState.referenceMatrix[j][k] = 0;\r\n               gameState.positionMatrix[j][k] = 0;\r\n          }\r\n          else {\r\n               gameState.referenceMatrix[j][k] = -1;\r\n               gameState.positionMatrix[j][k] = -1;\r\n          }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n// make centre -1\r\ngameState.referenceMatrix[3][3] = -1;\r\ngameState.positionMatrix[3][3] = -1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverytime a new gamestate is created, the position and reference matrix both are populated. So when one game starts I am using the gameState found at gameStateArray[0] and gameStateArray[0].positionMatrix is empty (as the above code has not yet been run) but when a second game starts for some reason gameStateArray[1].positionMatrix is populated, and it also overrides the gameStateArray[0].positionMatrix (which gets altered later through different code) when the above code is run.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure why I can change the .numTurns and all of the other paramaters of the gameState without changing them in all of the arrays, but I am not able to change the positionMatrix array without it effecting all gamestates?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly

The output for x = 5 will be 20.78674 stored in Blah as a string.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197526/is-it-possible-to-execute-a-formula-inside-a-variable/58197980#58197980","title":"Is it possible to execute a formula inside a variable?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12152476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2605d11c1cab2db7b7b39af36cec7175?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hammet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152476/hammet"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570091536,"post_id":58205728,"comment_id":102806703,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197526/is-it-possible-to-execute-a-formula-inside-a-variable/58205728#comment102806703_58205728"},{"owner":{"reputation":1632,"user_id":1473412,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ac8599add0ace676200f6d50d6d2ff1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gravitate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1473412/gravitate"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12152476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2605d11c1cab2db7b7b39af36cec7175?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hammet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152476/hammet"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570091684,"post_id":58205728,"comment_id":102806778,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197526/is-it-possible-to-execute-a-formula-inside-a-variable/58205728#comment102806778_58205728"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1632,"user_id":1473412,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ac8599add0ace676200f6d50d6d2ff1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gravitate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1473412/gravitate"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1632,"user_id":1473412,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ac8599add0ace676200f6d50d6d2ff1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gravitate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1473412/gravitate"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570091595,"last_edit_date":1570091595,"creation_date":1570034200,"answer_id":58205728,"question_id":58197526,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58205728","body_markdown":"It is unclear whether you need to pull the formula from the object title at runtime, or whether you can hard code it.\r\n\r\nHard coding it would be trivial. `Application.Evaluate` will give you very similar functionality to the EVAL function in Javascript.\r\n\r\n    x = 23\r\n    formula= &quot;43,025*&quot; &amp; x &amp; &quot;^-0,452&quot;\r\n    Value = Application.Evaluate(formula)\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want to get the formula on the fly at runtime, that is a separate issue as you will need to find the range reference in the string and replace it with your new variable.

Looking for usages of parameterless method will lead to actual implementation, the other one will lead you directly to test cases.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197512/c-conditional-using-and-default-parameter/58197615#58197615","title":"C# conditional using and default parameter"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570005569,"post_id":58198008,"comment_id":102774202,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197512/c-conditional-using-and-default-parameter/58198008#comment102774202_58198008"},{"owner":{"reputation":1214,"user_id":4800629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/plmvj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hafiz Asad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4800629/hafiz-asad"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570006092,"post_id":58198008,"comment_id":102774458,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197512/c-conditional-using-and-default-parameter/58198008#comment102774458_58198008"},{"owner":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570006180,"post_id":58198008,"comment_id":102774503,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197512/c-conditional-using-and-default-parameter/58198008#comment102774503_58198008"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1214,"user_id":4800629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/plmvj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hafiz Asad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4800629/hafiz-asad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1214,"user_id":4800629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/plmvj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hafiz Asad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4800629/hafiz-asad"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570006081,"last_edit_date":1570006081,"creation_date":1570005423,"answer_id":58198008,"question_id":58197512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58198008","body_markdown":"Checkout this.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    string Foo(Resource parameter = null)\r\n            {\r\n                if (parameter != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    parameter.Something();\r\n                    return;\r\n                }\r\n                using (var res = new Resource())\r\n                {\r\n                    return Foo(res);\r\n                }\r\n            }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58197512/c-conditional-using-and-default-parameter/58198008#58198008","title":"C# conditional using and default parameter"}],"owner":{"reputation":559,"user_id":1697234,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6dfec41342bf73532edb4ecab58e57fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jakub Szułakiewicz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1697234/jakub-szu%c5%82akiewicz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":892,"user_id":2190035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8f3dabd702e690cfd83f0f9ab1f273c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2190035","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2190035/user2190035"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":235,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58197572,"answer_count":4,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1570463034,"creation_date":1570003470,"last_edit_date":1570463034,"question_id":58197512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58197512","body_markdown":"Lets assume, we have an operation based on some file, connection, or other resource.\r\n\r\nWe need a method, which can be run with provided resource, or -
