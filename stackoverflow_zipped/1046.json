You tried several things without telling us what was wrong.  \r\n\r\n    In [241]: array_a = np.array([1,2,3]) \r\n         ...: array_b = np.array([[10, 11, 12], [20, 21, 22], [30, 31, 32]])  \r\n\r\n`vstack` runs:\r\n      \r\n    In [242]: np.vstack((array_a, array_b))                                         \r\n    Out[242]: \r\n    array([[ 1,  2,  3],\r\n           [10, 11, 12],\r\n           [20, 21, 22],\r\n           [30, 31, 32]])\r\n\r\nBut the result is a **vertical** join, by rows, not columns. The `v` in `vstack` is supposed to remind us of that.\r\n\r\n`stack` tries to join the arrays on a **new** axis, and requires that all input array have a matching shape:\r\n\r\n    In [243]: np.stack((array_a, array_b))                                          \r\n    ...\r\n    ValueError: all input arrays must have the same shape\r\n\r\nI suspect you tried this at random, without really reading the docs.\r\n\r\nBoth of these use `concatenate`, which is the basic joiner.  But it&#39;s picky about dimensions:\r\n\r\n    In [244]: np.concatenate((array_a, array_b))                                    \r\n    ...\r\n    ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 1 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 2 dimension(s)\r\n\r\nYou clearly realized that the number of dimensions didn&#39;t match.\r\n\r\nYou want to make a (3,4) array.  One is (3,3), the other needs to be (3,1).  And join axis needs to be 1\r\n\r\n    In [247]: np.concatenate((array_a[:,None], array_b), axis=1)                    \r\n    Out[247]: \r\n    array([[ 1, 10, 11, 12],\r\n           [ 2, 20, 21, 22],\r\n           [ 3, 30, 31, 32]])\r\n\r\nIf we made a (1,3) array, and tried to join on the default 0 axis, we get the same thing as the `vstack`.  In fact that&#39;s what `vstack` does:\r\n\r\n    In [248]: np.concatenate((array_a[None,:], array_b))                            \r\n    Out[248]: \r\n    array([[ 1,  2,  3],\r\n           [10, 11, 12],\r\n           [20, 21, 22],\r\n           [30, 31, 32]])\r\n    \r\nAnother function is:\r\n\r\n    In [249]: np.column_stack((array_a, array_b))                                   \r\n    Out[249]: \r\n    array([[ 1, 10, 11, 12],\r\n           [ 2, 20, 21, 22],\r\n           [ 3, 30, 31, 32]])\r\n\r\nThis does the same thing as [247].\r\n\r\nFunctions like `vstack` and `column_stack` are handy, but in long run it&#39;s better to understand how to use `concatenate` itself.  \r\n                                                      ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293610/concatenate-1d-and-2d-arrays-as-per-index-position/58294188#58294188","title":"Concatenate 1D and 2D arrays as per index position"}],"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":6848363,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10157229056200538/picture?type=large","display_name":"Christian Ivaha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6848363/christian-ivaha"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570569408,"creation_date":1570566246,"question_id":58293610,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293610","body_markdown":"I am trying to concatenate a 1D into a 2D array.

I have installed Splunk forwarder version 7.3.2 on a second server.  Both servers are running Ubuntu 18.  \r\n\r\nOn the Splunk forwarder I ran these commands:\r\n\r\n    sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /var/log/syslog -index main -sourcetype %app%\r\n    \r\n    sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add forward-server x.x.x.x:9997\r\n\r\n(where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the Splunk server)\r\n\r\n    sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start\r\n\r\nI tried rebooting both servers and restarting Splunk on both.\r\n\r\nFrom the Splunk dashboard I want to see some indication of the logs from the server with the forwarder.  But I don&#39;t see any. I log into the web UI, I go to Settings -&gt; Monitoring Console -&gt;  Indexing -&gt; Indexes and Performance.  There is an &quot;Instance&quot; drop down menu.  But the only option I see is the Splunk server.  I do not see the forwarder.\r\n\r\nIf I go to Data Inputs in the web UI, I cannot click &quot;Next.&quot;\r\n\r\nHow can I see some evidence that the Splunk web UI is receiving data from the Splunk forwarder?\r\n\r\nI check network connectivity, and nothing is blocking TCP/IP communication between the two.  I would expect to see some forwarded data in Splunk (on the main Splunk server), but I am not seeing that.  What should I do?\r\n\r\nEdit: Through the web UI for Splunk I configured a listening port for the forwarding on port 9997.  By running `splunk enable listen 9997` I get \r\n\r\n&gt; Failed to create. Configuration for port 9997 already exists.\r\n\r\nUpdate on 10/9/19\r\n\r\nConnectivity is configured over port 9997 between the two servers.  I have used nmap to test over this port to and from both servers using internal and external IP addresses.  Nothing is filtered over this port.  Therefore I am quite sure no firewall rule or security mechanism is to blame.  In fact, the back end splunk log for the main splunk server has registered some activity of the Splunk forwarder.\r\n\r\nI am trying to index /var/log/* on my Splunk forwarder server.  Here is an excerpt from /opt/splunkforwarder/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log: \r\n\r\n&gt; 10-10-2019 00:21:18.059 +0000 INFO  WatchedFile - Will begin reading\r\n&gt; at offset=4835872 for file=&#39;/var/log/sampleoct.log&#39;. ... 10-10-2019\r\n&gt; 00:22:10.944 +0000 WARN  FileClassifierManager - The file\r\n&gt; &#39;/var/log/.test123.swp&#39; is invalid.

(I presume this is because you are having kubectl define it).\r\n\r\nAssuming that you expect that $GCP_PROJECT_ID does not exist in the build environment and is instead something you are trying to copy from at the time your container executes (as indicated by your exec example), your problem is that the quoting of the RUN line\r\n\r\n````\r\nRUN echo &#39;REACT_APP_GCP_PROJECT_ID=&#39;$GCP_PROJECT_ID &gt;&gt; /usr/app/.env\r\n````\r\n\r\nIs interpreting $GCP_PROJECT_ID during the build, which of course is the empty string.  In your test in the shell inside the container, it appears that $GCP_PROJECT_ID actually exists in the environment and all is well.\r\n\r\nYou need to actually quote the $GCP_PROJECT_ID variable to get it included into /usr/app/.env, like so (instead of being interpreted as an empty string!):\r\n\r\n````\r\nRUN echo &#39;REACT_APP_GCP_PROJECT_ID=$GCP_PROJECT_ID&#39; &gt;&gt; /usr/app/.env\r\n````\r\n\r\nOf course, if you need the literal string which is the value of $GCP_PROJECT_ID to be included in the .env file, your only alternative may be to actually do the echo into .env at the beginning of the container execution (e.g. at the top of &lt;code&gt;docker-entrypoint.sh&lt;/code&gt;, and remove all the related code from your Dockerfile).\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nIf I am wrong about you having kubectl define it when the process starts, an alternative solution would require you to ensure that the docker build itself has access to that environment variable.  You can do this with the &lt;code&gt;--build-arg&lt;/code&gt; argument, such as:\r\n\r\n````\r\ndocker build --build-arg GCP_PROJECT_ID=[correct value] .\r\n````\r\n\r\nIn this case, you need to add an argument command to the Dockerfile, like so:\r\n\r\n````\r\nARG GCP_PROJECT_ID\r\n````\r\n\r\nat some point before the RUN command.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293584/cannot-get-kubectl-environment-variables-on-deploy/58294153#58294153","title":"Cannot get kubectl environment variables on deploy"}],"owner":{"reputation":922,"user_id":6822876,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zd7BK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carrein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6822876/carrein"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1225,"user_id":3399890,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/171944b3f88fd2fa4bc824b4b298de4e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"robsiemb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3399890/robsiemb"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58294153,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570582451,"creation_date":1570566139,"last_edit_date":1570582451,"question_id":58293584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293584","body_markdown":"I have a docker container with a few environment variables setup.

Remember that a structured function should have only one return statement. &quot;\r\n\r\nI think I have most of the program correct, except im having difficulties with the function portion. We have not learned if else statements so I can&#39;t use those. My thoughts were a conditional while statement to return a value of -1.0 if 0 is entered. Any thoughts would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the code I have so far. \r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    double divmaster(double x, double y);\r\n    \r\n    int main(void)\r\n    {\r\n    \tdouble i, j, value;\r\n    \r\n    \tprintf(&quot;Please enter two numbers &quot;);\r\n    \tprintf(&quot;the first number will be divded by the second. The value &quot;);\r\n    \tprintf(&quot;will then be returned. Enter q to quit\\n&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \twhile (scanf(&quot;%d%d&quot;, &amp;i, &amp;j) == 2)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tvalue = divmaster(i, j);\r\n    \t\tprintf(&quot;%d divded by %d is %.6f\\n&quot;, i, j, value);\r\n    \t\tprintf(&quot;Please enter the next paid of numbers or q to quit.\\n&quot;);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \treturn 0;\r\n    }\r\n    \t\r\n    \tdouble divmaster(double x, double y)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\twhile (y &lt;= 0);\r\n    \t\tprintf(&quot;-1.0&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n

am using Semantic-UI React and Next.JS but it appears at breakpoint &lt; 768px, my Home component completely breaks upon a refresh of the browser. I know because its a react/next.js app they are taking care of the routing but I guess I wondered what if a user happen to do that?\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t happen on my /login, /register or /profile routes\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;ve checked around to solve my issue — [Here][1] and in that post it points to the [React docs][2]; the explanation for why this happens and the prescription to solve it doesn&#39;t seem to fit to my case.\r\n\r\n&gt; Same as render(), but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML\r\n&gt; contents were rendered by ReactDOMServer. React will attempt to attach\r\n&gt; event listeners to the existing markup.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; React expects that the rendered content is identical between the\r\n&gt; server and the client. It can patch up differences in text content,\r\n&gt; but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In development\r\n&gt; mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no\r\n&gt; guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of\r\n&gt; mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most\r\n&gt; apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be\r\n&gt; prohibitively expensive.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably\r\n&gt; different between the server and the client (for example, a\r\n&gt; timestamp), you may silence the warning by adding\r\n&gt; suppressHydrationWarning={true} to the element. It only works one\r\n&gt; level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it.\r\n&gt; Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so\r\n&gt; it may remain inconsistent until future updates.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If you intentionally need to render something different on the server\r\n&gt; and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that\r\n&gt; render something different on the client can read a state variable\r\n&gt; like this.state.isClient, which you can set to true in\r\n&gt; componentDidMount(). This way the initial render pass will render the\r\n&gt; same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional\r\n&gt; pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is entry point file: `pages/index`\r\n\r\n    import React from &#39;react&#39;\r\n    import Head from &#39;../components/head&#39;\r\n    import HomeLayout from &#39;../components/Home/Home.jsx&#39;\r\n    import &#39;semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css&#39;\r\n    import &#39;../styles/styles.scss&#39;\r\n    import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;\r\n    \r\n    // import {bindActionCreators} from &#39;redux&#39;\r\n    // import withRedux from &#39;next-redux-wrapper&#39;\r\n    import { logInUser } from &#39;../store&#39;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class Home extends React.Component {\r\n        static async getInitialProps({ isLoggedIn }) {\r\n            return { isLoggedIn }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n   \r\n        render() {\r\n            const { isLoggedIn } = this.props\r\n            return (\r\n            &lt;div&gt;\r\n            {console.log(&quot;isLoggedIn &quot;, isLoggedIn)}\r\n               &lt;Head title = &#39;Home&#39;

For example, if you have a &#39;feature&#39; that is broad enough for two or more developers to be tackling it at the same time, I don&#39;t consider that to be a feature, I consider it to be an [epic][1].\r\n\r\nI would break such work right down to the extent where each &#39;feature&#39; is restricted to only one developer. That way these features can be worked on independently on their own `feature` branch by a single developer, and then merged back to `develop` once the work is complete.\r\n\r\nWork should be split (and projects should be structured) in such a way that developers almost never need to work on the same files at the same time, though If two developers are required to work in tandem on the exact same area, developer B can always merge `develop` back into their `feature` branch to get the latest changes.\r\n\r\n*However*, I would advise against merging developer A&#39;s `feature` branch directly into developer B&#39;s `feature` branch. In doing so, you&#39;re essentially saying that feature B is dependent on feature A. I would also advise against using a &#39;joint&#39; branch for the same reason.\r\n\r\nIn such a scenario, I suggest simply *delaying* work on feature B; you&#39;re introducing unknown risk into the development of feature B, and rushing the development of feature A. This can lead to inadequate testing of feature A (which can be resolved by [shifting to the left][2], where the testing is done on the branch itself, before it is deployed back to `develop`).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293514/should-developers-share-git-branches/58293764#58293764","title":"Should developers share git branches?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1320,"user_id":274030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fd910b4f7c7baabc22976dc6b29b744?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Everett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/274030/everett"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1570610893,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570567029,"creation_date":1570565893,"question_id":58293514,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293514","body_markdown":"This seems like a simple enough question, but it&#39;s generated a surprising amount of conversation in the office.  **Should developers share a branch, e.g. while working on a feature?**  Or should each developer use their own branch and if collaboration with other team-members is required, then a separate branch (something like a release branch) should be used for the purpose?\r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t seen any of the major branching strategies address this directly (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, or GitLab Flow).  Sharing a single feature branch lets multiple developers easily collaborate, and any cleanup of the commits/messages can be done when a pull-request is created and/or merged.  However, even 2 developers can butt heads when working on the same branch, e.g. if one of them uses merges and the other uses rebases.

For example, for an input table\r\n\r\n[![example_table_1][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to add a column that counts up from the most recent interaction date for that user (e.g., the most recent interaction date is 1, the next-most previous interaction date is 2, etc.):\r\n\r\n[![desired_output_table][2]][2]\r\n\r\nCan anyone steer me toward the right way to do this?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mtcf7.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NmyLR.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293503/add-column-with-within-subject-rank-ordered-interaction-day-in-pyspark","title":"Add column with within-subject rank-ordered interaction day in pyspark"},{"tags":["r","loops"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34781,"user_id":3358272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gteVQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"r2evans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3358272/r2evans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570566114,"post_id":58293501,"comment_id":102951140,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293501/label-hist-axis-in-a-multiplot-from-loops#comment102951140_58293501"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11261911,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-84wmKy2GYdc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdqqUQFG6uLQimLdA9pDhhtyiFhVg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Heithor Queiroz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11261911/heithor-queiroz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":34781,"user_id":3358272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gteVQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"r2evans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3358272/r2evans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570635765,"post_id":58293501,"comment_id":102977241,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293501/label-hist-axis-in-a-multiplot-from-loops#comment102977241_58293501"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11261911,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-84wmKy2GYdc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdqqUQFG6uLQimLdA9pDhhtyiFhVg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Heithor Queiroz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11261911/heithor-queiroz"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570658144,"post_id":58309167,"comment_id":102986598,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293501/label-hist-axis-in-a-multiplot-from-loops/58309167#comment102986598_58309167"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34781,"user_id":3358272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gteVQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"r2evans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3358272/r2evans"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570641313,"creation_date":1570641313,"answer_id":58309167,"question_id":58293501,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58309167","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: when you ask questions, please try to make them reproducible for us. In this case, `dados.no.id` is still missing. I&#39;m inferring that it is really just `dados` with the first column removed, which I will proxy by using `i+1` instead of `i` in the indexing.\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\npar(mfrow=c(2,5))                 # multiplot parameters\r\nloop.vector &lt;- 1:10\r\nfor (i in loop.vector){\r\n  z &lt;- dados[,i+1]                # dataframe without id column\r\n  hist(z, main = (&quot; &quot;),           # histogram plot function\r\n       xlab = names(dados)[i+1])  # trying to plot headers from dataframe\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it&#39;s possible (likely, even) that you have the `Hmisc` package installed, in which case you can come close with just:\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\npar(mfrow=c(2,5))\r\nHmisc::hist.data.frame(dados[,-1], n.unique=1)\r\n# or optionally\r\nlibrary(Hmisc)\r\npar(mfrow=c(2,5))\r\nhist(dados[,-1], n.unique=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(The use of `n.unique=1` is required only because of the sample data you provided. If you look at the source of the function, you&#39;ll see that it only shows a histogram for a column if there are at least `n.unique` values, and some of your columns have only one unique value in its two rows.)\r\n\r\nThe use of `dados[,-1]` will plot all except the first column (`id` in your data).

trying to design a schema intended to store multiple DB of cars (honda, bmw, opel, etc) in the same DB (consolidated master data). \r\n\r\nTo keep it simple, let say that each external DB have 3 entities: Model (lookup table), Category (lookup table), Car which refers the two lookup tables. \r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that Model and Category have completely different data in each external DB (but 99% common attributes). Thus in my consolidated DB how can I keep track of the Model and Category that belongs to each brand ? \r\n\r\nSimilarly, how can I avoid that a Car of brand Honda refers to Category or Model not belonging to Honda ? \r\n\r\nSomehow the brand information should also be stored (lookup table) but how can we avoid to avoid multiple cascade path ?\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the business requirement, users don&#39;t want any transformation / modification of the source data in the consolidated database. They should be kept as they are in the external DB.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of data of *Category*:\r\n\r\n**HONDA**\r\n\r\n - Sport\r\n\r\n - Sport Compact\r\n\r\n - City Car\r\n\r\nNB: &quot;Sport Comptact&quot; has &quot;Sport&quot; for parent\r\n\r\n**VW**\r\n\r\n - Sport Car\r\n\r\n - Sport Compact \r\n\r\n - City Car\r\n\r\nNB: &quot;Sport Compact&quot; has &quot;Sport Car&quot; for parent\r\n\r\n**BMW**\r\n\r\n - Super Car\r\n \r\n - Hyper Car\r\n\r\n - City Car\r\n\r\nAs example of data of *Model*:\r\n\r\n**HONDA**\r\n\r\n - Sedan\r\n\r\n - Wagon\r\n\r\n - Hatchback\r\n\r\n - Coup&#233;\r\n\r\n**VW**\r\n\r\n - SUV\r\n\r\n - Sedan - Coupe\r\n\r\n**BMW**\r\n\r\n - Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) \r\n\r\n - Wagon - Hatchback\r\n\r\n[I was thinking of a schema like this one][1]\r\n\r\nAll tables are connected to the Brand table, so that the frontend can populate the lookup tables Model and Category independently.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve brought the Brand ID down to the Car table which allows to ensure that Car referes Model and Category of the same Brand.\r\n\r\nBUT, not all SGBDR allows for referencing columns that are not part of PK neither to have multi-columns key.\r\n\r\nThings get also complicated if a Car needs to have multiple Category or Model, or if a Car needs to refer to another Car from another Brand (think of Seat which belongs to

In order to redirect back from the hosted pay page, I need to implement Android App Link (haven&#39;t gotten to do iOS version yet).  Based on [this][1] article, in order for App Links to work, one needs:\r\n\r\n 1. Identify a redirect URL on the Moneris hosted pay page (or on the page where a redirect might take place, in case of a generic example);\r\n 2. Modify AndroidManifest.xml to associate redirects with activities;\r\n 3. Implement a way in Flutter to intercept App Links;\r\n 4. Place the Digital Asset Links JSON file on the web site (same domain as redirect URL) in the .well-known folder.\r\n\r\nFor #1, I have identified 2 URLs, one for approved payments (https://example.com/moneris_approved) and one for declined payments (https://example.com/moneris_declined).  URLs have to be in https for the whole thing to work.  Moneris can reply with a POST with XML, POST with parms or GET with parms.  Tried all three.\r\n\r\nFor #2, I have modified AndroidManifest.xml both by hand and with help of Android Studio. Relevant pieces look like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-xml --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;application\r\n        android:name=&quot;io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication&quot;\r\n        android:label=&quot;&lt;label&gt;&quot;\r\n        android:icon=&quot;@mipmap/ic_launcher&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;activity\r\n            android:name=&quot;.MainActivity&quot;\r\n            android:launchMode=&quot;singleTop&quot;\r\n            android:theme=&quot;@style/LaunchTheme&quot;\r\n            ...              \r\n            &lt;intent-filter&gt;\r\n                &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot; /&gt;\r\n                &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.LAUNCHER&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\r\n    \r\n            &lt;intent-filter android:autoVerify=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.VIEW&quot; /&gt;    \r\n                &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.DEFAULT&quot; /&gt;\r\n                &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.BROWSABLE&quot; /&gt;    \r\n                &lt;data\r\n                    android:scheme=&quot;https&quot;\r\n                    android:host=&quot;example.com&quot;\r\n                    android:pathPattern=&quot;/moneris_approved&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;    \r\n            &lt;intent-filter android:autoVerify=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.VIEW&quot; /&gt;   \r\n                &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.DEFAULT&quot; /&gt;\r\n                &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.BROWSABLE&quot; /&gt;    \r\n                &lt;data\r\n                    android:scheme=&quot;https&quot;\r\n                    android:host=&quot;example.com&quot;\r\n                    android:pathPattern=&quot;/moneris_declined&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;    \r\n        &lt;/activity&gt;\r\n    &lt;/application&gt;\r\n\r\nFor #3, I am using uni_links package which takes care of channeling incoming App Links to my app.\r\n\r\nFor #4, I have created and uploaded the assetlinks.json file and placed in the right folder.  Included both debug and release SHA256 fingerprints.  The file looks like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-json --&gt;\r\n\r\n    [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;relation&quot;: [&quot;delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls&quot;],\r\n            &quot;target&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;namespace&quot;: &quot;android_app&quot;,\r\n                &quot;package_name&quot;: &quot;com.example.&lt;name&gt;&quot;,\r\n                &quot;sha256_cert_fingerprints&quot;:\r\n                [&quot;........&quot;]\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nNow, after doing all that, when Moneris redirects to provided URLs, I am seeing a 404 page coming from my hosting site.\r\n\r\nTo verify the setup, I have:\r\n\r\n - Successful tested statement file with the [Statement List Generator and Tester][2];\r\n - Successfully tested digital asset link file with Google APIs (https://digitalassetlinks.googleapis.com/v1/statements:list?source.web.site=https://example.com&amp;relation=delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls)\r\n - Successfully tested the URL intent using ADB shell (am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d &quot;https://example.com/moneris_approved&quot;)\r\n - Successfully checked link policies using ADB (adb shell dumpsys package d)\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nAt this point, I don&#39;t know how else to test it or what the problem is.  I don&#39;t think the problem is with my app but rather soemthing is not closing the loop between Moneris redirect and it coming back to my app.\r\n\r\n#Update 1#\r\n\r\nI devised a testing approach like this:\r\n\r\n 1. Created a link-test page on my site with links mimicking redirects (i.e. same host/path as in the app&#39;s AndroidManifest.xml;\r\n 2. Created a simple Java Android App using Android Studio.  Using App Link Assistant I updated its AndroidManifest, created intents and reacted to those coming in.  Also updated the assetlinks.json file on my website.  Tested it with the link-test page running on my emulator and everything worked as expected.  App opened up ok.\r\n 3. Repeated #2 but this time with a Flutter app using the uni_links package.  Went throught he same steps of creating slightly different links on my link-test page, updating AndroidManifest and assetlinks.json file.  Tested it with the link-test page running on my emulator and everything worked as expected.  App opened up ok.\r\n 4. Run the app I am working on on the emulator and put the links I am expecting to get from Moneris on my link-test page and tsted on the emulator.  Everything worked as expected.  App opened up ok.\r\n\r\nSo now my question is: what is the difference between me clicking on a link on my page (HTTP GET) vs. Moneris redirecting to the same link using HTTP GET?  Me clicking on the link works.  Moneris redirect does not.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking\r\n  [2]: https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator\r\n  [3]:

This might be an appropriate time for `useLayoutEffect` so that it runs immediately after the markers are rendered and ref values (should?) be set.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuseLayoutEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n  if (data) {\r\n    markerRef.current.map(ref =&gt; ref.current &amp;&amp; ref.current.showCallout());\r\n  }\r\n}, [data]);\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293433/react-useref-hook-causing-cannot-read-property-0-of-undefined-error/58293493#58293493","title":"React useRef hook causing &quot;Cannot read property &#39;0&#39; of undefined&quot; error"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":854,"user_id":12015722,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cf77efd63879ac761bb3b9b572addd4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ckedar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12015722/ckedar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570617961,"creation_date":1570617961,"answer_id":58302407,"question_id":58293433,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58302407","body_markdown":"Create refs using memoisation, like:\r\n\r\n\tconst markerRefs = useMemo(() =&gt; data &amp;&amp; data.posts.map(d =&gt; React.createRef()), [data]);\r\n\r\nThen render them like:\r\n\r\n      {data &amp;&amp;\r\n        data.posts.map((d, i) =&gt; (\r\n          &lt;Marker key={d} data={d} ref={markerRefs[i]}&gt;\r\n            &lt;div&gt;Callout&lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Marker&gt;\r\n        ))}\r\n\r\nAnd use the refs for calling imperative functions like:\r\n\r\n\t  const showAllCallouts = () =&gt; {\r\n\t    markerRefs.map(r =&gt; r.current.showCallout());\r\n\t  };\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the working code with mocked `Marker`: https://codesandbox.io/s/muddy-bush-gfd82\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293433/react-useref-hook-causing-cannot-read-property-0-of-undefined-error/58302407#58302407","title":"React useRef hook causing &quot;Cannot read property &#39;0&#39; of undefined&quot; error"}],"owner":{"reputation":312,"user_id":10116367,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ixorG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kevvv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10116367/kevvv"},"last_editor":{"reputation":312,"user_id":10116367,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ixorG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kevvv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10116367/kevvv"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58293493,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570617961,"creation_date":1570565501,"last_edit_date":1570576141,"question_id":58293433,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293433","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a reference using the `useRef` hook for each items within an array of `data by doing the following:\r\n\r\n    const markerRef = useRef(data.posts.map(React.createRef))\r\n\r\nNow, `data` is fetched externally through GraphQL and it takes time to arrive, therefore, during the mounting phase, `data` is `undefined`.

Like so:\r\n```\r\n#   group       date binary want\r\n#1      1 2000-01-01      1    1\r\n#2      1 2000-01-03      1    1\r\n#3      1 2000-01-04      1    2\r\n#4      1 2000-01-05      0    1\r\n#5      2 2000-01-09      1    1\r\n#6      2 2000-01-10      0    1\r\n#7      2 2000-01-12      1    1\r\n#8      3 2000-01-05      1    1\r\n#9      3 2000-01-06      1    2\r\n#10     3 2000-01-07      1    3\r\n#11     3 2000-01-08      1    4\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried akrun&#39;s suggestion which worked very well without the binary var, I tried to modify it adding the binary var as part of cumsum but I get errors: \r\n```\r\ndf %&gt;% group_by(group) \r\n%&gt;% mutate(wantn = rowid(cumsum(c(TRUE, diff(as.Date(date)) !=1 &amp;

It can be done using a sniffer tool like [Wireshark][2]. Once you know the protocol(s) you should be able to check whether JMeter (or other open source tool) supports this protocol or not. \r\n\r\nThe options could be in:\r\n\r\n 1. JMeter supports the protocol out of the box via one of its [Samplers][3]. For example if the protocol is simple enough and can be recorded and replayed you can capture the requests using the aforementioned Wireshark and simulate them with the [TCP Sampler][4], however the chance it will work is minimal \r\n 2. JMeter supports the protocol via one of its [Plugins][5] \r\n 3. There is a Java (or other language) client library implementing the protocol, in this case you will be able to use [JSR223 Sampler][6] and implement the use cases in Groovy (or other language, but it has to be [JVM/JSR223 compabitle][7]) or [JUnit Request][8] sampler and implement the use cases in Java\r\n 4. The protocol is proprietary and there are no client libraries for it. In this case you won&#39;t be able to conduct the load test without reaching out to the call system vendor and asking them for the implementation details and instructions on how it can be tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_(OSI_model)\r\n  [2]: https://www.wireshark.org/\r\n  [3]: https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#samplers\r\n  [4]: https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#TCP_Sampler\r\n  [5]: https://jmeter-plugins.org/\r\n  [6]: https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#JSR223_Sampler\r\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages\r\n  [8]: https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/how-use-junit-jmeter/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293410/can-we-do-load-testing-for-video-or-audio-call-in-jmeter/58301103#58301103","title":"Can we do Load testing for Video or Audio call in jmeter"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":32299,"user_id":7294900,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pdqi4.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user7294900","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7294900/user7294900"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570680596,"creation_date":1570680596,"answer_id":58315345,"question_id":58293410,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58315345","body_markdown":"You can use [UBIK Load Pack][1] which is a paid version for load test videos using JMeter with free trail\r\n\r\n&gt;Realistic and Scalable Load Testing for MPEG Dash, Apple&#39;s HTTP Live, Microsoft Smooth and Adobe HDS Streaming formats\r\n\r\n[1]:https://ubikloadpack.com/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293410/can-we-do-load-testing-for-video-or-audio-call-in-jmeter/58315345#58315345","title":"Can we do Load testing for Video or Audio call in jmeter"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":5826379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KO14Vn1lrus/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFA/6dlrwPJNW_A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mehran Shafqat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5826379/mehran-shafqat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570680596,"creation_date":1570565400,"question_id":58293410,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293410","body_markdown":"Is there any way we can do performance testing for voice or video call ?

a little confused by what&#39;s going on at the top of your code, so I&#39;m not going to refactor the entire thing.  I&#39;m going to provide an explanation from the time we have our string.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to use .split(), which will return an array of string values based on what character you choose to split the string by. The reason we need to do this is because your code is currently looping through each string, rather than each word in the string.  In this instance, I&#39;m assuming your string can&#39;t take punctuation like commas or periods. If that&#39;s the case, you want to split by empty spaces, so it would look like string.split(&quot; &quot;). \r\n\r\nThen, you could use the map() array method to loop through every value in the array and perform a function on it.  Note, the map() method will return a new array, so best to save this into a new variable.  \r\n\r\nThen, you could use the .join() method, which will join the values of an array based on some value (essentially the opposite of .split()). Again, assuming no punctuation, I&#39;d join the array with a space so that the values have a space between them, which would look like array.join(&quot; &quot;).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve included some mock code below.\r\n\r\n    const string = prompt(&quot;Please enter your string&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    const stringToArray = string.split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n    console.log(stringToArray);\r\n    \r\n    const filteredArray = stringToArray.map((string) =&gt; {\r\n      if (string.length &gt; 5) {\r\n        return string + &quot;-bork&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      return string + &quot;-boink&quot;;\r\n    });\r\n    console.log(filteredArray);\r\n    \r\n    const joinedFilteredArray = filteredArray.join(&quot;

You should subscribe to `UIResponder.keyboardWillChangeFrameNotification` and/or `UIResponder.keyboardDidChangeFrameNotification` which are notifications which trigger when the keyboard&#39;s frame will, or did, change. Here&#39;s an example of it in use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Somewhere in set up code\r\nNotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(keyboardDidChangeFrame),\r\n    name: UIResponder.keyboardDidChangeFrameNotification, object: nil)\r\n\r\n// Function elsewhere in your class\r\n@objc func keyboardDidChangeFrame(_ notification: Notification) {\r\n  guard let kbSize = notification.userInfo?[UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey]\r\n      as? CGRect else {\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Use kbRect as you initially did\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can use either the `Will` or the `Did` notifications depending on how you want the layout change to look. You can also query both `UIResponder.keyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey` `UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey` to get the keyboard frame before and after the size change, which may be useful if you want to animate your layout along with the keyboard.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293384/get-keyboard-size-with-suggestion-bar-swift/58298604#58298604","title":"Get keyboard size with suggestion bar swift"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":345,"user_id":2468781,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LOp83.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"erdemildiz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2468781/erdemildiz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570606285,"creation_date":1570606285,"answer_id":58299111,"question_id":58293384,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58299111","body_markdown":"You can try this;\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport UIKit\r\n\r\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n       \r\n        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(keyboardWillChange(notification:)), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification, object: nil)\r\n        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(keyboardWillChange(notification:)), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification, object: nil)\r\n        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(keyboardWillChange(notification:)), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillChangeFrameNotification, object: nil)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    deinit {\r\n        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification)\r\n        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification)\r\n        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(UIResponder.keyboardWillChangeFrameNotification)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @objc func keyboardWillChange(notification: Notification) {\r\n        \r\n        guard let keyboardSize = (notification.userInfo?[UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as?

FOR EACH block of test, I want to be able to extract what is in the square bracket, the line containing the FIRST instance of the word &quot;area&quot;, and what is on the right of the square bracket. Everything will be a string. Essentially what I want to do is store each string into a variable in a hash so i can print it into a 3 column csv file.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a sample of what the file looks like:\r\n\r\n&gt;Student-[K-6] Exceptional in Math &lt;br&gt;\r\n/home/area/kinder/mathadvance.txt, 12 &lt;br&gt;\r\nStudents in grade K-12 shown to be exceptional in math. &lt;br&gt;\r\nPlaced into special after school program. &lt;br&gt;\r\nSee /home/area/overall/performance.txt, 200\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nStudent-[Junior] Weak Performance &lt;br&gt;\r\nStudents with overall weak performance. &lt;br&gt; \r\nSummer program services offered as shown in &lt;br&gt;\r\n&quot;/home/area/services/summer.txt&quot;, 212 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nStudent-[K-6] Physical Excerise Time Slots\r\n&lt;br&gt; /home/area/pe/schedule.txt, 303&lt;br&gt;\r\nAssigned time slots for PE based on student&#39;s grade level. Make reference to &lt;br&gt;\r\n/home/area/overall/classtimes.txt, 90&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI want to to have a final csv file that looks like:\r\n\r\n&gt; Grade,Topic,Path\r\n&lt;br&gt;K-6, Exceptional in Math, /home/area/kinder/mathadvance.txt, 12\r\n&lt;br&gt;K-6, Physical Exercise Time Slots, /home/area/pe/schedule.txt, 303\r\n&lt;br&gt;Junior, Weak Performance, &quot;/home/area/services/summer.txt&quot;, 212\r\n\r\nSince it&#39;s a csv file, I know it will also separate at the line number when exporting into excel but I&#39;m fine with that.  \r\nI started off by putting the grade type into an array because I want to be able to add more strings to it for different grade levels. \r\n\r\nMy program looks like this so far:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/perl\r\nuse strict;\r\nuse warnings;\r\n\r\nmy @grades = (&quot;K-6&quot;, &quot;Junior&quot;, &quot;Community-College&quot;, &quot;PreK&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was thinking that I will need to do some sort of system sed command to grab what is in the brackets and store it into a variable. Then I will grab everything to the right of the bracket on the line and store it into a variable. And then I will grep for a line containing &quot;area&quot; to get the path and I will store it as a string into a variable, put these in a hash, and then print into csv. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m thinking about this the right way. Also, I have NO IDEA how to do this for each BLOCK of text in the file. I need it by block because each block has its own corresponding grades, topics, and paths. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293374/using-perl-to-parse-text-from-blocks","title":"Using Perl to parse text from blocks"},{"tags":["excel","vba"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12210,"user_id":9245853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4sRg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BigBen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9245853/bigben"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570565382,"post_id":58293373,"comment_id":102950849,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293373/how-to-select-range-of-cells-instead-of-only-2-cells-for-strbody-variable#comment102950849_58293373"},{"owner":{"reputation":8856,"user_id":6706419,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cp6Ow.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"urdearboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6706419/urdearboy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570565648,"post_id":58293373,"comment_id":102950949,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293373/how-to-select-range-of-cells-instead-of-only-2-cells-for-strbody-variable#comment102950949_58293373"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10162440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uNdUSJiAh_U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAM08/cvnNrqZZWBU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian Beahan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10162440/brian-beahan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12210,"user_id":9245853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4sRg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BigBen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9245853/bigben"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570566652,"post_id":58293373,"comment_id":102951388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293373/how-to-select-range-of-cells-instead-of-only-2-cells-for-strbody-variable#comment102951388_58293373"},{"owner":{"reputation":19257,"user_id":4650297,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1byc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BruceWayne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4650297/brucewayne"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570566848,"post_id":58293373,"comment_id":102951480,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293373/how-to-select-range-of-cells-instead-of-only-2-cells-for-strbody-variable#comment102951480_58293373"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10162440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uNdUSJiAh_U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAM08/cvnNrqZZWBU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian Beahan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10162440/brian-beahan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":19257,"user_id":4650297,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1byc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BruceWayne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4650297/brucewayne"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570567353,"post_id":58293373,"comment_id":102951639,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293373/how-to-select-range-of-cells-instead-of-only-2-cells-for-strbody-variable#comment102951639_58293373"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19257,"user_id":4650297,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1byc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BruceWayne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4650297/brucewayne"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570567465,"creation_date":1570567465,"answer_id":58293854,"question_id":58293373,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58293854","body_markdown":"Without seeing your data, you might consider building a UDF:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n    strBody = build_body(ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;).Range(&quot;A1:B2&quot;))\r\n    End Sub\r\n    \r\n    Function build_body(rng As Range, Optional delimiter As String = &quot;

So you need to define that hostname somewhere.\r\n\r\nFor example you can set it in `config/environments/production.rb` by including\r\n\r\n    config.action_controller.default_url_options = {:host =&gt; &quot;naijasinglesmeet.herokuapp.com&quot;}\r\n\r\nThis is because your application does not know under which host/domain it is running, you have to tell it that.\r\n\r\nA little tip, if you run into such problems, run `heroku logs --tail`, this will give you a continous logs as if you were using the development server.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293349/rails-app-showing-memory-stats-in-heroku-logs/58293782#58293782","title":"Rails app showing memory stats in heroku logs"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12184422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gnIp64IhhWY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdqqn3CtbGJ55OuFvxJdcbpYCPcGw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yinka Ash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184422/yinka-ash"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12184422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gnIp64IhhWY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdqqn3CtbGJ55OuFvxJdcbpYCPcGw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yinka Ash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184422/yinka-ash"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58293782,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570567128,"creation_date":1570565100,"last_edit_date":1570566760,"question_id":58293349,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293349","body_markdown":"I signed up on my rails app on heroku and get the following error on my heroku logs.

See the explanation in the comments of the slave transmit arduino code above. It took me a long time to figure that out.\r\n - **nothing worked with three devices connected to the I2C bus**, even if one of them was not powered. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s happening there but I suspect its related to documentation stating that the I2C bus cannot pull its lines back to HIGH. Some documentation recommends placing a resistor on both I2C lines connected to your source voltage so the line voltages return to HIGH after the devices pulls them low.\r\n - **this work would be easier with an oscilloscope**. I could have figured out this problem much more quickly if I had had one.

In the first demo the master transmits the next character every 500 ms and the slave receives it. And in the second demo the master requests the next character every 500 ms and the slave transmits it. \r\n\r\nMy demos are adapted from the arduino Wire examples found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/MasterReader) and [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/MasterWriter).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293348/ada-i2c-demo-on-the-microbit-with-the-ada-drivers-library","title":"Ada i2c demo on the microbit with the Ada Drivers Library?"},{"tags":["azure","azure-resource-manager","arm-template"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":4672050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81239e26e67e7eac464a86a437005436?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yituo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4672050/yituo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570741892,"post_id":58312177,"comment_id":103020095,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293347/azure-arm-template-dependson-with-linked-template/58312177#comment103020095_58312177"},{"owner":{"reputation":4622,"user_id":4962130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3bJTR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"bmoore-msft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4962130/bmoore-msft"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":506,"user_id":4672050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81239e26e67e7eac464a86a437005436?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yituo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4672050/yituo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570809465,"post_id":58312177,"comment_id":103044630,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293347/azure-arm-template-dependson-with-linked-template/58312177#comment103044630_58312177"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4622,"user_id":4962130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3bJTR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"bmoore-msft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4962130/bmoore-msft"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570654632,"creation_date":1570654632,"answer_id":58312177,"question_id":58293347,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312177","body_markdown":"No, not possible - you need to set the dependsOn / dependency on the nested deployment resource itself, e.g.\r\n\r\n    &quot;dependsOn&quot;: [ &quot;[resourceId(&#39;Microsoft.Resources/deployments&#39;, &#39;myLinkedDeploymentName&#39;)]&quot; ]\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293347/azure-arm-template-dependson-with-linked-template/58312177#58312177","title":"Azure Arm template dependson with linked template"}],"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":4672050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81239e26e67e7eac464a86a437005436?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yituo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4672050/yituo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":506,"user_id":4672050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81239e26e67e7eac464a86a437005436?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yituo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4672050/yituo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570654632,"creation_date":1570565082,"last_edit_date":1570565648,"question_id":58293347,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293347","body_markdown":"Is it possible to use the [dependsOn][1] element with resources in a linked template?
