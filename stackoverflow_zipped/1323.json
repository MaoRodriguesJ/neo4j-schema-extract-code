It seems like MySQLi statement class has no way of storing a running total of affected rows. After I thought about it, it makes total sense. Let me explain.\r\n\r\nEvery time you execute the statement it will affect a given number of rows. In your case you have a simple INSERT statement, which will add records one by one. Therefore, each time you call `execute()` the `affected_rows` value is one. \r\n\r\nThe query could be something different. For example `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` or `UPDATE` could affect multiple rows.   \r\nYou could also have `INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`. If the key exists in DB, then you are not inserting anything. If the values are the same, you are not even updating anything. The affected rows, could be 0 or more. \r\n\r\nThe reason why it would be unwise for the statement to keep a running total of the affected rows is that each execution affects certain rows, irrespective of the previous executions. They could be even the same records. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n\t$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare(&#39;UPDATE users SET username=? WHERE id=?&#39;);\r\n\t$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&#39;si&#39;, $name, $id);\r\n\r\n\t$id = 102;\r\n\r\n\t$name = &#39;Affected rows 1&#39;;\r\n\t$stmt-&gt;execute();\r\n\techo $stmt-&gt;affected_rows; // 1\r\n\r\n\t$name = &#39;Affected rows 2&#39;;\r\n\t$stmt-&gt;execute();\r\n\techo $stmt-&gt;affected_rows; // 1\r\n\r\nBoth update statements updated the same row. If mysqli kept a running total it would report 2 affected rows, but in reality only 1 row was changed. If the number was summed, you would be losing information. \r\n\r\nSo, for your simple scenario, it is fine to keep the total on your own, for example by summing up the `$stmt-&gt;affected_rows` after each execution. Anything more than that, it would probably not make much sense. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227245/how-to-return-number-rows-affected-on-multiple-inserts-with-mysqli-php/58227706#58227706","title":"How to return number rows affected on multiple inserts with Mysqli Php?"}],"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":10177977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf188e08a450371c5a16b079a6bf451f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hmerman6006","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10177977/hmerman6006"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58227706,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570142005,"creation_date":1570138889,"last_edit_date":1570139638,"question_id":58227245,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227245","body_markdown":"I have a function which inserts multiple rows using the MySqli library with prepared statements.

So I&#39;ll consider refactoring the above to a call from `OnPostFrame()` for the sake of performance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227204/gui-drawtexturewithtexcoords-draws-with-wrong-colors/58243107#58243107","title":"GUI.DrawTextureWithTexCoords() draws with wrong colors"}],"owner":{"reputation":1324,"user_id":284013,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4OI6J.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erik Hermansen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284013/erik-hermansen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1324,"user_id":284013,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4OI6J.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erik Hermansen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284013/erik-hermansen"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58243107,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570222619,"creation_date":1570138610,"last_edit_date":1570219706,"question_id":58227204,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227204","body_markdown":"The attached picture sums it up. On the right is what I want. On the left is what I get. The colors are wrong. (left face image is from a captured screenshot from the game running in Unity. right face image is me pasting the correct art on top of the screenshot for comparison&#39;s sake)\r\n\r\nThe code I&#39;m calling from `OnGUI()` to overlay the face image:\r\n\r\n    GUI.DrawTextureWithTexCoords(toRect, texture, fromRect);\r\n\r\nThe texture in question comes from a 1024x1024 PNG saved from Photoshop. This PNG has the right colors in it when I open it, but not when `DrawTextureWithTexCoords` renders it to screen. I&#39;ve experimented with different Photoshop export settings and texture import settings, but to no avail. It would be nice if I missed something there, but I seem to have run out of knobs to twiddle.\r\n\r\nFor troubleshooting purposes, I dragged the texture into the scene, applying it as a material to a surface of a mesh. The texture displayed with correct, original colors on the mesh. (Note - this is not the thing I&#39;m trying to do. I need the texture to appear in GUI, not in-scene.)\r\n\r\nThere is no code that I know of that is processing the texture or doing something that would affect the rendering. I tried turning off my post-processing as a test, but it doesn&#39;t affect GUI.\r\n\r\nThis is running Unity 2019.1.13f1 on a 2015 IMac. I&#39;ve also included a shot of the Inspector on the texture import settings below. And the *almost* original texture PNG (watermark added).\r\n\r\nHow can I get the face art to render with the correct colors?\r\n\r\n[![Showing difference in colors][2]][2]\r\n[![Texture inspector][3]][3]\r\n[![Texture PNG][1]][1]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/e6Vfp.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkcWC.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/csvpz.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227204/gui-drawtexturewithtexcoords-draws-with-wrong-colors","title":"GUI.DrawTextureWithTexCoords() draws with wrong colors"},{"tags":["email","spreadsheet"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1344,"user_id":3689364,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1wGCo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EliteRaceElephant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689364/eliteraceelephant"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570141460,"post_id":58227198,"comment_id":102830087,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227198/spreadsheets-and-emails#comment102830087_58227198"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12161083,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-28TqhUw7sSI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdycX7nQ3W6_8FfDUKbEPx2ecKXMQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brett Goldblatt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12161083/brett-goldblatt"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570138569,"creation_date":1570138569,"question_id":58227198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227198","body_markdown":"I want to set up a spreadsheet that has two columns, a date and text.

have this piece of text:\r\n\r\n    text = &quot;What is your name?  Well,  uh it&#39;s John Smith.  Thanks for asking. Anyway, I&#39;d doing well.&quot;\r\n\r\nHow do I use regex to find every element of the list names in the text, and replace the block of text (say, of length 50) immediately after the element with &quot; [name] &quot;.  So my output would be:\r\n\r\n    text = &quot;What is your name [name] Anyway, I&#39;d doing well.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo far, I have this code below, but it only replaces the element with &quot; [name] &quot; not the actual text after the element.\r\n\r\n    def my_replace3(match):\r\n        match = match.group()\r\n        return &quot; [name] &quot;\r\n\r\n    def no_name(text):\r\n        names = [&#39;your name&#39;, &#39;the name&#39;, &#39;his name&#39;, &#39;her name&#39;, &#39;their name&#39;, &#39;employer name&#39;, &quot;employer&#39;s name&quot;, &quot;father&#39;s name&quot;,\r\n            &quot;mother&#39;s name&quot;, &quot;maiden name&quot;, &quot;son&#39;s name&quot;, &quot;daughter&#39;s name&quot;, &quot;brother&#39;s name&quot;, &quot;sister&#39;s name&quot;]\r\n        regex = re.compile(r&#39;\\b(&#39;

I also made the df into an array but I&#39;m also not sure if I&#39;m even supposed to do that, to begin with.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227183/how-could-calculate-the-time-between-dates-in-my-dataframe-to-an-outside-date","title":"How could calculate the time between dates in my dataframe to an outside date?"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2","ggraph"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16620,"user_id":8449629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OrvIq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Z.Lin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8449629/z-lin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570164207,"post_id":58227181,"comment_id":102834348,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227181/how-to-draw-an-arrowhead-in-the-middle-of-an-edge-in-ggraph#comment102834348_58227181"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9931263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac9545ec5923b7bac046d661d68c3498?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9931263/max"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":16620,"user_id":8449629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OrvIq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Z.Lin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8449629/z-lin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570183161,"post_id":58227181,"comment_id":102841482,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227181/how-to-draw-an-arrowhead-in-the-middle-of-an-edge-in-ggraph#comment102841482_58227181"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9931263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac9545ec5923b7bac046d661d68c3498?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9931263/max"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570205484,"post_id":58238221,"comment_id":102852252,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227181/how-to-draw-an-arrowhead-in-the-middle-of-an-edge-in-ggraph/58238221#comment102852252_58238221"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9931263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac9545ec5923b7bac046d661d68c3498?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9931263/max"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570215193,"post_id":58238221,"comment_id":102855888,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227181/how-to-draw-an-arrowhead-in-the-middle-of-an-edge-in-ggraph/58238221#comment102855888_58238221"},{"owner":{"reputation":16620,"user_id":8449629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OrvIq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Z.Lin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8449629/z-lin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9931263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac9545ec5923b7bac046d661d68c3498?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9931263/max"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570232312,"post_id":58238221,"comment_id":102860444,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227181/how-to-draw-an-arrowhead-in-the-middle-of-an-edge-in-ggraph/58238221#comment102860444_58238221"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9931263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac9545ec5923b7bac046d661d68c3498?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9931263/max"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570267039,"post_id":58238221,"comment_id":102865043,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227181/how-to-draw-an-arrowhead-in-the-middle-of-an-edge-in-ggraph/58238221#comment102865043_58238221"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16620,"user_id":8449629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OrvIq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Z.Lin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8449629/z-lin"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570198790,"creation_date":1570198790,"answer_id":58238221,"question_id":58227181,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58238221","body_markdown":"I haven&#39;t used the ggraph package myself, but based on my understanding of the underlying grobs, you can try the following:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**.

have the following webdriver function:\r\n\r\n    this.clickButton = async function () {\r\n      try {\r\n        var buttonElement = await

sometimes gives a `Stale Element exception`.\r\n\r\nI sometimes get that exception even if I change it to:\r\n\r\n    this.clickButton = async function () {\r\n      try {\r\n        await

Is it normal / expected that a `Stale Reference exception` can occur in this function, where I get the element reference, then use it on the very next line, or even the same line, doing nothing else with the page?  (I could understand getting an &#39;element not found&#39; exception, if no element of &#39;button-class&#39; existed, but it doesn&#39;t make sense to me that the element exists at the time which I&#39;m searching for it, but it&#39;s gone by the time the next line of code is reached.)\r\n\r\n 2. If the answer to question 1 is yes, then how is that possible?  The element found is immediately acted upon, as it is in this case?  As you can see, I am not reusing locators / elements; the function searches for the element each time it is called, and ends immediately after the click.\r\n\r\n 3. Is it relevant that clicking the button removes itself from the page?  That is, could I be getting this exception because the button is gone after the click?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227174/why-is-a-stale-element-exception-occurring-in-this-case","title":"Why is a Stale Element exception occurring in this case?"},{"tags":["google-apps-script","google-sheets"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":515,"user_id":11921132,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBliMYJ9ZMvXTe3DsCQ4oBBLs4FLdqJny2x9wro=k-s128","display_name":"OMila","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11921132/omila"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570444301,"post_id":58227171,"comment_id":102902775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227171/advise-on-the-best-way-to-match-data-on-2-sheets-and-input-to-another-sheet#comment102902775_58227171"},{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11762872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-inramRX7Qpw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re5Y5OZlqMPzhqJIEGW6_XOGnkVrg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alan Saydon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11762872/alan-saydon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":515,"user_id":11921132,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBliMYJ9ZMvXTe3DsCQ4oBBLs4FLdqJny2x9wro=k-s128","display_name":"OMila","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11921132/omila"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571283108,"post_id":58227171,"comment_id":103190896,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227171/advise-on-the-best-way-to-match-data-on-2-sheets-and-input-to-another-sheet#comment103190896_58227171"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11762872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-inramRX7Qpw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re5Y5OZlqMPzhqJIEGW6_XOGnkVrg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alan Saydon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11762872/alan-saydon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571650094,"creation_date":1570138412,"last_edit_date":1571650094,"question_id":58227171,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227171","body_markdown":"I need to write some code to compare dates from various sheets and if the data matches it will put into a self-made google sheet calendar.\r\n\r\nWhat I have done so far is created a google form that sends to a sheet, from that sheet I would like to check if certain values are approved and if they are put that data into a calendar that finds the dated and marks a box under the name and under that date with a certain letter.\r\n\r\nMy question is what type of code is best to use as the code below seems rather long for a simple task the sheet is for some employees to book leave and insert that data in a calendar created.\r\n\r\n    =IF(AND(Data!E3 = $A$7, Data!J3 = JQ$3, Data!Q3 = &quot;Approved&quot;,Data!I3 = &quot;Vacation&quot;), &quot;V&quot;,IF(AND(Data!E3 = $A$7, Data!J3 = JQ$3, Data!Q3 = &quot;Approved&quot;,Data!I3 = &quot;Unpaid&quot;),&quot;U&quot;,IF(AND(Data!E3 = $A$7, Data!J3 = JQ$3, Data!Q3 = &quot;Approved&quot;,Data!I3 = &quot;Half&quot;),&quot;H&quot;,IF(AND(Data!E3 = $A$7, Data!J3 = JQ$3, Data!Q3 = &quot;Approved&quot;,Data!I3 = &quot;TimeOFF&quot;),&quot;T&quot;))))\r\n\r\nThe code works but when I want it to compare the whole columns I am getting errors.

If the base class pointer cannot access these derived class member function, then what is so convenient about polymorphism?\r\n\r\nBelow is an example. &quot;shape&quot; is a base class. &quot;square&quot; and &quot;circle&quot; are two derived classes.\r\n\r\n    class shape {\r\n    public:\r\n        virtual void getArea()=0;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class square: public shape {\r\n    private:\r\n        int edge;\r\n    public:\r\n        square(){edge = 1;}\r\n        virtual void getArea(){  //polymorphism\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; edge*edge &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        void getNumberOfEdge(){  //a new member function\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;4\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class circle: public shape {\r\n    private:\r\n        int radius;\r\n    public:\r\n        circle(){radius = 1;}\r\n        virtual void getArea(){  //polymorphism\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; 3*radius*radius &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        void getCurvature(){     //a new member function\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; 1/radius &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    int main(){\r\n        shape* arr[2] = {\r\n            new square(),\r\n            new circle()\r\n        };\r\n        arr[0]-&gt;getArea();\r\n        arr[1]-&gt;getArea();\r\n        arr[0]-&gt;getNumberOfEdge();  //compiler error\r\n    }\r\n\r\ngetArea() is a good example of realizing polymorphism. However accessing derived class member function gives me compiler error, which I understand why perfectly. But from a designing point of view, we do not want to add a bunch of virtual functions to the base class just for the sake of each derived class, right?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227169/if-base-class-pointer-cannot-access-derived-class-member-function-then-what-is","title":"If base class pointer cannot access derived class member function, then what is so convenient about polymorphism?"},{"tags":["android","node.js","firebase","google-cloud-functions"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20487,"user_id":3371862,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DyCE6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Renaud Tarnec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3371862/renaud-tarnec"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20487,"user_id":3371862,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DyCE6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Renaud Tarnec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3371862/renaud-tarnec"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570170098,"last_edit_date":1570170098,"creation_date":1570142938,"answer_id":58227819,"question_id":58227166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227819","body_markdown":"The [`get()`][1] method is asynchronous and returns a Promise: you should &quot;treat&quot; the result within the `then()` method.

This can cause undefined behavior. Since the behavior is undefined, the presence or absence of the `registry` array may alter the behavior.\r\n\r\nYou should initialize `i` in each `for` loop like this:\r\n\r\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; numOfStds; i++){\r\n\r\nI will also echo the concerns raised in [David&#39;s answer][1]. If you call a function that returns a status, you should always check the status to make sure it is what you expect. It is always better to handle errors as soon as they occur. Your code as written assumes no errors in the input, which is not valid in the general case. This is not a theoretical problem. Practical applications always have the possibility of encountering invalid or malformed input.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227559/315052","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227159/segmentation-fault-error-due-to-the-addition-of-one-small-2d-array/58227389#58227389","title":"Segmentation Fault error due to the addition of one small 2d array"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":49708,"user_id":3422102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tg0Gt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David C.

The `scanf (&quot;%d/n&quot;, ...)` format string is just wrong unless the user is actually entering a `&quot;/n&quot;` after each input and second, your loop variable is uninitialized in each `for` loop.\r\n\r\nBut even more troubling is you fail to ***validate*** the return of `scanf` on each call, so a single mistyped character can cause your integer conversion to fail silently and you proceed forward as if nothing is wrong. For example, if reaching for the `3` your user accidentally hits `&#39;e&#39;`, then a *matching-failure* occurs, character extraction from `stdin` stops at that point, and if you are looping collecting integer input, you have just spun off into an infinite loop.\r\n\r\n**Always Validate Every Input**\r\n\r\nIt takes nothing more than simple validation to save yourself from yourself. To validate you input you can do:\r\n\r\n        printf(&quot;How many students would you like to register: &quot;);\r\n        if (scanf (&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;numOfStds) != 1) {\r\n            fputs (&quot;error: invalid integer input - numOfStds.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n and for another example:\r\n\r\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; numOfStds; i++){\r\n            printf (&quot;Please enter student %d&#39;s number: &quot;, i+1);\r\n            if (scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;stdNum) != 1) {\r\n                fputs (&quot;error: invalid integer input - stdNum.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n                return 1;\r\n            }\r\n            students[i] = stdNum;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nPutting it together in a full example, and then outputting the collected values you can do:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main (void) {\r\n    \r\n        int numOfStds;\r\n        int numOfCrs;\r\n        int stdNum;\r\n    \r\n        printf(&quot;How many students would you like to register: &quot;);\r\n        if (scanf (&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;numOfStds) != 1) {\r\n            fputs (&quot;error: invalid integer input - numOfStds.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        printf(&quot;How many courses are in the program?: &quot;);\r\n        if (scanf (&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;numOfCrs) != 1) {\r\n            fputs (&quot;error: invalid integer input - numOfCrs.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        int students[numOfStds];\r\n        char courses[numOfCrs][8];\r\n        \r\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; numOfStds; i++){\r\n            printf (&quot;Please enter student %d&#39;s number: &quot;, i+1);\r\n            if (scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;stdNum) != 1) {\r\n                fputs (&quot;error: invalid integer input - stdNum.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n                return 1;\r\n            }\r\n            students[i] = stdNum;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; numOfCrs; i++){\r\n            printf(&quot;Please enter course %d&#39;s code (must be 7 characters long): &quot;,\r\n                    i+1);\r\n            if (scanf (&quot;%7s&quot;, courses[i]) != 1) {\r\n                fputs (&quot;error: invalid integer input - numOfCrs.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n                return 1;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        /* example output */\r\n        // int registry[numOfStds][numOfCrs];\r\n        puts (&quot;\\nStudents:&quot;);\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numOfStds; i++)\r\n            printf (&quot;student: %d\\n&quot;, students[i]);\r\n        puts (&quot;\\nCourses:&quot;);\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numOfCrs; i++)\r\n            printf (&quot;course: %s\\n&quot;, courses[i]);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(**note:** above the *protection of your array bounds* with `if (scanf (&quot;%7s&quot;, courses[i]) != 1)`, if you fail to include the `7` as a *field-width modifier*, your user can enter as many characters as they wish resulting in Undefined Behavior)\r\n\r\n**Example Use/Output**\r\n\r\n    $ ./bin/numofstds\r\n    How many students would you like to register: 3\r\n    How many courses are in the program?: 2\r\n    Please enter student 1&#39;s number: 301\r\n    Please enter student 2&#39;s number: 302\r\n    Please enter student 3&#39;s number: 303\r\n    Please enter course 1&#39;s code (must be 7 characters long): abcdefg\r\n    Please enter course 2&#39;s code (must be 7 characters long): bcdefgh\r\n    \r\n    Students:\r\n    student: 301\r\n    student: 302\r\n    student: 303\r\n    \r\n    Courses:\r\n    course: abcdefg\r\n    course: bcdefgh\r\n\r\nLook things over and let me know if you have further questions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227159/segmentation-fault-error-due-to-the-addition-of-one-small-2d-array/58227559#58227559","title":"Segmentation Fault error due to the addition of one small 2d array"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10977028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/193147c6ce9f1fba73cde056d2ed16c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MCkea444","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10977028/mckea444"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10977028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/193147c6ce9f1fba73cde056d2ed16c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MCkea444","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10977028/mckea444"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58227389,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570161079,"creation_date":1570138343,"last_edit_date":1570139430,"question_id":58227159,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227159","body_markdown":"I created a small test program because the same issue was happening in my larger program.

We may speculate that gdb displayed the “1” in byte 10 in octal instead of as a literal “1” because it is preceded or surrounded by non-printable characters or because it is after the null character that ends the normal string.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227157/why-does-snprintf-copy-different-values-eventhough-same-variables-are-copied-to/58227301#58227301","title":"why does snprintf copy different values eventhough same variables are copied to string array each time"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":64909,"user_id":168986,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqorX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clifford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/168986/clifford"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570139522,"creation_date":1570139522,"answer_id":58227363,"question_id":58227157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227363","body_markdown":"The character &#39;1&#39; and the octal value &#39;\\61&#39; are _presentations_ of the _same_ value.\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n\r\n    Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:11                                                           \r\n    11         return 0;                                                                         \r\n    (gdb) p string                                                                               \r\n    $1 = &quot;1\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\061\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000&quot;             \r\n    (gdb) p string[0]                                                                            \r\n    $2 = 49 &#39;1&#39;                                                                                  \r\n    (gdb) p string[10]                                                                           \r\n    $3 = 49 &#39;1&#39;                                                                                  \r\n    (gdb)    ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227157/why-does-snprintf-copy-different-values-eventhough-same-variables-are-copied-to/58227363#58227363","title":"why does snprintf copy different values eventhough same variables are copied to string array each time"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":3314183,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZiViC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DeepuChandran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3314183/deepuchandran"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7,"user_id":3314183,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZiViC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DeepuChandran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3314183/deepuchandran"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58227301,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570139522,"creation_date":1570138339,"last_edit_date":1570138673,"question_id":58227157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227157","body_markdown":"My problem is summarized in the below simple code.

This is not entirely your fault though; the futures documentation and API design aren&#39;t very clear about this. In its `0.2` incarnation, there will be a [task context](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/futures-rfcs/blob/master/task-context.md) explicitly threaded through various API calls. For example, [`Stream::poll`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.29/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html#tymethod.poll) in `0.1.x` is defined as:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn poll(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;, Self::Error&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `0.2.x`, it is [`Stream::poll_next`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.2.1/futures/trait.Stream.html#tymethod.poll_next):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn poll_next(\r\n    &amp;mut self, \r\n    cx: &amp;mut Context\r\n) -&gt; Result&lt;Async&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt;, Self::Error&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you won&#39;t be able to make the same mistake of polling outside of a task.\r\n\r\nUntil then this works with `0.1.x` futures crate:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse futures::sync::mpsc::{UnboundedReceiver, UnboundedSender};\r\nuse std::thread::{self, JoinHandle};\r\n\r\nfn launch_sender_thread(tx: UnboundedSender&lt;()&gt;) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;()&gt; {\r\n    thread::Builder::new()\r\n        .name(&quot;sender thread&quot;.to_string())\r\n        .spawn(move || loop {\r\n            let _ = tx.unbounded_send(());\r\n        })\r\n        .unwrap()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn launch_receiver_thread(rx: UnboundedReceiver&lt;()&gt;) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;()&gt; {\r\n    thread::Builder::new()\r\n        .name(&quot;receiver thread&quot;.to_string())\r\n        .spawn(move || {\r\n            let mut task = futures::executor::spawn(rx);\r\n            match task.wait_stream() {\r\n                Some(Ok(_)) =&gt; println!(&quot;thread2: received data&quot;),\r\n                Some(Err(e)) =&gt; println!(&quot;poll err {:?}&quot;, e),\r\n                None =&gt; (),\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        .unwrap()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let (sender, receiver) = futures::sync::mpsc::unbounded::&lt;()&gt;();\r\n    let recv = launch_receiver_thread(receiver);\r\n    let send = launch_sender_thread(sender);\r\n\r\n    println!(&quot;Press Ctrl-C to abort&quot;);\r\n    recv.join().unwrap();\r\n    send.join().unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNotice, you can drive `tx` with task as well. It is just simpler to call `unbounded_send` here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227120/no-task-is-currently-running/58231176#58231176","title":"no Task is currently running"}],"owner":{"reputation":2005,"user_id":922445,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bdf208b59a41f6d8fb4bbb26afd0e411?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nulik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/922445/nulik"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58231176,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570175853,"creation_date":1570138103,"question_id":58227120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227120","body_markdown":"I am getting an error: `no Task is currently running` when I attempt to use `UnboundedSender` and `UnboundedReceiver` without using `tokio::run()`.\r\n\r\nThis is the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPress Ctrl-C to abort\r\nthread &#39;receiver thread&#39;

your code, I think the problem you have is with scanf and buffer overflow. You tell scanf to read a string and store it at an address of a single char. Thus, where there are two characters or more, scanf will attempt to write into the address spaces of other variables. When reading with %s, scanf will also append a \\0 to the end of the string. Your char usrGame is not an array. Thus, anything else that more than a single &quot;y&quot; will go onto other address spaces. Hence, memory corruption. \r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, you only have to choose a method that reads a single first character from input then disregard the rest of the input, or read a single character then flush the input stream.\r\n\r\nYou can just try to change scanf to this and it will work:\r\n\r\n    scanf(&quot;%c%*c&quot;,&amp;usrGame);\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227113/int-variable-will-not-increment-past-1-or-will-reset-to-0/58242152#58242152","title":"int variable++ will not increment past 1 or will reset to 0"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12161528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b21ee2bced5b5a6e097adc3f9e68a288?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"natasha.oz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12161528/natasha-oz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":106,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570234280,"creation_date":1570138055,"last_edit_date":1570161417,"question_id":58227113,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227113","body_markdown":"I had to isolate part of my program for a program that plays a game and keeps track of your losses and wins for the duration of your game.\r\nHowever, my losses variable only increments to at most 1, but if my wins variable increments then it resets the losses back to 0.\r\nAlso once I exit the while loop it resets losses to 0 again.

of all, I really recommend you using Operator abbreviations so your code is easier to read, for example: \r\n\r\n`dinheiro = dinheiro - 0.5;`\r\n\r\ncan be abbreviated to:\r\n\r\n `dinheiro -= 0.5; `\r\n\r\nAs for your problem, as @Worthless said on comment, you should never use floating point data type for currency operations, since in between test and calculations, a lot of precision is lost and also, you cannot make enough if&#39;s for every decimal that a double can handle, you should really check out on BigInteger or BigDecimal classes, which you can read about [here][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n

basically, I am learning in college to code in Java, I&#39;ve had my first lessons, and now I was challenged to make a &quot;coin sorter&quot; program with if&#39;s and whiles.\r\nThe objective of the program is giving it an amount of money in Euros and it is supposed to return it organized in the most efficient way, prioritizing higher value bills.\r\nMy program is written with some variables in Portuguese so I&#39;ll explain:\r\n(double dinheiro;) is the variable where I store the amount of money.\r\nand then the coins go from left to right in the int list of the code, starting at the

I will rely on a [previous answer][2] where I defined the formula of some filter functions.\r\n\r\nWe have `f(x) = p*(x - 255/2) + 255/2` for `contrast(p)` and `f(x) = x*p` for `brightness(p)`\r\n\r\nTo obtain `contrast(p1) brightness(p2)` we mix both functions\r\n\r\n    f(x) = p2*(p1*(x - 255/2) + 255/2)\r\n\r\nWe simplify to\r\n\r\n    f(x) = p1*p2(*x - 127.5) + p2*127.5\r\n\r\nNow for `opacity(p)` we have &lt;sup&gt;[ref][3]&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n    f(x) =  x*p + C*(1 - p)\r\n\r\nWhere `C` is the background color of the image and in your case you considered white so we can replace it by `255` to get\r\n\r\n    f(x) =  x*p + 255*(1 - p) = p*(x - 255) + 255\r\n\r\nNow we simply want both function (the opacity one and the contrast-brightness one) to be the same thus we can write\r\n\r\n    p1*p2*(x - 127.5) + p2*127.5 = p*(x - 255) + 255\r\n\r\nFor `p=0.5`, `p1=1/3`, `p2=1.5=3/2` we will have\r\n\r\n    1/2*(x - 127.5) + 3/2*127.5 = 1/2*(x - 255) + 255\r\n    1/2*x - 127.5/2 + 3/2*127.5 = 1/2*x + 127.5\r\n    ...\r\n    0 = 0\r\n\r\nThis explain the relation between the values you are using. You can also find any other combination of values you want. \r\n\r\nFor a generic case we can consider:\r\n\r\n    p1*p2*(x - 127.5) + p2*127.5 = p*(x - 255) + 255\r\n    x*(p1*p2 - p) + p2*127.5*(1 - p1) + p*255 - 255 = 0\r\n\r\nWe should have `(p1*p2 - p) = 0` and `p2*127.5*(1 - p1) + p*255 - 255 = 0` so we get\r\n  \r\n    p1*p2 = p\r\n    p2*(1 - p1) = (1 - p)*2\r\n\r\nand finally\r\n \r\n    p2 = 2 - p\r\n    p1 = p/(2 - p)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we consider an opacity of `0.25` we will have:\r\n\r\n    p2 = 1.75\r\n    p1 = 1/7\r\n \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    img:first-of-type {\r\n      filter: opacity(var(--o,1));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    img:last-of-type {\r\n      filter: contrast(calc(var(--o,1)/(2 - var(--o,1)))) brightness(calc(2 - var(--o,1)));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div style=&quot;--o:0.75&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div style=&quot;--o:0.5&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div style=&quot;--o:0.25&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img  height=&quot;126&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/SMPTE_Color_Bars.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227073/8620333\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48798480/8620333\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50574620/8620333","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227072/how-do-you-simulate-the-opacity-effect-on-an-element-without-making-it-transpare/58227643#58227643","title":"How do you simulate the opacity effect on an element without making it transparent?"}],"owner":{"reputation":401,"user_id":1940121,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zpCHH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codebreaker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1940121/codebreaker"},"last_editor":{"reputation":107371,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58227643,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570145549,"creation_date":1570137828,"last_edit_date":1570138193,"question_id":58227072,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227072","body_markdown":"I want a div to have the &quot;grayed out&quot; look that you get with `filter:opacity(0.5)` on a white background, but I don&#39;t want to actually make it see-through.
