This code already existed in one application and I was simply copying it to another as we are trying to consolidate two applications into one. I have found that the code is now sending JSON messages that have the first letter capitalized for the `JSONArray` and `JSONObject` field names.  \r\n\r\nI was using JMS template with a message converter that takes in an object mapper to convert from a POJO to a JSON.  The only real difference in my new code is that I am using a newer version of spring boot. I know this would update all of the jackson dependencies so maybe that is why this change has occurred. I ended up trying to set the naming strategy on my object mapper but this doesn&#39;t seem to work. I originally did it in my bean definition but in order to see if it was actually working I tried it before I did a `convertAndSend`, and it did not work.

Can I make a map that works the same way as the dictionary does in Python?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274095/can-i-make-a-mutable-collection-of-functions-in-kotlin-without-them-running","title":"Can I make a mutable collection of functions in Kotlin without them running?"},{"tags":["r","tibble"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":76019,"user_id":903061,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jMWGQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gregor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/903061/gregor"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570468195,"post_id":58274113,"comment_id":102915028,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274093/how-to-mutate-values-of-a-tibble-in-long-format/58274113#comment102915028_58274113"},{"owner":{"reputation":464,"user_id":3225661,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d13f403cc78e1c491eda9b2416bf460?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sbac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3225661/sbac"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570469455,"post_id":58274113,"comment_id":102915507,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274093/how-to-mutate-values-of-a-tibble-in-long-format/58274113#comment102915507_58274113"},{"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":464,"user_id":3225661,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d13f403cc78e1c491eda9b2416bf460?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sbac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3225661/sbac"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570469552,"post_id":58274113,"comment_id":102915541,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274093/how-to-mutate-values-of-a-tibble-in-long-format/58274113#comment102915541_58274113"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570469561,"last_edit_date":1570469561,"creation_date":1570467792,"answer_id":58274113,"question_id":58274093,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58274113","body_markdown":"Instead of doing the `left_join`, can create the columns with `mutate`  and avoid the `summarise` step\r\n\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n    df2 %&gt;% \r\n        group_by(ind) %&gt;%\r\n        mutate(mn = min(value), mx = max(value)) %&gt;%\r\n        ungroup %&gt;%\r\n        mutate(value2 = (value - mn)/(mx-mn))\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Here, we assumed the OP wanted the columns &#39;mx&#39;, &#39;mn&#39; in the final output.

The focus has always been on maximum execution speed, and this means creating some quite complex data structures, e.g. the decision tables to support template rule matching. There&#39;s also a fair bit of data retained solely in order to provide good run-time diagnostics.\r\n\r\nAt some time in the past we did make efforts to ensure that the actual stylesheet tree could be garbage collected once compiled, but I&#39;ve been aware that there are now references into the tree that prevent this happening. I&#39;m not sure how significant a factor this is.\r\n\r\nIf you were running Saxon-EE then you could experiment with exporting and re-importing the compiled stylesheet. This would force out the links to data structures used only transiently during compilation, which might save some memory.\r\n\r\nAlso, Saxon-EE does JIT compilation of template rules, so if there are many template rules that are never invoked because you only use a small part of a large XML vocabulary, then this would give a memory saving.\r\n\r\nIf your 45 stylesheets have overlapping content, then moving these shared components into separately compiled XSLT 3.0 packages would be useful.\r\n\r\nCheck that you don&#39;t import the same stylesheet module at multiple precedence levels. I&#39;ve seen that lead to gross inefficiencies in the past.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I&#39;ve logged an issue at https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/4335 as a reminder to look at this next time we get a chance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274059/jvm-heap-holding-memory-intensive-transformed-objects-after-doing-xslt-transform/58277419#58277419","title":"JVM heap holding memory intensive transformed objects after doing xslt transformation using Saxon 9.6 HE libraries"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QWlnzR66N-8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reIYsN2wjTFMUn-oR1yJ-_IS_7KYg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177700/bala"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QWlnzR66N-8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reIYsN2wjTFMUn-oR1yJ-_IS_7KYg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177700/bala"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570542006,"creation_date":1570467542,"last_edit_date":1570469170,"question_id":58274059,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58274059","body_markdown":"**Issue summary :** \r\nWhile adding values to hashmap after transforming xslt into templates using saxon 9.6 HE library , the Heap allocation is growing upto 330MB which is almost 70% of the heap(Xmx512 and Xms32).

Write your own doclet.  API documentation (the HTML pages that describe Java classes) is generated from Javadoc comments by the [standard doclet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/standard-doclet.html).  That doclet is open-source code.  You could copy that doclet, change it slightly, and then run your modified version to create API documentation.\r\n\r\n2. Define an annotation `@NotDocumented` that will appear in HTML documentation.  Write the annotation on the &quot;secret&quot; fields/methods of your class.  Create HTML API documentation normally.  Postprocess the HTML API documentation using a text processing tool like perl, awk, or sed to strip all references to `@NotDocumented` members.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274031/can-a-specific-property-field-be-restricted-from-javadocs-generation/58294282#58294282","title":"Can a specific property / field be restricted from JavaDocs generation?"}],"owner":{"reputation":818,"user_id":4093727,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/22327337db44ed28343012df0055f574?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4093727/michael-m"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570569829,"creation_date":1570467432,"question_id":58274031,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58274031","body_markdown":"I have a few Java classes containing one or more properties that I would like to exclude from the JavaDocs when they are generated.  I am using the &#39;maven-javadoc-plugin&#39; and cannot find any documentation indicating that this is possible.\r\n\r\nIs there a tag that can be applied in the POM, nor an annotation that can be placed on the actual property in the Java class, so that specific properties can be excluded?\r\n\r\nI know that exclusions can be done at the **package** level using the `&lt;excludePackageNames /&gt;` tag in the POM.  In addition, it appears that **specific classes** can be also restricted from the JavaDocs by using the `&lt;sourceFileExcludes /&gt;` tag, so long as a `&lt;sourcepath /&gt;` is also defined.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, I am using RAML 1.0 to generate API documentation for this project, so does anyone know whether there is a RAML-specific exclusion that can be applied to prevent the documentation from being included?  Of course, the JavaDocs are generated separately from the RAML docs, so restricting individual class properties / fields on the RAML side (if possible) will still need a JavaDocs exclusion so that the Maven JavaDocs plugin also ignores them.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!  Though I am expecting that the answer will be a negatory.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274031/can-a-specific-property-field-be-restricted-from-javadocs-generation","title":"Can a specific property / field be restricted from JavaDocs generation?"},{"tags":["jquery","html","loops","variables","dom"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3713,"user_id":3281014,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SIpXo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nawed Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3281014/nawed-khan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570468231,"post_id":58274030,"comment_id":102915046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274030/jquery-loop-dumps-all-content-into-first-div-with-a-class-of-course#comment102915046_58274030"},{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570468357,"post_id":58274030,"comment_id":102915097,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274030/jquery-loop-dumps-all-content-into-first-div-with-a-class-of-course#comment102915097_58274030"},{"owner":{"reputation":6089,"user_id":3824283,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l7OG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EternalHour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824283/eternalhour"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570469630,"post_id":58274030,"comment_id":102915571,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274030/jquery-loop-dumps-all-content-into-first-div-with-a-class-of-course#comment102915571_58274030"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6921223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de34a5d1c1826f1ec4f4b768ebb45625?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stolercloud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6921223/stolercloud"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570470417,"post_id":58274030,"comment_id":102915850,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274030/jquery-loop-dumps-all-content-into-first-div-with-a-class-of-course#comment102915850_58274030"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6921223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de34a5d1c1826f1ec4f4b768ebb45625?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stolercloud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6921223/stolercloud"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570470610,"post_id":58274030,"comment_id":102915927,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274030/jquery-loop-dumps-all-content-into-first-div-with-a-class-of-course#comment102915927_58274030"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6921223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de34a5d1c1826f1ec4f4b768ebb45625?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stolercloud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6921223/stolercloud"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570468187,"creation_date":1570467429,"last_edit_date":1570468187,"question_id":58274030,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58274030","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing a loop with jquery where it:\r\n\r\nFinds a Div with a class of &quot;course&quot;\r\nit wraps this div within two other divs &quot;tabs&quot; and &quot;tap&quot;\r\nThen it adds two other HTML Tags: &lt;input type= &#39;checkbox&#39; id=&#39;&quot; + accordionID + &quot;-chck1&#39;&gt;\r\nand &lt;label class=&#39;tab-label&#39; for=&#39;&quot; +  accordionID + &quot;-chck1&#39;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;\r\n\r\nEvery time it cycles through- it takes the first anchor link text- places it into a variable called &quot;accordionID&quot; and sets the ID of the input box as well as the &quot;for&quot; referenced in label. \r\n\r\nHowever when I run the code- it prints out all the content into the first div with a class of &quot;course&quot; instead of going into the div with a class of &quot;course&quot; once, doing all the loop instructions then moving on to the next div with a class of &quot;course&quot;.

am having a problem in displaying more than 50 items in matlab legend. I already saw some answers on the other websites stating that i need to make another axes in the plot, copy the previous data, and then hide the new axes, but i couldn&#39;t do that with my data. I went along the steps they provided, i did make a new axis, but it only shows 1 additional variable from the 16 that is left, and i am stuck on it.\r\nI attached a link to my data under &quot;test_bend.m&quot;. In total i have 66 angles to be shown. Any help out there ?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pdcrujfatyirqzv/test.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\nThank

best way to do this is have some logic in your routing functions of your Api\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nReceive an API request\r\nCheck if [&#39;X-MOCK-HEADER&#39;] exists\r\nIf it does then route to the mock version of the endpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo your mock for create user would always return 201 OK - your mock endpoint would do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst routes = {\r\n   CREATE_USER_OK:() =&gt; { return {....} } // make sure these return proper http responses\r\n   CREATE_USER_BAD_REQUEST: () { return {...} }\r\n}\r\n\r\n return routes[HEADER_VALUE]()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason being you&#39;re testing the route not the database class in this instance, so you just want to return static data, if you wanna test something else then just change the X-MOCK-HEADER value to whatever you want and add the mock route to return the right http response/code - I&#39;d need to know what the API code looked like to help you on the backend implementation.\r\n\r\nIf possible stay away from messing with staging databases for testing because down the road you will suffer a LOT of pain as it gradually gets filled with garbage.\r\n\r\nAlso if you&#39;re working with a front end app you can quickly prototype with static data - this is especially useful if you&#39;ve got a front end team waiting for an API endpoint to say create a login screen.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58274004/reset-a-database-before-each-test/58274175#58274175","title":"reset a database before each

But that was exactly what I needed to get this done.\r\n\r\nThe plugin is not Vue or Vue-CLI specific but it works if you do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Add a `vue.config.js` file in the root of the app.\r\n\r\n2) The linked plugin above is actually an extension of another package. You need both.\r\n\r\n    npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin \r\n    npm install --save-dev html-webpack-inline-source-plugin \r\n\r\n3)\r\n\r\n\r\n    // vue.config.js\r\n    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(&#39;html-webpack-plugin&#39;)\r\n    const HtmlWebpackInlineSourcePlugin = require(&#39;html-webpack-inline-source-plugin&#39;);\r\n    module.exports = {\r\n        css: {\r\n            extract: false,\r\n        },\r\n        configureWebpack: {\r\n          optimization: {\r\n            splitChunks: false // makes there only be 1 js file - leftover from earlier attempts but doesn&#39;t hurt\r\n          },\r\n          plugins: [\r\n            new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\r\n              filename: &#39;output.html&#39;, // the output file name that will be created\r\n              template: &#39;src/output-template.html&#39;, // this is important - a template file to use for insertion\r\n              inlineSource: &#39;.(js|css)$&#39; // embed all javascript and css inline\r\n            }),\r\n            new HtmlWebpackInlineSourcePlugin()\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n4) Add a template.

You can design a workflow in AWS step that integrates with API Gateway, Lambda and SNS to send email and text notifications as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a REST API via API gateway that will invoke a Lambda function passing in for example, the destination address (email, phone #) of the SNS notification, when it should be sent, notification method (e.g. email, text, etc.).\r\n 2. The Lambda function on invocation will invoke the Step function passing in the data (Lambda is needed because API Gateway currently can&#39;t invoke Step functions directly).\r\n 3. The Step function is basically a workflow, you can define states for waiting (like waiting for the specified time to send the notification e.g. 30 seconds), and states for invoking other Lambda functions that can use SNS to send out an email and/or text notifications.\r\n\r\nA [rudimentary example][1] is provided by AWS w/ their Task Timer example.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/task-timer-sample.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273980/best-way-to-schedule-one-time-events-in-serverless-environments/58274188#58274188","title":"Best way to schedule one-time events in serverless environments"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3199,"user_id":11372593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FQBr5NRaPHA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABb0/XuGqOq18jyg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"guillaume blaquiere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11372593/guillaume-blaquiere"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570475703,"creation_date":1570475703,"answer_id":58275813,"question_id":58273980,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58275813","body_markdown":"Things are coming on GCP for doing this, but not very soon.

Does anyone know if this is bug or am I doing something wrong? \r\n\r\nHelp is appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273970/saving-data-in-conversation-exits","title":"Saving data in conversation exits"},{"tags":["c#","unity3d","hololens","mrtk"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":12111126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eb06e94646007a7ef75fd44fe680d65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yoon Park","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12111126/yoon-park"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570467259,"creation_date":1570467259,"answer_id":58273975,"question_id":58273969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58273975","body_markdown":"I found that the code for Gaze would be:\r\n\r\n            if (CoreServices.InputSystem.GazeProvider.GazeTarget != null)\r\n            {\r\n                return CoreServices.InputSystem.GazeProvider.HitPosition;\r\n            }\r\nhttps://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/Input/Gaze.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273969/upgrading-htk-gazemanager-to-mrtk-v2-pointer-handray/58273975#58273975","title":"Upgrading HTK GazeManager to MRTK v2 Pointer (HandRay...)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":12111126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eb06e94646007a7ef75fd44fe680d65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yoon Park","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12111126/yoon-park"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570467447,"creation_date":1570467447,"answer_id":58274034,"question_id":58273969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58274034","body_markdown":"// The object the right-hand ray hit (from MRTK v2.1.0 release)\r\nGetPointer&lt;ShellHandRayPointer&gt;(Handedness.Right)?.Result.Details?.Object","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273969/upgrading-htk-gazemanager-to-mrtk-v2-pointer-handray/58274034#58274034","title":"Upgrading HTK GazeManager to MRTK v2 Pointer (HandRay...)"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":12111126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eb06e94646007a7ef75fd44fe680d65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yoon Park","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12111126/yoon-park"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570467447,"creation_date":1570467228,"question_id":58273969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273969","body_markdown":"What would be the equivalent code if I want to get hand ray&#39;s hit object &amp; position? \r\nI am looking at this page but it shows event-driven result only.\r\nhttps://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/Input/Pointers.html#pointer-result\r\n\r\n\r\n        private static Vector3 GetGazePlacementPosition(Vector3 headPosition, Vector3 gazeDirection, float defaultGazeDistance)\r\n        {\r\n            if (GazeManager.Instance.HitObject != null)\r\n            {\r\n                return GazeManager.Instance.HitPosition;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return headPosition + gazeDirection * defaultGazeDistance;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:1990199d4e304812baefc5b243eaa852@thread.skype/1570237762952?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&amp;amp;groupId=fcd54363-a331-4ab6-8b7c-5687877d77f8&amp;amp;parentMessageId=1570237762952&amp;amp;teamName=Mixed Reality Toolkit INTERNAL&amp;amp;channelName=Help!&amp;amp;createdTime=1570237762952&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273969/upgrading-htk-gazemanager-to-mrtk-v2-pointer-handray","title":"Upgrading HTK GazeManager to MRTK v2 Pointer (HandRay...)"},{"tags":["r","plot"],"owner":{"reputation":606,"user_id":3199320,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0bb4acf2cc5eea34f4a33dad926adc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"adkane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3199320/adkane"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570467204,"creation_date":1570467204,"question_id":58273966,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273966","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using qmplot to make maps but it won&#39;t print the axis labels.

[**SKFieldNode**][1], It allows you to actually apply physics effects to nodes. And if you want real tree branches that can move based on the physics, you should combine **SKFieldNode** with [**SKPhysicsJoint**][2]. When you combine those two you can actually create indepedent Branch Nodes to receive some kind of force to simulate a wind effect. To understand what you can do with SKPhysicsJoint, check out this [**guide**][3]. This solution can get really complex and hard to achieve with superficial understanding of SpriteKit Engine, but you can create an amazing effect using it. Personally, I would not recommend if you have deadlines to attend, physics always get buggy if you lose your grasp on what you are doing, you may invest a lot of time trying to achieve this using physics.\r\n 2. Create different animation of your tree responding to wind movement and control which animation frame you should use at that specif case. I Would highly recommend this one, because you will have control over what is going on with you tree and people that play games don&#39;t pay that much attention to what is going on with background, altho is a good thing to think about it from the game experience.\r\n 3. Create your tree textures and change the **[anchor point][4]** to be at the place you want the effect to be more effective and responsive. The farthest the coordinate in the node is from the anchor points coordinate, less effect from your [**SKAction**][5] it will get. \r\n\r\nSorry for my English, is not my native language. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skfieldnode\r\n  [2]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skphysicsjoint\r\n  [3]: https://www.raywenderlich.com/735-how-to-make-a-game-like-cut-the-rope-using-spritekit-and-swift\r\n  [4]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skspritenode/1519877-anchorpoint\r\n  [5]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skaction","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273965/animating-wind-in-spritekit/58278455#58278455","title":"Animating wind in Spritekit?"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":1544149,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f3262cb62b187bcd56277ef726c927d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"elektricni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1544149/elektricni"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58278455,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570492193,"creation_date":1570467204,"question_id":58273965,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273965","body_markdown":"Is there a way to animate wind for certain game objects?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, branches of trees should gently move, like there&#39;s a breeze in game.

followed the steps in this [youtube tutorial][1] and made a Cordova app with plugins that wraps an Angular app.\r\nThe main point in the video is to take the files from your Angular dist folder (see [rootfolder]/ClientApp/dist) and move them into your Cordova www folder. Also, when I did it I had to modify Angular dist index.html a little bit to make it work (i.e. changing type=&quot;module&quot; to type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;). Also needed to add a script to index.html\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;cordova.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n[UPDATE]\r\n\r\nI realize now that I didn&#39;t actually use cordova plugins in my angular code, although it seems there is a way to do that (judging by a quick google search). All I did was add the cordova diagnostic plugin to the Cordova wrapper and then added a javscript file which I called permissions.js to my angular src/assets folder. Then in my index.html (in CordovaRoot/www) I ran the script with the code below.\r\n\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;assets/permissions.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nAlso, there seems to be a bug with using the angular router when it&#39;s wrapped by a Cordova app. But there is an easy albeit hacky fix in [this blog][2].\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiIGcmHtDDE&amp;list=LLpv78mT2s6hT7TPl-aE4VCw&amp;index=13&amp;t=0s\r\n  [2]: https://weblogs.thinktecture.com/thomas/2017/02/cordova-vs-zonejs-or-why-is-angulars-document-event-listener-not-in-a-zone.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273959/create-a-mobile-app-in-angular-and-run-it-on-android-device-with-cordova-and-use/58279655#58279655","title":"Create a mobile app in angular and run it on android device with cordova and use cordova plugins"}],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":8590587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa9a69d070fad16324798ae65abdc5ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Iva Pesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8590587/iva-pesa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":94,"user_id":11218701,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84e3f8dd7779845dca98f110d785da6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Philip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11218701/philip"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570757991,"creation_date":1570467176,"last_edit_date":1570616605,"question_id":58273959,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273959","body_markdown":"I want to create a hybrid app with angular and cordova so I followed this tutorial https://medium.com/@neridonk/create-a-mobile-app-in-angular-and-run-it-on-your-android-phone-with-cordova-5fe8a8adb598 and created a basic app. When I run \r\n\r\n           npm run start\r\nthe app runs on my android device but I can only see the output of cordova&#39;s project, not the angular output.

whilst using Scala, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to handle a `java.util.Map` with provided Encoders, I probably would have had to write one myself and I figured it was too much work.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can see two ways to do this without converting to `java.util.Map` and using `scala.collection.immutable.Map`.\r\n\r\nYou could convert into a `Dataset[Obj]` and flatMap.\r\n\r\n    case class

v))}).toList))\r\n    output.show(false)\r\n\r\nOr you can use a UDF\r\n\r\n    val mapToList: Map[String, String] =&gt; List[Map[String, String]] = {\r\n      x =&gt; x.flatMap({case (k, v) =&gt;

The code should identify the open reply email, edit the subject line and body of the email and send the email.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is that I get as far as identifying the running instance of Outlook and assigning it to an object using one of the Marshal methods`outApp = Marshal.GetActiveObject(&quot;Outlook.Application&quot;) as Application`, but then I cannot cast it to a MailItem type in order to manipulate its elements e.g. the subject line, body, etc...something like `MailItem mailItem = (MailItem)outApp.CreateItem((OlItemType.olMailItem));` throws an invalid cast exception at runtime.  \r\n \r\nApologies if I am wrong, but could not find a single example close to this exact sequence of events, one of the closer ones is this post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30579056/c-sharp-outlook-open-existing-instance-and-reply-to-email\r\nbut then it goes a whole different way.

Any help is appreciated, thank you.  \r\n\r\n**EDIT 08102019:**  \r\nThe code is used from an RPA platform, so there is no risk of it being picked up as malware. The &quot;user&quot; is just a virtual user on an account with purpose-made permissions and a controlled environment...sorry, nothing dark here :-). Anyway, here is the code I am using at the moment which creates a new instance and saves it to drafts in Outlook.

The result is that you most likely read more bytes than you indented to and now the rest of your reads are not in the correct place.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can fix this by doing away with `fprintf` and `fscanf` by writing the entire `name` field with `fwrite`:\r\n\r\n    fwrite(maze.name,sizeof(maze.name), 1, file);\r\n\r\nAnd reading it with `fread`:\r\n\r\n    fread(maze.name,sizeof(maze.name), 1, file);\r\n\r\nYou also have a problem here:\r\n\r\n    fwrite(&amp;maze.map[x], sizeof(Cell), maze.height, file);\r\n\r\nAnd here:\r\n\r\n    fread(&amp;maze.map[x], sizeof(Cell), maze.height, file);\r\n\r\n`&amp;maze.map[x]` is not the address of the memory you allocated but the address of the *pointer it points to*.  So rather than reading/writing the memory set aside for each row of cells you&#39;re reading/writing the memory used for the row of pointers for each cell.  You end up reading/writing past the end of allocated memory when you do this.\r\n\r\nGet rid of the address-of operator here to pass in the pointer to the actual memory you&#39;re reading/writing:\r\n\r\n    fwrite(maze.map[x], sizeof(Cell), maze.height, file);\r\n    ...\r\n    fread(maze.map[x], sizeof(Cell), maze.height, file);\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273944/fwrite-fread-a-dynamically-declared-struct/58275519#58275519","title":"Fwrite/Fread a dynamically declared struct **"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":11202542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AtQcFVwN8fs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/oosaWmmBIwE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Xilamax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11202542/xilamax"},"last_editor":{"reputation":28,"user_id":11202542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AtQcFVwN8fs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/oosaWmmBIwE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Xilamax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11202542/xilamax"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58275519,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570475927,"creation_date":1570467122,"last_edit_date":1570474729,"question_id":58273944,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273944","body_markdown":"I would like to `fwrite()` then `fread()` the following `struct **` whose memory has been allocated dynamically.\r\nThis struct is declared as following :\r\n\r\n    typedef struct {\r\n       int num;\r\n       char type;\r\n       Entity entity;\r\n    }Cell;\r\n\r\nI declare a map of cell as following :\r\n\r\n    typedef struct {\r\n      char name[MAX_STRING];\r\n      int width;\r\n      int height;\r\n      Cell** map;\r\n    }Maze;\r\n\r\nI allocate the map&#39;s memory as following :\r\n\r\n    maze.map = (Cell **)malloc( width*sizeof( Cell* ));\r\n\r\n    for (int  x = 0; x &lt; width; x++ )\r\n    {\r\n        maze.map[x] = (Cell *)malloc(sizeof( Cell )*height);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe thing is is i can&#39;t `fwrite()`/`fread()` my struct like this because once I would like to `fread()` the `struct`, I would not be able to allocate the proper memory space.\r\nSo i decided to write the height and width first then allocate the memory then read the map.\r\nBut I can&#39;t find how to write or read my map properly.\r\nI tried :\r\n\r\n    for (int x = 0; x &lt; maze.width; ++x) {\r\n        for (int y = 0; y &lt; maze.height; ++y) {\r\n            fwrite(&amp;maze.map[x][y], sizeof(Cell), 1, file);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nBut it doesn&#39;t work, otherwise i don&#39;t know how should I write/read my map.\r\n\r\nEverything i tried doesn&#39;t give me back the map i wrote or it just crash saying me : Process finished with exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005)\r\n\r\nHere are the two writing and readin fuction :\r\n\r\n    void SaveMaze(Maze maze){\r\n       FILE *file;\r\n       char file_name[MAX_STRING];\r\n\r\n       strcpy(file_name, maze.name);\r\n       strcat(file_name,&quot;.save&quot;);\r\n\r\n       file = fopen(file_name, &quot;w&quot;);\r\n\r\n       if(file == NULL)\r\n       {\r\n           perror(&quot;Error Fopen : &quot;);\r\n           return ;\r\n       }\r\n       fwrite(maze.name,sizeof(maze.name), 1, file);\r\n       fwrite(&amp;maze.height,sizeof(maze.height), 1, file);\r\n       fwrite(&amp;maze.width,sizeof(maze.width), 1, file);\r\n\r\n       for (int x = 0; x &lt; maze.width; ++x) {\r\n           fwrite(&amp;maze.map[x], sizeof(Cell), maze.height, file);\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       // Close the file\r\n       fclose(file);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    Maze LoadMaze(char * name){\r\n       FILE *file;\r\n       Maze maze;\r\n       char file_name[MAX_STRING];\r\n\r\n       strcpy(file_name, name);\r\n       strcat(file_name,&quot;.save&quot;);\r\n\r\n       file = fopen(file_name, &quot;r&quot;);\r\n\r\n       if(file == NULL) {\r\n           perror(&quot;Error Fopen : &quot;);\r\n           return maze;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       fread(maze.name,sizeof(maze.name), 1, file);\r\n       fread(&amp;maze.height,sizeof(maze.height), 1, file);\r\n       fread(&amp;maze.width,sizeof(maze.width), 1, file);\r\n\r\n       maze.map = (Cell **)malloc( maze.width*sizeof( Cell* ));\r\n\r\n       for (int  x = 0; x &lt; maze.width; x++ )\r\n       {\r\n          maze.map[x] = (Cell *)malloc(sizeof( Cell )*maze.height);\r\n       }\r\n       for (int x = 0; x &lt; maze.width; ++x) {\r\n           fread(&amp;maze.map[x], sizeof(Cell), maze.height, file);\r\n       }\r\n       printf(&quot;%c&quot;,maze.map[0][0].num);\r\n\r\n       fclose (file);\r\n       return maze;\r\n    }\r\n    int main() {\r\n       int choice;\r\n       int width,height;\r\n       char name[MAX_STRING],file_name[MAX_STRING];\r\n       Maze maze;\r\n\r\n       do{\r\n           printf(&quot;1.

They seem to fall into two different categories, and one seems better than the other for helping the reader recognise what solution to use for a particular problem:\r\n\r\n 1. &quot;what needs to be done in this problem&quot; : i.e. a chapter on sorting, a chapter on searching, trees, heaps\r\n For example, *&quot;Algorithms&quot; by Robert Sedgewick, &quot;Intro to Algorithms&quot; by Thomas Cormen.*\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n 2.  &quot;how to design an algorithm to approach this problem&quot; : i.e. divide-and-conquer, branch-and-bound, greedy approach. For example, *&quot;Foundations of Algorithms&quot; by Richard E. Neapolitan* and to a certain extent *&quot;Algorithms Illuminated&quot; by Tim Roughgarden*\r\n\r\nIn the first way, algorithms are taught as isolated methods to be applied to some random data set (&quot;here we show you how to sort it, here we show you how to search for it&quot;) and it tends to leave me confused on which solution to choose.\r\n\r\nBut in the second way algorithms are presented by how they are designed (not by what they do). For example, mergesort and binary search can be presented together as &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; algorithms, in the same chapter. Algorithms for finding minimum-spanning-trees can be associated with scheduling algorithms, in that they are both greedy approaches. For me, this type of book (the second type) is the most useful, and helps me to retain the information longer term.\r\n\r\nAnother good book that you might find helpful is *&quot;The Algorithm Design Manual&quot; by Steven Skiena*. It&#39;s a hybrid of the two approaches, but contains a lot of real world anecdotes and &quot;war stories&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273906/how-do-you-approach-solving-data-structures-and-algorithms-problems/58285832#58285832","title":"How do you approach solving data structures and algorithms problems?"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":3879037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca81b16e2121ef12ec012b0fae34fd6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KevinC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3879037/kevinc"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":89,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58273985,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570539624,"creation_date":1570466940,"question_id":58273906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273906","body_markdown":"I have been having trouble finding the best solutions to data structures and algorithms questions issued by interviewers.

I think this issue is the line right after you set res_Hough to 0 (i.e. res_Hough=MIJ.getResultsTable();).

Perhaps add a print statement after the while loop and see if it prints the same values for the duration of the for loop.\r\n\r\nI suppose the next thing to do is for me to actually try to offer a solution regardless of the above.

(given that fields might be missing in database because production uses different db than development).\r\n\r\nIs there a nice way to validate whether or not object returned from database contains all fields which are `truthy`, of the current model present in my code? \r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273903/mongoose-typegoose-validating-database-result-using-model","title":"Mongoose / typegoose validating database result using model"},{"tags":["c#","linq","cross-join"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":567738,"user_id":88656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fbdff3ffb6f111d172759b4f05bea0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eric Lippert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/88656/eric-lippert"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570479309,"post_id":58273898,"comment_id":102919582,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273898/linq-cross-join-list-of-lists-cartesian-product-for-unknown-number-of-lists#comment102919582_58273898"},{"owner":{"reputation":1285,"user_id":1647464,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yo6Fl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"komsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1647464/komsky"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":567738,"user_id":88656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fbdff3ffb6f111d172759b4f05bea0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eric Lippert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/88656/eric-lippert"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570707040,"post_id":58273898,"comment_id":103002529,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273898/linq-cross-join-list-of-lists-cartesian-product-for-unknown-number-of-lists#comment103002529_58273898"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1285,"user_id":1647464,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yo6Fl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"komsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1647464/komsky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570469032,"post_id":58274306,"comment_id":102915349,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273898/linq-cross-join-list-of-lists-cartesian-product-for-unknown-number-of-lists/58274306#comment102915349_58274306"},{"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1285,"user_id":1647464,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yo6Fl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"komsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1647464/komsky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570474123,"post_id":58274306,"comment_id":102917454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273898/linq-cross-join-list-of-lists-cartesian-product-for-unknown-number-of-lists/58274306#comment102917454_58274306"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570474104,"last_edit_date":1570474104,"creation_date":1570468669,"answer_id":58274306,"question_id":58273898,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58274306","body_markdown":"Try following :\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n    using System.Linq;\r\n    using System.Text;\r\n\r\n    namespace ConsoleApplication135\r\n    {\r\n        class Program\r\n        {\r\n            static ItemMenu menu = null;\r\n            static List&lt;List&lt;ModifierOption&gt;&gt;

It’s called [recursion][1]. When not implemented properly, it can introduce some overhead, but sometimes it can be a very elegant solution.\r\n\r\nThat having been said, you might not want to do it like you have here. What if it guessed the same number three times before it got one that wasn’t equal to `lastRoundNumber`? You’d see four `print` statements for one new value. Do you really want that behavior? If you were going to implement `getRandomNumber` as a recursive function, at the very least I’d suggest inserting a `return` statement after it calls itself recursively, so that you don’t get `print` statements for the iterations where it ended up with the same value as `lastRoundNumber`.\r\n\r\nThat having been said, we often only reach for recursion (and the overhead that entails) when that implementation is appreciably more elegant or intuitive than the non-recursive rendition. But in this case, the non-recursive rendition is probably just as clear, and as such, we’d likely favor it over the recursive version. It might look like:\r\n\r\n    func getRandomNumber() {\r\n        guard allPlayers.count &gt; 1 else { return }\r\n\r\n        var randomNumber: Int\r\n\r\n        repeat {\r\n            randomNumber = .random(in: 0..&lt;allPlayers.count)\r\n        } while randomNumber == lastRoundNumber\r\n\r\n        print(randomNumber)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote, I’m checking that you have more than one player to avoid the possibility of infinite loop.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nBut let&#39;s say there were 100 players. And let’s say you called this 100 times. Is it OK if it returned player 1, then player 2, then player 1 again, then player 2 again, repeating again and again, never returning any players 3 through 100. This is unlikely, but it’s possible. Is that OK?\r\n\r\nOften we want to return all players, but in a random order. In that case, you’d “shuffle” the list, e.g.\r\n\r\n    let players = (0..&lt;allPlayers.count).shuffled()\r\n\r\nThat will ensure that you have an array of integer values, shuffled into random order, but never repeating any given number. That provides randomness while also ensuring that each value is returned only once.\r\n\r\nIt just depends upon your desired behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273875/bad-practice-for-a-method-to-call-itself/58274127#58274127","title":"Bad practice for a method to call itself?"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":12169361,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f068054b2d76b5c1de6ccb19f18a9cd6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PrezyProgramming","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12169361/prezyprogramming"},"last_editor":{"reputation":48961,"user_id":106435,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11155673de94185c4ea775c87d2c8aeb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"vikingosegundo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/106435/vikingosegundo"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":91,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58274127,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570533411,"creation_date":1570466789,"last_edit_date":1570533411,"question_id":58273875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273875","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve a question about good or bad practice.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created a function which will generate a random number.

will begin using MongoDB in a project and made the following observation:\r\nA ‘Date’, e.g.: ISODate(&quot;2000-07-24T00:00:00.000Z&quot;) is stored in as **UTC 0** (or **Zulu**).\r\n\r\nLet’s assume that an end user submits a plain date, such as “**2000-07-24**” and his or her **local timezone is -5**.\r\n\r\nBecause of the ‘**Z**’ character in the time (indicates **UTC 0**), storing the following would be incorrect because the user’s 5 hour difference:\r\n\r\nISODate(&quot;**2000-07-24T00:00:00.000Z**&quot;)\r\n\r\nI am assuming that it would be more proper to consider the end user’s local time zone into account and store the date as follows:\r\n\r\nISODate(“**2000-07-23T19:00:00.000Z**”)\r\n\r\nBy doing this, I can see that any queries would need a timezone adjustment for

important thing to remember is that in Ruby a trailing `!` or `?` are allowed on method names and become *part of the method name*, not a modifier added on. `x` and `x!` and `x?` are three completely different methods.\r\n\r\nIn Ruby the convention is to add `!` to methods that make *in-place modifications*, that is they modify the object in fundamental ways. An example of this is `String#gsub` which returns a copy, and `String#gsub!` which modifies the string in-place.\r\n\r\nIn Rails this has been ported over to mean that as well as situations where the method *will raise an exception on failure* instead of returning `nil`. This is best illustrated here:\r\n\r\n    Record.find_by(id: 10) # =&gt; Can return nil if not found\r\n    Record.find_by!(id: 10) # =&gt; Can raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound\r\n\r\nNote that this is not always the case, as methods like `find` will raise exceptions even without the `!`. It&#39;s purely an informational component built into the method name and does not guarantee that it will or won&#39;t raise exceptions.\r\n\r\n*Update*:\r\n\r\nThe reason for using exceptions is to make flow-control easier. If you&#39;re constantly testing for `nil`, you end up with highly paranoid code that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    def update\r\n      if (user.save)\r\n        if (purchase.save)\r\n          if (email.sent?)\r\n            redirect_to(success_path)\r\n          else\r\n            render(template: &#39;invalid_email&#39;)\r\n          end\r\n        else\r\n          render(template: &#39;edit&#39;)\r\n        end\r\n      else\r\n        render(template: &#39;edit&#39;)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nIn other words, you always need to be looking over your shoulder to be sure nothing bad is happening. With exceptions it looks like this:\r\n\r\n    def update\r\n      user.save!\r\n      purchase.save!\r\n      email.send!\r\n\r\n      redirect_to(success_path)\r\n\r\n    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound\r\n      render(template: &#39;edit&#39;)\r\n    rescue SomeMailer::EmailNotSent\r\n      render(template: &#39;invalid_email&#39;)\r\n    end\r\n\r\nWhere you can see the flow is a lot easier to understand. It describes &quot;exceptional situations&quot; as being less likely to occur so they don&#39;t clutter up the main code.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273846/what-is-the-use-of-in-rails/58273964#58273964","title":"What is the use of ! in rails"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12149159,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a57d61d40ac83af4d8840ea56ccc4bfb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"eric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12149159/eric"},"last_editor":{"reputation":365865,"user_id":479863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ArUCE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mu is too short","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/479863/mu-is-too-short"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58273964,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570472517,"creation_date":1570466685,"last_edit_date":1570467172,"question_id":58273846,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273846","body_markdown":"What is the use of `!` in rails?\r\n\r\nEspecially in this line: From HArtl tutorial\r\n\r\n    users = User.order(:created_at).take(6)\r\n    50.times do \r\n    \tcontent = Faker::Lorem.sentence(5)\r\n    \tuser.each { |user| user.microposts.create!( content: content )}\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBasically this is creating tweets/microposts for 6 users.\r\n\r\nI am really wondering why need to use `!`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273846/what-is-the-use-of-in-rails","title":"What is the use of ! in rails"},{"tags":["android","aidl"],"owner":{"reputation":911,"user_id":1101963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84c24dec7be50840b7aeaac32358e189?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Yuriy Kulikov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1101963/yuriy-kulikov"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570466680,"creation_date":1570466680,"question_id":58273845,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58273845","body_markdown":"I have an exported service which exposes an AIDL Interface to other processes. **The AIDL Interface uses callbacks**. There could be 0 to n clients which bind the service simultaneously. Client will often unbind the service.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    interface ImageProviderAidl {\r\n      void fetchImageSubscribe(in String clientId, in String uri, int requestId, BitmapCallback callback);\r\n      void fetchImageDispose(int requestId);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    interface BitmapCallback {\r\n        void onNext(in Bitmap bitmap);\r\n        void onComplete();\r\n        void onError(String message);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, service onBind will be only called once, after the first client binds the service. onUnbind will one be called if no clients bind the service anymore.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that **callbacks which are provided by a client which is not binding the service anymore are still referenced by the service**. How can I detect and remove such callbacks? Do these callbacks prevent garbage collection on the client side?\r\n\r\nSo far I came up only with a dedicated &quot;clearCallbacks(clientId: String)&quot; method in the service which will be called before clients unbind the service. This will require clients to behave and call the method in time. Another drawback is that it not deterministic in case if client applications are destroyed without giving them the chance to call the method if the system is low on memory. I will get a RemoteException upon attempting to call the &quot;dead&quot; callback, but until then it will remain and it will use resources. Another idea is to use some kind of a checkHeartbeat() method, but this will only make detection faster.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273845/how-to-detect-bind-and-unbinds-of-an-android-service","title":"How to detect bind and unbinds of an Android Service?"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":174348,"user_id":616443,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/907798bf02efdaf6f9d07d3c0552868f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"j08691","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/616443/j08691"},"edited":false,"score":6,"creation_date":1570466776,"post_id":58273840,"comment_id":102914428,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273840/why-is-my-for-loop-stuck-on-the-second-option#comment102914428_58273840"},{"owner":{"reputation":3821,"user_id":1159056,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df2e8f63d4017908895b90d5d5052ed6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"silentw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159056/silentw"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570466829,"post_id":58273840,"comment_id":102914452,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273840/why-is-my-for-loop-stuck-on-the-second-option#comment102914452_58273840"},{"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3821,"user_id":1159056,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df2e8f63d4017908895b90d5d5052ed6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"silentw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159056/silentw"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570467003,"post_id":58273840,"comment_id":102914535,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273840/why-is-my-for-loop-stuck-on-the-second-option#comment102914535_58273840"},{"owner":{"reputation":24471,"user_id":9819146,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ioXmnWNrB_w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/Q47JYDWDFyo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Maheer Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9819146/maheer-ali"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570467483,"post_id":58273840,"comment_id":102914755,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273840/why-is-my-for-loop-stuck-on-the-second-option#comment102914755_58273840"},{"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24471,"user_id":9819146,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ioXmnWNrB_w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/Q47JYDWDFyo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Maheer Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9819146/maheer-ali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570467574,"post_id":58273840,"comment_id":102914798,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273840/why-is-my-for-loop-stuck-on-the-second-option#comment102914798_58273840"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":8405484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Fsr-utjgKgI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/kdifh_7Arew/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"vinay yadav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8405484/vinay-yadav"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570466868,"post_id":58273860,"comment_id":102914469,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58273840/why-is-my-for-loop-stuck-on-the-second-option/58273860#comment102914469_58273860"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2337,"user_id":1946016,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0c5d167d76c943145ee2d9af55a1b99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"karthikdivi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946016/karthikdivi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":533,"user_id":3711792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2bbd20713e1429cb31d30f6ee04fe5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kreld","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3711792/kreld"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570466869,"last_edit_date":1570466869,"creation_date":1570466740,"answer_id":58273860,"question_id":58273840,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58273860","body_markdown":"You need to change `if (i = 0)` to `if (i == 0)`.
