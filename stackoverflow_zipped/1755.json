You can then write Python bindings for that C code if you want to use Python for the non-critical parts of your application (as is the case with, for example, NumPy).\r\n\r\nInstead of focusing on making individual expressions or functions in your code run as fast as possible, focus on algorithms you use and the the overall structure of your code (and on making it readable, but you are already aware of that). Then, when your application starts running slowly, you can profile it to figure out what parts take the most time, and improve only those parts.\r\n\r\nThe changes will be easier to make to well-structured, readable code and optimizing the actual bottlenecks will generally give a much better speedup-to-time-coding ratio than most micro-optimizations. The time spent wondering which of two expressions runs faster is time you could have spent getting other things done.\r\n\r\nAs an exception, I&#39;d say learning _why_ one option is faster than the other is sometimes worth the time, because then you can incorporate that more general knowledge into your future programming, letting you make quicker calls without worrying about the details.\r\n\r\nBut enough about why we shouldn&#39;t waste time worrying about speed, let&#39;s talk about speed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTaking a look at [the source of the `random` module](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/e09359112e250268eca209355abeb17abf822486/Lib/random.py) (for CPython 3.7.4), this line from the end of the opening comment provides a short answer:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n```\r\n* The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,\r\n  and is, therefore, threadsafe.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first statement is the ones that matters the most to us. `random` is a python binding for a C function, so the complexity of its operation runs at the blinding speed of machine code rather than the relatively slow speed of Python.\r\n\r\n`randint`, on the other hand, _is_ implemented in Python, and suffers a significant speed penalty for it. `randint` calls `randrange`, which ensures that the range&#39;s bounds (and step size) are integers, that the range isn&#39;t empty, and that the step size isn&#39;t zero, before calling `getrandbits`, which is implemented in C.\r\n\r\nThis alone produces the majority of `randint`&#39;s slowness. However, there is one more variable in play.\r\n\r\nGoing a little deeper, into the internal function `_randbelow`, it turns out that the algorithm for getting a random number between 0 and `n` is very straightforward: it gets the number of bits in `n`, then generates that many bits at random repeatedly until the resulting number is no greater than `n`.\r\n\r\nOn average (across all possible values of `n`), this has little effect, but comparing the extremes, it is noticeable.\r\n\r\nI wrote [a function](https://gist.github.com/jirassimok/47bfc1a1821212487e81447dee9b9ee3) that tests the impact of that loop. Here are the results:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbits   2 ** (n - 1)   (2 ** n) - 1   ratio\r\n  64   1.358526759    1.084741422    1.2523968675\r\n 128   1.43073282     1.02119227     1.4010415688\r\n 256   1.600253063    1.271662798    1.2583941793\r\n 512   1.845024581    1.363168823    1.3534820852\r\n1024   2.371779281    1.620392686    1.4637064839\r\n2048   2.98949864     2.01788896     1.48149809\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first column is the number of bits, the second and third are the average time (in microseconds) to find a random integer with that many bits, in microseconds, over 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 runs. The last column is the ratio of the second and third columns.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll notice that average runtimes for the largest number with a given bit length are larger than for the smallest number with that bit length. This is because of that loop:\r\n\r\nWhen looking for a _n_-bit number less than the largest _n_-bit number, a second attempt is needed only if that largest number is generated, which is unlikely except for very small _n_. But to find a number smaller than the smallest (2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a single 1-bit followed by _n_&amp;minus;1 0-bits), half of the attempts fail.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAddendum: I removed the tests for bit lengths from 1 to 32 because, upon inspection of the C source for `getrandbits`, I discovered that it uses a separate, faster, function for those numbers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124646/why-in-python-is-random-randint-so-much-slower-than-random-random/58126026#58126026","title":"Why (in Python) is random.randint so much slower than random.random?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11609834,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d173bbe8db2ccb421516f69b5dcf3a20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"philosofool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11609834/philosofool"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570846356,"creation_date":1569531246,"question_id":58124646,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124646","body_markdown":"I got curious about the relative speeds of some random integer generating code. I wrote the following to check it out: \r\n```\r\nfrom random import random\r\nfrom random import choice\r\nfrom random import randint\r\nfrom math import floor\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    times = 1000000\r\n    \r\n    startTime = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(times):\r\n        randint(0,9)\r\n    print(time.time()-startTime)\r\n    \r\n    startTime = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(times):\r\n        choice([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])\r\n    print(time.time()-startTime)\r\n    \r\n    startTime = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(times):\r\n        floor(10*random())##generates random integers in the same range as randint(0,9)\r\n    print(time.time()-startTime)\r\n\r\nmain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results of one trial of this code were\r\n&gt;0.9340872764587402\r\n\r\n&gt;0.6552846431732178\r\n\r\n&gt;0.23188304901123047\r\n\r\nEven after executing multiplication and math.floor, the final way of generating integers was by far fastest. Messing with the size of the range from which numbers were generated didn&#39;t change anything.\r\n\r\nSo, why is random way faster than randint? and is there any reason why (besides ease of use, readability, and not inviting mistakes) that one would prefer randint to random (e.g., randint produces more random pseudo-random integers)? If `floor(x*random())` feels not readable enough but you want faster code, should you go for a specialized routine?\r\n```\r\ndef myrandint(low,high):   ###still about 1.6 longer than the above, but almost 2.5 times faster than random.randint\r\n    return floor((high-low+1)*random())+low  ##returns a random integer between low and high, inclusive. Results may not be what you expect if int(low) != low, etc. But the numpty who writes &#39;randint(1.9,3.2)&#39; gets what they deserve.\r\n  ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124646/why-in-python-is-random-randint-so-much-slower-than-random-random","title":"Why (in Python) is random.randint so much slower than random.random?"},{"tags":["javascript","survey"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5759,"user_id":933198,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25a22103fd3210fdfa142843c7777ff1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lee Taylor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/933198/lee-taylor"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1569531580,"post_id":58124644,"comment_id":102637812,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124644/js-survey-logic#comment102637812_58124644"},{"owner":{"reputation":5869,"user_id":2359687,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b567febb6032c881398226a28bedc09c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"devlin carnate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2359687/devlin-carnate"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569531855,"post_id":58124644,"comment_id":102637891,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124644/js-survey-logic#comment102637891_58124644"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11018727,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bWMvzkgsCoo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQOGmqOTxY0Teyw-9gg8uhAXcX4Rvw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Giovanni Flowers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11018727/giovanni-flowers"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11018727,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bWMvzkgsCoo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQOGmqOTxY0Teyw-9gg8uhAXcX4Rvw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Giovanni Flowers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11018727/giovanni-flowers"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570041923,"creation_date":1569531244,"last_edit_date":1570041923,"question_id":58124644,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124644","body_markdown":"So the first bit of code I posted didn&#39;t grant me the help that I was looking for from this &quot;community&quot;.

I&#39;ve included code below (a simple macOS command line tool) to illustrate the problem.\r\n\r\nI am using Xcode 10.3, on macOS 10.14.6. It also happens on iOS 12.4.1.\r\n\r\nTo see the problem, run the code below. Place a breakpoint on the `return` statement in the `weirdStuff(withURL:)` function, and on the 2nd-to-last line. Run the app, and when the code breaks on the `return` line, hover the pointer over the 4 `let`s in the function to examine their values. Here&#39;s what&#39;s weird:\r\n\r\n1. `badURL` will not show any value at all! And the &quot;Variables View&quot; pane of the debug console will show that the value has not been defined.\r\n2. `copyOfBadURL` will contain the correct value from `badURL` even though apparently `badURL` doesn&#39;t exist!\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that `URL(fileURLWithPath:)` is failing (eg, `badURL`) when the `fileURLWithPath:` parameter value is a variable, but succeeds (`goodURL`) when the parameter value is a constant string. That can&#39;t be right!\r\n\r\nNext, continue running the app so that you get the to other breakpoint. If you hover the pointer over `url2` you&#39;ll see that the correct value was returned via `return badURL`. You can also see that `badURLNowGood` has a value as expected, even though this is essentially the same call that failed when called within my testing function.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s going on here? I&#39;ve never seen a variable never even be defined (after execution) before (ie, `badURL`).\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Foundation\r\n\r\nfunc weirdStuff(withURL urlParam: URL) -&gt; URL {\r\n\t\r\n\tlet pathFromParam = urlParam.path\r\n\tlet badURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: pathFromParam)\r\n\tlet goodURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: &quot;/Dir1/file.txt&quot;)\r\n\tlet copyOfBadURL = badURL\r\n\t\r\n\tprint(&quot;func: badURL = \\(badURL)&quot;)\t\t// is valid here but not if you hover above\r\n\tprint(&quot;func: copyOfBadURL = \\(copyOfBadURL)&quot;)\r\n\tprint(&quot;func: goodURL = \\(goodURL)&quot;)\r\n\t\r\n\treturn badURL\t// Breakpoint on this line; hover over 4 values above\r\n\t\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Call function with URL weirdness\r\nlet url1 = URL(fileURLWithPath: &quot;/Dir1/file.txt&quot;, isDirectory: true)\r\nlet url2 = weirdStuff(withURL: url1)\r\nprint(&quot;main: weirdStuff(withURL:) result = \\(url2)&quot;)\r\n\r\n// Now do similar calls outside of the function\r\nlet pathFromURL1 = url1.path\r\nvar badURLNowGood = URL(fileURLWithPath: pathFromURL1)\r\nlet goodURLUsingString = URL(fileURLWithPath: &quot;/Dir1/file.txt&quot;)\r\nprint(&quot;main: badURLNowGood = \\(badURLNowGood)&quot;)\t\t// Breakpoint here\r\nprint(&quot;main: goodURLUsingString = \\(goodURLUsingString)&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124632/swift-urlfileurlwithpath-returns-no-value-at-all-not-even-nil","title":"Swift: URL(fileURLWithPath:) returns no value at all, not even nil"},{"tags":["ms-word","office-js","office-addins"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4738,"user_id":6190031,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDpYH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rick Kirkham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6190031/rick-kirkham"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569536695,"post_id":58124631,"comment_id":102639200,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124631/auto-open-does-not-open-for-read-permissions-unless-you-select-live-view-in-bro#comment102639200_58124631"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12127347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC7f6cBcWf4-0Ygmx6Lk40itJzNlK1nKZMo-9my=k-s128","display_name":"Michael Panciroli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127347/michael-panciroli"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4738,"user_id":6190031,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDpYH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rick Kirkham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6190031/rick-kirkham"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569600414,"post_id":58124631,"comment_id":102662570,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124631/auto-open-does-not-open-for-read-permissions-unless-you-select-live-view-in-bro#comment102662570_58124631"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12127347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC7f6cBcWf4-0Ygmx6Lk40itJzNlK1nKZMo-9my=k-s128","display_name":"Michael Panciroli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127347/michael-panciroli"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569531159,"creation_date":1569531159,"question_id":58124631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124631","body_markdown":"The add-in automatically opens a task pane on Word Online from a SharePoint document library for owners but when you try and open with a site member with read-only access it will not show unless you click the &quot;Live View in Browser&quot; from the open document drop down.

It&#39;d also help if you can run this in a python IDE so we could pull stuff up on a console.\r\n\r\nIf that is inconvenient, I could build the SDK/sample and run through the thing myself, but I haven&#39;t opened up Visual Studio on my VM in ages and will probably need to go through some licensing fandango. (I mostly use the IOTHub Device &amp; Service SDKs, the newer versions of which don&#39;t need to be built, or the REST api for areas where the SDKs break.) It&#39;ll be a little bit before I have some spare time for that.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-create-simulated-device-x509-python#create-a-self-signed-x509-device-certificate-and-individual-enrollment-entry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124618/where-is-x509-certificate-used-by-iot-device-in-auto-provision-a-simulated-devi/58140459#58140459","title":"Where is X509 certificate used by iot-device in &quot;auto-provision a simulated device(python)&quot; Quick-start Guide?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10301475,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Pelse44b2MY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADv0/DJVcKb6g49Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sreeju Sreedhar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10301475/sreeju-sreedhar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569615445,"creation_date":1569531129,"question_id":58124618,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124618","body_markdown":"The question is with reference to &quot;&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-create-simulated-device-x509-python&quot;\r\n        \r\nThe section &#39;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-create-simulated-device-x509-python#simulate-the-device&#39; talks about modifying certain parameters.

I swear!). Well you could, *in theory*, but then there&#39;s no telling how many characters (and how much time and disk space!) you&#39;re going to need to add in order to get *the* hash collision that yields exactly the same hash as the original file.\r\n\r\nWhat you&#39;re asking is basically defeating the entire purpose of a [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum).\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t think that ATARI computer used SHA-1 hashing (160 bits), let alone the SHA-256 or SHA-512 (or 128-bit MD5), or any other algorithm in common use today.\r\n\r\nYou could implement some of the lower-bitness [checksum algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions), but the smaller the hash, the higher the risk of a hash collision - and the easier it is to get a hash that collides with your checksum value, the more meaningless the checksum is.\r\n\r\n*By definition*, a hashing function isn&#39;t reversible, and a salted, cryptographic hash will not even produce the same ouptut given two *identical* inputs.

First of all I know that it is a frontend framework and it is assumed that all security should be left in charge of the backend, but I am looking for options before immersing myself to do something in the backend, since at the moment I only know something of frontend. Is it possible to send access credentials to an API from Angular securely without anyone being able to intercept them? I am trying to connect to an API of a CRM Software and in the first instance I could not because they blocked my request through CORS, I contacted them and they told me that the requests should be made from my backend and above all they say it is for security, so this is my big question, I was looking for and did not find something that allows me to send secure credentials in an angular way and for that reason I turn to this medium to confirm.

They only exist for this particular time the component rendered. So on the first render, `console.log(&quot;filtered arr length&quot;, filteredArr.length);` is referring to the array that exists on that first render. `filteredArr` will never be assigned a new array (it can&#39;t, it&#39;s a const), and unless you mutate the array (which you shouldn&#39;t), the length of that array will always be 0.\r\n\r\nWhen you call setFilteredArr, this instructs react to rerender the component. React might do the rendering synchronously, or it might wait to try to batch up changes. When that 2nd render happens, you make a call to useState and get back the new value. This is assigned to a local variable named filteredArr, but this is a completely different variable than the one we had on the first render. The console.log statement in that first render, will have no way to access the variable in the second render. But the second render has access to it, so any logging you do the second time will show the second array.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124595/when-exactly-do-react-hook-states-get-set/58124732#58124732","title":"When exactly do React Hook states get set?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":121,"user_id":7437512,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2a18f93f63804e8b1e1204515c10745?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"EstebanA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7437512/estebana"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569535566,"creation_date":1569535566,"answer_id":58125330,"question_id":58124595,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58125330","body_markdown":"setState or &#39;setFilteredLength&#39; is an async operation.

order to have some not cleared area also after the &quot;clear range&quot;,\r\nI extended your DataFrame by one row, so it contains:\r\n\r\n               Day     IR  Shift\r\n    0  May/30/2019

 May/24/2019   5.1%     2%\r\n    7  May/23/2019   5.0%      -\r\n\r\nAnd now how to solve the issue:\r\n\r\nFirst define a function detecting start and end of the &quot;clear range&quot;,\r\nbased on 2 auxiliary columns, which will be created soon:\r\n\r\n    def detect(row):\r\n        if row.Shft1 &lt; -50:\r\n            detect.retVal = True\r\n        elif row.Shft2 &gt; 50:\r\n            detect.retVal = False\r\n        return detect.retVal\r\n\r\nThen compute these 2 auxiliary columns:\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;Shft1&#39;] = df.Shift.apply(lambda x: 0.0 if x == &#39;-&#39; else float(x.rstrip(&#39;%&#39;)))\r\n    df[&#39;Shft2&#39;] = df.Shft1.shift(fill_value=0)\r\n\r\nThe actual computation involves the following code:\r\n\r\n    detect.retVal=False\r\n    df.IR.mask(df.apply(detect, axis=1), np.nan, inplace=True)\r\n\r\nReading of the above code start from `df.apply(detect, axis=1)`.\r\nThis instruction computes the mask, indicating rows where `IR` value\r\nshould be cleared (replaced with *NaN*).\r\n\r\nThen move on to `mask` function itself.

rows (*grp*) it takes a column of particular name (*col*),\r\nsets the name as *date* from the first row (the grouping key) and\r\nreturns it.\r\n\r\nAs the initial step, group *df* by *country* and *state*:\r\n\r\n    gr = df.set_index([&#39;country&#39;, &#39;state&#39;]).groupby(&#39;date&#39;)\r\n\r\nThen compute 2 DataFrames, as the result of reformatting (applying\r\nthe above function to each group, for both columns of interest:\r\n\r\n    df1 = gr.apply(reformat, col=&#39;population&#39;)\r\n    df2 = gr.apply(reformat, col=&#39;num_cars&#39;)\r\n\r\nAnd having two partial results, merge them on indices:\r\n\r\n    pd.merge(df1, df2, left_index=True, right_index=True,\r\n        suffixes=(&#39;_pop&#39;, &#39;_cars&#39;))\r\n\r\nThe result is:\r\n\r\n    country Xxx_pop         Yyy_pop         Xxx_cars         Yyy_cars        \r\n    state       Aaa Bbb Ccc     Ggg Hhh Jjj      Aaa Bbb Ccc      Ggg Hhh Jjj\r\n    date

top level of MultiIndex on columns is &quot;Country / population&quot;\r\nand &quot;Country / car No&quot;.

Being brand new to .dta formats, I did some digging and this is the information I was able to gather up so far:\r\n\r\n - .DTA files are data files generated by Btrieve software, which Btrieve then had a name change to PervasiveSQL, which is now owned by Actian\r\n - .DTA files have accompanying system catalog DDF files (data definition files)\r\n - According to this post https://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=364542 I should be able to download the PervasiveSQL demo to be able to explore these DTA files but now I am taken to the Actian website when I click on the links provided.  \r\n - We do not have access to the front end software anymore\r\n\r\nWhen I go to the Actian website, its asking me for a username and password to be able to download any trial software.  \r\nBefore I go signing up for anything, I wanted to check in with you smart people to see if you know of  any alternatives to extracting the data out of these legacy .DTA files so I am able to populate it into SQL tables.\r\nBTW, I have tried all of the obvious; exploring in notepad, excel, access, using any/all drivers in SSMS for importing data/openrowset and even trying to use an ODBC driver for Btrieve and none of those have given me any success.  \r\nI would just LOVE it if there was something obvious I am missing or if anyone has had any success using the Actian

}\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn Master page:\r\n$.get(&quot;&lt;%=ResolveUrl(&quot;~/&quot;)%&gt;AJAXKeepAlive.ashx&quot;);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nWhen am debugging in my local using visual studio iis express, session_end method in global.asax.cs is always called at the end of 20 minutes automatically even when am refreshing the page several times. \r\n\r\nMy assumption is that when I make a trip to the server/IIS session timer will be reset and it will only expire when there is 20 minutes of inactivity. This is not the case. I have been very active on the site but still the session_end method is called. \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Things I&#39;ve tried:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve hosted the application on IIS in our dev server. I have set the IIS session timeout property to be 30 minutes. I have also updated the IIS application pool Idle Time-out minutes to be 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nEven in this case, session ends in 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nI am unable to have the session slide as it normally should after every page request. Any pointers here is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Solution/Edit:**\r\n\r\nAfter researching for a long time, we found that the regeneration of session id while the user is logging in is causing the problem. \r\n\r\n**Further Update:**\r\n\r\nI was able to resolve this issue completely. Please use the c# code in the link below:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/56391868/3189880\r\nThere are other answers in that page but the one that works is the one where the oldId is removed rather than the releasing it. Again only remove the item from store but not release it.

However, it causes the adapter to clean the previous view and add on it the current.\r\n\r\nAs I understand that you are trying to add query results into your RecyclerView list, but the problem is that it removes the old/previous query result from the list while adding the new one. and you need to keep all the results. Please correct me if that is wrong.\r\n\r\nThis behavior might be due to instantiating new adapter each time you get a new query result inside `onSucess()` method. So you can avoid that by transfering this part of code into `onCreate()` method; and then for each onSuccess() call, you can just call `adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()` to notify the adapter that it source of data is changed, so update yourself.\r\n\r\nThis also requires us not to instantiate the adapter with new data, but just add new method to the adapter to update lists with `.addAll()` method.\r\n\r\nSo changes:\r\n\r\n\tMyRecyclerViewAdapter adapter;\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n\t\tsuper.onCreate( savedInstanceState );\r\n\t\tsetContentView( R.layout.activity_main );\r\n\r\n\t\tArrayList&lt;String&gt;

In there, I do have a dependency on a package that in turn has dependencies to lodash and deepdash.\r\n\r\nSince deepdash is provided as a mixin for lodash, the usage of it is (as per the docs) like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// load Lodash if you need it\r\nconst _ = require(&#39;lodash&#39;);\r\n//mixin all the methods into Lodash object\r\nrequire(&#39;deepdash&#39;)(_);\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, if you want to use ES6 syntax (at least that is my understanding), it would translate to:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport _ from &#39;lodash&#39;;\r\nimport deepdash from &#39;deepdash&#39;;\r\n\r\ndeepdash(_);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving done that, I am trying to use webpack to create a bundle now to be used in the browser. My problem is, that for some reason it appears that webpack replaces the import of lodash with some &quot;\\_\\_webpack_require\\_\\_&quot; magic functionality, which leads to lodash not being a function anymore, and the browser says this:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nTo better demonstrate my problem I created a demo github repo with just trying to webpack deepdash and lodash: [ArSn/webpack-deepdash][2] Here is the line that the browser complains about: https://github.com/ArSn/webpack-deepdash/blob/master/dist/main.js#L17219\r\n\r\nI have played around a lot with adding babel configuration en mass and it felt like my best shot was the plugin [babel-plugin-transform-commonjs-es2015-modules][3]. I tried that, the result was still exactly the same.\r\n\r\nI feel like either I have a deep misunderstanding of the situation or I am missing just one tiny little thing. I can however for the life of me not figure out which one it is and what.\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\n - I know there is also a ES6-Version of deepdash, and apparently when using both of those the webpack mechanics work fine (as is stated in the response to the [github issue I opened][4] over at deepdash for this), but the dependency I am using is not using those. Also, I do not really see (or understand?) the point of having a dedicated ES6 version there in the first place.\r\n - The very same code (using deepdash this way with lodash) works just fine when executed on node.js, where it is not bundled with webpack before, obiously.

My question is how can I determine the ANN structure (like how many hidden layers and nodes in each layer) is the best, or at least good enough to use. I heard that package caret can be utilized to determine the best structure. I have gone through the package manual, but cannot figure out how it works. So can anyone give me the basic ideas about this issue, or some hints, or some useful links, so that I can go ahead to check. It&#39;s not limited to caret package, other efficient and useful packages are also OK, or some other ways to set up the ANN. Your help is very appreciated.

However, when i create a new entry in the data `Array` in the relevant `state` that the `getter` works with, it only fetches &amp; displays the new entry when i navigate away from the current route.

The truth is, in most cases, you shouldn&#39;t.\r\n\r\n`for(i in X)` works this way:\r\n\r\n- if X is not an object, convert it to a respective wrapper (a number to a `Number`, a string to a `String`)\r\n- for each &quot;enumerable property&quot; of X, assign its name to i and run the loop body\r\n\r\nSo strings are converted to `String` objects, and, as you can see in the console, they are just like arrays: they have numeric properties from 0 to length - 1 and each property contains the respective character:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThat is, yes, the above logic works just fine with strings. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you only want to iterate a string char-by-char, there&#39;s a more direct way to do the same: the `for..of` loop. \r\n\r\n`for(a of X)` picks each *element* (not property) from X (which can be a string, an array or any &quot;iterable&quot; object) and assigns it to &quot;a&quot;.

As your `ReviewService` (part of the `BookingModule`) depends on your `DoctorLoaderService` (part of the `DoctorModule`) and your `DoctorLoaderService` depends on your `ReviewService`, you need to `forwardRef` in both the module and service of each affected class. In this case `DocotrModule` needs a `forwardRef(() =&gt; BookingModule)` and `BookingModule` needs a `forwardRef(() =&gt; DoctorModule)` as well as `ReviewService` and `DoctorLoadingService` having similar `@Inject(forwardRef(() =&gt; )` setups.\r\n\r\nIn general it is best to avoid these circular dependencies as they can create headaches that are difficult to debug.

&quot;; &quot; &amp; Me.lstContacts.Column(2, N)\r\n    Next N\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can modify the code to only add values from column 2 that meet a certain criteria in column 5?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124399/is-there-a-method-for-looking-up-a-value-in-a-list-box-based-on-criteria-from-on","title":"Is there a method for looking up a value in a list box based on criteria from one of the list box columns?"},{"tags":["postgresql"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569530261,"creation_date":1569530261,"answer_id":58124438,"question_id":58124393,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58124438","body_markdown":"Use the options `-c` and `-f` to specify both an SQL statement and a script:\r\n\r\n    psql -h $MYHOST -U postgres -p 5432 myDB -c &#39;SET search_path=aschema&#39;
