Reading up on this subject you automatically hit items like configuring a S3 backend for your state file instead of using the file locally.\r\n\r\nBut I can&#39;t find a good approach for starting a new terraform project when you want the terraform.tfstate file to be saved in the s3 bucket from start.\r\n\r\nAll the documentation I come across on this subject is talking about creating a S3 bucket, creating a DymanoDB table, doing a new init with the S3 backend settings configured. But all these steps rely on the fact that there already is a local terraform.tfstate file available.\r\n\r\nHow does is work when you want to start a new project when there is no tfstate file available yet?\r\n\r\nWhat I tried so for.\r\n\r\nTo start working with my env-t project I first run this system command to set all the correct s3 backend settings. ( I&#39;ve adopted this construction so I can easily switch between different env&#39;s which all need the same TF code to be applied. Variation is done by using a var file. )\r\n\r\nFILE set_env_env-t.sh\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nexport TF_VAR_CMDLINE_environment=env-t\r\nexport TF_VAR_CMDLINE_tf_state_bucket=tfstate-files-env-t\r\nexport TF_VAR_CMDLINE_tf_state_table=tfstate-locks-env-t\r\nexport TF_VAR_CMDLINE_region=eu-west10001\r\n\r\nexport AWS_PROFILE=$TF_VAR_CMDLINE_environment\r\n\r\n/tmp/terraform init -backend-config &quot;bucket=$TF_VAR_CMDLINE_tf_state_bucket&quot; -backend-config &quot;dynamodb_table=$TF_VAR_CMDLINE_tf_state_table&quot; -backend-config &quot;region=$TF_VAR_CMDLINE_region&quot; -backend-config &quot;key=$TF_VAR_CMDLINE_environment/terraform.tfstate&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in my main.tf I use this code so the previously set backend config is \r\nalso available within the TF script. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;CMDLINE_environment&quot;                   {}\r\nvariable &quot;CMDLINE_tf_state_bucket&quot;               {}\r\nvariable &quot;CMDLINE_tf_state_table&quot;                {}\r\nvariable &quot;CMDLINE_region&quot;                                {}\r\n\r\nterraform {\r\n  backend &quot;s3&quot; {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndata &quot;terraform_remote_state&quot; &quot;state&quot; {\r\n  backend = &quot;s3&quot;\r\n  config = {\r\n    profile        = var.CMDLINE_environment\r\n    bucket         = var.CMDLINE_tf_state_bucket\r\n    dynamodb_table = var.CMDLINE_tf_state_table\r\n    region         = var.CMDLINE_region\r\n    key            = &quot;${var.CMDLINE_environment}/terraform.tfstate&quot;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting the S3 backend all works okay.\r\n\r\n```\r\n. ./set_env_env-t.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut once I run this plan command it bails out with the error that there is no tfstate\r\navailable in the S3 backend yeah that&#39;s correct this is my first run.....\r\n\r\n```\r\nterraform plan -var-file=env-t/vars.tfvars\r\n```\r\n\r\nError: Unable to find remote state\r\n\r\n  on main.tf line 53, in data &quot;terraform_remote_state&quot; &quot;state&quot;:\r\n  53: data &quot;terraform_remote_state&quot; &quot;state&quot; {\r\n\r\nNo stored state was found for the given workspace in the given backend.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only way around this I now have is first work with a local terraform.tfstate file\r\nconfigure all the stuff req. for the S3 backend.

We are able to get it working properly when running the App in a regular mode (i.e. as a user) but it fails when running in Kiosk mode.\r\n\r\nOur App engine hosted FIDO server generates the respective HTML/JS code that interacts with the our app to create a working U2F flow using a Yubikey.

However, if the user has 2 tabs open, one being the application tab and another tab of some arbitrary site, and the user closes the application tab, the cookies still persist when the user opens a new application tab, and thus, the user session is still active and does not force him to sign-in again.\r\n\r\nSo my thinking is as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Keep track of the open tabs by storing a count value in the browser cookies.\r\n 2. Increment the cookie if a new tab is opened\r\n 3. Decrement the cookie if a tab is closed\r\n 4. Leave the cookie count unchanged if the browser is refreshed\r\n\r\nFor items 2 - 4, I am utilizing the `window.performance.navigation.type` properties to determine whether a tab was loaded or refreshed. When a tab is opened at first, the `navigation.type` correctly indicates a type of `0`, which is `TYPE_NAVIGATE`. However, if the same tab is refreshed, the type still indicates a value of 0, and only after the second refresh, it switches over correctly to a 1, which is the `TYPE_RELOAD`. So this incorrect interpretation between 0 and 1 causes the cookie to be incorrectly calculated.\r\n\r\nBelow is my code, perhaps any idea or feedback as to what is going wrong, or perhaps guidelines to a better way of determining if the last tab was closed?\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar checkTabs = function () {\r\n    //This method gets called at the start of the application\r\n        \r\n    var isRefresh = window.performance.navigation.type === window.performance.navigation.TYPE_RELOAD;\r\n    \r\n    //The getCookie and setCookie methods are custom functions to retrieve a browser cookie and its value, and set the retrieved cookie value.\r\n    var tabCookie = getCookie({ name: &quot;WS:T&quot; });\r\n    \r\n    //If the cookie is not found, we create a new cookie with an initialized value of 0\r\n    if (!tabCookie)\r\n        tabCookie = { name: &quot;WS:T&quot;, value: 0 };\r\n        \r\n    var increment = tabCookie.value;\r\n    \r\n    //If the navigation type is a navigate and not a refresh, we increment the cookie value    \r\n    if (!isRefresh)\r\n        increment = parseInt(tabCookie.value, 10) + 1;\r\n        \r\n    setCookie({ name: &quot;WS:T&quot;, value: increment, expiry: moment().subtract(1, &quot;days&quot;).format(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm&quot;) });\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe `beforeunload` listener is added to the window object and makes reference to the method below:\r\n```\r\nvar beforeUnloadTab = function (e) {\r\n        var isRefresh = window.performance.navigation.type === window.performance.navigation.TYPE_RELOAD;\r\n        if (!isRefresh) {\r\n    //Only decrement the cookie if the tab is closed and not refreshed.\r\n            var tabCookie = getCookie({ name: &quot;WS:T&quot; });\r\n            var decrement = parseInt(tabCookie.value, 10) - 1;\r\n\r\n            if (decrement === 0) {\r\n                //If the last tab is being closed, perform the necessary clearing of all session values etc.\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            setCookie({ name: &quot;WS:T&quot;, value: decrement, expiry: moment().subtract(1, &quot;days&quot;).format(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm&quot;) });\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199323/how-to-check-if-the-last-browser-tab-of-an-application-is-closed","title":"How to check if the last browser tab of an application is closed"},{"tags":["fiddler"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2301,"user_id":259206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/36eb402c7146af7b967a49e135d2f2c1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Borislav Ivanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/259206/borislav-ivanov"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570083270,"creation_date":1570083270,"answer_id":58213254,"question_id":58199321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58213254","body_markdown":"You can use a filter with **Show only if URL contains** option set to `localhost`, or if you need more sophisticated filtering, with the `REGEX:` syntax, e.g.\r\n```\r\nREGEX:https://localhost.*\r\n```\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PyqeM.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199321/how-to-only-allow-localhost-url-in-fiddler/58213254#58213254","title":"How to only allow localhost url in fiddler"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10748833,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zwr1-1NotHs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/sBvVnvQtYf8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"34 34","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10748833/34-34"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2059,"user_id":4479165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fb7faf1344075e6252156358b64e539?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theduck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4479165/theduck"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570083270,"creation_date":1570010441,"last_edit_date":1570015274,"question_id":58199321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199321","body_markdown":"I am working with following localhost Urls  with windows 10 desktop and need to track api calls from these domains.

But the only advantage it has over the original is that it&#39;s point-free.  And if you were to try to extend this to intermediate functions in that pipeline, it would get downright ugly.\r\n\r\nMy take is that point-free can at times lead to cleaner, easier-to-read, and easier-to-maintain code.  But there is no reason to go point-free when it doesn&#39;t do so.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not that point-free is inherently more functional than pointed code.  I think this idea starts as a sort of Haskell-envy from other languages.  Haskell is held up as an idealized FP language, and it happens to be a language in which point-free comes naturally.  But that&#39;s at least partially coincidental.\r\n\r\nMy standard example is that `const sum = reduce(add, 0)` is cleaner and more comprehensible than `const sum = (xs) =&gt; xs.reduce(add, 0)`.  It also makes extremely clear the parallels with `const product = reduce(multiply, 1)` or `const all = reduce(and, true)`.  But as you get more complex, or when you need to reuse an intermediate calculation (as Bergi pointed out), point-free code often becomes a liability.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t have a real call here about whether this version is an improvement on the original.  If so, it&#39;s only a minor one.  Carrying it further would significantly degrade the readability.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [co]: https://ramdajs.com/docs/#converge\r\n  [li]: https://ramdajs.com/docs/#lift\r\n  [uw]: https://ramdajs.com/docs/#useWith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199319/functional-way-of-re-using-variables-in-a-pipe/58203072#58203072","title":"Functional way of re-using variables in a pipe"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7992,"user_id":4099454,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hjZGE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hitmands","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4099454/hitmands"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570046966,"creation_date":1570046966,"answer_id":58208705,"question_id":58199319,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58208705","body_markdown":"What about something like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const getAnotherPropOfC = R.prop(&#39;message&#39;);\r\n    const transformToArray = R.split(&#39;&#39;);\r\n    const mapToSomething = R.map(R.toUpper);\r\n    const filterSomething = R.reject(R.equals(&#39; &#39;));\r\n    const chainMyIdWithResultOfPreviousFunction = R.pipe(\r\n      R.prop(&#39;fragment&#39;), \r\n      R.concat,\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    const myFun = R.converge(R.map, [\r\n      chainMyIdWithResultOfPreviousFunction,\r\n      R.pipe(\r\n        getAnotherPropOfC,\r\n        transformToArray,\r\n        mapToSomething,\r\n        filterSomething,\r\n      ),\r\n    ]);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    console.log(\r\n      myFun({ message: &#39;Hello World&#39;, fragment: &#39;!&#39; }),\r\n    );\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ramda/0.26.1/ramda.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199319/functional-way-of-re-using-variables-in-a-pipe/58208705#58208705","title":"Functional way of re-using variables in a pipe"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":10728469,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7167d1e03e480bc72dfc805af0d8803a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maxpower90","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10728469/maxpower90"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":122,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58203072,"answer_count":4,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570046966,"creation_date":1570010425,"question_id":58199319,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199319","body_markdown":"Using functional programming in javascript and typescript together with Ramda, I often find myself writing code like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst myFun = c =&gt; {\r\n  const myId = c.id\r\n\r\n  const value = pipe(\r\n    getAnotherOtherPropOfC,\r\n    transformToArray,\r\n    mapToSomething,\r\n    filterSomething,\r\n    // ...

I finally realized that earlier i had created a test `round()` function and i deleted it manually from R Environment then things got solved.\r\n\r\nAnyway here is your answer:\r\n\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n    # test data as in question\r\n    round_fun &lt;- function(x) {\r\n      x %&gt;% \r\n        mutate(new_number = ifelse((geo_lev ==&#39;USA&#39; &amp; \r\n                         reg_lev !=&#39;two&#39;), round(number,-1), number))\r\n      }\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n    \r\n    # A tibble: 5 x 4\r\n      geo_lev reg_lev number new_number\r\n      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\r\n    1 USA     one        101        100\r\n    2 France  two         10         10\r\n    3 England one         14         14\r\n    4 Ukraine two         19         19\r\n    5 Poland  one         22         22","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199313/applying-a-function-to-round-selected-variables/58200075#58200075","title":"Applying a function to round selected variables"}],"owner":{"reputation":207,"user_id":7545840,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2bc7adcc578d06f37799984177f54b20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mrmoleje","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7545840/mrmoleje"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11416,"user_id":4552295,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b47aeeacc995822fb34f3dbb8db8ecca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sindri_baldur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4552295/sindri-baldur"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58200075,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570014210,"creation_date":1570010409,"last_edit_date":1570010629,"question_id":58199313,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199313","body_markdown":"I would like to develop a function with an if statement, so that when the function is run over a dataframe only certain variables are amended. \r\n\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n\r\n    df1 &lt;- tibble(\r\n      geo_lev = c(&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;England&quot;, &quot;Ukraine&quot;, &quot;Poland&quot;),\r\n      reg_lev = c(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;one&quot;),\r\n      number = c(101, 10, 14, 19, 22))\r\n\r\nThis is how I would round the data without a function\r\n\r\n    df1 %&gt;% \r\n      mutate(number=ifelse(geo_lev ==&#39;USA&#39; &amp; reg_lev !=&#39;two&#39;, \r\n                                        round(number, -1),\r\n                           number))\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried to develop a function to do this but it doesn&#39;t quite work\r\n\r\n    round &lt;- function(x) {\r\n      result = round(x, -1) \r\n      if (geo_lev ==&#39;USA&#39; &amp; reg_lev !=&#39;two&#39;)}\r\n\r\nOne the function is applied I would like the data to look like this\r\n\r\n    round(df1)\r\n\r\n    df1 &lt;- tibble(\r\n      geo_lev = c(&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;England&quot;, &quot;Ukraine&quot;, &quot;Poland&quot;),\r\n      reg_lev = c(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;one&quot;),\r\n      number = c(100, 10, 14, 19, 22))\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how I would develop the function?

It&#39;s an essential function that&#39;s setting up the drawing process. A lot of OpenGL beginners have the misconception that `glViewport` is some sort of initialization step, or in your case a specialization. It&#39;s not. *It&#39;s a drawing related function!*\r\n\r\nThe idiomatric way to drawing to a window with OpenGL begins with setting the viewport to the position and size wherein that window you want to draw, *at each and every iteration of the drawing loop*. Yes, it&#39;s idiomatic to call it repeatedly, since working with, say *framebuffer objects*, or drawing overlay elements, like HUDs, require the change the viewport multiple times throughout drawing a frame.\r\n\r\nSo the fix for your problem is to call `glViewport` with the size of the drawable region you want to draw to, right at the beginning of the drawing function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199304/opengl-wrong-viewport/58202097#58202097","title":"OpenGL wrong viewport"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5867556,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kuxLFHAEQUg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAi4/vx9TPdjXk1Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Quorthon Plavi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5867556/quorthon-plavi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43551,"user_id":44729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyWaU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"genpfault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/44729/genpfault"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570024019,"creation_date":1570010382,"last_edit_date":1570024019,"question_id":58199304,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199304","body_markdown":"I have a problem with rendering a triangle in 800x600 res window.

have a dataframe with free form addresses which I normalize with Google Maps Geocoder API.

If you gonna run things in parallel you need to increase according your needs.\r\n\r\nAt the end i simplify my code.\r\n\r\n    pipeline{\r\n        agent{\r\n            label &#39;xxx&#39; //Insert node here\r\n        }\r\n        options {\r\n            timeout(time: 30, unit: &#39;MINUTES&#39;) // set timeout if you need\r\n        }\r\n        stages{\r\n            stage(&#39;xxx&#39;){ // Give stage name\r\n                steps {\r\n                    build &#39;xxxx&#39;   // Name of the build/job here\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHope it hepls someone one day. :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199235/how-to-set-from-jenkins-pipeline-the-configuration-to-mobile-center/58215658#58215658","title":"how to set from Jenkins pipeline the configuration to Mobile Center?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11952694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-944yPmLgXDA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXE/PqIr5_3XYvk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11952694/rik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11952694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-944yPmLgXDA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXE/PqIr5_3XYvk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11952694/rik"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58215658,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570093977,"creation_date":1570010076,"last_edit_date":1570013336,"question_id":58199235,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199235","body_markdown":"I have some scripts made for regression testing.

Ticket and Note are two separate CRUD entities. By modifying the views and by creating a trait, I&#39;ve managed to put the &quot;Show&quot; portion of one particular Ticket inside the &quot;Create&quot; page of a Note. The Create page of Note basically had both the Show of a particular ticket and the form that I could use to create a new Note.\r\n\r\nIt used to work back in 3.6 but it doesn&#39;t now that I&#39;ve moved to version 4.0.\r\nIs it because the CrudPanel is now a singleton?\r\nWhat could I do in order to make this work?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I did:\r\n\r\nNoteTicketCrudController:\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin;\r\n\r\nuse Route;\r\n\r\nclass NoteTicketCrudController extends TicketCrudController\r\n{\r\n    public function setup()\r\n    {\r\n        parent::setup();\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;removeButton(&#39;reply_button&#39;);\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;removeButton(&#39;note_button&#39;);\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;denyAccess(&#39;delete&#39;);\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;denyAccess(&#39;create&#39;);\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;denyAccess(&#39;update&#39;);\r\n        // get the user_id parameter\r\n        $noteId = Route::current()-&gt;parameter(&#39;note&#39;) ?: Route::current()-&gt;parameter(&#39;note_id&#39;);\r\n        // set a different route for the admin panel buttons\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;setRoute(&quot;admin/notes/&quot;.$noteId.&quot;/tickets&quot;);\r\n        // show only that user&#39;s posts\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;addClause(&#39;whereHas&#39;, &#39;notes&#39;, function ($query) use($noteId) {\r\n            $query-&gt;where(&#39;id&#39;, $noteId);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;setColumnDetails(&#39;subject&#39;, [&#39;limit&#39; =&gt; &#39;1000&#39;]);\r\n\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;addColumn([\r\n                &#39;name&#39;  =&gt; &#39;description&#39;,\r\n                &#39;label&#39; =&gt; &#39;Messaggio&#39;,\r\n                &#39;type&#39;  =&gt; &#39;text&#39;,\r\n                &#39;limit&#39; =&gt; 1000\r\n        ])-&gt;afterColumn(&#39;subject&#39;);\r\n\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;addColumn([\r\n                // run a function on the CRUD model and show its return value\r\n                &#39;name&#39; =&gt; &quot;history_info&quot;,\r\n                &#39;label&#39; =&gt; &quot;&quot;,\r\n                &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;closure&#39;,\r\n                &#39;function&#39; =&gt; function ($entry) {\r\n                    return $entry-&gt;getHistoryView();\r\n                }\r\n        ]);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelatedCrud:\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Traits;\r\n\r\nuse Backpack\\CRUD\\app\\Http\\Controllers\\CrudController;\r\n\r\ntrait RelatedCrud\r\n{\r\n    public $relatedCrud;\r\n\r\n    public function setupRelated(CrudController $relatedController)\r\n    { \r\n      \r\n        $relatedController-&gt;crud = app()-&gt;make(&#39;crud&#39;); // 4.0\r\n        $relatedController-&gt;request = request();\r\n        $relatedController-&gt;setupDefaults(); // 4.0\r\n        $relatedController-&gt;setup(); \r\n        $relatedController-&gt;setupConfigurationForCurrentOperation(); // 4.0\r\n        $this-&gt;relatedCrud = $relatedController-&gt;crud;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNoteCrudController:\r\n```\r\nclass NoteCrudController extends CrudController\r\n{\r\n    use \\Backpack\\CRUD\\app\\Http\\Controllers\\Operations\\ListOperation;\r\n    use \\Backpack\\CRUD\\app\\Http\\Controllers\\Operations\\ShowOperation   { show as traitShow; }\r\n    use \\Backpack\\CRUD\\app\\Http\\Controllers\\Operations\\CreateOperation { store as traitStore; create as traitCreate; }\r\n    use \\Backpack\\CRUD\\app\\Http\\Controllers\\Operations\\UpdateOperation { edit as traitEdit; update as traitUpdate; }\r\n    use \\Backpack\\CRUD\\app\\Http\\Controllers\\Operations\\DeleteOperation { destroy as traitDestroy; }\r\n    use AccessManager;\r\n    use RelatedCrud;\r\n\r\n    public $ticket;\r\n\r\n    public function setup()\r\n    {\r\n        /*\r\n        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        | CrudPanel Basic Information\r\n        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        */\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;setModel(&#39;App\\Note&#39;);\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;setRoute(config(&#39;backpack.base.route_prefix&#39;) . &#39;/notes&#39;);\r\n        $this-&gt;crud-&gt;setEntityNameStrings(&#39;note&#39;, &#39;note&#39;);\r\n\r\n        //imposta il controller usato per mostrare la tabella dei ticket nel metodo show\r\n        $this-&gt;setupRelated(new NoteTicketCrudController()); // LOADS SECOND CRUD\r\n\r\n        /*\r\n        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        | CrudPanel Configuration\r\n        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        */\r\n\r\n        $this-&gt;setPermissions();\r\n\r\n        $this-&gt;ticket = $this-&gt;crud-&gt;request-&gt;ticket ?

First of all, none of those are actually columns. In InfluxDB, your data is stored using the following data model (aka, the line protocol): `measurement-name,tag-set field-set timestamp` \r\n\r\n“**The measurement**” is a high level of grouping of data and it is *string*, “**the tag set**” is a collection of key/value pairs which can be considered as metadata where all values are *indexed* and *strings*, and “**the field set**” is a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be *int64*, *float64*, *bool*, or *string*. In contrast to tags, fields are not indexed.\r\n\r\nIn the `LayoutMapper` class, you set `tag=true` for the `id` and `linename`, that means these two are members of the tag-set in your measurement. Tags are used to query fields in a high performance way. For that reason, they are usually located in WHERE clause, not SELECT alone. \r\n\r\nIn InfluxDB, if you want to return a specific tag, the SELECT clause must include at least one field. That&#39;s why you only get result from the queries including `*` and `layout` field.

The code attached is returning nulls.\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199200/using-linq-to-return-list-of-objects-where-sum-of-attribute-is-the-max-in-list","title":"Using linq to Return list of objects where sum of attribute is the Max() in list of list"},{"tags":["sql-server","date","sum"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":302,"user_id":12055980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Dy1f.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Au Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12055980/au-nguyen"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570010976,"post_id":58199405,"comment_id":102776881,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199199/sum-all-records-smaller-than-a-date-in-daterange-with-group-by-in-mssql/58199405#comment102776881_58199405"},{"owner":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570011073,"post_id":58199405,"comment_id":102776924,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199199/sum-all-records-smaller-than-a-date-in-daterange-with-group-by-in-mssql/58199405#comment102776924_58199405"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3513024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/602660603/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3513024","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3513024/user3513024"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570011100,"post_id":58199405,"comment_id":102776943,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199199/sum-all-records-smaller-than-a-date-in-daterange-with-group-by-in-mssql/58199405#comment102776943_58199405"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6493981,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc1045dcd73fbe72430856d993c92982?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"troggy69","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6493981/troggy69"},"last_editor":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6493981,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc1045dcd73fbe72430856d993c92982?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"troggy69","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6493981/troggy69"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570015492,"last_edit_date":1570015492,"creation_date":1570010704,"answer_id":58199405,"question_id":58199199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58199405","body_markdown":"Try something like this but you need to amend it to fit your table and where clauses if there are any.\r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n      SUM(yt.qty) AS qty,\r\n      yt.date,\r\n      yt.user\r\n    FROM your_table yt\r\n    WHERE yt.date between &quot;2019-09-01&quot; AND &quot;2019-09-03&quot;\r\n    GROUP BY yt.user, yt.date\r\n    ORDER BY yt.date ASC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/472621/1/0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199199/sum-all-records-smaller-than-a-date-in-daterange-with-group-by-in-mssql/58199405#58199405","title":"Sum all records smaller than a date in daterange with group by in MsSql"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3513024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/602660603/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3513024","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3513024/user3513024"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3513024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/602660603/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3513024","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3513024/user3513024"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570015492,"creation_date":1570009963,"last_edit_date":1570011237,"question_id":58199199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199199","body_markdown":"i have records like that\r\n```\r\nqty    date          user\r\n1      2019-09-01    a\r\n1      2019-09-01    b\r\n2      2019-09-01    a\r\n1      2019-09-01    c\r\n1      2019-09-02    a\r\n3      2019-09-02    c\r\n1      2019-09-02    a\r\n4      2019-09-03    b\r\n1      2019-09-03    c\r\n1      2019-09-03    a\r\n\r\n```\r\nI just want to sum qty&#39;s group by date and user and sum is smaller than the given date.

It&#39;s similar to what you are already doing. A web job acts a host behind the scenes and it runs the individual functions on the timers set in each function&#39;s [timer trigger][1]. You just won&#39;t have to do the messy work of keeping track of schedules or setting up the webjob. \r\n\r\nYou would run one function per job and use [C# script (.csx files)][2] to keep the functions dynamic. The work comes in managing the function scripts.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how I would convert your project. Feel free to borrow, edit, or make this your own way:\r\n\r\n 1. To make it easier to make updates I would take the logic of your calculations and make them into either a class library inside the `bin` folder or convert them to .csx files and add them to a `./shared` folder under your `wwwroot` folder. You&#39;ll then be able to make use of it in the functions without duplicating it by using `#load &quot;..\\shared\\calculation1Logic.csx&quot;`at the top of the function&#39;s .csx file. This is optional\r\n\r\nSo now we have: &lt;br/&gt;\r\n- wwwroot &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - website (if you are using the same app service) &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - shared &lt;br/&gt; \r\n| | - calculation1Logic.csx &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| | - calculation2Logic.csx &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\n*or*\r\n\r\n| bin &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| | calculationLogic.dll &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n 2. Make some function templates that wrap each one of those calculations.\r\n\r\n*calculation1Function.csx* example\r\n\r\n    #load &quot;..\\shared\\calculation1Logic.csx&quot;\r\n    \r\n    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;\r\n    \r\n    public static void Run(TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log)\r\n    {\r\n        log.LogInformation($&quot;running calculation 1: {DateTime.Now}&quot;);\r\n        calculation1Logic(myTimer, log);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n 3. To create a new job, I would use the `createfunction` endpoint [in the Azure Management API][3] and pass it that template and a timer binding with the schedule converted to CRON syntax. Since this is much easier to create from an example, there&#39;s one in [this][4] MSDN thread. It is in Node, but as I am using .csx instead of precompiled code the same method of dynamically adding functions will work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Make sure to make the function names unique and store them so that you can edit or delete them later.\r\n\r\nNow these are the files I have based on how this will get converted from the API request: &lt;br/&gt;\r\n- wwwroot &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - website (if you are using the same app service) &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - shared &lt;br/&gt; \r\n| | - calculation1Logic.csx &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| | - calculation2Logic.csx &lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - User1_Calculation1 &lt;br/&gt;\r\n  | | - run.csx&lt;br/&gt;\r\n  | | - function.json&lt;br/&gt;\r\n  | | - function.proj&lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - User2_Calculation2&lt;br/&gt;\r\n  | | - run.csx&lt;br/&gt;\r\n  | | - function.json&lt;br/&gt;\r\n  | | - function.proj&lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - host.json (part of the functions runtime along with extensions.csproj)&lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - extensions.csproj&lt;br/&gt;\r\n| - bin&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n 4. Editing the schedule. This is where it gets a bit tricky. There are a couple ways to do this. The safest is to delete and re-add the function each time. The other is to replace the `function.json` with one with the updated binding. This way is a bit outside of what you &#39;should&#39; do, but it allows for dynamic rebindings. `function.json` is a simple file if you just have the one binding, so you should be able to generate it progromaticaly.\r\n\r\n*function.json* example\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;bindings&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;myTimer&quot;,\r\n          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;timerTrigger&quot;,\r\n          &quot;direction&quot;: &quot;in&quot;,\r\n          &quot;schedule&quot;: &quot;0 */5 * * * *&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can replace files in the App Service without a full deployment by accessing the files by FTP. Now, because changing the file via FTP [doesn&#39;t notify][5] the host process that it has a new schedule to implement, you will need to send a request to `/syncfunctiontriggers` [via the management API][6] to get it to update. This doesn&#39;t restart the full app, but if you are changing schedules often, you may want to have that API call run on a timer-- every minute or whatever interval works best for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-csharp\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/createfunction\r\n  [4]: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/f4c91356-4de4-481c-83dc-7974f9ab1aae/creating-a-function-dynamically-using-azure-rest-api?forum=AzureFunctions\r\n  [5]: https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/issues/210\r\n  [6]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/syncfunctiontriggers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199183/how-to-schedule-regular-executions-dynamically/58254121#58254121","title":"How to schedule regular executions dynamically?"}],"owner":{"reputation":73,"user_id":1000831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8578e575347a1fa588d375d814ddc9aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Julien Brousseau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1000831/julien-brousseau"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570334870,"creation_date":1570009917,"question_id":58199183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58199183","body_markdown":"I need to run some calculations periodically on a website. The difficult bit is that they don&#39;t run at fully regular intervals, as they are scheduled by the end users to run every N minutes (can be changed at any time), then would pause towards the end of the business day, and resume again the next morning, or else after a weekend.

If I uncomment the constructor of the child component I can see that the properties are empty. \r\n\r\nWhat is the correct way in ReactJs to render a child component and pass properties?\r\n\r\n**Solved**\r\nSolved this! The problem was in the code for RestDataSource.getCourses(). This was not transforming to properties model. The JSON from the Rest API returned included CourseID and CourseName properties. The react child component Course included properties courseID and courseName. Fixed by ensuring properties exactly matched.\r\n \r\n**CourseList.ts (Parent)**\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport Course from &#39;./Course&#39;;\r\nimport { CourseProps } from &#39;./Course&#39;;\r\nimport { RestDataCourse } from &#39;../data/RestDataCourse&#39;;\r\n\r\ntype CourseListProps = {};\r\n\r\ntype CourseListState = {\r\n  courses: Array&lt;CourseProps&gt;;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default class CourseList extends React.Component&lt;\r\n  CourseListProps,\r\n  CourseListState\r\n&gt; {\r\n  constructor(props: CourseListProps) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = { courses: new Array&lt;CourseProps&gt;() };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async componentDidMount(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {\r\n    console.log(&#39;CourseList::componentDidMount&#39;);\r\n\r\n    const dataSource: RestDataCourse = new RestDataCourse();\r\n    const coursesList: Array&lt;CourseProps&gt; = await dataSource.getCourses();\r\n\r\n    this.setState({ courses: coursesList });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async componentWillUnmount(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {\r\n    console.log(&#39;CourseList::componentWillUnmout&#39;);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public render(): JSX.Element {\r\n    console.log(&#39;CourseList::render =&gt; &#39; + JSON.stringify(this.state.courses));\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        {this.state.courses.map(c =&gt; (\r\n          &lt;Course\r\n            key={c.courseID}\r\n            courseID={c.courseID}\r\n            courseName={c.courseName}\r\n          /&gt;\r\n        ))}\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Course.ts (Child)**\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n\r\nexport interface CourseProps {\r\n  courseID: string;\r\n  courseName: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default class Course extends React.Component&lt;CourseProps, {}&gt; {\r\n  // constructor(props: CourseProps) {\r\n  //   super(props);\r\n  //   console.log(`Course::constructor =&gt; ${JSON.stringify(props)}`);\r\n  // }\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount(): void {\r\n    console.log(&#39;Course::componentDidMount&#39;);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillUnmount(): void {\r\n    console.log(&#39;Course::componentWillUnmout&#39;);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public render(): JSX.Element {\r\n    console.log(\r\n      JSON.stringify(`Course::render =&gt; ${JSON.stringify(this.props)}`),\r\n    );\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        Course render\r\n        {this.props.courseID}\r\n        {this.props.courseName}\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58199157/reactjs-typescript-properties-are-not-initialised-in-child-component-created-f","title":"Reactjs Typescript - Properties are not initialised in child component created from parent component render method"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7993}
