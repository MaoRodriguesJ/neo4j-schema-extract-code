Numbers in JavaScript are represented using the [floating point standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic). This standard makes tradeoffs between range and precision. The larger the number the less precision you have. This means that really large numbers can&#39;t be represented accurately. For example `10000000000000001` can&#39;t be represented in this standard, so you actually end up with `10000000000000000`. You can test this out if you `console.log` the numbers:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconsole.log(10000000000000000);\r\nconsole.log(10000000000000001);\r\nconsole.log(10000000000000002);\r\nconsole.log(10000000000000003);\r\nconsole.log(10000000000000004);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput is:\r\n```\r\n10000000000000000\r\n10000000000000000\r\n10000000000000002\r\n10000000000000004\r\n10000000000000004\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to represent large numbers with greater precision you will need to use a custom large number library ([ex](https://github.com/peterolson/BigInteger.js)). There is also [proposed bigint support](https://v8.dev/features/bigint) in Javascript, but at least at time of writing this has limited support in browsers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58505809/modulus-operator-in-typescript-not-working-correctly-for-big-numbers/58505960#58505960","title":"Modulus(%) operator in Typescript not working correctly for big numbers"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":160,"user_id":6434590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07f49f0a4871e7a0057a62d9e58b3f41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David G.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6434590/david-g"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571752943,"creation_date":1571752943,"answer_id":58506061,"question_id":58505809,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58506061","body_markdown":"This is a Javascript problem, not Typescript.

original solution is surprisingly fast but it can be done faster.\r\nYou can join the strings to one large buffer and process it with one call to ```np.fromstring```.\r\n\r\nTry following code:\r\n```\r\n# put everthing to a buffer as a large 1D-array separated with commas\r\nbuf = &#39;,&#39;.join(iPoints)\r\n# parse the buffer\r\niPoints = np.fromstring(buf, sep=&#39;,&#39;, dtype=float, count=3*len(iPoints))\r\n# make it 3d again\r\niPoints = iPoints.reshape(-1,3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve made some benchmark.\r\n\r\n```\r\niPoints=[&#39;-50.0651394154927,-5.3133315588409,0&#39;, &#39;-48.7824404616692,3.1894817418136,0&#39;, &#39;-46.2317402190515,11.3986203175639,0&#39;]\r\n# lets make it a little large\r\niMorePoints = iPoints * 10000\r\n\r\nmethod1 = lambda: np.array([[float(c) for c in v.split(&#39;,&#39;)] for v in iMorePoints])\r\nmethod2 = lambda: np.fromstring(&#39;,&#39;.join(iMorePoints), sep=&#39;,&#39;, dtype=float, count=3*len(iMorePoints)).reshape(-1,3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults on my machine are:\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(method1,

In the future you will probably face issues like I/O overhead. You can catch a glimpse of the evils of large arrays in the article [Why shouldn&#39;t I embed large arrays in my documents?](http://www.askasya.com/post/largeembeddedarrays/). Although it&#39;s hard to find it written anywhere, large arrays in MongoDB are considered a performance anti-pattern.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to go for **referencing**, I suggest reading [Building with Patterns: The Bucket Pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-bucket-pattern). The article can give you an idea on how to design your **user_events** collection in a non-relational way.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58505786/mongodb-best-practise-one-to-many-relation/58509166#58509166","title":"MongoDB best practise - One to many relation"}],"owner":{"reputation":239,"user_id":8408576,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54858c552ad405c4ebf6477f4a9b2e7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dewey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8408576/dewey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58509166,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1571763811,"creation_date":1571752032,"question_id":58505786,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58505786","body_markdown":"According to this post I should **embed** a &quot;reference&quot;: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5373198/mongodb-relationships-embed-or-reference\r\n\r\nUser.js\r\n----\r\n    const mongoose = require(&#39;mongoose&#39;);\r\n\r\n    const Schema = mongoose.Schema;\r\n    \r\n    const userSchema = new Schema({\r\n        email: {\r\n            type: String,\r\n            required: true\r\n        },\r\n        password: {\r\n            type: String,\r\n            required: true\r\n        },\r\n        createdEvents: [&#39;Event&#39;]\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    module.exports = mongoose.model(&#39;User&#39;, userSchema);\r\n\r\nEvent.js\r\n--------\r\n\r\n    const mongoose = require(&#39;mongoose&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    const Schema = mongoose.Schema;\r\n    \r\n    const eventSchema = new Schema({\r\n        title: {\r\n            type: String,\r\n            required: true\r\n        },\r\n        description: {\r\n            type: String,\r\n            required: true\r\n        },\r\n        price: {\r\n            type: Number,\r\n            required: true\r\n        },\r\n        date: {\r\n            type: Date,\r\n            required: true\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    module.exports = mongoose.model(&#39;Event&#39;, eventSchema);\r\n\r\nSo an embedded event looks like this in the database:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cSseN.png\r\n\r\nMy Code works but im curious if this is the right way to embed the event.

my android app I need to handle IBeacons\r\nSo \r\nDescription of IBeacon:\r\n\r\n    The starting point of the Beacons movement is considered to the development of iBeacons by Apple, announced in 2013. Beacons are the devices supporting the Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Their task is simple — serially send data packages (advertisement packets).\r\n    This packet consists of the following parts:\r\n    The 3-component beacon ID:\r\n    UUID — 16 byte. For example your company ID, retail store ID, etc.\r\n    Major — 2 byte. The city ID where your company/store is located.\r\n    Minor — 2 byte. The GPS coordinates of a specific venue.\r\n    TX Power — 1 byte. This is a paragon of the signal strength. The paragon is the signal strength at the distance of 1 meter from the beacon. Measures in dBm.\r\n\r\nNice.\r\n\r\nIn my android app to handle **IBeacons** I use this [https://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/index.html][1]\r\n\r\n    implementation &#39;org.altbeacon:android-beacon-library:2.16.3&#39;\r\n\r\nIn documentation I found this help:\r\nhere is the list of some beacon layouts\r\n\r\n    ALTBEACON      m:2-3=beac,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24,d:25-25\r\n    EDDYSTONE TLM  x,s:0-1=feaa,m:2-2=20,d:3-3,d:4-5,d:6-7,d:8-11,d:12-15\r\n    EDDYSTONE UID  s:0-1=feaa,m:2-2=00,p:3-3:-41,i:4-13,i:14-19\r\n    EDDYSTONE URL  s:0-1=feaa,m:2-2=10,p:3-3:-41,i:4-20v\r\n    IBEACON        m:2-3=0215,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in my android app:\r\n\r\n    fun initBeaconManager() {\r\n            beaconManager = BeaconManager.getInstanceForApplication(this)\r\n            beaconManager!!.bind(this as BeaconConsumer)\r\n            //Parse IBeacon structure\r\n            val beaconParserList = beaconManager!!.getBeaconParsers()\r\n            val beaconParser = BeaconParser()\r\n                 beaconParser.setBeaconLayout(&quot;m:2-3=0215,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24&quot;)\r\n            beaconParserList.add(beaconParser)\r\n        }\r\n\r\nand it&#39;s work fine.

I started the project today again and now suddenly the fixture gets executed twice and it opens two seperate browsers (which causes my tests to fail). I thought the `IClassFixture` was supposed to only execute once like `[OneTimeSetUp]` attribute in NUnit. Why is my fixture executing twice?\r\n\r\nThis happens when I run all tests (all tests runs`ProfileTest` and `HomeTest`). If I run for example one of the two tests individually, then just 1 browser instance opens and the test passes.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using XUnit 2.4.0.\r\n\r\n**- EDIT -**\r\n\r\nWhen I use:\r\n\r\nVS 2019 (run all tests): It opens 2 browsers at same time and fails.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nVS 2019 (debug all tests): It opens 2 browsers at same time and fails.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nJetbrain&#39;s Rider IDE (run all tests): It opens 2 browsers at same time and fails.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nJetbrain&#39;s Rider IDE (debug all tests): It opens 1 browser till `HomeTest` finishes and then another browser for `ProfileTest`, and both tests pass (including `LoginTest`).&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThis last is how it is supposed to work and it used to be like this when I used NUnit before.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58505734/xunit-class-fixture-iclassfixture-is-being-executed-twice","title":"XUnit Class Fixture (IClassFixture) is being executed

So assuming you have the `Test` class in current priject `A`, when you see the content in VS code editor, you&#39;ll see something like:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s expected behavior that you won&#39;t see that rich comments in project A any more cause they have been moved to `docs.xml`.\r\n\r\n2.**If you mean when you create a new Project B(or share the assembly to other developers), the Intellisense can&#39;t recognize your Test class.**\r\n\r\nTwo possible causes:\r\n\r\n1.The output xx.dll and xx.xml from project A are  not in the same folder, so when you reference that xx.dll in your new project, Intellisense won&#39;t display the documentation comments.\r\n\r\n2.I guess there&#39;s something wrong with your `docs.xml` file. (I can&#39;t find any official document which indicates this technology supports user-defined nodes like `extradoc` and `class` in docs.xml, I used these two nodes and the Intellisense did not work, after changing them to normal `docs` and `members`, it works now)\r\n\r\n**Try using `docs.xml` and `include` in this way:**\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;docs&gt;\r\n      &lt;members name=&quot;MyTests&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;Test&gt;\r\n          &lt;summary&gt;\r\n            This class is public, but do nothing\r\n          &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n          &lt;remarks&gt;\r\n            Just write something here to indicate this is remarks.\r\n          &lt;/remarks&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Test&gt;\r\n      &lt;/members&gt;\r\n    &lt;/docs&gt;\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n    /// &lt;include file=&quot;docs.xml&quot; path=&#39;docs/members[@name=&quot;MyTests&quot;]/Test/*&#39; /&gt;\r\n        public class Test { }\r\n\r\nI suggest you use a public class to test...

as others have said, you&#39;re using inheritance wrong, but I&#39;m chalk that up to the homework requirements.\r\n\r\nin your Dice subclasses try updating the number of sides in the `__init__`

note, when printing information you want to be able to look at the logs and immediately understand it. I suggest adding the following line to roll roll method: `print(&#39;Rolling [{}], count: [{}] values: {}&#39;.format(self.sides, self.nOfDie, self.valueLst))` This will tell you what size of dice you are rolling, how many, and the results of each.

The C convention does not support multiple functions with the same name.\r\n\r\nfun.cpp:\r\n\r\n    #ifdef _WIN32\r\n    #   define API __declspec(dllexport)\r\n    #else\r\n    #   define API\r\n    #endif\r\n    \r\n    extern &quot;C&quot; API int add(int a, int b) {\r\n        return a+b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPython:\r\n\r\n    from ctypes import *\r\n    \r\n    dll = CDLL(&#39;fun&#39;)\r\n    result = dll.add(10,1)\r\n    print(&#39;Addition value:&#39;,result)\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    Addition value: 11\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58505664/how-can-i-call-a-c-function-using-python/58508851#58508851","title":"How can I call a c++ function using python"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":10591725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jfu5OShbIC0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/iNW-EufqVHA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"IT World","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10591725/it-world"},"last_editor":{"reputation":53,"user_id":10591725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jfu5OShbIC0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/iNW-EufqVHA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"IT World","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10591725/it-world"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":82,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58508851,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571782986,"creation_date":1571751676,"last_edit_date":1571755298,"question_id":58505664,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58505664","body_markdown":"I want to know if there&#39;s a way to use a c++ function inside a python code\r\n\r\nFor example, after doing my research I did find this solution using .dll file.\r\nBut It can&#39;t find the function \r\nMy code:\r\n\r\nfun.cpp:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    extern int add(int a, int b) {\r\n    return a+b;\r\n    }\r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!

Looking at the font declaration file for `freesans` for example, the `pnum` variant glyphs are not even included in the character width array.\r\n\r\nHowever, what you can do is copy the variant glyphs into the Unicode range with font forge and map the characters in the contexts you want to use them.  For instance, if you&#39;re not using the subscript numeral glyphs, they make good candidates as search appears to still find them in several of the PDF readers I tested.\r\n\r\nJust so I could have something to test, I ran a *similar* scenario: using Free Sans but wanting to use proportional figures in some places with the same font file. I opened the Free Sans font with FontForge, looked at the glyph info to see which variants were available for the zero glyph, used that to find the set of `pnum` glyphs, and then copied them over the subscript figures. (u2080 - u2089) The range is arbitrary, so if you&#39;re using these glyphs, there&#39;s the private use range for instance, though that destroys searchability without some extra steps.\r\n\r\nThen in TCPDF, simply ran a string replace on the alphanumeric strings I wanted to affect.\r\n\r\n    $pdf-&gt;writeHTMLCell(0, 0, &#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: freesansmod&quot;&gt;H90173A8301X5&lt;/span&gt;&#39;, 0, 1, 0, true, &#39;&#39;, true);\r\n\r\n    //I feel like there&#39;s a shorter way to write this...\r\n    $special_numbers = str_replace([&#39;0&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;3&#39;,&#39;4&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;6&#39;,&#39;7&#39;,&#39;8&#39;,&#39;9&#39;],\r\n    \t[&quot;\\u{2080}&quot;, &quot;\\u{2081}&quot;, &quot;\\u{2082}&quot;, &quot;\\u{2083}&quot;,\r\n             &quot;\\u{2084}&quot;, &quot;\\u{2085}&quot;, &quot;\\u{2086}&quot;, &quot;\\u{2087}&quot;,\r\n             &quot;\\u{2088}&quot;, &quot;\\u{2089}&quot;], &#39;H90173A8301X5&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    $pdf-&gt;writeHTMLCell(0, 0, &#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: freesansmod&quot;&gt;&#39;.$special_numbers.&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&#39;, 0, 1, 0, true, &#39;&#39;, true);\r\n\r\nThe result is still searchable, though copy-and-paste is a bit weird.

I haven&#39;t searched, but there may be pre-existing tools that can automatically do this for you. The content would fully retain its semantic meaning, and the code may be a bit cleaner, at the cost of embedding effectively two copies of the same font.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/omK9C.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58505628/can-i-use-old-style-non-lining-numerals-in-tcpdf/58530894#58530894","title":"Can I use &quot;old-style&quot; (non-lining) numerals in TCPDF?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7426,"user_id":209139,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/083585eca61df2e31aa5768fa62872aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"TRiG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209139/trig"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58530894,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571864605,"creation_date":1571751583,"question_id":58505628,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58505628","body_markdown":"Unicode does not distinguish between lining figures (which have the same proportions as capital letters, and are useful in tables, but stand out in running text) and non-lining figures, which look more like lowercase letters, with ascenders and descenders, as it considers them variants of each other. Many fonts, though, have both sets of digits, and provide a way to choose between them. Is there any way to achieve this in TCPDF?\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like numbered lists to use lining figures, and numbers in running text to use non-lining, and postcodes (British and Irish postcodes are alphanumeric) to use non-lining figures and small block capital numbers. This could be achieved in LaTeX with `\\oldstylenums{1234567890}`.\r\n\r\nThe only similar question I could find was about [tweaking font metrics in TCPDF to make non-lining figures look lining](https://stackoverflow.com/q/42201756/209139).
