Is `t2` perfectly safe and equivalent with `t1`?\r\n\r\nNo.  `std::aligned_storage` creates storage that is suitably aligned for the object being placed in it.  `std::byte buffer[sizeof(X)]` while

This normally will not have same alignment of the type you are placing in it since it has an alignment of `1`.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue as far as the C++ virtual machine is concerned, but in the real world this can cause sever performance penalties or even cause the program to crash.\r\n\r\nIf you want suitably aligned storage, &lt;strike&gt;use `std::aligned_storage`&lt;/strike&gt; see [Barry&#39;s answer][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58288603/4342498","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288225/can-stdbyte-replace-stdaligned-storage/58288283#58288283","title":"Can std::byte replace std::aligned_storage?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":201983,"user_id":2069064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4V2X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Barry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2069064/barry"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570545434,"creation_date":1570545434,"answer_id":58288603,"question_id":58288225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58288603","body_markdown":"&gt; Is `t2` perfectly safe and equivalent with `t1`?\r\n\r\nNo. In fact, both are bad.\r\n\r\n`t2` is bad for the reason [NathanOliver](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58288283/2069064) indicates: it&#39;s underaligned. You&#39;d need to write:\r\n\r\n    alignas(X) std::byte storage[sizeof(X)];\r\n\r\n`t1` also kind of has this problem, in that you almost certainly want to write `aligned_storage_t&lt;sizeof(X), alignof(X)&gt;` and not just `aligned_storage_t&lt;sizeof(X)&gt;`. If `X` were overaligned, you would lose that here. If `X` was just large but had no alignment requirement, you would end up with a relatively overaligned storage.\r\n\r\n`t1` is also bad for an especially peculiar reason: `aligned_storage` doesn&#39;t quite guarantee what you think it guarantees. In particular, it guarantees that an `X` can fit in `aligned_storage&lt;sizeof(X)&gt;`, but it does not guarantee that it can fit _exactly_. The [specification](http://eel.is/c++draft/meta.trans.other#lib:aligned_storage) is simply:\r\n\r\n&gt; The member typedef `type` shall be a trivial standard-layout type suitable for use as uninitialized storage for any object whose size is at most `Len` and whose alignment is a divisor of Align.\r\n\r\nThat is, `aligned_storage&lt;16&gt;::type` is guaranteed to be at least 16 bytes, but a conforming implementation could easily give you 32. Or 4K. That in addition to the problem of using `aligned_storage&lt;16&gt;` by accident instead of `aligned_storage_t&lt;16&gt;`.\r\n\r\nThis is why [P1413](https://wg21.link/p1413) exists as a paper: `aligned_storage` is kind of bad. \r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n\r\nSo the real answer is actually just to write something like libstdc++&#39;s [`__aligned_membuf`](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc++-v3/include/ext/aligned_buffer.h#L46-L78):\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    struct storage_for {\r\n        alignas(T) std::byte data[sizeof(T)];\r\n\r\n        // some useful constructors and stuff, probably some getter\r\n        // that gives you a T* or a T const*\r\n    };\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288225/can-stdbyte-replace-stdaligned-storage/58288603#58288603","title":"Can std::byte replace std::aligned_storage?"}],"owner":{"reputation":39172,"user_id":2805305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/442d249754d1725d9510cf06fa46b964?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bolov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2805305/bolov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39172,"user_id":2805305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/442d249754d1725d9510cf06fa46b964?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bolov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2805305/bolov"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58288603,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570547181,"creation_date":1570544285,"last_edit_date":1570546746,"question_id":58288225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288225","body_markdown":"C++17 introduced a new type, `std::byte`, so now we finally have a first-class citizen type to represent bytes in memory.

But then how would you make a pull request?\r\n\r\nPull requests are not a Git feature.  Instead, they are an add-on, provided by various web hosting providers such as Bitbucket and GitHub.  (Compare with the email messages from `git request-pull`; `git request-pull` *is* a Git feature.  You can run `git request-pull` locally.\r\n\r\nNote that because they are an add-on, each adder-on-er (is that an actual word?) may have a few tweaks of their own, that the other doesn&#39;t, but there&#39;s something pretty common here:  A GitHub pull request can only be created using the GitHub web site.  Unless you can write directly to the original GitHub repository, this requires creating a GitHub fork.  A Bitbucket pull request can only be created using the Bitbucket web site.  Unless you can write directly to the original Bitbucket repository, this requires creating a Bitbucket fork.\r\n\r\nAssuming this pattern holds for GitLab—I have not used GitLab and can&#39;t say for sure, but it seems awfully likely—that would explain why you have to create a GitLab fork.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288217/difference-between-clone-remote-repo-directly-and-fork-remote-repo-first/58290282#58290282","title":"Difference between clone remote repo directly and fork remote repo first"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":7449411,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8361ca720b7982c25247952ab63c0dea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Anthony.Wang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7449411/anthony-wang"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64598,"user_id":1755598,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/S6a50.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CodeWizard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1755598/codewizard"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570551375,"creation_date":1570544248,"last_edit_date":1570549072,"question_id":58288217,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288217","body_markdown":"I work for another project lately, including about 15 developers.   \r\nWe use GitLab as our source control server. \r\n\r\nWhat confused me is that we fork the original remote repo first, then clone the forked repo to local repo. \r\n\r\nWhen we want to push some code, we push code to our own remote repo, then make a merge request to the original remote repo. \r\n\r\nWhy not just clone the remote repo to local repo directly?   \r\nI think a feature branch can also work.

It does not have a normal operator which it maps to (the way &quot;LIKE&quot; maps to &quot;~~&quot;), which is probably why it does not work.  Rather, it seems to be more like a macro, which gets rewritten in terms of POSIX regular expressions.\r\n\r\n    explain SELECT * from pgbench_accounts where filler similar to &#39;%(fish|bear)%&#39;;\r\n                                         QUERY PLAN                                     \r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     Gather  (cost=1000.00..45517.52 rows=1 width=97)\r\n       Workers Planned: 2\r\n       -&gt;  Parallel Seq Scan on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.00..44517.42 rows=1 width=97)\r\n             Filter: (filler ~ &#39;^(?:.*(?:fish|bear).*)$&#39;::text)\r\n\r\nSee how the filter says it uses &quot;~&quot;, and the string itself has been modified?\r\n\r\nSo one answer would be to use POSIX regular expressions in the first place, rather than SIMILAR TO.

Otherwise a fast\r\n&gt; case insensitive string lookup is used that may alter the case and\r\n&gt; white space of some methods/headers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288166/jetty-charset-utf-8-vs-charset-utf-8/58288697#58288697","title":"Jetty charset utf-8 vs charset UTF-8"}],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":3046582,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc9981f61e67eaeb00fdbadca735bc96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3046582","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3046582/user3046582"},"last_editor":{"reputation":61,"user_id":3046582,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc9981f61e67eaeb00fdbadca735bc96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3046582","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3046582/user3046582"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58288697,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570551646,"creation_date":1570544016,"last_edit_date":1570549587,"question_id":58288166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288166","body_markdown":"I am using a Spring-Web application using jetty:\r\n```XML\r\n&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n        &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n    &lt;/exclusions&gt;\r\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-jetty&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\nAssume this http endpoint:\r\n```java\r\n@RestController\r\npublic class ExampleController {\r\n\r\n  @GetMapping(value = &quot;/example&quot;, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE)\r\n  public ExampleResponse example() {\r\n      return new ExampleResponse();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static class ExampleResponse {\r\n      private String dummy = &quot;example&quot;;\r\n\r\n      public String getDummy() {\r\n          return dummy;\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand curl against the Endpoint and inspect the header `curl -v localhost:8080/example`:\r\n~~~\r\n* Trying 127.0.0.1...\r\n* TCP_NODELAY set\r\n* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)\r\n&gt; GET /example HTTP/1.1\r\n&gt; Host: localhost:8080\r\n&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.58.0\r\n&gt; Accept: */*\r\n&gt; \r\n&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n&lt; Date: Tue, 08 Oct 2019 13:52:10 GMT\r\n&lt; Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8\r\n&lt; Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n&lt; \r\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n**Notice** the `charset=**utf-8**` in the response header, but I am setting the header via the annotation `produces=MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE` to the value `application/json;charset=UTF-8`.

The problem is that this file must be owned by the munge user and have owner-read-only permissions, &#39;0400&#39;. The directory it&#39;s in must be owned by munge and have permissions &#39;0700&#39;.\r\n\r\nThe ansible task structure below works for other files with more permissive &#39;0644&#39; permissions, and even sets owner/group/permissions successfully, but fails for this file:\r\n\r\n    - name: Copy munge key\r\n      copy:\r\n        src: /etc/munge/munge.key\r\n        dest: /etc/munge/munge.key\r\n        owner: munge\r\n        group: munge\r\n        mode: &#39;0400&#39;\r\n\r\nIs there a way to &#39;become root or munge&#39; both locally and remotely to copy the file? Or is there another simple solution to this problem?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI have tried &lt;code&gt;become: yes&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;become_user: root&lt;/code&gt; and separately with &lt;code&gt;become_user: munge&lt;/code&gt;. Neither worked. It fails with the error &lt;code&gt;&quot;Could not find or access &#39;/etc/munge/munge.key&#39;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; each time. The file is there, but both /etc/munge and /etc/munge/munge.key have permissions only for the munge user.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2:\r\n\r\nMy hackish long-winded solution consists of five tasks that 1. Free up permissions on the source file and directory; 2. Free up permissions on remote file and directory; 3. Copy the file; 4. Lock up remote file and directory permissions; 5.

reason it can&#39;t find it is because users.json is not being served up anywhere. It is simply a file. In order to use ``fetch`` it needs to be hitting some type of endpoint (endpoint is a location that is hosted on a server i.e. examplesite.com/aboutme --&gt; about me is the endpoint hosted on the website examplesite.com). \r\n\r\nYou should either run a server using express that will allow you to host that file and utilize it like an API endpoint. Or, you can manually edit the file. React has a good library for this called [edit-json-file][1]. It seems pretty straight forward to use, you can edit the file locally, AND you don&#39;t have to create an API or additional server.\r\n\r\nSo, quick answer: if you&#39;re just worrying about editing the file, edit it manually rather than hosting it on a server. But, if you want that experience and want to learn how to host an API, use express and host it there. Then, fetch the endpoint and execute the POST request like you&#39;ve done in your code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/edit-json-file","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288138/how-can-i-fix-the-error-post-http-localhost3000-users-json-404-not-found-on/58291196#58291196","title":"How can i fix the error POST http://localhost:3000/users.json 404 (Not Found) on reactjs?"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11590574,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2863836456966351/picture?type=large","display_name":"Telmo Pina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11590574/telmo-pina"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11590574,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2863836456966351/picture?type=large","display_name":"Telmo Pina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11590574/telmo-pina"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58291196,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570555323,"creation_date":1570543943,"last_edit_date":1570544762,"question_id":58288138,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288138","body_markdown":"Basically i have a json file named users.json.

= &#39;0123456789&#39;**\r\n\r\nThe index can be read as &quot;from where (inclusive)&quot;:&quot;to where (exclusive)&quot;:&quot;step size&quot;. Negative elements in the first two sections imply a `+ len(...)`, so something like `w[len(w)-2:-1:-1]` is equivalent to `w[-2:-1:-1]` or `w[-2:len(w)-1:-1]`.\r\n\r\nGiven `len(w) == 10`, `w[len(w)-2:-1:-1]` means `w[8:9:-1]`. This is obviously empty, since you can&#39;t get from 8 to 9 going backwards.\r\n\r\n`w[-2:-2:-1]` is empty for the same reason (just as `w[2:2]` would be, for example).\r\n\r\n`w[len(w)-2:-3:-1]` is `w[8:7:-1]`, which is just a single character, `&#39;8&#39;`, as expected. Similar reasoning for `w[len(w)-2:-4:-1]` mapping to `w[8:6:-1]`.\r\n\r\n**w = &#39;a&#39;**\r\n\r\nTo explain `w[len(w)-2::-1]`, you need one more piece of information: an empty start or stop index means &quot;the limit in the appropriate direction, including the sign of the step size&quot;. So a missing stop index with a step of `-1` means &quot;past the beginning of the sequence&quot;. Also, keep in mind that `len(w)-2` is `-1` in this case. So you have `w[-1::-1]`, which means go from the last element to the beginning backwards, i.e., `&#39;a&#39;`.\r\n\r\n`w[len(w)-2:-2:-1]` is simple if you keep track of indices as well: `w[-1:-2:-1]` is pretty much exactly equivalent to `1[-1::-1]` when the length is 1.\r\n\r\nThe larger negative stop indices should be straightforward. There are no elements past the beginning of the string, so the result is always just `&#39;a&#39;`.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d see more expected results if your start index was `len(w)-3` or so, since in this case the `len(w)` just confuses the issue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288120/reversing-string-of-length-1-has-some-weirdness/58288436#58288436","title":"Reversing string of length 1 has some weirdness"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11040804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxYMb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11040804/pera"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11443,"user_id":1466970,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kGMwA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Richard Chambers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466970/richard-chambers"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1570544937,"accepted_answer_id":58288436,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570564540,"creation_date":1570543882,"last_edit_date":1570544511,"question_id":58288120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288120","body_markdown":"I am reversing a string in python though I don&#39;t want to reverse the complete string.

You need to tell to the PowerShell to treat this string as an expression. \r\nTo do so you need to use the `&amp;` symbol in front, putting the statement, that you would like to execute in round brackets. \r\nSame behaviour could be observed, when you try to launch a file from a location that contains white space.

All non-null columns are relatively easy to get with a query like this:\r\n\r\n    select\r\n        case when count(distinct first_name) = 1 then max(first_name) end as first_name,\r\n        case when count(distinct last_name) = 1 then max(last_name) end as last_name,\r\n        case when count(distinct city) = 1 then max(city) end as city\r\n    from ...\r\n    for json path, without_array_wrapper\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    select\r\n        case when max(first_name) = min(first_name) then max(first_name) end as first_name,\r\n        case when max(last_name) = min(last_name) then max(last_name) end as last_name,\r\n        case when max(city) = min(city) then max(city) end as city\r\n    from ...\r\n    for json path, without_array_wrapper\r\n\r\nThe result of the queries above is json like this `{&quot;first_name&quot;:&quot;John&quot;}`. But then there are problems with nulls. Problem **(1)** - queries above do not take nulls into account, so if I have data like this\r\n\r\n    first_name    last_name     city\r\n    ----------------------------------\r\n    John          Lennon        null\r\n    John          Lennon        null\r\n    John          null          null\r\n    \r\nThen last name is also included in the resulting json \r\n\r\n    { &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Lennon&quot; }\r\n\r\nOk, that&#39;s understandable (cause `...Null value is eliminated by an aggregate...`) and I can solve it with a query like this:\r\n\r\n    select\r\n        case when count(distinct first_name) = 1 and count(first_name) = count(*) then max(first_name) end as first_name,\r\n        case when count(distinct last_name) = 1 and count(last_name) = count(*) then max(last_name) end as last_name,\r\n        case when count(distinct city) = 1 and count(city) = count(*) then max(city) end as city\r\n    from ...\r\n    for json path, without_array_wrapper\r\n\r\nBut there are other problems with nulls I can&#39;t really solve neatly for now. Problem **(2)** - I want to have also `&quot;city&quot;:null` in my json. Of course I can do something like this\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    case when count(city) = 0 then &#39;null&#39; end as city\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nand then replace string `null` with real nulls, but it&#39;s not very neat. Another annoying thing is (**3**) - I&#39;d really like to get rid of warnings \r\n\r\n&gt; Warning: Null value is eliminated by an aggregate or other SET operation.\r\n\r\nwithout turning `ANSI_WARNINGS` off. For now I can only think about using some placeholders with `isnull` which doesn&#39;t look like a clean solution\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    case when count(distinct isnull(city, &#39;null&#39;)) = 1 then max(city) end as city\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nSo, any ideas on how to elegantly solve problems (**2**) and (**3**)? see examples in [`db&lt;&gt;fiddle`](https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=sqlserver_2017&amp;fiddle=2c79f0df2f10a72174865a512197ef1a).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288057/sql-server-aggregate-if-only-one-distinct-value-nulls-without-ansi-warnings","title":"SQL Server - aggregate if only one distinct value + nulls without ansi warnings"},{"tags":["hive","superset"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12182723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f185c034b05e6603b47de0429244f8f6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"oguz_eren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182723/oguz-eren"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570543675,"creation_date":1570543675,"question_id":58288054,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288054","body_markdown":"I can connect to HIVE using sqlalchemy without any issues :\r\n\r\n    oguz@dikanka:~$ python\r\n    Python 2.7.15+ (default, Jul  9 2019, 16:51:35)\r\n    [GCC 7.4.0] on linux2\r\n    Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from sqlalchemy import create_engine\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; engine = create_engine(&#39;hive://dikanka:10000&#39;)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; result = engine.execute(&quot;select movieid from default.ratings&quot;)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; result.first();\r\n    (242,)\r\n\r\nBut when I try to connect Superset to Hive, I receive the following error :\r\n\r\n    ERROR: {&quot;error&quot;: &quot;Connection failed!\\n\\nThe error message returned was:\\nCan&#39;t load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:hive&quot;}\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails are as follows :\r\n\r\nI have a single-node HDP-3.1.4.0 setup on my laptop.\r\nI have the following services up and running : HDFS 3.1.1, Hive 3.1.0, Zookeeper 3.4.6, Superset 0.23.0\r\n\r\nPython version is Python 2.7.15+.\r\n\r\nHive command line interface works smoothly.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve installed the following python modules :\r\n\r\n    pip install thrift\r\n    sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev\r\n    pip install sasl\r\n    pip install thrift_sasl\r\n    pip install pyhive\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I have a KUbuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\nOn Superset, I try to add a database named &quot;default&quot;, and I set the SQLAlchemy URI to \r\n\r\n    hive://dikanka:10000\r\nwhich is exactly the same URI I used with create_engine above.\r\n\r\nThen I click &quot;Test Connection&quot;, with all default values for the rest of the form.\r\n\r\nI get the error as mentioned above.[Here is a screenshot][1]\r\n\r\nHope somebody out there can help me fix this.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZTYE.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288054/superset-hive-connection-issue","title":"Superset - Hive Connection Issue"},{"tags":["excel","vba","macos"],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":10508937,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3112d44576ab4ab57e82b79d637f64c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"PhilNBlanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10508937/philnblanks"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570543668,"creation_date":1570543668,"question_id":58288053,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288053","body_markdown":"In Excel for Mac If I minimize the workbook when working in the VBA editor I cannot get the workbook to maximize again without minimizing the editor.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following:\r\n1.

cause is pretty straightforward: The entity `JobExecution` has a list of `StepExecution`s and `StepExecution` has a backreference to `JobExecution`, which is cyclic, which causes Jackson to throw this ugly error.\r\n\r\nThe recommended solution to this problem seems to be to annotate the classes to be serialized with Jackson annotations (`@JsonManagedReference` and `@JsonBackReference`). But that is not possible in this context, as the offending classes are Spring Batch&#39;s.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to configure another `ExecutionContextSerializer`, i.e. the `XStreamExecutionContextStringSerializer`. This solution works for me, but the `XStreamExecutionContextStringSerializer` class is deprecated and I&#39;d rather not use that one.\r\n\r\nOther people (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49625231/migration-to-spring-boot-2-and-using-spring-batch-4) have the reverse problem: In their case the *de*serialization of the persisted execution context fails because it was written by XStream and now can not be read by Jackson. But in my case, the serialization fails, so this is not a compatibility issue between XStream and Jackson.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288040/spring-batch-serialization-problem-when-using-jackson","title":"Spring Batch serialization problem when using

The email i am sending is part of a workflow and should come from a generic account, not a user account. \r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288021/o365-send-as-another-user-via-graph-api","title":"O365 Send as another user via graph api"},{"tags":["excel","vba"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4303,"user_id":8260484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35e7d5435c75864734b3ef3bcbc271e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cybernetic.nomad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8260484/cybernetic-nomad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570544871,"post_id":58288015,"comment_id":102941543,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288015/csv-file-export#comment102941543_58288015"},{"owner":{"reputation":5533,"user_id":4717755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehiyK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PeterT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4717755/petert"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570544924,"post_id":58288015,"comment_id":102941577,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288015/csv-file-export#comment102941577_58288015"},{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11773981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OnGEDcvsbgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf1AuAjXZZ7RXVh88t_z7a9cEec1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"khyati dedhia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11773981/khyati-dedhia"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570545500,"post_id":58288015,"comment_id":102941906,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288015/csv-file-export#comment102941906_58288015"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11773981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OnGEDcvsbgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf1AuAjXZZ7RXVh88t_z7a9cEec1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"khyati dedhia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11773981/khyati-dedhia"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570543509,"creation_date":1570543509,"question_id":58288015,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288015","body_markdown":"I wanted to get multiple txt file into single sheet, I have tried below code but it is not coping data below exiting data in the sheet.\r\n\r\ndata is over writing existing data.\r\n\r\n    Sub QueryImportText()\r\n        Dim sPath As String, sName As String\r\n        Dim LR As Long, qt As QueryTable\r\n        \r\n        sPath = &quot;F:\\WIN7PROFILE\\Desktop\\New folder\\&quot;\r\n        sName = Dir(sPath &amp;

language-all: lang-c# --&gt;\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned in the comments just make it event driven.\r\n\r\nI would even go a little further and you could directly tell the `MessageBox` what to do when is &quot;done&quot; like\r\n\r\n    public enum MessageBoxResponse\r\n    {\r\n        Confirmed,\r\n        Declined,\r\n        Canceled\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class MessageBox\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        // You can give the Action any parameter you like e.g.\r\n        public Action&lt;MessageBoxResponse&gt; done;\r\n\r\n        // Additional flag inncase you still want to use it in routines\r\n        public bool IsDone { get; private set; }\r\n\r\n        public MessageBox(string msg, Action&lt;MessageBoxResponse&gt; onDone)\r\n        {\r\n            IsDone = false;\r\n\r\n            var obj = (GameObject)MonoBehaviour.Instantiate(Resources.Load(@&quot;MsgBox&quot;));\r\n         \r\n            obj.GetComponentInChildren&lt;Text&gt;(true).text = msg;\r\n\r\n            // Now this will simply tell the Button to call SetDone\r\n            // (As this is added on runtime it won&#39;t appear in the Inspector)\r\n            obj.GetComponentInChildren&lt;Button&gt;(true).onClick.AddListener(Confirm);\r\n\r\n            done += onDone;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private void Confirm()\r\n        {\r\n            SetDone(MessageBoxResponse.Confirmed);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private void SetDone(MessageBoxResponse response)\r\n        {\r\n            if(IsDone) return;\r\n\r\n            IsDone = true;\r\n\r\n            done?.Invoke(response);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen when creating the box you can directly pass in the callback either as lambda expression\r\n\r\n    var msgBox = new MessageBox(&quot;example&quot;, response =&gt; \r\n        {\r\n            Debug.Log(&quot;Done with response &quot; + response);\r\n        }\r\n    );\r\n\r\nOr the same as method call\r\n\r\n    var msgBox = new MessageBox(&quot;example&quot;, OnMessageDone);\r\n\r\n    private void OnMessageDone(MessageBoxResponse response)\r\n    {\r\n        Debug.Log(&quot;Done with response&quot; + response);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd you can also add callbacks afterwards using\r\n\r\n    msgBox.done += OnMessageDone;\r\n    // Or lambda\r\n    msgBox.done += response =&gt; { Debug.Log(&quot;Done with response &quot; + response); };\r\n\r\nWhen the button is clicked the `MessageBox` itself will automatically call `SetDone` and invoke all listeners without the need for any routine waiting for it.\r\n\r\nIn case you still want to use it also to stall a routine anyway you can use the \r\n\r\n    yield return new WaitUntil (() =&gt; msgBox.IsDone);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288009/unity-waituntil-in-a-self-made-message-box-class/58289240#58289240","title":"Unity, WaitUntil in a self-made message box

The Spring MVC 5.2.0.RELEASE framework throws `org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageNotWritableException` during serialization of the `EntityModel` created by the `@RestController`.  The `EntityModel` is assembled using a [SimpleIdentifiableRepresentationModelAssembler](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas-examples/blob/master/commons/src/main/java/org/springframework/hateoas/SimpleIdentifiableRepresentationModelAssembler.java) sub-class.\r\n\r\nMapping the Avro objects to POJOs before passing them to the representation model assembler works as expected during serialization, but duplicating the domain model won&#39;t scale for this application in the long run.  I&#39;ve read about [custom media types](https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.0.0.RELEASE/reference/html/#mediatypes.custom) and I could probably do something like this for, say, `application/hal+avro+json`, but that&#39;s a deep rabbit hole to go down for a set of objects that, outside of the representation model, are easily serialized to simple JSON.  Especially since REST clients don&#39;t actually need the Avro schema embedded in these objects... yet.

The website is actually implemented as a collection of webservers, were webserver is owned by a different team.
