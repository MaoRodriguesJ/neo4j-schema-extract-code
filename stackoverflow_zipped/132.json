That also makes it easier to write an answer, because I can create simple artificial cases without having to put them in a ROOT file and read them back with uproot.\r\n\r\nHere are some artificial `jetpt` and `jeteta` jagged arrays:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import awkward\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jetpt = awkward.fromiter([[0.0, 1.1, 2.2], [3.3], [4.4, 5.5], [6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9]])\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jeteta = awkward.fromiter([[0.1, -1.2, 0.8], [1.2], [-0.8, 0.8], [0.2, -0.3, 0.9, 0.0]])\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jetpt, jeteta\r\n```\r\n```\r\n(&lt;JaggedArray [[0.0 1.1 2.2] [3.3] [4.4 5.5] [6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9]] at 0x7c2c9e9950b8&gt;,\r\n &lt;JaggedArray [[0.1 -1.2 0.8] [1.2] [-0.8 0.8] [0.2 -0.3 0.9 0.0]] at 0x7c2c9dfb9320&gt;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key thing about these two jagged arrays is that they have the same number of inner array elements per inner array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jetpt.counts, jeteta.counts\r\n```\r\n```\r\n(array([3, 1, 2, 4]),\r\n array([3, 1, 2, 4]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is still true when we perform mathematical operations on the arrays, such as inequality comparisons. (Note that we have to use bitwise operators for and/or/not because these are the only ones Numpy can overload. You also need parentheses because of the order of operations with bitwise operations.)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (-1.0 &lt; jeteta) &amp; (jeteta &lt; 1.0)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n&lt;JaggedArray [[True False True] [False] [True True] [True True True True]] at 0x7c2c9dfb9b38&gt;\r\n```\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ((-1.0 &lt; jeteta) &amp; (jeteta &lt; 1.0)).counts\r\n```\r\n```\r\narray([3, 1, 2, 4])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince these boolean arrays have the same number of counts as `jetpt`, you can use them as an index on `jetpt` or any other jet variable. You can&#39;t use them as an index on `muonpt`, etc., because in general, there&#39;s a different number of muons per event than jets per event. (There&#39;s a lot more about this in the &quot;03-columnar-data-analysis&quot; notebook in [this tutorial](https://github.com/jpivarski/2019-07-29-dpf-python#readme).)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jetpt[(-1.0 &lt; jeteta) &amp; (jeteta &lt; 1.0)]\r\n```\r\n```\r\n&lt;JaggedArray [[0.0 2.2] [] [4.4 5.5] [6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9]] at 0x7c2ca88f8550&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour second question was about truncating to at most three jets. This is a simple slice, but one that applies to the second dimension. I&#39;ll apply it to the example above—it needs to be a separate square bracket, and often you&#39;d assign the above to a variable if you think that makes it easier to read.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jetpt[(-1.0 &lt; jeteta) &amp; (jeteta &lt; 1.0)][:, :3]\r\n```\r\n```\r\n&lt;JaggedArray [[0.0 2.2] [] [4.4 5.5] [6.6 7.7 8.8]] at 0x7c2c9dfdb4a8&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [the awkward README](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array#readme) for a lot more!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58503117/may-i-see-a-short-example-of-cutting-on-data-to-prepare-it-for-histogramming-in/58504068#58504068","title":"May I see a short example of cutting on data to prepare it for histogramming in uproot?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12255981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cCC7I.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Todd Huffman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12255981/todd-huffman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2716,"user_id":1623645,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WqHHL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jim Pivarski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1623645/jim-pivarski"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571746520,"creation_date":1571743199,"last_edit_date":1571745669,"question_id":58503117,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58503117","body_markdown":"I have am using Python 3.6.5 (or higher) and I have successfully installed &#39;numpy&#39;, &#39;uproot&#39;, and &#39;awkward&#39;. I have a previously made *.root file with a jagged NTuple which contains quite a large number of branches. This is particle physics data and so one can think of the &quot;rows&quot; as individual collisions or &quot;events&quot; while the columns have the data structures. (And some of the columns might have a third dimension or more...I&#39;ll explain in a bit.)\r\n\r\nIn this case I have events where there are many &quot;Jets&quot; in the events and each &quot;jet&quot; has a lot of information about it. \r\n\r\njet_E, jet_pT, jet_eta, jet_phi, Numb (number of b tags), NLayer0 etc. \r\n\r\nEach &quot;event&quot; could have any number of jets, but it is impossible for it to have zero jets in this case. Each of these jets will have this information stored, but all information from one &quot;event&quot; must be kept uncorrelated with any other &quot;event&quot;. (If you already know Particle physics this part is probably already understood.) \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been reading the uproot documentation and examples and I cannot see easily how one would, using only pythonic code like this, histogram the jet_pT but only for jets within the events where some OTHER jet variable is being cut upon. eta, for example. \r\n\r\nHow do I extract only the information from the *.root file about all the jet_pT for those jets with jet_eta&gt;-1.0 and jet_eta&lt;1.0 ?

( i have removed all the other code for the other tables)\r\n\r\nThe txt files can be found here: http://www.pbs.gov.au/downloads/2019/10/2019-10-01-extracts-down-converted.zip  \r\n  \r\n\r\n    from numpy import genfromtxt\r\n    from time import time\r\n    from datetime import datetime\r\n    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Float, Date, String, ForeignKey, \r\n    Numeric, Table, Text\r\n    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\r\n    from sqlalchemy import create_engine\r\n    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship\r\n    import sqlalchemy\r\n\r\n    def Load_Data_tab(file_name):\r\n        data = genfromtxt(file_name, dtype=&#39;unicode&#39;, delimiter = &quot;\\t&quot;, \r\n    skip_header=False, converters={0: lambda s: str(s)})\r\n        return data.tolist()\r\n\r\n    Base = declarative_base()\r\n\r\n    fN_Restriction = &quot;RestrictionExtract_191001.txt&quot;\r\n\r\n    class Restrictions(Base):\r\n        __tablename__ = &#39;restrict&#39;\r\n        IndicatId1 = Column(Text, primary_key=True)\r\n        RestrictIndicatText = Column(Text)\r\n        MiscRestrictFlag = Column(Integer)\r\n        DateRequireFlag = Column(String(1))\r\n        TextRequireFlag = Column(String(1))\r\n        TreatmentPhase = Column(Text)\r\n        TreatmentCriteria = Column(Text)\r\n        ClinicalCriteria = Column(Text)\r\n        PopulationCriteria = Column(Text)\r\n\r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n\r\n        #Create the database\r\n        engine = create_engine(&#39;sqlite:///csv_test.db&#39;)\r\n        Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\r\n\r\n        #Create the session\r\n        session = sessionmaker()\r\n        session.configure(bind=engine)\r\n        s = session()\r\n\r\n     # Build Restriction Table\r\n        try:\r\n            data = Load_Data_tab(fN_Restriction)  \r\n            for i in data:\r\n                ChopString = i[1]\r\n                TP = ChopString.find(&#39;Treatment Phase:&#39;) \r\n                CC = ChopString.find(&#39;Clinical criteria:&#39;)\r\n                PC = ChopString.find(&#39;Population criteria:&#39;)\r\n                TC = ChopString.find(&#39;Treatment criteria:&#39;)\r\n                if TP = 0:\r\n                    if CC = 0:\r\n                        if PC = 0:\r\n                            if TC = 0:\r\n                                RestrictIndicatText1 = i[1]\r\n                            else:\r\n                                RestrictIndicatText1 = &quot;&quot;\r\n                if TP &gt;

Recently I noticed some strange behavior when using multi display setup with different scaling on each display. Newly opened popups (i.e. context menu and combobox content popup) are misplaced. \r\n\r\nThe primary screen is defining the coordinate system and the other display to the left get negative coordinates. (see image below)\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/FIu4R.png\r\n\r\n\r\nThe top left coordinate of display 1 should be the same as the top right coordinate of display 2. But this is not the case. \r\n\r\n[-1536,771] vs [-1920,964] for AWT and [-1920,443] vs [-1920,443] for javafx\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tracked the issue down to the awt-Win32GraphicsConfig getBounds method. As far as I understand the scaling for screen 1 (left display) is done on the absolute value for x/y. This results in the assumption that the next screen is working with the same scaling. \r\n\r\ntop left x value: -3840 (plattform x) / 1.25 (scaling factor) = -3072 \r\n\r\nwith this x value and the width of 1536 we end up in the coordinate system of display 2 [-1920 to 0]\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n * Class:     sun_awt_Win32GraphicsConfig\r\n * Method:    getBounds\r\n * Signature:

overwrite your table using `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE`:\r\n\r\n```lang-sql\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE your_table AS\r\nPARTITION BY DATE(date_register) \r\nSELECT\r\n  * EXCEPT(row_number)\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT\r\n    *,\r\n    ROW_NUMBER()\r\n          OVER (PARTITION BY id, date_register) row_number\r\n  FROM your_table)\r\nWHERE\r\n  row_number = 1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don&#180;t have a partition field defined at the source, I recommend that you create a new table with the partition field to make this query work so that you can automate the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

believe the problem is the fact that you have the `label_it()` function append a result to the `return_stuff_classifier` list each time it is executed and then returns the entire list — resulting in a return value that has accumulated the results of previous calls. The number of times this occurs is controlled by the `chunksize`.\r\n\r\nFortunately that&#39;s easy to fix — just return the tuple you were appending to to the list. If you do that, there&#39;s no longer a need to have the list at all.\r\n\r\nNote I had to added an `if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:` guard to the code so it would work on my computer running Windows because child processes are created differently on it than they are on unix-like OSs. It should still work on them, so doing so it portable. The need to do this is in the documentation in a subsection titled _Safe importing of main module_ in the `multiprocessing` module&#39;s [Programming guidelines](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#programming-guidelines).\r\n\r\nAnother change made was to move the `get()` call to after the `pool_class.join()`, because by then all the child processes have end. Doing it wasn&#39;t required in this case because the main process had effectively nothing further to do, but it&#39;s the canonical way to retrieve results from `map_async()` — probably because it allows the main process to concurrently perform other tasks. \r\n```\r\nimport multiprocessing as mp\r\nfrom pprint import pprint\r\n\r\ncropped_images = [f&#39;./image_directory_path/frame_{i}.jpg&#39; for i in range(1, 25)]\r\n#return_stuff_classifier = []  # No longer needed.\r\n\r\ndef label_it(image_path):\r\n    file_name = image_path\r\n    image_name = image_path.split(&#39;/&#39;)[-1]\r\n    frame_id = image_name.split(&#39;_&#39;)[0]\r\n    object_id = image_name.split(&#39;_&#39;)[1].split(&#39;.&#39;)[0]\r\n    label = &quot;gt&quot;\r\n    result = &quot;0.86&quot; # Here I have explicitly mentioned this, not to go through the\r\n                    # classifier model prediction\r\n\r\n#    return_stuff_classifier.append((frame_id, object_id, label, result))\r\n#    return return_stuff_classifier\r\n\r\n    return (frame_id, object_id, label, result)  # Just return the results.\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n    def multiprocessor():\r\n        m_class = mp.Manager()\r\n        queue_class = m_class.Queue()\r\n        pool_class = mp.Pool(8)\r\n        final_results = []\r\n\r\n        # Here cropped_image_no == 24 -&gt; chunk_size_class=3\r\n        chunk_size_class = round(len(cropped_images) / 8)\r\n        print(f&#39;{chunk_size_class=}&#39;)\r\n\r\n        results_class = pool_class.map_async(label_it, cropped_images, chunk_size_class)\r\n        # label_it is the method to be multiprocessed\r\n        # cropped_images is the list of all image paths to be multiprocessed\r\n\r\n        pool_class.close()\r\n        pool_class.join()\r\n        final_results.append(results_class.get())\r\n\r\n        pprint(final_results)\r\n\r\n    multiprocessor()\r\n```\r\nHere&#39;s what prints showing there are now no repetitions:\r\n```none\r\nchunk_size_class=3\r\n[[(&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;10&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;11&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;12&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;13&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;14&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;15&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;16&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;17&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;18&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;19&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;20&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;21&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;22&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;23&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;),\r\n  (&#39;frame&#39;, &#39;24&#39;, &#39;gt&#39;, &#39;0.86&#39;)]]\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58503033/how-to-fix-the-repetitive-outputs-from-multiprocessing-a-method/58511306#58511306","title":"How to fix the repetitive outputs from multiprocessing a method?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7034352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45abd7bc88fce0df3480fd0f7c22afac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"em_bis_me","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7034352/em-bis-me"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77038,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58511306,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571782518,"creation_date":1571742914,"last_edit_date":1571769243,"question_id":58503033,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58503033","body_markdown":"I am trying to run a Classifier model on top of an OD Model (used for localizing objects).

Now I was wondering: how do you guys &quot;deal with that&quot; in terms of safety? Is it possible for an image to contain malicious content? Of course, there are the &quot;unwanted&quot; pixels, like porn or something. But that&#39;s not what I mean now. I mean images which &quot;break&quot; machines while they are being decoded, etc. I already saw this: [How can a virus exist in an image][1].\r\n\r\nBasically I was planning to do this:\r\n\r\n - Create a DMZ\r\n - Store the assets in a bucket (we use GCP here) which lives inside the DMZ\r\n - Then apply &quot;malicious code&quot;-detection on the file\r\n - If it turns out to be fine... then move the asset into the &quot;real&quot; landscape (the non-dmz)\r\n\r\nNow the 3rd part... what can I do here?\r\n\r\n**Applying a virus scanner**\r\nNo problem with this, there are a lot of options here. Simple approach and good chance that viruses are being caught.\r\n\r\n**Do mime-type detection**\r\nBased on the first few bytes, I do a mime type detection. For example, if someone sends us a &quot;image.jpg&quot; but in fact its an executable, then we would detect this. Right? Is this safe enough? I was thinking about [this package][2].\r\n\r\n**What else???**\r\nNow... what else can I do? How do other big companies do this? I&#39;m not really looking for answers in terms of orchestration, etc. I know how to use a DMZ, link it all together with a few pubsub topics, etc. I&#39;m purely interested in what techniques to apply to really find out that an incoming asset is &quot;safe&quot;.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9675941/how-can-a-virus-exist-in-an-image#\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58503030/how-to-deal-with-user-input-files-images-video","title":"How to deal with user input files (images / video)?"},{"tags":["clover"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11732698,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-p5r2cK4n_bk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFqk/zlRqNmVDAtY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raviraj Raikar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11732698/raviraj-raikar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571742875,"creation_date":1571742875,"question_id":58503027,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58503027","body_markdown":"I have two separate micro-services/application.

this is expected behaviour. As a general rule, Scala&#39;s collection `map` methods try to make the output collection the same type as the collection on which the method is called.\r\n\r\nSo, for `Map.map`, the output collection _can_ be a `Map` whenever the result type of the function you pass to `map` is a `Tuple`. This is precisely the case when you call `val b = a.map(_._1)`. At this point, another rule comes into play: a `Map`&#39;s keys must be unique. So, as Scala traverses `a` during the call to `a.map(_._1)`, it inserts the result of `_._1` into the new map that it&#39;s building (to become `b`). The second entry replaces the first, and the fourth entry replaces the third, because they have the same key.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the behaviour you want, you should be able to get round it by decalring the type of `b` to be something other than a `Map`.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```scala\r\nval b: Seq[(String, String)] = a.map(_._1)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502958/tuple-keys-of-a-map-are-converted-to-another-map-when-using-map-function-to-retr/58503615#58503615","title":"Tuple keys of a map are converted to another map when using map function to retrieve the keys"}],"owner":{"reputation":100,"user_id":3486078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ARYU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"K_Augus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3486078/k-augus"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58503615,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571748718,"creation_date":1571742690,"question_id":58502958,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502958","body_markdown":"When I ran the following piece of code, I got some unexpected result\r\n```scala\r\n\r\nval a = Map(\r\n  (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;) -&gt; 1,\r\n  (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;4&quot;) -&gt; 2,\r\n  (&quot;2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;) -&gt; 3,\r\n  (&quot;2&quot;, &quot;4&quot;) -&gt; 4\r\n)\r\nprintln(a.size)\r\nval b = a.map(_._1)\r\nprintln(b.size)\r\nval c = a.keySet\r\nprintln(c.size)\r\n```\r\nThe result is:\r\n```\r\nres0: Int = 4\r\nb: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,String] = Map(1 -&gt; 4, 2 -&gt; 4)\r\nres1: Int = 2\r\nc: scala.collection.immutable.Set[(String, String)] = Set((1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4))\r\nres2: Int = 4\r\n```\r\nWhat I expected is the content of b is the same as that of c.

Depending on what your named range `Num` entitles (single cell or (discontinues) range) the behaviour will differ.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that you are trying to use an indirect cell reference that sits in `num` being a single cell.

Switch to a **statement-level trigger** (instead of the row-level you currently use) as it fires once per statement, regardless number of rows affected.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502926/didnt-send-mail-html-body-in-plsql/58503537#58503537","title":"didn&#39;t send mail html body in plsql"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12220084,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49066ab4192f931380662efbfa210c49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zerimeche","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12220084/zerimeche"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571826028,"creation_date":1571826028,"answer_id":58520658,"question_id":58502926,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58520658","body_markdown":"Hello thank you for your update, below my explications: I created two view rib1 and rib3 rib1 for select the last row inserted or updated, rib3 for all rows with attribute4 not null:\r\ncreate or replace view rib1 as (\r\nselect * from (\r\nselect p.segment1,p.vendor_name,l.attribute4,l.last_update_date,l.last_updated_by from ap_supplier_sites_all l,apps.ap_suppliers p\r\nwhere p.vendor_id=l.vendor_id order by l.last_update_date desc)\r\nwhere rownum=1)\r\ncreate or replace view rib3 as (\r\nselect distinct p.segment1 Supplier_Number,p.vendor_name Supplier_Name,s.attribute4 Supplier_RIB,s.last_update_date Update_Date,p.last_updated_by Update_User\r\nfrom apps.ap_supplier_sites_all s , apps.ap_suppliers p\r\nwhere p.vendor_id=s.vendor_id and s.attribute4 is not null)\r\nmy trigger is created for sending mail if the attribute4 exists with another suppliers (segment1), i created procedure : testrib for sending email, it work i received only email, but when i called testrib in my trigger i received 6 emails in the same time and all time 6 emails (hasn&#39;t any relations with count), count(*)=2--&gt; 6 emails, count(*)=11--&gt; 6 emails, i think the issue not in count(*)\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502926/didnt-send-mail-html-body-in-plsql/58520658#58520658","title":"didn&#39;t send mail html body in plsql"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12220084,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49066ab4192f931380662efbfa210c49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zerimeche","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12220084/zerimeche"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7203,"user_id":1879019,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/otzDQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tomRedox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1879019/tomredox"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571826028,"creation_date":1571742580,"last_edit_date":1571747795,"question_id":58502926,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502926","body_markdown":"I developed  a trigger in plsql, the trigger work but I received 6 mails in the same time.

print(file)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;No items match your search&quot;)\r\n\r\nSimilarly to Ofer, I would transform the [generator function](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) returned by Path.glob() into a list, so that you can check if it contains any items or not. Generator functions by themselves always evaluate to True, and you can only find out if they contain any items by calling them with `next()` or with a for loop.\r\n\r\nIn Python, the empty list evaluates to False, so you can get away with just `if files:` in the condition part of the if statement. Then I would omit the `if file.exists():` check, because all files found by Path.glob() will exist at the time it is run. The rest of the logic shouldn&#39;t contain any surprises.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if your script might match a lot of files, and you want to avoid the overhead of loading all the file objects into memory at once in your list of results, then you can use a flag variable.\r\n\r\n    cwd = Path()\r\n    found = False\r\n    for file in cwd.glob(&#39;*.txt&#39;):\r\n        print(file)\r\n        found = True\r\n    if not found:\r\n        print(&quot;No items match your search&quot;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502880/how-to-use-if-else-condition-in-python-to-check-existence-of-files/58503784#58503784","title":"How to use If else condition in python to check existence of files?"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11893427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Sz4hkoErG_A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc-a4tq_S7KObCB7lB-EbH-avt9qA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"UpaniK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11893427/upanik"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":4,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571745929,"creation_date":1571742434,"question_id":58502880,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502880","body_markdown":"I am new to python and trying to run the following code to get the files in the specified format on the current path using the if-else statement. \r\n\r\n``` \r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\n\r\npath=Path()\r\nfor file in path.glob(&#39;*.txt&#39;):\r\n    if file.exists():\r\n        print(file)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;No items match your search&quot;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works for the if condition, by printing all the files that match the given file format.
