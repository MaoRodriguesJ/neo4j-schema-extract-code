The problem is that I don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t render any other components. \r\n\r\nThis is my `withLoading` file where I define the `LoadingProvider`:\r\n\r\n    import React, { Component } from &quot;react&quot;;\r\n    import Loading from &quot;/components/Loading&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    const LoadingContext = React.createContext();\r\n    \r\n    export class LoadingProvider extends Component {\r\n        constructor(props) {\r\n            super(props);\r\n    \r\n            this.state = {\r\n                loading: false\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        setLoadingContext = e =&gt; {\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                loading: true\r\n            });\r\n        };\r\n    \r\n        render() {\r\n    \r\n            return (\r\n                &lt;LoadingContext.Provider value={this.setLoadingContext}&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Loading\r\n                        loading={this.state.loading}\r\n                    /&gt;\r\n                &lt;/LoadingContext.Provider&gt;\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    export const withLoading = Component =&gt; props =&gt; (\r\n        &lt;LoadingContext.Consumer&gt;\r\n            {setLoadingContext =&gt; (\r\n                &lt;Component {...props} setLoadingContext={setLoadingContext} /&gt;\r\n            )}\r\n        &lt;/LoadingContext.Consumer&gt;\r\n    )\r\n\r\nAnd this is my `Loading.js` file where I define my `Loading` component:\r\n\r\n    import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import CircularProgress from &#39;@material-ui/core/CircularProgress&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    class Loading extends Component {\r\n        render() {\r\n    \r\n            const loading = this.props;\r\n    \r\n            // TODO: fix weird repetitive loading prop\r\n            if (!loading.loading) {\r\n                return null;\r\n            } else {\r\n                return (\r\n                    &lt;CircularProgress /&gt;\r\n                );\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    export default Loading;\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess it has something to do with returning null when loading is false. But when I comment that rule of code out it says: \r\n\r\n&gt; Uncaught Invariant Violation: Loading(...): Nothing was returned from\r\n&gt; render. This usually means a return statement is missing.

as keys: the same as in the (old) dictionary, i.e. the file names,\r\n     - as values: the (possibly new) hashes of the corresponding files,\r\n- I compare this new dictionary with the old one in `hash_file.txt` and the files whom hashes don&#39;t match (corresponding to the keys whom values don&#39;t match) are uploaded.\r\n- I replace the old dictionary in `hash_file.txt` by the new one.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n----\r\nWith the following old and new dictionaries:\r\n\r\n- `{&quot;file_1&quot;:&quot;foo1&quot;,&quot;file_2&quot;:&quot;foo2&quot;,&quot;file_3&quot;:&quot;foo3&quot;,&quot;file_4&quot;:&quot;foo4&quot;}`,\r\n- `{&quot;file_1&quot;:&quot;foo1&quot;,&quot;file_2&quot;:&quot;bar2&quot;,&quot;file_3&quot;:&quot;foo3&quot;,&quot;file_4&quot;:&quot;bar4&quot;}`,\r\n\r\nthe keys to be detected would be `&quot;file_2&quot;` and `&quot;file_4&quot;`.\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n----\r\n\r\n- Is there a better way to do than this scenario?\r\n- If not, what is the best way detect the keys of these two dictionaries whom values don&#39;t match?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266480/two-python-dictionaries-with-same-keys-how-to-detect-the-keys-whom-values-dont","title":"Two Python dictionaries with same keys: how to detect the keys whom values don&#39;t match?"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","arrays","json"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570439299,"post_id":58266476,"comment_id":102900325,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266476/jquery-get-json-in-original-order-valid-json#comment102900325_58266476"},{"owner":{"reputation":6083,"user_id":3233827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVngi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ssc-hrep3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3233827/ssc-hrep3"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570439548,"post_id":58266476,"comment_id":102900460,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266476/jquery-get-json-in-original-order-valid-json#comment102900460_58266476"},{"owner":{"reputation":21220,"user_id":3082296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EmdM0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"adiga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3082296/adiga"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570439886,"post_id":58266476,"comment_id":102900631,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266476/jquery-get-json-in-original-order-valid-json#comment102900631_58266476"},{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12175580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/997722d4ac5db6b53cec2627e0e2f1cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"c3560231","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175580/c3560231"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6083,"user_id":3233827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVngi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ssc-hrep3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3233827/ssc-hrep3"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570442622,"post_id":58266476,"comment_id":102901969,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266476/jquery-get-json-in-original-order-valid-json#comment102901969_58266476"},{"owner":{"reputation":6083,"user_id":3233827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVngi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ssc-hrep3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3233827/ssc-hrep3"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570456385,"post_id":58266476,"comment_id":102908960,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266476/jquery-get-json-in-original-order-valid-json#comment102908960_58266476"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12175580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/997722d4ac5db6b53cec2627e0e2f1cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"c3560231","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175580/c3560231"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570439278,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570439235,"creation_date":1570439235,"question_id":58266476,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58266476","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to receive sorted data from a JSON file.

Idea 1 is just a callback. If you want to use a callback: `useCallback`. Idea 2 will work and is preferable if you don&#39;t need to use redux. Sometimes you&#39;re better off using redux. Maybe you&#39;re setting form validity by checking none of the input fields have errors or something similar. Since we&#39;re on the topic of redux, let&#39;s assume that&#39;s the case.\r\n\r\nUsually the best approach to error handling with redux is to have an error field in state that is then passed to an error component.\r\n\r\n    const ExampleErrorComponent= () =&gt; {\r\n      const error = useSelector(selectError);\r\n      if (!error) return null;\r\n      return &lt;div className=&quot;error-message&quot;&gt;{error}&lt;/div&gt;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe error component doesn&#39;t have to just display an error, it could also do side effects with `useEffect`.\r\n\r\nHow the error is set/unset depends on your application. Let&#39;s use your phone number example.\r\n\r\n## 1. If the validity check is a pure function, it can be done in the reducer.\r\n\r\nYou would then set or unset the error field in response to phone number change actions. In a reducer built with a switch statement it could look like this.\r\n\r\n    case &#39;PHONE_NUMBER_CHANGE&#39;:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...state,\r\n        phoneNumber: action.phoneNumber,\r\n        error: isValidPhoneNumber(action.phoneNumber) ? undefined : &#39;Invalid phone number&#39;,\r\n      };\r\n\r\n## 2. If errors are reported by the backend, dispatch error actions.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say you&#39;re sending the phone number to a backend that does validation before it does something with the number. You can&#39;t know if the data is valid on the client side.

You can unset the error on a change action or when making another request depending on the application.\r\n\r\nThe two approaches I outlined are not mutually exclusive. You can use the first to display locally detectable errors and also use the second to display server side or network errors.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266418/correct-way-of-error-handling-in-react-redux/58299220#58299220","title":"Correct way of error handling in React-Redux"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":274,"user_id":10433835,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00fde0520b423e4482be35cfb19d306b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anny123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10433835/anny123"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571177982,"post_id":58321919,"comment_id":103151592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266418/correct-way-of-error-handling-in-react-redux/58321919#comment103151592_58321919"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":8957100,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/27ef2a17e0d0ba9c6b833096b54389a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anerco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8957100/anerco"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570707120,"creation_date":1570707120,"answer_id":58321919,"question_id":58266418,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58321919","body_markdown":"I would use a formik with yup validation.\r\nthen, for server-side error i would use something like this:\r\n\r\n    import React, { useEffect } from &quot;react&quot;;\r\n    import { useDispatch, useSelector } from &quot;react-redux&quot;;\r\n    import { Spinner } from &quot;@blueprintjs/core&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    export default ({ action, selector, component, errorComponent }) =&gt; {\r\n      const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n    \r\n      useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n        dispatch(action());\r\n      }, [dispatch, action]);\r\n    \r\n      const DispatchFetch = () =&gt; {\r\n        const { data, isRequesting, error } = useSelector(selector());\r\n        if (!isRequesting &amp;&amp; data) {\r\n          const Comp = component;\r\n          return &lt;Comp data={data}&gt;&lt;/Comp&gt;;\r\n        } else if (error) {\r\n          if (errorComponent) {\r\n            const ErrorComp = errorComponent;\r\n            return &lt;ErrorComp error={error}&gt;&lt;/ErrorComp&gt;;\r\n          }\r\n          return &lt;div&gt;{error}&lt;/div&gt;;\r\n        }\r\n        return &lt;Spinner&gt;&lt;/Spinner&gt;;\r\n      };\r\n    \r\n      return &lt;DispatchFetch&gt;&lt;/DispatchFetch&gt;;\r\n    };","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266418/correct-way-of-error-handling-in-react-redux/58321919#58321919","title":"Correct way of error handling in React-Redux"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2577,"user_id":1832330,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A_qG09cVlMw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcCqt6qmCk-turs85lQitFbJhgA3g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zhuber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832330/zhuber"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570795136,"creation_date":1570795136,"answer_id":58340824,"question_id":58266418,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340824","body_markdown":"It depends on what kind of error handling are you talking about. If it&#39;s only form validation handling then I don&#39;t think you need Redux for that - please read [this article][1]. If your error is only going to be &quot;consumed&quot; within that component, why send it to redux? You can easily use your local state for that.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you want to show some kind of error notification to user indicating whether any HTTP call on site failed, you could benefit with redux by dispatching error from all parts of your application (or even generically your middleware)\r\n\r\n    dispatch({ type: &#39;SET_ERROR_MESSAGE&#39;, error: yourErrorOrMessage });\r\n\r\n    // simple error message reducer\r\n    function errorMessage(state = null, action) {\r\n      const { type, error } = action;\r\n\r\n      switch (type) {\r\n          case &#39;RESET_ERROR_MESSAGE&#39;:\r\n              return null;\r\n          case &#39;SET_ERROR_MESSAGE&#39;:\r\n              return error;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      return state\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou need to define how is your state going to be organized and whether you need to put some state in redux or just keep it in local state of your component. You could put everything in redux, but personally I&#39;d say it&#39;s an overkill - why would you put state X in component Y if only component Y cares about that state? If you structure your code correctly you shouldn&#39;t have problem with moving that state from local to redux later on, if for some reason other parts of your app start to depend on that state.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://redux.js.org/faq/organizing-state","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266418/correct-way-of-error-handling-in-react-redux/58340824#58340824","title":"Correct way of error handling in React-Redux"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":713,"user_id":2164245,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EE7zF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rich green","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2164245/rich-green"},"last_editor":{"reputation":713,"user_id":2164245,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EE7zF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rich green","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2164245/rich-green"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571175101,"last_edit_date":1571175101,"creation_date":1571173125,"answer_id":58402560,"question_id":58266418,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58402560","body_markdown":"I think about it like this, what should be state?  And what should be derived from state?\r\nState should be stored in redux, and derivations should be calculated.\r\n\r\nA phone number is state, which field has focus is state, but whether or not it&#39;s valid, that can be derived from the values in state.\r\n\r\nI would use Reselect to cache derivations and return the same results when the relevant state hasn&#39;t been modified.\r\n\r\n    export const showInvalidPhoneNumberMessage = createSelector(\r\n      getPhoneValue,\r\n      getFocusedField,\r\n      (val, focus) =&gt; focus !== &#39;phone&#39; &amp;&amp; val.length &lt; 10 // add other validations.\r\n    )\r\n\r\nYou can then use the selector in mapStateToProps in all components that may care about this value, and you can use it in async actions as well.

Will you store every single day in state, or do you just need to know a couple things like the current year and month currently being viewed.  With just these 2 pieces of state you can calculate the days to display on a calendar, and don&#39;t need to recalculate until one of them changes, and this recalculation will happen virtually automatically, no need to think about all the ways theat they could change.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266418/correct-way-of-error-handling-in-react-redux/58402560#58402560","title":"Correct way of error handling in React-Redux"}],"owner":{"reputation":274,"user_id":10433835,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00fde0520b423e4482be35cfb19d306b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anny123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10433835/anny123"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":144,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":8,"accepted_answer_id":58299220,"answer_count":4,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1571175101,"creation_date":1570439071,"question_id":58266418,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58266418","body_markdown":"I want to understand what is more general or correct way of error handling with React-Redux. \r\n\r\nSuppose, I have phone number sign up component.\r\n\r\nThat Component throws an error say if the input phone number is invalid \r\n\r\nWhat would be a best way to handle that error? \r\n\r\n**Idea 1:** \r\nCreate a component, which takes an error and dispatches an action whenever an error is passed to it\r\n\r\n**idea 2:** \r\nSince the error is related to that component, pass that error to a component (which isn&#39;t connected to redux i.e the error handler component won&#39;t dispatch the action)\r\n\r\n**Question:** Can someone guide me on proper-way of error handling in React-Redux for large-scale app?

on the Explain plan, optimizer is not able to use any index for `ORDER BY rent`. So try the following: \r\n\r\n 1. Ensure that an index exists on the `rent_date` column of the `rents` table. This index will be used to optimize the `ORDER BY` clause. It can be a single column index, or a multi-column one (used in other scenarios). But, in case of multi-column one, you need to ensure that the `rent` column is the first column in the index order.\r\n 2. Ensure that an index exists on the `id` column of the `kickscooters` table. Details about single-column / multi-column index remains the same as in the point #1.\r\n 3. Ensure that an index exists on the `serial_number` column of the `kickscooter_states_190614` table. Details about single-column / multi-column index remains the same as in the point #1.\r\n\r\nNow, after ensuring these indexes, try your original query. Most likely, optimizer should be able to optimize the Join Order. Besides, the above query, you can enforce join order by using [`STRAIGHT_JOIN`][1] optimizer hint. So, try the following query as well, and benchmark between the two of them:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect\r\n  r.user_id,\r\n  k.id as kickscooter_id,\r\n  st_astext(k.location) as location,\r\n  k.created_at,\r\n  k.serial_number,\r\n  k_st.serial_number as states_serial_number,\r\n  st_astext(k_st.gps) as gps_location,\r\n  k_st.gps_updated_at,\r\n  r.start_time,\r\n  r.end_time\r\nfrom kickscooters k\r\nstraight_join rents r\r\n  on k.id= r.kickscooter_id\r\nstraight_join kickscooter_states_190614 k_st\r\n  on k.serial_number = k_st.serial_number\r\norder by r.rent_date\r\nlimit 999;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/516720/2469308","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266389/performance-difference-in-query-between-cmd-and-workbench-mysql/58280546#58280546","title":"Performance difference in query between cmd and workbench mysql"}],"owner":{"reputation":401,"user_id":10970202,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fa7071ecb8f3b81bb2245d9fe6789ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"makewhite","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10970202/makewhite"},"last_editor":{"reputation":401,"user_id":10970202,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fa7071ecb8f3b81bb2245d9fe6789ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"makewhite","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10970202/makewhite"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570526374,"creation_date":1570438975,"last_edit_date":1570526099,"question_id":58266389,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58266389","body_markdown":"I have two questions:\r\n\r\n1.

Your `warehouse_join` does not affect this relation.\r\n\r\nAlso, in order to have associated objects available through an individual object of the queried collection without extra DB queries you have to use preloading (eager loading) methods such as `includes`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to fetch a list of `organizations` with their `warehouses`, you should do that like this:\r\n\r\n    orgs = organizations.includes(:warehouses)\r\n\r\n    # now you can access `warehouses` of each individual `organization` without extra DB queries\r\n    orgs.first.warehouses\r\n    orgs.second.warehouses\r\n\r\nAs far as I know it is impossible (or not so easy) in `ActiveRecord` to use `includes` with a custom JOIN condition.\r\n\r\nBut in your case I wouldn&#39;t try to do that, there is another way. Use two separate associations (one for each foreign key):\r\n\r\n    class Organization &lt; ActiveRecord::Model\r\n      # delegated warehouses         \r\n      has_many :delegated_warehouses, class_name: &quot;Warehouse&quot;, \r\n                                      foreign_key: &quot;delegated_to_organization_id&quot; \r\n      # owned, but not delegated to any other organization\r\n      has_many :owned_not_delegated_warehouses, -&gt; { where(delegated_to_organization_id: nil) }, \r\n                                                class_name: &quot;Warehouse&quot;, \r\n                                                foreign_key: organization_id                                  \r\n    \r\n      def warehouses_under_responsibility\r\n        # do not do like this!!! those associations are for preloading only!\r\n        delegated_warehouses + owned_not_delegated_warehouses # wrong!!!\r\n\r\n        # the right way\r\n        Warehouse.where(&quot;coalesce(delegated_to_organization_id, organization_id, -1) = ?&quot;, id)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can use the associations to separately preload (eager load) `warehouses` that are under responsibility.\r\n\r\n    orgs = Organization.includes(:delegated_warehouses, :owned_not_delegated_warehouses)\r\n\r\n    orgs.each do |org|\r\n      # now you can access the associated records separately\r\n      owned_warehouses = org.owned_not_delegated_warehouses\r\n      delegated_warehouses = org.delegated_warehouses\r\n    \r\n      # or use them all together\r\n      all_warehouses = owned_warehouses + delegated_warehouses\r\n    end\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nThose associations should only be used when preloading warehouses, i.e. when there is a large collection of organization and you need to fetch the warehouses they are responsible for.\r\n\r\nIf you have a single organization and need to fetch the warehouses it is responsible for, you should use another approach, which is shown in the `warehouses_under_responsibility` method.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand why we didn&#39;t use the same approach when preloading.

It should say that your app is available in all countries. Edit it and make the app unavailable in all countries.\r\n3. Now again make the app available in all countries and Submit Update. \r\n4.

This is a self-referential constraint (known as [F-bounded polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_quantification#F-bounded_quantification)) and allows the compiler to verify that the type `T` inferred from calling the function has, for any key in `keyof T`, properties assignable to `Style`.  Let&#39;s see it in action:\r\n\r\n    const componentStyles = asComponentStyles({\r\n        button: { color: &#39;red&#39; },\r\n        heading: { fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 28 },\r\n        body: { fontSize: 12, lineHeight: 18 },\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    type ComponentName = keyof (typeof componentStyles);\r\n    // type ComponentName = &quot;button&quot; | &quot;heading&quot; | &quot;body&quot;\r\n    \r\nThis works as you intended.  And let&#39;s make sure that it&#39;s doing its job of preventing bad `Style` properties:\r\n\r\n\r\n    const errorChecking = asComponentStyles({\r\n        okay: { color: &#39;chartreuse&#39;, lineHeight: 123 },\r\n        badColor: { color: 123, lineHeight: 123 }, // error!\r\n        //          ~~~~~ &lt;── &#39;number&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;string | undefined&#39;.\r\n        excessPropChecking: { colour: &quot;grey&quot; } // error!\r\n        //   ┌──────────────&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n        // Object literal may only specify known properties, \r\n        // but &#39;colour&#39; does not exist in type &#39;Style&#39;.\r\n        // Did you mean to write &#39;color&#39;?\r\n    })\r\n\r\nAlso looks good.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNote that you might be able to get away with a simpler non-self-referential helper function using an index signature similar to how you&#39;re doing it in your question:\r\n\r\n    const asComponentStylesIndex = &lt;T extends { [k: string]: Style }&gt;(t: T) =&gt; t;\r\n    \r\n    const componentStylesIndex = asComponentStylesIndex({\r\n        button: { color: &#39;red&#39; },\r\n        heading: { fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 28 },\r\n        body: { fontSize: 12, lineHeight: 18 },\r\n    }); // okay\r\n    \r\nThat works because TypeScript will take an object literal and give it an [implicit index signature](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#implicit-index-signatures).  \r\n\r\nBut I wouldn&#39;t recommend this if you are going to be using interface values, since [they are not currently allowed to gain implicit index signatures](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15300), while the F-bounded version works for interfaces as well as object literals:\r\n\r\n    interface MyComponent {\r\n        foo: Style,\r\n        bar: Style\r\n    }\r\n    declare const myComponent: MyComponent; // value of an interface type\r\n    \r\n    const works = asComponentStyles(myComponent); // okay\r\n    const doesntWork = asComponentStylesIndex(myComponent); // error!\r\n    //  ┌───────────────────────────────────&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    // Index signature is missing in type &#39;MyComponent&#39;.\r\n\r\nNot sure if interface-valued things are part of your use case or not.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope that helps; good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?ssl=29&amp;ssc=1&amp;pln=49&amp;pc=1#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgMpgJ4BsUG8CwAUMicggPZblQD8AXMgM5hSgDmA3EacjOeKmAAvCPWQgArgFsARtC7FSWUBAASEYGwAWYMZNnyiAXyJEKIZsjiMAwuSkAHfhAGYcjZAF5kAHgAqyBAAHpAgACYeAEoQFFBhPgDWEBjkMMh+ADRobhAAfLkAFGAMfgCUXrnIYApm-JYUjs6u2BAe3tZ2jSAuYOgtjAUEiiQyEmBg-Ay4ZJTUDADkUBBh88hGGdykWhBwYexTvPy9whAMAIwAHFnK3eqaOgwATBdrG8PIMuRhGAd8AifnR7XFR3bTFZCXV7GUo1QiYBwoTpObrgABycCkKG8SRSaSKGARqRmXR6fXcMKIAHpKVUCYj7MieujMV5kAAiUbjfhs5AAH3Z2127B5-I5XwwbNMhHMlmgUGoNm2CAS7FZHQZTV6OQGQx45AScB+yGmFCoUAWCC0cCgLAgEkYEHmwNuGjBgIAzFD3jJdnYzQdTXMIY93c61K6HsHPetkNTAlB5VAAISbEhxngZgB+2ezvkAAKR55DzfRyKCrYAeEDkMBWRiMTQgOAyHBVci0hFF5isEBsPnICThCAwFQrAB0qcCQSQdYACvKHIqYiqewHZhJzey2EsJWtYzS5dQU+904AYUgL54vl7zlRzt7v2YncYA8jIAFYxGvKSBQOBYZBSQ1kH4LAMCYBEEGAGBQISKsAHcQGQBx52gMBgFaLJHxpTki0DddVjCchWnEatJwrGtQHbFB5jJR1x2PGkABFgDCZAUgkf8dgQiZkFg1hIBw2YyxoaEpRlGt1RJZp3AASUHIJWX8SdQgiY1kAAbQSBgu3YABdBgaLWQpwTKCoqlhMTiUZKTWlksJgjVWwNRRLV+ls4JBgnTkJhAVd-SLJYVi9HhBT2FdVL+Y4RHOK5kBucN7nBZ4gtIT5vl+I5BCi4Mw1BSNIXWaEOD3ICDQwKVQG-eAkGQABZDAkU1Y0Jz4ch9JyN4eB9DcaOMIg7IQLBrRQCypHqpyegYOqGuc8y6hrWDqASNpa2m0ltQKUbVvAGFkFqCwawI1pwAAdUWhytpcmS5I2sbJLAHa4wPZMqRpZAzyvD7Pq+i8b3vW8XuQNz5PrNhGzAdcUArf8K3rHtkAo+EqKm8bwHmOipSAA)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58266280/inferring-type-of-keys-in-a-map-while-also-typing-the-values-in-a-map/58271067#58271067","title":"Inferring type of keys in a map (while also typing the values in a map)"}],"owner":{"reputation":9600,"user_id":15982,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/543d0222ea3269453527c07141d48e4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rene Saarsoo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15982/rene-saarsoo"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58271067,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570456519,"creation_date":1570438545,"question_id":58266280,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58266280","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to infer the type of keys from a map.\r\n\r\nI can successfully do this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst componentStyles = {\r\n  button: { color: &#39;red&#39;
