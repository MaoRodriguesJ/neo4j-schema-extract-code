always as easy as you think.\r\n\r\nThis is my first stackoverflow post by the way so i&#39;m sorry if its not fully as it should be or i did something wrong.\r\n\r\nThe html:\r\n``` \r\n&lt;div

free to change the headline to what may be more suitable)\r\n\r\nI am using Ruby on Rails and I have two model sets:\r\n\r\n- Page\r\n- Store\r\n\r\n- A page `has_many` stores. \r\n- A store has the attribute `status_nbr` which ranges from 1-5.\r\n\r\nFor example, page #1 could have 5 stores where two of them have `status_nbr = 1` and three of them have `status_nbr = 3`.\r\n\r\nI want to run a query which to find all Pages where there is **no** store who has status_nbr = 1. In other words, Pages that lack stores with status_nbr = 1. How do I do that? I assume this can be done with some clever join?\r\n\r\nAs for now I run a loop:\r\n\r\n    ok_list = []\r\n    Page.all.each do |page|\r\n      ok_list &lt;&lt; page.id unless page.stores.where(:status_nbr =&gt; 1).blank?\r\n    end\r\n    @pages = Page.where(:id =&gt; ok)\r\n\r\nwhich is very bad/slow programming.\r\n\r\nEdit: This is not a duplicate question of the one referred. My model is dependent on another model and the attribute of that other model. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113853/exclude-active-record-entries-based-on-another-active-record-attribute","title":"Exclude active record entries based on another active record attribute"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":11395273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LMbIvVP7a4s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAISA/OFAhzHmhwaA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Itzik Saviya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11395273/itzik-saviya"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569495115,"post_id":58115027,"comment_id":102619542,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113851/how-to-take-the-value-from-selectedoption-and-display-it/58115027#comment102619542_58115027"},{"owner":{"reputation":461,"user_id":5498144,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gMgni.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Majid Amiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5498144/majid-amiri"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":55,"user_id":11395273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LMbIvVP7a4s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAISA/OFAhzHmhwaA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Itzik Saviya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11395273/itzik-saviya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569497476,"post_id":58115027,"comment_id":102620837,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113851/how-to-take-the-value-from-selectedoption-and-display-it/58115027#comment102620837_58115027"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":461,"user_id":5498144,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gMgni.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Majid Amiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5498144/majid-amiri"},"last_editor":{"reputation":461,"user_id":5498144,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gMgni.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Majid Amiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5498144/majid-amiri"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569497450,"last_edit_date":1569497450,"creation_date":1569494486,"answer_id":58115027,"question_id":58113851,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58115027","body_markdown":"You are using `this.state.value` but updating `this.state.selectedOption`.

my Xamarin Android app I save various bits of data (for example logging and errors) to the external files directory. To do this I call GetExternalFilesDir in the below method:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    using AndroidApp = Android.App;\r\n    ...  \r\n    private string GetExternalPrivateStoragePath()\r\n        {\r\n           \r\n                return AndroidApp.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir(null).AbsolutePath;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThis is called very frequently in production - several times a minute. \r\nVery occasionally I will get a null reference exception from this method. After this exception all subsequent calls also return a null reference exception until the app is restarted. My question is, under what circumstances would this throw a null reference exception, and how can I recover from it? The app is currently only being used on the same model of Android device which has an internal shared storage directory, which contains the path returned by the above method. The app is used in an industrial setting where it is used constantly, and it is unlikely it is restarted for days at a time.\r\nThis is information I have received from the error report in App

You also need to consider that it could be reading from multiple sources each with different indexes and keys.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re looking to replicate structure rather than the data then you need a different tool.

(In &#39;_reactNativeDeviceInfo.default.getDeviceCountry()&#39;,\r\n&gt; &#39;_reactNativeDeviceInfo.default.getDeviceCountry&#39; is undefined)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113805/how-to-get-current-country-of-device-in-react-native-ios-and-android","title":"How to get current country of Device in React Native (iOS and Android)?"},{"tags":["ios","objective-c"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":75505,"user_id":3418066,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/De72L.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paulw11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3418066/paulw11"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569490895,"post_id":58113802,"comment_id":102617350,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113802/how-to-access-method-of-another-viewcontroller#comment102617350_58113802"},{"owner":{"reputation":501,"user_id":2822720,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11f7aee0dc600e96a24d01f3d02590a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jacob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2822720/jacob"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569490896,"post_id":58113802,"comment_id":102617351,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113802/how-to-access-method-of-another-viewcontroller#comment102617351_58113802"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6892440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10210074066703608/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alon Mel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6892440/alon-mel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569491363,"post_id":58113802,"comment_id":102617620,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113802/how-to-access-method-of-another-viewcontroller#comment102617620_58113802"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6892440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10210074066703608/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alon Mel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6892440/alon-mel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569491382,"post_id":58113802,"comment_id":102617630,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113802/how-to-access-method-of-another-viewcontroller#comment102617630_58113802"},{"owner":{"reputation":6579,"user_id":1077601,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8156916199f65a68c31dac5b8ad4151c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Darren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1077601/darren"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569943926,"post_id":58113802,"comment_id":102755959,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113802/how-to-access-method-of-another-viewcontroller#comment102755959_58113802"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6892440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10210074066703608/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alon Mel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6892440/alon-mel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":111,"user_id":652086,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/egfLN.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tjalsma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/652086/tjalsma"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569569090,"creation_date":1569490543,"last_edit_date":1569569090,"question_id":58113802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58113802","body_markdown":"i&#39;m making a call to a function from another view controller, but while runtime the app crushes because of &#39;unrecognized selector sent to instance&#39;

for a way to avoid writing down in my `Props` all 25++ properties of `formik` when using `connect()`.\r\n\r\nThe error is exactly this: ` Type &#39;{ entry: Entry; }&#39; is missing the following properties from type &#39;Props&#39;: values, errors, touched, isValidating, and 25 more.` \r\n\r\nI want to use either the whole `formik` object or the `values` out of it, so something like this:\r\n\r\n`const MyComponent = ({ entry, values }: Props) =&gt; { //... `\r\n\r\nor like that:\r\n\r\n`const MyComponent = ({ entry, formik }: Props) =&gt; { //... `\r\n\r\nwhile exporting it like that: `export default connect(MyComponent);` (haven&#39;t typed that yet, could use some help in this too btw)\r\n\r\nand I&#39;m struggling with the types: \r\n```\r\nimport * as React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport {\r\n  connect,\r\n  FormikProps,\r\n  FormikValues\r\n  ...\r\n} from &#39;formik&#39;;\r\n...\r\n\r\ninterface Props extends Pick&lt;FormikProps&lt;FormikValues&gt;, &#39;values&#39;&gt; {\r\n  entry: Entry;\r\n  values: Pick&lt;FormikProps&lt;FormikValues&gt;, &#39;values&#39;&gt;;\r\n  // values: FormikValues; //tryouts\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even \r\n```\r\ninterface Props extends FormikProps&lt;FormikValues&gt; {\r\n  entry: Entry;\r\n  // values: FormikValues;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n```\r\nconst MyComponent = ({ entry, values }: Props &amp; FormikProps&lt;FormikValues&gt;) =&gt; {\r\n```\r\ni don&#39;t want to make the `formik` props optional (so the `?` part). But if I do not use the `?` I get the error ` Property &#39;values&#39; (or formik) is missing in type &#39;{ entry: Entry; }&#39; but required in type &#39;Props&#39;.` \r\n. But I don&#39;t understand that, since all those props are passed via the `connect()` and not from a parent component.\r\n\r\nI thought the `extends SomeProps` keyword lets you avoid typing the properties from `SomeProps` completely. And thus that I don&#39;t have to include `formik` or `values` or any of those props in my `Props` interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat have I got wrong? How should the types declaration be in this case?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113791/formik-connect-props-extends-missing-properties","title":"formik connect props extends missing properties"},{"tags":["jquery","mobile","scrollbar","responsive","fullpage.js"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":8558867,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82851e584a9b4a95795c08dfa8d246cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ghadir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8558867/ghadir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569498332,"post_id":58114267,"comment_id":102621291,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113788/mobile-homepage-having-two-scrollbars-one-large-and-one-small-not-working-prop/58114267#comment102621291_58114267"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6744327,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-E33une1dClY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA2E/V1KOMqn2JyQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sasindu Jayampathi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6744327/sasindu-jayampathi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569491948,"creation_date":1569491948,"answer_id":58114267,"question_id":58113788,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58114267","body_markdown":"i found some style append to your page and it&#39;s must case of this\r\n\r\n`@media screen and (max-width: 480px)\r\n.visible-bar-container {\r\n     display: none;\r\n}`\r\n\r\nand if you can not find where it&#39;s coming from, use this code in some style sheet in your site\r\n\r\n`@media screen and (max-width: 480px)\r\n.visible-bar-container {\r\n    display: block!important;\r\n}`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113788/mobile-homepage-having-two-scrollbars-one-large-and-one-small-not-working-prop/58114267#58114267","title":"Mobile homepage having two scrollbars, one large and one small, not working properly"}],"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":8558867,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82851e584a9b4a95795c08dfa8d246cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ghadir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8558867/ghadir"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569491948,"creation_date":1569490502,"question_id":58113788,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58113788","body_markdown":"This is not a reproducible problem. I have no code to share (more specifically: I have too much code and don&#39;t know where the problem could be).\r\n\r\nI am just hoping to get suggestions/insights into what the problem could be (and perhaps I can troubleshoot from there). \r\n\r\nSo I have a homepage. The homepage has a menu that gets displayed on the mobile version. The menu is transparent and is supposed to become white-colored when we scroll down past the 0 position according to this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(window).bind(&#39;scroll&#39;, function () {\r\n    if ($(window).scrollTop() &gt; 0) {\r\n/*code here*/\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I am scrolling past half a page before the menu becomes white. So it is not working directly after I start scrolling, only after I scroll like 50% of the viewport. \r\n\r\nHere is a screen recording showing how it is functioning (ignore the ugly website, see when the transparent menu is changing to white): https://imgur.com/a/KHAeSOM\r\n\r\nNote that the same code logic is applied to the desktop version of the menu, and in the desktop, it is working without a problem.\r\n\r\nWhen troubleshooting the mobile version on responsive mode, I get two scrollbars - one small (normal) and one big. It seems that my problem stems from the &#39;big&#39; scrollbar - as if there was supposed to be a div that covers all homepage but it somehow ended up covering 95% of it, and I ended up with the scrollbar that is messing the functionality.\r\n\r\nHere is a recording of the scrollbars: https://imgur.com/a/Bcovx9i\r\n\r\nI hid the domain name in the above recordings, but I will share it anyway in case some kind-hearted programmer was willing to look at it: https://www.thedigitalarabs.com\r\n\r\nSo at this point any suggestion would be helpful. I tried to detect when the second section is visible in the viewport to trigger the white-color function above, it didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nIt might be useful to know that I am using the fullpage.js plugin (disabled on mobile), and I suspect I am having problems with the mobile menu because of it.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help you can give.

such as Intents or .aidl or whatever\r\n\r\nSo if you have `android:process` declared for your Service and If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (&#39;:&#39;), a new process, is created when it&#39;s needed and the service runs in that process. \r\n\r\nYou need to use AIDL to communicate with this service as this is another process as far as Android is concerned  &amp;  On Android, one process cannot normally access the memory of another process. \r\n\r\nSo to talk to each other, they need to decompose their objects into primitives that the operating system can understand, and marshall the objects across that boundary for you.\r\n\r\n&gt; I am hoping you will say there is an easy way to share data but I\r\n&gt; suspect you are going to say that because they are in different\r\n&gt; processes there is no easy way to do it\r\n\r\nWell, this the way android process model works - i am afraid what else anyone else can say anything different \r\n\r\n&gt; I would like to avoid all the overhead with Intents or .aidl or\r\n&gt; whatever... It should also be said that there is a special reason why\r\n&gt; I want the service in another process.\r\n\r\nThat you have a specific reason to run the service in another process - This makes a case to go for AIDL even more stronger, because as per official android docs, \r\n\r\n&gt; Using AIDL is necessary if you allow clients from different\r\n&gt; applications to access your service for IPC and want to handle\r\n&gt; multithreading in your service. If you do not need to perform\r\n&gt; concurrent IPC across different applications, you should create your\r\n&gt; interface by implementing a Binder or, if you want to perform IPC, but\r\n&gt; do not need to handle multithreading, implement your interface using a\r\n&gt; Messenger.\r\n\r\nMay be you can think of explore implementing Binder or Messenger - if that serves your specific service&#39;s implementation details.

First, let&#39;s make sure the CoreData stack is ready to go. In `ExtensionDelegate`:\r\n```swift\r\nclass ExtensionDelegate: NSObject, WKExtensionDelegate {\r\n\r\n    let persistentContainer = NSPersistentContainer(name: &quot;Haha&quot;)\r\n\r\n    func applicationDidFinishLaunching() {\r\n        persistentContainer.loadPersistentStores(completionHandler: { (storeDescription, error) in\r\n            // handle this\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI had trouble when this property was `lazy` so I set it up explicitly. If you run into timing issues, make `loadPersistentStores` a synchronous call with a semaphore to debug and then figure out how to delay nib instantiation until the closure is called later.\r\n\r\nNext, let&#39;s fix `HostingController`, by making a reference to a constant view context. `WKHostingController` is an object, not a struct. So now we have:\r\n```swift\r\nclass HostingController: WKHostingController&lt;AnyView&gt; {\r\n\r\n    private(set) var context: NSManagedObjectContext!\r\n\r\n    override func awake(withContext context: Any?) {\r\n        self.context = (WKExtension.shared().delegate as! ExtensionDelegate).persistentContainer.viewContext\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    override var body: AnyView {\r\n        return AnyView(ContentView().environment(\\.managedObjectContext, context))\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, any subviews should have access to the MOC. The following now works for me:\r\n```swift\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n\r\n    @Environment(\\.managedObjectContext) var moc: NSManagedObjectContext\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            Text(&quot;\\(moc)&quot;)\r\n            SubView()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct SubView: View {\r\n\r\n    @Environment(\\.managedObjectContext) var moc: NSManagedObjectContext\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        Text(&quot;\\(moc)&quot;)\r\n            .foregroundColor(.red)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou should see the address of the MOC in white above and in red below, _without_ calling `.environment` on the `SubView`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113776/environment-variable-not-passed-to-subviews/58241776#58241776","title":"Environment variable not passed to Subviews"}],"owner":{"reputation":2622,"user_id":1948211,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BgqKK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dschu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1948211/dschu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2622,"user_id":1948211,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BgqKK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dschu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1948211/dschu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":176,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58241776,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570214934,"creation_date":1569490475,"last_edit_date":1569671962,"question_id":58113776,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58113776","body_markdown":"I want to get started with Core Data &amp; SwiftUI and therefore created a new watchOS project using the latest Xcode 11.1 GM.\r\n\r\nThen, I copied both `persistentContainer` &amp; `saveContext` from a fresh iOS project (with Core Data enabled), to gain Core Data capabilities.\r\n\r\nAfter that I modified the `HostingController` to return `AnyView` and set the variable in the environment.\r\n\r\n    class HostingController: WKHostingController&lt;AnyView&gt; {\r\n        override var body: AnyView {\r\n            \r\n            let managedObjectContext = (WKExtension.shared().delegate as!

Every platform has its own set of features that the others do or don&#39;t have, and Tableau has a lot of customization options that you won&#39;t find elsewhere. Aim to get as much of your dashboard converted 1:1 then warm everyone up to the idea that it will look/operate a little bit different since it&#39;s on a different platform.\r\n\r\n 2. **Can a t2.large hosting Zeppelin sustain up to 10 concurrent users viewing a report aggregated on 300k rows?** A t2.large should be more than big enough to run Zeppelin, Tableau, Superset, etc. with 10 concurrent users pulling a report with 300k rows. 300k isn&#39;t really that much.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good way to speed things up and squeeze more concurrent users on with your existing infrastructure is to speed up your data sources. That is where a lot of the aggregation calculations happen. Taking a look at your ETL&#39;s and trying to aggregate ahead of time can help, as well as make sure your data scientists aren&#39;t running massive queries slowing down your database server.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113773/is-apache-zeppelin-suitable-for-presenting-dashboard-for-several-users/58141693#58141693","title":"Is Apache Zeppelin suitable for presenting dashboard for several users?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1058,"user_id":484050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75870a83d2863117631cd690335d473d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/484050/mike"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58141693,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569621225,"creation_date":1569490465,"question_id":58113773,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58113773","body_markdown":"In other words, **can Zeppelin be used as a Tableau replacement** at small scale?\r\n\r\nI have a new UI/UX design of reporting dashboard. Data for dashboard comes from relational database (SQL Server). This dashboard is to be viewed by ~300 colleagues in my company. Perhaps up to ten of them will be viewing it at the same time.\r\n\r\nCurrently the dashboard is implemented in Kibana with data being imported into Elasticsearch from SQL Server on a regular basis. However, the new design requires certain widgets and data aggregations that go beyond dashboarding capabilities of Kibana. Additionally, my organization desires to migrate this dashboard to a technology which is considered more familiar for data scientists that work with us (Kibana isn&#39;t considered such).\r\n\r\nThis report and dashboard could be migrated to Tableau. Tableau is powerful enough to perform desired data aggregations and present all desired widgets. However we can&#39;t afford licenses cost, but we can invest as much developer&#39;s time as needed.\r\n\r\nI have evaluated couple of open-source dashboarding tools (Metabase and Superset) and they are lacking aggregations and widgets that we need. I would not go into details because the question is not about specifics. It is clear that Metabase and Superset are not powerful enough for our needs.\r\n\r\nI have an impression that Apache Zeppelin is powerful enough with its support for arbitrary Python code (I would use Pandas for data aggregations), graphs and widgets. However, I am not sure if single Zeppelin instance can support well number of concurrent viewers.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;d like to build a set of notebooks and make them available to all colleagues in the organization (access control is not an issue, we trust each other). Notebooks will be interactive with data filters and date range pickers.\r\n\r\nLooks like Zeppelin has switchable [interpreter isolation modes](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0/usage/interpreter/interpreter_binding_mode.html) which we can use to make different user&#39;s sessions isolated from each other. My question is whether a single t2.large AWS instance hosting Zeppelin can sustain up to ten users viewing report aggregated on 300k rows dataset. Also, are there any usability concerns which make an idea of multi-user viewing of reporting dashboard impractical for Zeppelin?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113773/is-apache-zeppelin-suitable-for-presenting-dashboard-for-several-users","title":"Is Apache Zeppelin suitable for presenting dashboard for several users?"},{"tags":["scala","apache-spark"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":3815153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/157ac509a310f92cb84ecb705e4729e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"apnith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3815153/apnith"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569495485,"creation_date":1569495485,"answer_id":58115333,"question_id":58113771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58115333","body_markdown":"You can simply do the below change:\r\n```\r\nval windowFunction = Window.partitionBy(partitionsColumnsList.head, partitionsColumnsList.tail:_*).orderBy(unionedDF(orderByList(0),orderByList(1)).desc)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113771/spark-dataframe-orderby-using-many-columns-in-scala/58115333#58115333","title":"Spark dataframe orderby using many columns in scala"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":4377674,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002591113803/picture?type=large","display_name":"Gaurav Garg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4377674/gaurav-garg"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569571360,"creation_date":1569571360,"answer_id":58130306,"question_id":58113771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58130306","body_markdown":"You can use the below snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window\r\n\r\nWindow.partitionBy(partitionsColumnsList.map(col): _*)\r\n.orderBy(array_union(orderByList.map(col): _*).desc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this did not work.

**Q** : *What could possibly be wrong with the code?*\r\n\r\nGiven the code is using the same **`localhost`** ( as seen from using the address ), the suspect number one is, that having 10x more work to process, the such workload will always stress the `localhost`&#39;s O/S and the CPU, won&#39;t it?\r\n\r\nNext comes the choice of the transport-class. Given all the **`SUB`**-s are co-located on the same **`localhost`** as the **`PUB`**, there is all the L3-stack-based TCP/IP protocol work going wasted. To compare the relative costs ( the add-on effect of using the **`tcp://`** transport-class for this hardware-singular messaging ), test the very same with using **`inproc://`** transport-class, where none of the protocol-related TCP/IP-stack add-on processing will take place.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, my code will never mix different event-loops ( using ZeroMQ since v2.11, so someone may consider my a bit old-fashioned in avoiding relying on `async`-decorated capabilities available in recent py3.6+ )\r\n\r\nMy code will use an explicit, non-blocking, zero-waiting test for a presence of a message per-`aSocketINSTANCE`, as in **`aSocketINSTANCE.poll( zmq.POLLIN, 0 )`** rather than using any &quot;externally&quot; added decoration, which may report the same, but via some additional (expensive and outside of my code domain of control) event-handling. All real-time, low-latency use-cases strive to bear as minimum latency/overheads as possible, so using explicit control will always win in my Projects, to any &quot;modern&quot; syntax-sugar sweetened tricks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy the Zen-of-Zero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58113764/subscribers-receive-messages-slowly/58184696#58184696","title":"Subscribers receive messages slowly"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":6143936,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f508f31cb91802c94bd7c4e20b662857?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Konstantin Litvin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6143936/konstantin-litvin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":6143936,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f508f31cb91802c94bd7c4e20b662857?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Konstantin Litvin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6143936/konstantin-litvin"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":117,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58184696,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569932554,"creation_date":1569490444,"last_edit_date":1569835767,"question_id":58113764,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58113764","body_markdown":"I have a pyzmq Publisher which sends around 1000 messages per second.

Reentrancy means precisely that, that a function can be reentered again, in the middle of a call to itself, without any risk to the internal data it manages int the active call.  For that to occurr, the function must operate only on its stack frame, or be given pointers as parameters (in the stack, or in storable registers) to any externa data objects it must act upon.  This makes reentrancy possible.\r\n\r\nNow, I&#39;ll explain one scenario where using a non-reentrant function (with the locking mechanism you propose) is not applicable:\r\n\r\nAssume the case you have a function `f()` that is being executed, then a signal is received (or an interrupt) and the signal handler just has to make a call to `f()`.  As far as you have the function entry locked, the signal handler will be locked on entry to the function `f()`, making the handler never return, so the main program cannot continue its execution of `f()` to open the lock.  In cases (the majority) you use the same stack to handle interrupts than the one of the interrupted function (well, I know about FreeBSD using a different context for interrupt handlers, but don&#39;t know if this applies to user mode processes), no chance to unlock the lock until the handler has return, but it cannot return as far as the handler is waiting for the lock to be unlocked.  This case of reentrancy is not handled by your routine.\r\n\r\nHow can this problem be avoided.  Just avoid interrupts that call this handler when you are in the middle of the shared region (then, why to lock it?)  so interrupts are handled _after_ the function call.  \r\n\r\nOf course, if you need to call it from several threads (each with it&#39;s own stack) then you need the lock after all.\r\n\r\n#Conclusion: \r\n\r\nThe lock just avoids the reentering of `f()`, but doesn&#39;t make it reentrant.

The login page will then automatically redirect the user back to the AAD login page.\r\n\r\nIf the user then decides to login again, the result of `MyMsalObject.GetAccount()` returns null, and an error occurs that mentions the following:\r\n\r\n&gt;ClientAuthError: Login_In_Progress: Error during login call - login is already in progress.\r\n\r\nAt first I used one js file to handle log in &amp; logout, I then realised that that probably wasn&#39;t he best solution, as it attempted a login on load.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to split them up into two separate JS files but this hasn&#39;t fixed my problem.\r\n\r\nmsalObject definition:\r\n\r\n    var msalConfig = {\r\n        auth: {\r\n            clientId: &quot;my_client_id&quot;,\r\n            authority: &quot;my_authority_url&quot;,\r\n            redirectUri: &quot;http://localhost:port&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        cache: {\r\n            cacheLocation: &quot;localStorage&quot;,\r\n            storeAuthStateInCookie: true\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    var myMSALObj = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalConfig);\r\n\r\nlogin code:\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){\r\n        if (!myMSALObj.getAccount()) {\r\n                myMSALObj.loginRedirect(msalConfig);\r\n                acquireTokenRedirectAndCallMSGraph();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nSome extra details.\r\nI&#39;ve now made it so that users must click on a button before being redirected to Microsoft to login.\r\n\r\nThe above unfortunately still applies.

have some Web API 2 that we are using :\r\n  - internally via a backoffice js SPA \r\n  - and externally from an external partner website\r\n\r\nIn order to control authorization we have designed our

you could fix this issue (but you need to know what you are doing) is to download the script in question to your server every night via a cron job and serve it from your server instead.\r\n\r\nThat
