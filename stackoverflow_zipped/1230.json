For this we are using the Micronaut OpenTracing support and Jaeger integration.\r\n\r\nThe following dependencies are included in the `pom.xml`\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n      &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n      &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-tracing&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n      &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n

&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHave implemented Filter method with `@ContinueSpan` (also tried the same with `@NewSpan`) as shown below\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Filter(&quot;/**&quot;)\r\npublic class TraceTestFilter implements HttpServerFilter {\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Publisher&lt;MutableHttpResponse&lt;?&gt;&gt; doFilter(\r\n      HttpRequest&lt;?&gt; request, ServerFilterChain

request, ServerFilterChain chain) {\r\n\r\n        // Details ommitted here\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following is maintained in the `application-k8s.yml` (also have an `application.yml` with the same settings)\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n---\r\ntracing:\r\n  jaeger:\r\n    enabled: true\r\n    sampler:\r\n      probability: 1\r\n    sender:\r\n      agentHost: jaeger-agent.istio-system\r\n      agentPort: 5775\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever we only see the trace entries that are generated by Istio (Envoy proxies) but we don&#39;t see the details of the method calls itself. \r\n\r\nAny ideas as to what could be going wrong here?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249869/micronaut-and-opentracing-of-method-calls","title":"Micronaut and OpenTracing of method

I am currently trying to scrape Twilio at https://www.twilio.com/company/jobs. However, I am not getting the job data its self -- that seems to be being missed by the scraper. Based on other questions this could be because the data is in JavaScript, but that is not obvious. \r\n\r\nHere is the code I am using:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Set the URL you want to webscrape from\r\nurl = &#39;https://www.twilio.com/company/jobs&#39;\r\n\r\n# Connect to the URL\r\nresponse = requests.get(url)\r\n\r\nif &quot;_job-title&quot; in response.text:\r\n    print &quot;Found the jobs!&quot;    # FAILS\r\n\r\n# Parse HTML and save to BeautifulSoup object\r\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, &quot;html.parser&quot;)\r\n\r\n# To download the whole data set, let&#39;s do a for loop through all a tags\r\nfor i in range(0,len(soup.findAll(&#39;a&#39;, class_=&#39;_job&#39;))): # href=True))): #&#39;a&#39; tags are for links\r\n    one_a_tag = soup.findAll(&#39;a&#39;, class_=&#39;_job&#39;)[i]\r\n    link = one_a_tag[&#39;href&#39;]\r\n    print link            # FAILS\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing displays when this code is run.

So, I thought about polling.\r\n\r\nThat is, I like to read a property or call a method in the server&#39;s object at an interval to determine if something has changed. To test this, I added this property to the `WeatherForecastService` class. The property increases every time when read. \r\n\r\n        int _Value = 0;\r\n        public int Value\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                _Value++;\r\n                return _Value;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIn the weather tablet sample plage, I removed the code to display the weather and added this.\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;This component demonstrates fetching data from a service.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;div&gt;Value = @this.Value&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\t@code {\r\n\t\tprivate int Value = 0;\r\n\r\n\t\tprotected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tSystem.Timers.Timer t = new System.Timers.Timer();\r\n\t\t\tt.Elapsed += (s, e) =&gt; { Value = ForecastService.Value; };\r\n\t\t\tt.Interval = 1000;\r\n\t\t\tt.Start();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAnd it did not work.

A data descriptor is a property that has a value, which may or may not be writable. An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter pair of functions. A descriptor must be one of these two flavors; it cannot be both.\r\n\r\nThe **type** of a property descriptor refers to whether the descriptor is a data descriptor (one for which a value is meaningful) or an accessor descriptor (with a getter/setter). A non-configurable property cannot be changed from a data type to a getter/setter type, or vice versa.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const o = {};\r\n    Object.defineProperty(o, &#39;t&#39;, {writable: true, configurable: false})\r\n    console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o, &#39;t&#39;));\r\n    Object.defineProperty(o, &#39;t&#39;, { get() { }})\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you pass a `writable` key, the descriptor type defaults to a data descriptor, whose value is `undefined` if no `value` is passed.\r\n\r\nThe error you&#39;re seeing at the end is different. While you can change a writable non-configurable data descriptor to a non-writable data descriptor, you can&#39;t go the other way around - a non-writable, non-configurable data descriptor cannot be converted to a writable data descriptor.

So your main error is that several buttons have the same ID.

This approach is an example of a general strategy: whatever is provided during normal execution by the environment (machine name, date, culture, etc) should be a parameter in the method under test, and the test bench should provide a range of significant values.\r\n\r\nRegarding the actual tests (if I may, do yourself a favor and use NUnit or XUnit): they become trivial.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[TestMethod]\r\n    public void ItsNotWednesday()\r\n    {\r\n        var wednesdayObj = new Wednesday();\r\n\r\n        var result = wednesdayObj.IsWednesday(new DateTime(2019, 10, 5)); // Not a wednesday\r\n\r\n        Assert.AreEqual(&quot;It’s not Wednesday&quot;, result);\r\n    }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249734/proper-way-to-conduct-or-quit-a-unit-test-based-on-a-real-time-value/58251829#58251829","title":"Proper way to conduct or quit a unit test based on a real-time value"}],"owner":{"reputation":189,"user_id":5732531,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1yaO5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lil broomstick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5732531/lil-broomstick"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58251829,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570305584,"creation_date":1570289084,"question_id":58249734,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58249734","body_markdown":"I have a class that checks if the current day of the week is Wednesday.

It is working fine all over the app.\r\nFollowing in the code (still main.js):\r\n```\r\njquery.extend(true, jquery.fn.datetimepicker.defaults, {\r\n  icons: {\r\n    time: &#39;&lt;svg-icon icon-class=&quot;plus-circle&quot; class=&quot;plus&quot; /&gt;&#39;,\r\n    date: &#39;tools&#39;,\r\n    up: &#39;run&#39;,\r\n    down: &#39;pdf&#39;,\r\n    previous: &#39;tree&#39;,\r\n    next: &#39;user&#39;,\r\n    today: &#39;form&#39;,\r\n    clear: &#39;table&#39;,\r\n    close: &#39;eye&#39;\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\nI&#39;ve changed the default icons with my own (just with their names -random, as I normally do in the rest of the app, or with the html tag), but it doesn&#39;t work.\r\nAlso, this part is not really clear to me ```jquery.fn.datetimepicker.defaults,```. Following the imports I should use ```datePicker```, but if I do it, the console says it is not defined.\r\n\r\nSo I actually don&#39;t know for sure if the problem is using my own icons, or if I am doing something wrong somewhere else in the code.\r\n\r\nFollowing the docs, in my vue.config file I&#39;ve added this code\r\n```\r\n// plugin date time picker\r\nconfig\r\n .plugin(&#39;provide&#39;)\r\n .use(require(&#39;webpack&#39;).ProvidePlugin, [{\r\n Vue: [&#39;vue/dist/vue.esm.js&#39;, &#39;default&#39;],\r\n $: &#39;jquery&#39;,\r\n moment: &#39;moment&#39;,\r\n jQuery: &#39;jquery&#39;,\r\n &#39;window.jQuery&#39;: &#39;jquery&#39;\r\n}])\r\n``` \r\ninside the chainWebpack(config).\r\n\r\nIn the vue template where I use the datetimepicker component I have:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n// Import required dependencies\r\nimport &#39;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css&#39;\r\n\r\n// Import this component\r\nimport datePicker from &#39;vue-bootstrap-datetimepicker&#39;\r\n\r\n// Import date picker css\r\nimport &#39;pc-bootstrap4-datetimepicker/build/css/bootstrap-datetimepicker.css&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: &#39;NewActivity&#39;,\r\n  components: {\r\n    datePicker\r\n  },\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      date: null,\r\n      options: {\r\n        format: &#39;DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss&#39;,\r\n        locale: &#39;it&#39;,\r\n        useCurrent: false,\r\n        showClear: true,\r\n        showClose: true\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried leaving the default ones, using glyphicons, using fontawsome and changing their names according to the last release but I never seen any icon showing.\r\n\r\nHope someone can help.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\nx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249730/how-to-use-my-own-icons-in-vue-bootstrap-datetimepicker","title":"How to use my own icons in

I understand your question correctly, the problem is that you need to associate the status of the user to one of potentially many projects that the user is associated with, but you are associating a single status to a single user instead of the project.\r\n\r\nIn that event, you need to abstract this association to an additional model, for instance &quot;UserProjectStatus&quot; which would be associated with both the User and the Project.  You can do this using the has_many, through association.  This would end up with something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n\r\n```RUBY\r\nclass Project &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n  has_many :user_project_statuses\r\n  has_many :users, through :user_project_statuses\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass UserProjectStatus &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n  belongs_to :user\r\n  belongs_to :project\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass User &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n  has_many :user_project_statuses\r\n  has_many :projects, through :user_project_statuses\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a good overview of this any many other Rails ActiveModel associations at

Making a change in redux will not automatically do this. In order to see changes to the state, you&#39;d need to subscribe to those changes. You could do this yourself, but a far better solution is to use [react-redux][1], which is designed for connecting react components to redux stores.\r\n\r\nFor example, you&#39;d add a provider to your app:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Provider } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\nimport { store } from &#39;./Store&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default function App () {  \r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;button onClick={changeName}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;Name /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Provider&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you&#39;d use `connect` with your Name component:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\nfunction Name(props) {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;           \r\n      My name is: {props.name}\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) =&gt; {\r\n  return { name: state };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(Name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/quick-start","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249720/how-to-update-react-component-after-changing-state-through-redux/58249812#58249812","title":"How to update React component after changing state through redux?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":725,"user_id":10056846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/602b04bc74a31c117be6be43715d6363?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Elder Patten Ferreira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10056846/elder-patten-ferreira"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570291897,"creation_date":1570291897,"answer_id":58250085,"question_id":58249720,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58250085","body_markdown":"You need to set up your reducer and initial store properly following the Redux documentation.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re missing a `Provider`, which will provide your `store` to your application.\r\n\r\n    const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));\r\n    \r\n    const rootElement = document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    ReactDOM.render(\r\n      &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;\r\n        &lt;App /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Provider&gt;,\r\n      rootElement\r\n    );\r\n\r\nNow, your store is available to your components.\r\n\r\nYour `reducer` needs an initial state too and you&#39;re always supposed to return an updated copy of your state. That said, don&#39;t change the state directly, but make a copy, change it, then return that copy.\r\n\r\n    const initialState = {\r\n      name: &quot;&quot;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    const reducer = function(state = initialState, action) {\r\n      if (action.type === &quot;name&quot;) {\r\n        return { ...state, name: action.payload };\r\n      } else {\r\n        return state;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    export default reducer;\r\n\r\nYou might have noticed that I added a middleware to your store, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s usually the way to go when accessing your current reducer&#39;s state in your actions. That said, I installed redux-thunk for that, so in your action, you can have something like this:\r\n\r\n    export const changeName = () =&gt; {\r\n      return (dispatch, getState) =&gt; {\r\n        if (getState().name === &quot;Tarun&quot;) {\r\n          dispatch({ type: &quot;name&quot;, payload: &quot;Subhash&quot; });\r\n        } else {\r\n          dispatch({ type: &quot;name&quot;, payload: &quot;Tarun&quot; });\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n    };\r\n\r\nNow, with your store being provided to your app, your reducer being done and your actions being ready to go, you can connect different components to your reducer.\r\n\r\nYou use the high order component in `react-redux` called `connect` for that. For example, in your `Name` component, we can connect the name to be displayed to your reducer by mapping your state to the component&#39;s props:\r\n\r\n    function Name(props) {\r\n      return &lt;div&gt;My name is: {props.name}&lt;/div&gt;;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    const mapStateToProps = state =&gt; {\r\n      return {\r\n        name: state.name\r\n      };\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Name);\r\n\r\nThe nice thing here is that you can also leave the first parameter in the `connect` high order component empty and just pass the second, which would be the dispatch functions. Well, that&#39;s what you would do in your `App` component, you would connect it to the `changeName` action.\r\n\r\n    function App(props) {\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n          &lt;button onClick={props.changeName}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\r\n          &lt;Name /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =&gt; {\r\n      return {\r\n        changeName: () =&gt; dispatch(changeName())\r\n      };\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    export default connect(\r\n      null,\r\n      mapDispatchToProps\r\n    )(App);\r\n\r\nNow, when App dispatches a `changeName` action, your reducer state will be updated and the other components that are connected to the reducer&#39;s state will re-render.\r\n\r\nSummary: Try to think of your store as an empty jar of candies. Your jar starts empty, but different actions could change what&#39;s inside the jar. On top of that, different people in the house that know where the jar is can go get some candy. Translating to your problem, your app begins with an empty name and you have an action that sets up a name. The components that know where to find that name by being *connected* to your reducer will know when that name changes and will get the updated name.\r\n\r\nThe final code can be found here:\r\n\r\n[![Edit vigilant-field-shfj7](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/vigilant-field-shfj7?fontsize=14)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249720/how-to-update-react-component-after-changing-state-through-redux/58250085#58250085","title":"How to update React component after changing state through redux?"}],"owner":{"reputation":303,"user_id":5360375,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c014b5c9e17a1f860f9b4d8f3b6eede?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tarun Khare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5360375/tarun-khare"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570291897,"creation_date":1570288995,"question_id":58249720,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58249720","body_markdown":"I was learning React and Redux and while doing that I decided to make webpage with a button which on clicking would change the state.

So yes, reading the time as 934 or 1800 goes nicely, and there’s no reason to hand format the way you did in the question.\r\n\r\n\t\tDateTimeFormatter inputFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;Hmm&quot;);\r\n\t\tDateTimeFormatter outputFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;H&#39;h&#39;mm&quot;);\r\n\t\tLocalTime minTime = LocalTime.of(9, 0);\r\n\t\tLocalTime maxTime = LocalTime.of(18, 0);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tString userInput = &quot;1800&quot;;\r\n\t\tLocalTime time = LocalTime.parse(userInput, inputFormatter);\r\n\t\tif (time.isBefore(minTime) || time.isAfter(maxTime)) {\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;TODO put your error message here&quot;);\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tString output = time.format(outputFormatter);\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Debut de la location: &quot; + output);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nOutput from the example code snippet is:\r\n\r\n&gt; Debut de la location: 18h00\r\n\r\nOne detail may surprise here: The input format pattern string `Hmm` would ordinarily mean input in three digits, one digit hour of day and two digit minute of the hour. However, when Java sees that there are four digits, not three, since it knows that hour of day may sometimes require two digits, it is smart enough to figure that `1800` is two-digit hour, 18, and two-digit minute, 00.\r\n\r\nIn the output format pattern, `H&#39;h&#39;mm`, the single quotes around the `h` means that this letter is to be printed literally, it is not a format pattern letter like `H` and `mm`.\r\n\r\nIf you can, I recommend that you read the input as a `String`, not an `int`.\r\n\r\nIf the user has typed a time that doesn’t conform with the exptected, for instance a wrong format or a minute of hour greater than 59, `LocalTime.parse` will throw a `DateTimeParseException`, so you will want to catch this exception, issue an error message and ask the user to try again.\r\n\r\n**Link:** [Oracle tutorial: Date Time](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/) explaining how to use java.time.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249689/is-there-a-way-to-modify-the-format-of-a-user-input-ex900-9h00/58250642#58250642","title":"Is there a way to modify the format of a user input (ex:900 -&gt;

Thus you can design functionality, implement that design and create a test for new Feature.\r\n\r\n   ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249676/azure-connection-attempt-failed/58250039#58250039","title":"Azure connection attempt failed"}],"owner":{"reputation":577,"user_id":1211292,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDzC4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1211292/jon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570483441,"creation_date":1570288725,"question_id":58249676,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58249676","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using the following code to connect.

It&#39;s pure conjecture on my part, so please feel free to say it&#39;s non-sense if it is, and if you happen to know, why... \r\n\r\nIn the first example, `$i` is defined outside of the lexical scope of the for loop. Consequently, `$i` exists independent of the loop and its iterations. When `$i` is referenced from inside the loop, there is only one `$i` that can be affected. It is this `$i` that gets pushed into `@b`, and has its contents modified afterwards in the loop.\r\n\r\nIn the second example, `$i` is defined inside the lexical scope of the for loop. As @timotimo pointed out, the pointed block get&#39;s called for each iteration, like a subroutine; `$i` is therefore freshly declared for each iteration, and scoped to the respective block. When `$i` is referenced inside the loop, the reference is to the block-iteration-specific `$i`, which would normally cease to exist when the respective loop iteration ends. But because at some point `$i` is pushed to `@c`, the reference to the block-iteration-specific `$i` holding value `2` cannot be deleted by the garbage collector after termination of the iteration. It will stay in existence..., but still be different from `$i` in later iterations.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249670/scalar-value-being-affected-after-push-or-not-raku/58256703#58256703","title":"Scalar value being affected after push, or not...

I&#39;ll try to illustrate the issue that I ran into in a more complicated context in two stylized examples. \r\n\r\n***Example 1 *** In the first example, a scalar `$i` is pushed onto an array `@b` as part of a `List`. After the push, the value held by the scalar is explicitly updated in later iterations of the for loop using the `$i++` instruction. These updates have an effect on the value in the array `@b`: at the end of the for loop, `@b[0;0]` is equal to `3`, and no longer to `2`.\r\n```\r\nmy @b;\r\nmy $i=0;\r\nfor 1..3 -&gt; $x {\r\n  $i++;\r\n  say &#39;Loose var $i: &#39;, $i.VAR.WHICH, &quot; &quot;, $i.VAR.WHERE;\r\n  if $x == 2 {\r\n     @b.push(($i,1));\r\n     say &#39;Pushed $i   : &#39;, @b[0;0].VAR.WHICH, &quot; &quot;, @b[0;0].VAR.WHERE;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nsay &quot;Post for-loop&quot;;\r\nsay &quot;Array       : &quot;, @b;\r\nsay &#39;Pushed $i   : &#39;, @b[0;0].VAR.WHICH, &quot; &quot;, @b[0;0].VAR.WHERE;\r\n``` \r\nOutput example 1: \r\n```\r\nLoose var $i: Scalar|94884317665520 139900170768608\r\nLoose var $i: Scalar|94884317665520 139900170768648\r\nPushed $i   : Scalar|94884317665520 139900170768648\r\nLoose var $i: Scalar|94884317665520 139900170768688\r\nPost for-loop\r\nArray       : [(3 1)]\r\nPushed $i   : Scalar|94884317665520 139900170768688\r\n```\r\n*** Example 2 *** In the second example, the scalar `$i` is the loop variable. Even though `$i` is updated after it has been pushed (now implicitly rather than explicitly), the value of `$i` in array `@c` does **not**\r\nchange after the push; i.e. after the for loop, it is still `2`, not `3`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy @c;\r\nfor 1..3 -&gt; $i {\r\n  say &#39;Loose var $i: &#39;, $i.VAR.WHICH, &quot; &quot;, $i.VAR.WHERE;\r\n  if $i == 2 {\r\n     @c.push(($i,1));\r\n     say &#39;Pushed $i   : &#39;, @c[0;0].VAR.WHICH, &quot; &quot;, @c[0;0].VAR.WHERE;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nsay &quot;Post for-loop&quot;;\r\nsay &quot;Array       : &quot;, @c;\r\nsay &#39;Pushed $i   : &#39;, @c[0;0].VAR.WHICH, &quot; &quot;, @c[0;0].VAR.WHERE;;\r\n``` \r\nOutput example 2: \r\n```\r\nLoose var $i: Scalar|94289037186864 139683885277408\r\nLoose var $i: Scalar|94289037186864 139683885277448\r\nPushed $i   : Scalar|94289037186864 139683885277448\r\nLoose var $i: Scalar|94289037186864 139683885277488\r\nPost for-loop\r\nArray       : [(2 1)]\r\nPushed $i   : Scalar|94289037186864 139683885277448\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Question:** Why is `$i` in `@b` in example 1 updated after the push, while `$i` in `@c` in example 2 is not?\r\n\r\n\r\n**edit**:\r\nFollowing @timotimo&#39;s comment, I included the output of `.WHERE` in the examples. This shows the (WHICH/logical) scalar-identity of `$i` stays the same, while its memory address changes through the various loop iterations. But it does not explain why in example 2 the pushed scalar remains tied to the same WHICH-identity in combination with an old address (&quot;448).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249670/scalar-value-being-affected-after-push-or-not-raku","title":"Scalar value being affected after push, or not...

need some way for the programs to store that they&#39;ve done a thing, know as a [semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)).\r\n\r\nSimplest thing to do is use a shared location like `/var/run/` to place a semaphore file. Then each program attempts to create that file. If it already exists, they can assume someone else already performed the action.\r\n\r\nTo do that we use the [`open`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_(system_call)) system call (not `fopen`) for fine control. Using both the `O_CREAT` and `O_EXCL` flags says to create the file, and error if it already exists. This is atomic, we&#39;re checking if the file exists and creating it in one action. There&#39;s no way two programs could accidentally check &amp; create at the same time.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;\r\n\r\nbool check_semaphore(const char *file) {\r\n    if( open(file, O_CREAT|O_EXCL) &gt;= 0 ) {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    if( check_semaphore(&quot;did_debug_log&quot;) ) {\r\n        FILE *log = fopen(&quot;log.txt&quot;, &quot;a&quot;);\r\n        if( !log ) {\r\n            perror(&quot;Couldn&#39;t open log.txt&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        fprintf(log, &quot;Some debug stuff\\n&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use more sophisticated shared storage as a semaphore, like shared memory or a shared database such as SQLite, but the basic technique is the same. Check if the operation has been complete while also declaring you&#39;re going to do it in an atomic operation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58249666/how-to-identify-whether-a-particular-file-is-called-first-time-in-c/58249871#58249871","title":"How to identify whether a particular
