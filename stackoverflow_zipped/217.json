have an app developed in MS Access which uses ADO connections to SQL server (Microsoft SQL Server 2017) to execute numerous stored procedures. The ADO connections are all done through an application role in order to limit permissions. \r\n\r\nIn the latest update, I created a few new stored procedures which return several recordsets, which are pasted in Excel. My issue is that when I execute these stored procedures, the application role is removed... The query runs without any issues, but when it finishes running, the application role is unset. \r\n\r\nThe following is an example of one of the stored procs being called in VBA Access: \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPublic Function CDTExceptionsReport() As ADODB.Recordset\r\n    \r\n    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler\r\n    \r\n    Set objConn = DB.MaintainConnection\r\n    \r\n    On Error GoTo 0\r\n    \r\n    If objCmd_ER Is Nothing Then\r\n        Set objCmd_ER = New ADODB.Command\r\n        With objCmd_ER\r\n            .CommandType = adCmdText\r\n            .CommandTimeout = 60 &#39; increase command \r\n            .CommandText = &quot;EXEC tool.ExceptionsReport;&quot;\r\n            .Prepared = True\r\n            &#39; set connection object\r\n            .ActiveConnection = objConn\r\n            \r\n        End With\r\n    End If\r\n                    \r\n    Set CDTExceptionsReport = objCmd_ER.Execute\r\n    \r\n    On Error GoTo 0\r\n     Exit Function\r\nErrorHandler:\r\n    MsgBox &quot;Error: &quot; &amp; Err.DESCRIPTION &amp; vbNewLine &amp; &quot;Number: &quot; &amp; Err.Number\r\n    On Error GoTo 0 &#39; reset error handling\r\nEnd Function\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that ```objConn``` is my connection object, and ```objCmd_ER``` is my global command object. \r\n\r\nThrough the immediate terminal in VBA, I can check what role is being activated by using the following in debug mode: \r\n``` \r\nSet RS = objConn.Execute(&quot;SELECT CURRENT_USER&quot;)\r\n?RS.Fields(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run this before the ```objCmd_ER.Execute``` line, I can see the application role is still in use. However, when I run this immediately after that statement, the application role is removed and my windows username is returned. Has anyone experienced this before? \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve executed this stored procedure in SQL Server directly, and it works fine and does not log the application role out. Therefore my thinking is it&#39;s something to do with the ADO connection. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what further details would be helpful to provide. The stored procedure does not contain any DDL or DML language - just 4 select queries. \r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484478/executing-stored-procedure-in-ms-access-through-ado-connection-removing-applic","title":"Executing stored procedure in MS Access

have been trying to create a CRUD application but when I try to run the application then I get the **error** &quot;`Field repo in com.nationwide.individualproject.controllers.BoulderController required a bean of type &#39;com.nationwide.individualproject.Repos.BoulderRepo&#39; that could not be found`.&quot; along with the message in the title.\r\n\r\nI have tried adding various annotations such as `@ComponantScan` and `@EntityScan` but this hasn&#39;t changed anything. The application consists of **three packages** all under `com.nationwide.individualproject; .controllers, .data, .Repos`, with each class in those annotated as `@RestController, @Entity, and @Repository` respectively.\r\n\r\nThe **main application** class is **outside** of all of these packages at the same level.\r\n\r\nThe main application looks like:\r\n\r\n    package com.nationwide.individualproject;\r\n    \r\n    import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\r\n    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\r\n    \r\n    @SpringBootApplication()\r\n    \r\n    public class IndividualProjectApplication {\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            SpringApplication.run(IndividualProjectApplication.class, args);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BoulderRepo looks like:\r\n\r\n    package com.nationwide.individualproject.Repos;\r\n    \r\n    import com.nationwide.individualproject.data.Boulder;\r\n    import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\r\n    import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.Date;\r\n    \r\n    @Repository\r\n    public interface BoulderRepo extends JpaRepository&lt;Boulder, Integer&gt; {\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boulder class looks like: \r\n\r\n    package com.nationwide.individualproject.data;\r\n    \r\n    import javax.persistence.Entity;\r\n    import javax.persistence.Id;\r\n    import java.util.Date;\r\n    \r\n    @Entity\r\n    public class Boulder {\r\n        @Id\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nand finally the controller looks like:\r\n    \r\n        package com.nationwide.individualproject.controllers;\r\n    \r\n        import com.nationwide.individualproject.Repos.BoulderRepo;\r\n        import com.nationwide.individualproject.data.Boulder;\r\n        import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\r\n        import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\r\n        import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;\r\n        import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;\r\n        import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\r\n    \r\n        \r\n\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.Date;\r\n\r\n    @RestController\r\n    public class BoulderController {\r\n\r\n        @Autowired\r\n        private BoulderRepo repo;\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at other questions similar to mine they suggest that its something to do with having the classes all in different packages but I still am unsure of why I am getting the error when the main class is at the same level as all the packages.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisual of the project structure looks something like this:\r\n\r\n     ---com.nationwide.individualproject\r\n\r\n         ---controllers\r\n\r\n         ---data\r\n\r\n         ---Repos\r\n\r\n         ---individualProjectApplication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT longer Stacktrace message**\r\n\r\n        \r\n    2019-10-21 14:04:21.705  INFO 3172 --- [           main] j.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean : Initialized JPA EntityManagerFactory for persistence unit &#39;default&#39;\r\n    2019-10-21 14:04:21.716  WARN 3172 --- [           main] ConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext : Exception encountered during context initialization - cancelling refresh attempt: org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name &#39;boulderController&#39;: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through field &#39;repo&#39;; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type &#39;com.nationwide.individualproject.Repos.BoulderRepo&#39; available: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate.

(1) Areas under distribution curve for Condition A to E are\r\n&gt; sequentially colored with &quot;#009B9F&quot;, &quot;#5EBCBF&quot;, &quot;#C6DFE0&quot;, &quot;#E9D4E2&quot;,\r\n&gt; &quot;#D99BC5&quot;;\r\n\r\nTranslating this into ggplot-speak, you want `condition` mapped onto the `fill` aesthetic, then you want a custom fill color scale with the values `c(&quot;#009B9F&quot;, &quot;#5EBCBF&quot;, &quot;#C6DFE0&quot;, &quot;#E9D4E2&quot;, &quot;#D99BC5&quot;)`.\r\n\r\n(I&#39;ll put comments in each block where something has changed)\r\n\r\n```r\r\nm %&gt;%\r\n  spread_draws(b_Intercept, r_condition[condition,]) %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(condition_mean = b_Intercept + r_condition) %&gt;%\r\n  # map condition onto fill here ------------------------\\/\r\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = condition_mean, fill = condition)) +\r\n  stat_halfeyeh() +\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) +\r\n  # change the fill scale to use your values ------------\\/\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;#009B9F&quot;, &quot;#5EBCBF&quot;, &quot;#C6DFE0&quot;, &quot;#E9D4E2&quot;, &quot;#D99BC5&quot;))\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![plot with manual fill scale][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSidebar: I&#39;m not sure I would use a manual color scale for this: it&#39;s usually easier and better to use pre-made color scales from places like [Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html), [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&amp;scheme=BuGn&amp;n=3), or [HCL Wizard](http://hclwizard.org/) --- these color scales are designed for things like colorblind safety, perceptual uniformity, good desaturation, etc. Also this example uses categorical data and the color scale you provided has a natural order to it; I hope your real data is ordinal and not categorical, as otherwise the color scale implies an ordering that does not exist in the data.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the next question:\r\n\r\n&gt; (2) For distribution whose posterior mean is positive (i.e., Condition\r\n&gt; A to D), assign larger alpha value (less transparent) to regions under\r\n&gt; the curve that are to the right of the 0 line and assign lower alpha\r\n&gt; value (more transparent) to regions under the curve that are to the\r\n&gt; left of the 0 line;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; (3) For distribution whose posterior mean is negative (i.e., Condition\r\n&gt; E), assign lower alpha value (more transparent) 0 to regions under the\r\n&gt; curve that are to the right of the 0 line and assign higher alpha\r\n&gt; value (less transparent) to regions under the curve that are to the\r\n&gt; left of the 0 line.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean here, so I&#39;m going to try two different things.\r\n\r\nOne possibility is this: you want to map the `x` value onto the `alpha` aesthetic, but you want to reverse this relationship if the mean of `condition_mean` is less than 0 (I&#39;ll actually use the `slab_alpha` aesthetic, which specifically targets the slab portion of this geom and leaves the intervals alone). I&#39;ll start by doing the straightforward `slab_alpha` mapping:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nm %&gt;%\r\n  spread_draws(b_Intercept, r_condition[condition,]) %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(condition_mean = b_Intercept + r_condition) %&gt;%\r\n  # map x value onto alpha -------------------------------------------\\/\r\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = condition_mean, fill = condition, slab_alpha = stat(x))) +\r\n  stat_halfeyeh() +\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;#009B9F&quot;, &quot;#5EBCBF&quot;, &quot;#C6DFE0&quot;, &quot;#E9D4E2&quot;, &quot;#D99BC5&quot;))\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![simple slab_alpha mapping][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately you should see a problem: your manual color scale also uses the alpha channel, and these two mappings combine in a confusing way. So I am going to switch to a color palette from ColorBrewer that does not use the alpha channel:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nm %&gt;%\r\n  spread_draws(b_Intercept, r_condition[condition,]) %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(condition_mean = b_Intercept + r_condition) %&gt;%\r\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = condition_mean, fill = condition, slab_alpha = stat(x))) +\r\n  stat_halfeyeh() +\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) +\r\n  # categorical palette that doesn&#39;t vary alpha much:\r\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![alpha with color brewer palette][3]][3]\r\n\r\nFor the next part, you have to split the alpha mapping in two (I don&#39;t think it is possible to do this without splitting the data, as ggplot currently does not support mixing columns from the original data with columns computed by a statistic). You can pass functions (including purrr-style `~` functions) to the `data` argument of stats and geoms and these functions are applied to the data, which allows you to easily split up the data inside ggplot. In addition, because `spread_draws` groups by all indices in the expression you pass it (in this case, `conditions`), the data are already grouped by `condition`, so an expression like `mean(condition_mean)` will calculate the mean of `condition_mean` within each level of `condition`. That allows you to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nm %&gt;%\r\n  spread_draws(b_Intercept, r_condition[condition,]) %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(condition_mean = b_Intercept + r_condition) %&gt;%\r\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = condition_mean, fill = condition)) +\r\n  # move alpha mapping here and split halfeye spec in two\r\n  stat_halfeyeh(aes(slab_alpha = stat(x)), data = ~ filter(., mean(condition_mean) &gt; 0)) +\r\n  stat_halfeyeh(aes(slab_alpha = -stat(x)), data = ~ filter(., mean(condition_mean) &lt; 0)) +\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) +\r\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![split alpha, continuous][4]][4]\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might have been asking for a hard change in alpha value. For that you just want something like `stat(x &lt; 0)` or `stat(x &gt; 0)` instead of `stat(x)` or \r\n`-stat(x)`:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nm %&gt;%\r\n  spread_draws(b_Intercept, r_condition[condition,]) %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(condition_mean = b_Intercept + r_condition) %&gt;%\r\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = condition_mean, fill = condition)) +\r\n  # use binary alpha mapping\r\n  stat_halfeyeh(aes(slab_alpha = stat(x &gt; 0)), data = ~ filter(., mean(condition_mean) &gt; 0)) +\r\n  stat_halfeyeh(aes(slab_alpha = stat(x &lt; 0)), data = ~ filter(., mean(condition_mean) &lt; 0)) +\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) +\r\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![split alpha, binary][5]][5]\r\n\r\nFinally, in general if you are trying to use alpha to emphasize things that are more likely far from 0 on either side, I would be inclined not to define that mapping on the basis of which side the mean is on --- it seems a little backwards to ignore the uncertainty to decide which side it is on on the bases of the mean alone.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a simpler alternative that just encodes distance from 0 (i.e. `abs(x)`) on the alpha aesthetic:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nm %&gt;%\r\n  spread_draws(b_Intercept, r_condition[condition,]) %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(condition_mean = b_Intercept + r_condition) %&gt;%\r\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = condition_mean, fill = condition)) +\r\n  \r\n  # use alpha mapping with abs(x)\r\n  stat_halfeyeh(aes(slab_alpha = stat(abs(x)))) +\r\n  \r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) +\r\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![alpha channel on distance from 0][6]][6]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/95BXM.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvFMD.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGGtw.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WFPDc.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/slFUG.png\r\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/N779B.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484405/customize-transparancy-of-halfeye-plot-in-tidybayes/58490608#58490608","title":"Customize transparancy of halfeye plot in tidybayes"}],"owner":{"reputation":143,"user_id":4923935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nDg7_hVVcOM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/G4BjC6ucHro/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Patrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4923935/patrick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":143,"user_id":4923935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nDg7_hVVcOM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/G4BjC6ucHro/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Patrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4923935/patrick"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58490608,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571676548,"creation_date":1571653761,"last_edit_date":1571666041,"question_id":58484405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484405","body_markdown":"I am using tidybayes to generate half-eye plot to illustrate distribution of posterior draws, following the example [here][1].\r\n\r\nWith the following code:\r\n\r\n    library(magrittr)\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n    library(purrr)\r\n    library(forcats)\r\n    library(tidyr)\r\n    library(modelr)\r\n    library(tidybayes)\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    library(ggstance)\r\n    library(ggridges)\r\n    library(cowplot)\r\n    library(rstan)\r\n    library(brms)\r\n    library(ggrepel)\r\n    library(RColorBrewer)\r\n    library(gganimate)\r\n    \r\n    theme_set(theme_tidybayes() + panel_border())\r\n    \r\n    rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)\r\n    options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())\r\n    \r\n    set.seed(5)\r\n    n = 10\r\n    n_condition = 5\r\n    ABC =\r\n      tibble(\r\n        condition = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot;), n),\r\n        response = rnorm(n * 5, c(0,1,2,1,-1), 0.5)\r\n      )\r\n    \r\n    m = brm(response ~ (1|condition), data = ABC, control = list(adapt_delta = .99),\r\n      prior = c(\r\n        prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept),\r\n        prior(student_t(3, 0, 1), class = sd),\r\n        prior(student_t(3, 0, 1), class = sigma)\r\n      ))\r\n    \r\n    m %&gt;%\r\n      spread_draws(b_Intercept, r_condition[condition,]) %&gt;%\r\n      mutate(condition_mean = b_Intercept + r_condition) %&gt;%\r\n      ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = condition_mean, fill = stat(x &lt;

So the pattern is [`~\\b(?:star|wars)\\b~i`](https://regex101.com/r/8t0NNz/1).

You haven&#39;t included the column chosen in your `EXPLAIN` snippet but it&#39;s probably the first column in the join. \r\n\r\n`DS_BCAST_INNER` is broadcasting a _complete_ copy of `tmp_accumulate` to every node. Both of these operations are quite expensive and slow.\r\n\r\nYour join is very wide and it seems like the first column is quite skewed. You could try 2 approaches to resolve the skew and prevent the broadcast:\r\n\r\n1. Change the order of columns declared in the join to declare the _most_ unique (or _least_ skewed) column first. The first column will typically be used as the redistribution key. (NB: This would not work if the tables were already diststyle key.) \r\n2. _Recommended_. Since the join is so complex and skewed you could _pre-calculate_ a hash value across these columns and then join on that value.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n--Example of Pre-Calculated Hash\r\nCREATE TEMP TABLE tmp_predict \r\n    DISTKEY(dist_hash)\r\nAS SELECT FUNC_SHA1(pd||idate::VARCHAR||aid::VARCHAR||pf::VARCHAR\r\n                      ||is::VARCHAR||camp::VARCHAR||ua_camp_id::VARCHAR\r\n                      ||country::VARCHAR) dist_hash\r\n         ,pd ,idate ,aid ,pf ,is ,camp ,ua_camp_id, country\r\n         ,…\r\n     FROM …\r\n;\r\nCREATE TEMP TABLE tmp_accumulate \r\n    DISTKEY(dist_hash)\r\nAS SELECT FUNC_SHA1(pd||idate::VARCHAR||aid::VARCHAR||pf::VARCHAR\r\n                      ||is::VARCHAR||camp::VARCHAR||ua_camp_id::VARCHAR\r\n                      ||country::VARCHAR) dist_hash\r\n         ,pd ,idate ,aid ,pf ,is ,camp ,ua_camp_id, country\r\n         ,…\r\n     FROM …\r\n;\r\nINSERT INTO report.agg_info\r\nSELECT …\r\nFROM    tmp_predict p\r\nJOIN    tmp_accumulate ar\r\n    ON  p.dist_hash = ar.dist_hash\r\n;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484326/is-there-any-better-way-to-avoid-data-skew-by-join-in-redshift/58488339#58488339","title":"Is there any better way to avoid data skew by join in Redshift?"}],"owner":{"reputation":25872,"user_id":3011380,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oN76M.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zangw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3011380/zangw"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58488339,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571667777,"creation_date":1571653511,"question_id":58484326,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484326","body_markdown":"The query SQL as below cause one node of Redshift cluster disk full\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ninsert\r\ninto\r\n  report.agg_info\r\n  ( pd ,idate ,idate_str ,app_class ,app_superset ,aid ,pf ,is ,camp ,ua_camp_id ,country ,is_predict ,cohort_size ,new_users ,retained ,acc_re ,day_iap_rev ,iap_rev ,day_rev ,rev ) \r\nselect\r\n    p.pd ,\r\n    p.idate ,\r\n    p.idate_str ,\r\n    p.app_class ,\r\n    p.app_superset ,\r\n    p.aid ,\r\n    p.pf ,\r\n    p.is ,\r\n    p.camp ,\r\n    p.ua_camp_id ,\r\n    p.country ,\r\n    1 as is_predict ,\r\n    p.cohort_size ,\r\n    p.new_users ,\r\n    p.retained ,\r\n    ar.acc_re ,\r\n    p.day_iap_rev ,\r\n    ar.iap_rev ,\r\n    p.day_rev ,\r\n    ar.rev\r\nfrom\r\n    tmp_predict p\r\njoin\r\n    tmp_accumulate ar\r\n        on p.pd = ar.pd\r\n        and p.idate = ar.idate\r\n        and p.aid = ar.aid\r\n        and p.pf = ar.pf\r\n        and p.is = ar.is\r\n        and p.camp = ar.camp\r\n        and p.ua_camp_id = ar.ua_camp_id\r\n        and p.country = ar.country\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd query plan is\r\n\r\n```\r\nXN Hash Join DS_DIST_BOTH (cost=11863664.64..218084556052252.12 rows=23020733790769 width=218)\r\n    -&gt; XN Seq Scan on tmp_predict p (cost=0.00..3954554.88 rows=395455488 width=188)\r\n    -&gt; XN Hash (cost=3954554.88..3954554.88 rows=395455488 width=165)\r\n      -&gt; XN Seq Scan on tmp_accumulate ar (cost=0.00..3954554.88 rows=395455488 width=165)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nFrom the above image we know `node-39` hold more data than other nodes.

You can define the number as:\r\n\r\n    number int identity(1, 1)\r\n\r\nIf you want the value as a string padded to eight characters, then use a computed column:\r\n\r\n    number_string as (format(number, &#39;00000000&#39;)) \r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nThere are strong reasons why you want an `identity` column and not to calculate the values yourself.  You can do what you want using `row_number()`, where the logic looks like this:\r\n\r\n    insert into table1(id ,.., field,...)\r\n        select newid(), ...,\r\n               convert(varchar(8),\r\n                       (coalesce(t1.max_number, 0) + \r\n                        row_number() over (order by (select null))\r\n                       )\r\n                      )\r\n         from table2 t2 cross join\r\n              (select max(t1.number) as max_number from table1 t1) t1;\r\n    \r\n    N\r\n\r\nNote:  I am assuming that the inserts are coming from a different table, but `table2` can really be `table1`.\r\n\r\nVery importantly:  **This is not thread safe.**  Two different threads can run the same code and result in the same values.  The solution to this is locking the entire table.

I therefore *hope* that `id` isn&#39;t your `CLUSTERED INDEX`, as if it is `NEWID()` is not doing it any favours. If you are using a `uniqueindentifier` for your `CLUSTERED INDEX`, use `NEWSEQUENTIALID()` instead, and don&#39;t provuide the value in the `INSERT`:\r\n\r\n    ALTER TABLE dbo.Table1 ADD CONSTRAINT DF_Table1_id DEFAULT NEWSEQUENTIALID() FOR id;\r\n\r\nAs for your `INSERT`, as I said in my comment: *&quot;Use an `IDENTITY` column. If you **must** then have sequential values, use a `VIEW` and `ROW_NUMBER`. Let SQL Server gracefully handle the incrementing value. Trying to increment the number yourself is going to only cause you problems, such as race conditions, and your data will be in a far worse position.&quot;*. Unfortunately you can&#39;t change an existing column to an `IDENTITY`, so this is a little harder. Likely you&#39;ll want to do something like:\r\n\r\n    ALTER TABLE dbo.Table1 ADD number_new int IDENTITY(1,1);\r\n    GO\r\n    \r\n    SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.Table1 ON;\r\n    --UPdate the new column with the existing values\r\n    UPDATE dbo.Table1\r\n    SET number_new = number;\r\n    \r\n    SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.Table1 OFF;\r\n    GO\r\n    --Drop the old column and rename\r\n    ALTER TABLE dbo.Table1 DROP COLUMN number;\r\n    EXEC sp_rename N&#39;dbo.Table1.number_new&#39;, N&#39;number&#39;, N&#39;COLUMN&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Gordon said, if you simply then need a formatted value (with leading 0&#39;s) and no worry about gaps, use a computed column:\r\n\r\n    ALTER TABLE dbo.Table1 ADD Number_f AS RIGHT(CONCAT(&#39;00000000&#39;,number),8) PERSISTED;\r\n\r\nIf, however, you want them to be in sequential order, and update accordingly when a row is deleted, or a `INSERT` fails, etc, then you can use a view, with the following expression:\r\n\r\n    RIGHT(CONCAT(&#39;00000000&#39;,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY number ASC),8)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484307/max-value-in-insert-into/58484675#58484675","title":"max value in insert into"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12213074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1222ede181539ae099fff57f883ef3a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"marko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12213074/marko"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571654988,"creation_date":1571653469,"question_id":58484307,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484307","body_markdown":"I need to get the maximum number in a column because in a insert operation I have to insert max number in that column +1 for each insert, I did this:\r\n\r\n    insert into table1(id ,.., field,...)\r\n    select newid(), ..., (SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), FORMAT((MAX(number)+1),&#39;00000000&#39;))\r\n       FROM table1)\r\n\r\nIt works just for the first inserted row, than I get this number for other rows too!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484307/max-value-in-insert-into","title":"max value in insert into"},{"tags":["outlook","office-js","office-addins","outlook-web-addins","outlook-web-app"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4343,"user_id":7823505,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWz8s.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Outlook Add-ins Team - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7823505/outlook-add-ins-team-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571821761,"post_id":58484305,"comment_id":103364394,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484305/recurrence-information-is-wrong-when-changed-in-editor#comment103364394_58484305"}],"owner":{"reputation":835,"user_id":4245484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c5d8d91277f818c4ea693f2b76dde1a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christian Frommeyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4245484/christian-frommeyer"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571653468,"creation_date":1571653468,"question_id":58484305,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484305","body_markdown":"When editing an Appointment in Outlook for the Web, the Add-In will always get the same recurrence information for an item while it is open.

is possible to find the value of characters that cannot be represented in the VBIDE by pasting them into an empty Word document and then using VBA to print the AscW values of each character in the

The file opening/saving/closing part is handled in Python/win32com and works fine. My big point of contention is still the VBA macro.\r\n\r\nI know there is a regex ***(\\p{Han})*** that should be able to catch all Chinese characters, but this does not seem to work in VBA. Similarly, I have tried using Unicode Ranges and Chr(W). Nothing so far produced any output, let alone correct output. \r\nOut of frustration, I made one last ditch attempt and simply inverted the search paramters. This is how it is now:\r\n\r\n    Sub FindReplace_zh(Rng As Range)\r\n        With Rng.Find\r\n            Do While .Execute(FindText:=&quot;[!A-Z&#196;&#214;&#220;a-z&#228;&#246;&#252;0-9&gt;&lt;_ ^11^13&#167;$&#178;&#179;%#&amp;/\\+-]&quot;, MatchWildcards:=True)\r\n                If Rng.Font.Bold = True And Rng.Font.Name Like &quot;Arial*&quot; Then\r\n                    Rng.Font.Name = &quot;SimHei&quot;\r\n                ElseIf Rng.Font.Bold = False And Rng.Font.Name Like &quot;Arial*&quot; Then\r\n                    Rng.Font.Name = &quot;SimSun&quot;\r\n                End If\r\n                Rng.Collapse 0\r\n            Loop\r\n        End With\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nAT LEAST THIS WORKS, but its far from elegant and still produces some undesired output.\r\n\r\nI have yet to understand how I can substitute &quot;*[!A-Z&#196;&#214;&#220;a-z&#228;&#246;&#252;0-9&gt;&lt;_ ^11^13&#167;$&#178;&#179;%#&amp;/\\+-]*&quot; with a variable, or most anything else. Many characters are not covered by this regex, such as &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot; etc., but adding them (even escaped with \\) will result in runtime errors in VBA.\r\nI found a lot of tutorials and questions dealing with removing or inserting text, but my specific case of finding text and then changing the font, while leaving everything else untouched, seems rather specific.\r\n\r\nFun fact:\r\nI had to add ^11 and ^13 to the regex list, as not including them would lead to the Macro inserting new linebreaks in random positions of the .doc\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nNew try with comment:\r\n\r\n    Dim searchPattern As String\r\n    searchPattern = &quot;[&quot; &amp; ChrW(&amp;H2E80) &amp; &quot;-&quot; &amp; ChrW(&amp;HFFED) &amp; &quot;]{1,}&quot;\r\n        With Rng.Find\r\n            Do While .Execute(FindText:=searchPattern, MatchWildcards:=True)\r\n\r\nInvalid operation on final line!\r\nI also would not have concatinated a string like this. I am not sure how VBA parses this, but apprently not the way we hoped.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: **FIX**\r\n\r\nRemoving &quot;{1,}&quot; from searchPattern did it.
