As a result in git every single model shows up as being changed when in reality nothing was actually changed other than spacing. I tried to look for a setting which could change this but had no luck. Restarted VS a couple of times and tried to right click on edmx file and &quot;Run Custom Tool&quot; but no luck.\r\n\r\nI have several coworkers who are running 16.1.3 and have no issues, so it looks like it could be something that changed/broke in a new release.

In my example the Groovy-file is called Prebuild which contains a funtion ```getBranchNames()``` where I get all branches from a svn-repro.\r\n\r\n```\r\npipeline {\r\n  agent any\r\n  libraries {\r\n    lib(&#39;PreBuild&#39;)\r\n  }\r\n  stages {\r\n    stage(&#39;Set Parameters&#39;) {\r\n      steps {\r\n        timeout(time: 30, unit: &#39;SECONDS&#39;) {\r\n          script {\r\n            def INPUT_PARAMS = input message: &#39;Please Provide Parameters&#39;, ok: &#39;Next&#39;, parameters: [choice(name: &#39;Branch_Choice&#39;, choices: PreBuild.getBranchNames(), description: &#39;Which Branch?&#39;)]\r\n          }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe corrospending Prebuild.groovy file looks like this:\r\n```\r\nimport groovy.util.XmlSlurper\r\ndef getBranchNames(){\r\n    def svn = bat(returnStdout: true, script: &#39;svn ls https://svn-repro --xml --username John --password Doe --non-interactive --trust-server-cert&#39;).trim()\r\n    def result = svn.readLines().drop(1).join(&quot; &quot;)\r\n    def slurper = new XmlSlurper()\r\n    def xml = slurper.parseText(result)\r\n    def name = new ArrayList()\r\n    name.addAll(xml.&#39;*&#39;.&#39;*&#39;.&#39;name&#39;)\r\n    return name.join(&#39;\\n&#39;)   \r\n}\r\n```\r\nI parse the svn-command output into an arraylist and return it as a joined string back to my pipeline job.\r\n\r\nBe aware that your other Groovy-file has to be in a SCM too.

Let&#39;s call it `arr` instead.\r\n\r\nYou want to treat that block of space in the BSS as an array qword elements.  So each element is 8 bytes.  **So you need to store to `arr+0`, `arr+8`, and `arr+16`.**  (The total size of your array is 10000 bytes, which is 10000/8 qwords).\r\n\r\nBut you&#39;re using `%r8` as a byte offset, not a scaled-index.  That&#39;s generally a good thing, all else equal; indexed addressing modes are slower in some cases on some CPUs.  But the problem is you only increment it by `1` with `inc`, not with **`add $8, %r8`**.\r\n\r\nSo **you&#39;re actually storing to `arr+0`, `arr+1`, and `arr+2`, with 8-byte stores that overlap each other**, leaving just the least-significant byte of the last store.  x86 is little-endian so the resulting contents of memory is effectively this, followed by the rest of the unwritten bytes that stay zero.\r\n\r\n    # static array that matches what you actually stored\r\n    arr: .byte 500 &amp; 0xFF, 10, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r\n\r\nYou could of course just use `.qword` in the `.data` section to declare a static array with the contents you want.  But with only the first 3 element non-zero, putting it in the BSS makes sense for one that large, instead of a having the OS page in the zeros from disk.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re going to fully unroll instead of using a loop over your 3-element qword array starting at `par4`, you don&#39;t need to increment a register at all.  You also don&#39;t need the initializers to be in data memory, you can just use immediates because they all fit as 32-bit sign-extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n  # these are assemble-time constants, not associated with a section\r\n.equ par4, 500\r\n.equ par5, 10\r\n.equ par6, 15\r\n\r\n.text  # already the default section but whatever\r\n\r\n.globl _start\r\n_start:\r\n    movq    $par4, arr(%rip)            # use RIP-relative addressing when there&#39;s no register\r\n    movq    $par5, arr+8(%rip)\r\n    movq    $par6, arr+16(%rip)\r\n\r\n    mov $60, %eax\r\n    syscall               # Linux exit(0)\r\n\r\n.bss\r\n    arr:   .skip 10000\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can run that under GDB and examine memory to see what you get.  (Compile it with `gcc -nostdlib -static foo.s`).  In GDB, start the program with `starti` (to stop at the entry point), then single-step with `si`.  Use `x /4g  &amp;arr` to dump the contents of memory at `arr` as an array of 4 qwords.\r\n\r\nOr if you did want to use a register, might as well just loop a pointer instead of an index.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    lea     arr(%rip), %rdi           # or mov $arr, %edi in a non-PIE executable\r\n    movq    $par4, (%rdi)\r\n    add     $8, %rdi                  # advance the pointer 8 bytes = 1 element\r\n    movq    $par5, (%rdi)\r\n    add     $8, %rdi\r\n    movq    $par6, (%rdi)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr scaled-index:\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Scaled-index addressing\r\n    movq    $par4, arr(%rip)\r\n    mov     $1, %eax\r\n    movq    $par5, arr(,%rax,8)       # [arr + rax*8]\r\n    inc     %eax\r\n    movq    $par6, arr(,%rax,8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFun trick: you could just do a byte store instead of a qword store to set the low byte, and leave the rest zero.  This would save code-size but if you did a qword load right away, you&#39;d get a store-forwarding stall.

A PVC with its storageClassName set equal to &quot;&quot; is always interpreted to be requesting a PV with no class, so it can only be bound to PVs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to &quot;&quot;). A PVC with no storageClassName is not quite the same and is treated differently by the cluster, depending on whether the DefaultStorageClass admission plugin is turned on.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mysql#persistence\r\n  [3]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#class-1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402101/kubernetes-helm-mysql-chart-loses-stored-data-after-stopping-pod/58411767#58411767","title":"Kubernetes -- Helm -- Mysql Chart loses stored data after stopping pod"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":8422937,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/314026beabfddb3fc18fa2ac6763b486?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Binyata","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8422937/binyata"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26349,"user_id":10008173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3ea5d6d5d63e054acb8cfa95a39240d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David Maze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10008173/david-maze"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571223689,"creation_date":1571170744,"last_edit_date":1571179904,"question_id":58402101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402101","body_markdown":"Using https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mysql (all the code is here), it is cool being able to run mysql as part of my local kubernetes cluster (using docker kubernetes).\r\n\r\nThe problem though is that once I stop running the pod, and then run the pod again, all the data that was stored is now gone. \r\n\r\nMy question is how do I keep the data that was added to the mysql pod?

you insist on using rand ([which you really shouldn&#39;t](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7114482/2602718)), you can divide by RAND_MAX to get you a percentage:\r\n\r\n    double rand_val = (double)rand() / RAND_MAX;\r\n\r\nYou have a range of .05 (5-10%), so multiply that percentage by .05 to figure out how far between 5% and 10% you&#39;ll be.

your `Employee` and `Department` classes are like so:\r\n\r\n    public class Employee\r\n    {\r\n        public string FirstName { get; set; }\r\n        public string LastName { get; set; }\r\n

filter your `Employee` data in your `ViewModel` and create a list of `DisplayEmployee`:\r\n\r\n    Employees = new List&lt;Employee&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        new Employee() { FirstName = &quot;A&quot;, LastName = &quot;Z&quot;, DepartmentFK = &quot;D1&quot; },\r\n        new Employee() { FirstName = &quot;B&quot;, LastName = &quot;Y&quot;, DepartmentFK = &quot;D2&quot; },\r\n        new Employee() {

},\r\n        new Employee() { FirstName = &quot;E&quot;, LastName = &quot;V&quot;, DepartmentFK = &quot;D2&quot; }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    Departments = new List&lt;Department&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        new Department() { ID = &quot;D1&quot;, Dept = &quot;Department 01&quot; },\r\n        new Department() { ID = &quot;D2&quot;, Dept = &quot;Department 02&quot; },\r\n        new Department() { ID = &quot;D3&quot;, Dept = &quot;Department 03&quot; },\r\n        new Department() { ID = &quot;D4&quot;, Dept = &quot;Department 04&quot; }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    DisplayEmployees = new List&lt;DisplayEmployee&gt;();\r\n    foreach (var emp in Employees)\r\n    {\r\n        DisplayEmployees.Add(\r\n        new DisplayEmployee()\r\n        {\r\n            FirstName =

`XAML`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ListView Name=&quot;Employees_Listview&quot; \r\n              ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding DisplayEmployees, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}&quot; \r\n

&lt;/ListView.View&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ListView&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nEdit\r\n--\r\nYou can even make the `DisplayEmployee` a derived class of `Employee`:\r\n\r\n    public class DisplayEmployee :

have 2 `ObservableCollections` (`Employees` --&gt; FirstName, LastName, DepartmentFK / `Departments` --&gt; Id, Department). `Employees` contains a foreign key (`DepartmentFK`) which is linked to `Id` (`departments` table) on my database tables. \r\n\r\nWhat I want is to display all employees including the department name (instead of the foreign key integer)\r\n\r\nMy XAML looks like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ListView Name=&quot;Employees_Listview&quot; ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding Employees, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}&quot; SelectedItem=&quot;{Binding YourSelectedItem, Mode=TwoWay}&quot; Height=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;ListView.View&gt;\r\n            &lt;GridView&gt;\r\n                &lt;GridViewColumn Header=&quot;FirstName&quot; DisplayMemberBinding=&quot;{Binding

So, either you implement some logic that tells which naming scheme you are parsing (and this depends on who/what provides the files) or you always extract the sample name from the parent directory as this should work also for the first case (but again, assuming you can rely on such naming scheme).\r\n\r\nIf you want to go for the second option, something like this should do:\r\n\r\n    FILES = {}\r\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(&#39;RNAseqTutorial&#39;):\r\n        for file in files:\r\n            if file.endswith(&quot;fastq.gz&quot;):\r\n                sample = os.path.basename(root)\r\n                full_path = os.path.join(root, file)\r\n                if sample not in FILES:\r\n                    FILES[sample]= {}\r\n                if &#39;R1&#39; in file:\r\n                    reads = &#39;R1&#39;\r\n                elif &#39;R2&#39; in file:\r\n                    reads = &#39;R2&#39;\r\n                else:\r\n                    raise Exception(&#39;Unexpected file name&#39;)\r\n                if reads not in FILES[sample]:\r\n                    FILES[sample][reads] = []\r\n                FILES[sample][reads].append(full_path)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402058/altering-snakemake-workflow-to-anticipate-and-accommodate-different-data-structu/58414902#58414902","title":"Altering snakemake workflow to anticipate and accommodate different data-structures"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":550,"user_id":9544516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GEe1L.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maarten-vd-Sande","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9544516/maarten-vd-sande"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571233634,"creation_date":1571233634,"answer_id":58414910,"question_id":58402058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58414910","body_markdown":"Not sure if I understand correctly, but here you go:\r\n\r\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(args):\r\n        for file in files:\r\n            if file.endswith(&quot;fq.gz&quot;):\r\n                full_path = join(root, file)\r\n                reads = &#39;R1&#39; if &#39;R1&#39; in file else &#39;R2&#39;\r\n                sample = root.split(&#39;/&#39;)[-1]\r\n                FILES[sample][reads].append(full_path)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402058/altering-snakemake-workflow-to-anticipate-and-accommodate-different-data-structu/58414910#58414910","title":"Altering snakemake workflow to anticipate and accommodate different data-structures"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11937854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0ced71d0fe5728de1f90e30cb0db724?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Manninm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11937854/manninm"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11937854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0ced71d0fe5728de1f90e30cb0db724?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Manninm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11937854/manninm"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571411168,"creation_date":1571170526,"last_edit_date":1571411168,"question_id":58402058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402058","body_markdown":"I have an existing snakemake RNAseq workflow that works fine with a directory tree as below.

Is there another module or function other than os.walk? Could I somehow force os.walk to skip a directory and merge the part and sample prefixes? Any suggestions would be helpful!\r\n\r\nEdited to add:\r\nI wasn&#39;t clear in describing my problem, and noticed that the second example wasn&#39;t representative of the problem, and I fixed the examples accordingly, because the second tree was taken from a directory processed by someone else. Data I get comes in two forms, either samples of only one tissue, where the directory consists of WD, sampled folders, and fastq files, where the fastq files have the same prefix as the sample folders that they reside in. The second example is of samples from two tissues. These tissues must be processed separate from each other. But tissues from both types can be found in separate &quot;Parts&quot;, but tissues of the same type from different &quot;Parts&quot; must be processed together. If I could get os.walk to return four tuples, or even use \r\n```bash\r\nroot,dirs,files*=os.walk(&#39;Somedirectory&#39;)\r\n```\r\nwhere the * would append the rest of the directory string to the files variable. Unfortunately, this method does not go to the file level for the third child directory &#39;root/part/sample/fastq&#39;. In an ideal world, the same snakemake pipeline would be able to handle both scenarios with minimal input from the user. I understand that this may not be possible, but I figured I ask and see if there was a module that could return all portions of each sample directory string.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402058/altering-snakemake-workflow-to-anticipate-and-accommodate-different-data-structu","title":"Altering snakemake workflow to anticipate and accommodate different data-structures"},{"tags":["kubernetes"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32971,"user_id":78722,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf611565f0b79abd0b3dc200ad867661?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"coderanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/78722/coderanger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571171336,"post_id":58402057,"comment_id":103149384,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402057/where-is-the-kubectl-command-get-executed#comment103149384_58402057"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":908,"user_id":11560878,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/96A5r.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"OhHiMark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11560878/ohhimark"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10249980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zoqWfSBSo0U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/Cy3yvUof-yM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Penguin Tech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10249980/penguin-tech"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571212203,"post_id":58403073,"comment_id":103160444,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402057/where-is-the-kubectl-command-get-executed/58403073#comment103160444_58403073"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":583,"user_id":1304288,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68feb45198b177ca2df2a81e63c39f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Yinzara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1304288/yinzara"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571176031,"creation_date":1571176031,"answer_id":58403073,"question_id":58402057,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58403073","body_markdown":"The `kubectl` command itself is a command line utility that always executes locally however all it really does is issue commands against a Kubernetes server via its [Kubernetes API][1] \r\n\r\nWhich Kubernetes server it acts against is determined by the local environment the command is run with.

I have an output called `df` that came from a pandas dataframe created within a loop of many films like this, so each `df` is the data for one film:\r\n\r\n    df = pandas.get_dummies(data=df, columns=[&#39;genre1&#39;, &#39;genre2&#39;, &#39;genre3&#39;, &#39;genre4&#39;])\r\n    df = df.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(&#39;genre1_&#39;, &#39;&#39;))\r\n    df = df.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(&#39;genre2_&#39;, &#39;&#39;))\r\n    df = df.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(&#39;genre3_&#39;, &#39;&#39;))\r\n    df = df.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(&#39;genre4_&#39;, &#39;&#39;))\r\n    df = pd.concat([df[col].sum(axis=1).rename(col) if len(df[col].shape)==2 else\r\n                    df[col] for col in df.columns.unique()],axis=1)\r\n    print(df)\r\n    with open(&#39;test.csv&#39;, &#39;a&#39;) as f:\r\n        df.to_csv(f, mode=&#39;a&#39;, header=f.tell()==0)\r\n\r\nbut the problem is that with each loop there are different genres to the loop before.\r\n\r\nSo for the first loop the output looks like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n\r\n    title     runTime    comedy    action    drama   biography  ......\r\n    film1      90mins      1         1         1         1\r\n\r\nwhich then gets assigned to the csv\r\n\r\nBut on the next iteration of the loop the next film is as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n\r\n    title     runTime    comedy    action    history     ......\r\n    film2      90mins      1         1         1\r\n\r\nI now what it to create a new column called `history` and have a one in that row for `film2` but a `0` for `film1` and assign `0` to the `biography` and `drama` columns on `film2`.\r\n\r\nCurrently it simply creates the first film as the default and then thinks every other film has the same genres.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the first iteration produces a df that looks like this like this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSecond iteration looks like this:\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3uVk2.png\r\n  [2]:

You should of course ask yourself whether you want this to work to start with, and whether you simply shouldn&#39;t explicitly handle one level of nesting and stop there.\r\n\r\nTo support arbitrary nesting, what you&#39;d want is a special case for when `Point` includes another `Point` inside of it: these are then &quot;peeled away&quot;, since the result type for `Point&lt;Point&lt;T&gt;, U&gt;` is declared as the result of addition of `Point&lt;T&gt;` and `U`.\r\n\r\nFinally, I imagine that you&#39;re assuming that `std::common_type&lt;T,U&gt;` results in the same type as `T{}+U{}`, so that the addition via the `Point` indirection works just like addition on the most interior fields would work.

But when the input is `5 -3` (or anything else with a space before the `-`) the parse fails, because `scanf` does not immediately see the `-` it expects.\r\n\r\nIf that&#39;s not what you expected, or not what you want, or if that doesn&#39;t make sense, or if that&#39;s not how you&#39;d like `scanf` to work, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s too bad: `scanf` works the way it works.\r\n\r\nHow can you fix this?  That depends in part on why you included the `-` character in your format string in the first place.\r\n\r\n* You can use `%d%d` or `%d %d`, which will simply read two integers (separated by at least one whitespace character).  If there&#39;s a `-` character preceding the second integer, that integer will be read as negative.\r\n* You can use `%d -%d`, which will skip (arbitrary) whitespace before it tries to match the `-` character.\r\n* You can use two separate `scanf` calls.\r\n* If you do continue to use `scanf`, you really need to check its return value so that your program can detect the case that the expected inputs were not matched.\r\n* Finally, you can use something other than `scanf`.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation to you depends on the ultimate purpose of this program.\r\n\r\n* If it&#39;s just for learning, then minimize the amount of time you spend fussing with the way your program does input at all.  For example, if you need to read an integer, use one `%d`.  As long as you can get the numbers you need into your program (so that you can test the rest of your program), you&#39;re fine.  If there are things you can type that cause `scanf` to get confused, just don&#39;t worry about it, just don&#39;t type those things.  Don&#39;t try to do *anything* fancy — that&#39;s not what `scanf` is for.\r\n* If this is a &quot;real&quot; program, that does have to accept arbitrary user input, or input with a specific syntax (like with that `-` in the right place), and if you need to deal gracefully with incorrect input, printing appropriate errors, and not reading the wrong values or getting confused — then run, do not walk, away from `scanf`, and never use it again.  It is effectively impossible to write a program that performs high-quality input using `scanf`.  Not even a C expert can do it.  It&#39;s simply not worth it.  You will spend five times as long, and get an inferior result, than if you simply abandoned `scanf` and read your input a line at a time using `fgets` or the like, then parsed the input line (perhaps even using `sscanf` — but again, check its return value).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAddendum: It&#39;s true, all format specifiers — with three exceptions (`%c`, `%[…]` scan sets, and `%n`) — skip whitespace before beginning their work.  But format specifiers are things that begin with `%`.  Literal characters in the format string must match exactly, and there&#39;s no implicit whitespace skipping for them.  If you want to skip whitespace at spots in the input other than before the `%` format specifiers that do it, you can include a literal whitespace character (usually a single space) in your format string.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58401959/integer-taken-with-scanf-does-not-get-its-intended-value-in-c/58402331#58402331","title":"Integer taken with scanf() does not get its intended value in C"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2320,"user_id":1255551,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8aYa.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"craig65535","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255551/craig65535"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571173367,"creation_date":1571173367,"answer_id":58402603,"question_id":58401959,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58402603","body_markdown":"You need to check the return value of `scanf`.

If so, please point me in the right direction. If not, see below, I&#39;ve been tasked with the following:\r\n\r\nCreate a function that can, **dynamically**, check the database to see if a value is present for a certain object.\r\n\r\nBasically, the user clicks a button which moves an item to another Stage. The next stage **may/may not** have requirements before being able to enter that stage. If requirements are present, there are two data points sent to me:\r\n\r\n - **ReflectionClass** (string) [*I will either use the DbSet string value OR the Class string value here*]\r\n - **ReflectionProperty** (string)\r\n\r\nWith these two pieces of data I need to check the database (*via DbSet preferably, using LINQ or Reflection*).\r\n\r\nThe **ReflectionClass** variable can refer to one of 5 tables in the database. So, essentially, I need a way to say: `db.[DbSet].Any(w=&gt;w.ID == PipelineID &amp;&amp; w.[ReflectionProperty] != null)` or something like this...\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using ExpressionTrees but I can&#39;t get the `Func&lt;T,bool&gt;` to work with a `Type` variable.

Since you aren&#39;t defining the closing of the attribute value specifically, .NET is picking up the / as part of it. As @HereticMonkey pointed out, you don&#39;t need the closing slash anyway. But, you should put quotes around your values regardless. If you have a space in your value, it&#39;ll break at the space where you don&#39;t want it to. For example, if myValue = &quot;My Client Name&quot;, you&#39;ll end up with a rendered tag like so:\r\n\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;client&quot; value=My Client Name/&gt;\r\n\r\nWhich, as you can guess, will end up posting back a value of just &quot;My&quot; because the space designates the end of the attribute.

In C# the result of\r\n\r\n    int x = 5;\r\n    var result = x / 2; // result is 2 and of type int\r\n\r\n... because an integer division is performed. So if integers are involved (not a `double` with no decimals, but a value of type `int` or `long`), make sure to convert to `double` before dividing.\r\n\r\n    int x = 5;\r\n    double result = x / 2; // result is 2.0 because conversion to double is made after division\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n\r\n    int x = 5;\r\n    var result = (double)x / 2; // result is 2.5 and of type double\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\r\n\r\n    int x = 5;\r\n    var result = x / 2.0; // result is 2.5 and of type double\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\r\n\r\n    int x = 5;\r\n    var result = 0.5 * x; // result is 2.5 and of type double\r\n\r\nThe only place in your formula where this could happen is `EstimatedMoisture / 100`, in case `EstimatedMoisture` is of type `int`. If this is the case, fix it with `EstimatedMoisture / 100.0`.\r\n\r\nInstead of `8.04 * Math.Pow(10, -5)`, you can write `8.04e-5`. This avoids rounding effects of `Math.Pow`!\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how `Math.Pow(a, b)` works, but the general formula is `a^b=exp(b*ln(a))`. So instead of writing `Math.Pow(something, 2)`, write `something * something`. This is both, faster and more accurate.\r\n\r\nUsing constants for magic numbers adds clarity. Using temps for common sub-expressions makes the formula more readable.\r\n\r\n    const double mmHg_to_kPa = 0.133322;\r\n    const double g0 = 9.80665;\r\n\r\n    var p = preTestTestingDetails;\r\n    double moisture = EstimatedMoisture / 100.0;\r\n    double dryness = 1.0 - moisture;\r\n    double pressure_mmHg = p.BarometricPressure / mmHg_to_kPa;\r\n    double nozzleMean2 = p.NozzleMean * p.NozzleMean;\r\n    double nozzleMean4 = nozzleMean2 * nozzleMean2;\r\n\r\n    double result = 8.04E-05 *\r\n        p.PitotCp * p.PitotCp * DeltaH * (tempDGMAverage + 273.0) / (StackTemp + 273.0) *\r\n        ((pressure_mmHg + p.StackStaticPressure / g0 / 13.6) / pressure_mmHg) *\r\n        (p.EstimatedMolWeight / (p.EstimatedMolWeight * dryness + 18.0 * moisture)) *\r\n        dryness * dryness * nozzleMean4;\r\n\r\nWhy not use 273.15 instead of 273.0 if precision is a concern?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58401938/matching-excels-rounding-in-a-c-application/58402521#58402521","title":"Matching excels rounding in a C# application"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":3573386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/811040369/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kyle Motherwell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3573386/kyle-motherwell"},"last_editor":{"reputation":75060,"user_id":880990,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/123d02be3a4fb6074b72b7e28bc05bad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Olivier Jacot-Descombes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/880990/olivier-jacot-descombes"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58402521,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571177601,"creation_date":1571169943,"last_edit_date":1571173520,"question_id":58401938,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58401938","body_markdown":"I am currently in the process of turning a rather lofty Excel sheet that is used for calculating scientific values into a C# application. However, I am hitting some problems in regards to the rounding.\r\n\r\nAll of my values are stored as doubles, and when you perform a small number of operations on them they match the excel sheet within acceptable accuracy (5 or 6 decimal places). When they are put through rather large operations with division, multiplication, square roots. They start to drift off by quite a large margin. I switched the entire code base to decimals at another point to test if it resolved this issue, it lessened the gap but the issue still remained.\r\n\r\nI am aware this is due to the nature of decimal numbers in software development, but it&#39;s imperative I match excels rounding as much as possible. Research on this topic points me towards the standards that excel uses to round and it seems C# by default uses a slightly different one. Despite learning of this I am still unsure of how to proceed on replicating excels rounding. I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any advice or previous experience on this topic?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nEDIT : I would just like to clarify that I am not rounding my numbers whatsoever. The rounding on both the sheet and my code is implicitly being applied. I have tested the same formulas inside of a totally different software package (A form builder called K2). The resulting numbers match my c# application so it seems excels implicit rounding differs in some way.\r\n\r\nOne of the offending formulas:\r\n\r\n    (8.04 * Math.Pow(10, -5)) *\r\n    (Math.Pow(preTestTestingDetails.PitotCp, 2)) * (DeltaH) *\r\n    (tempDGMAverage + 273.0) / \r\n    (StackTemp + 273) * \r\n    ((preTestTestingDetails.BarometricPressure / 0.133322 + \r\n    ((preTestTestingDetails.StackStaticPressure / 9.80665) / 13.6)) /\r\n    (preTestTestingDetails.BarometricPressure / 0.133322)) * \r\n    (preTestTestingDetails.EstimatedMolWeight / \r\n    ((preTestTestingDetails.EstimatedMolWeight * (1 - (EstimatedMoisture / 100))) +\r\n    (18 * (EstimatedMoisture / 100)))) *\r\n    Math.Pow((1 - (EstimatedMoisture / 100)), 2) * \r\n    (Math.Pow(preTestTestingDetails.NozzleMean, 4));\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58401938/matching-excels-rounding-in-a-c-application","title":"Matching excels rounding in a C# application"},{"tags":["reactjs","react-select"],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":9124368,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af7a8ded994c13980d21a12d045d48d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Matt B.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9124368/matt-b"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571169937,"creation_date":1571169937,"question_id":58401937,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58401937","body_markdown":"Basically, I have this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Select, { components } from &#39;react-select&#39;;\r\nimport classnames from &#39;classnames/bind&#39;;\r\nconst cx = classnames.bind(styles);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n&lt;Select\r\nclassName={cx(&#39;selectthis&#39;)}\r\nclassNamePrefix={cx(&#39;one&#39;)}\r\noptions={options}\r\n&gt;&lt;/Select&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe container works perfect.
