We would like to enable windows authentication now.\r\n\r\nI created a test web app with windows authentication and tried adding missing bits into our existing web app. Below are the changes that I made:\r\n\r\n1. Modified app.razor to include cascadingauthenticationstate\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Router AppAssembly=&quot;@typeof(Program).Assembly&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;Found Context=&quot;routeData&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=&quot;@routeData&quot; DefaultLayout=&quot;@typeof(MainLayout)&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Found&gt;\r\n        &lt;NotFound&gt;\r\n            &lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;\r\n                &lt;LayoutView Layout=&quot;@typeof(MainLayout)&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there&#39;s nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;/LayoutView&gt;\r\n            &lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;\r\n        &lt;/NotFound&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Added missing imports in _imports.razor\r\n```\r\n@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization\r\n@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Tried fetching current windows identity using below code block in a razor component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@code {\r\n    [CascadingParameter]\r\n    private Task&lt;AuthenticationState&gt; authenticationStateTask { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    private async Task LogUsername()\r\n    {\r\n        var authState = await authenticationStateTask;\r\n        var user = authState.User;\r\n\r\n        if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine($&quot;{user.Identity.Name} is authenticated.&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;The user is NOT authenticated.&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run the web app locally in Visual Studio 2019 preview, I am always ending up with an empty identity name. And, IsAuthenticated is always false.\r\nHowever, if I run the test web app locally, it gets the correct identity name.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I am missing in my existing web app?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940223/how-to-enable-fix-windows-authentication-in-blazor-server-side-app","title":"How to enable/fix windows authentication in Blazor Server-Side App?"},{"tags":[".net-core","entity-framework-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13425,"user_id":5928070,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u5lN9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TanvirArjel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5928070/tanvirarjel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568517486,"post_id":57940222,"comment_id":102296740,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940222/why-there-is-no-ef-core-oftypetype-type-method#comment102296740_57940222"},{"owner":{"reputation":383,"user_id":5455223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qnQgM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitriy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5455223/dmitriy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13425,"user_id":5928070,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u5lN9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TanvirArjel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5928070/tanvirarjel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568517918,"post_id":57940222,"comment_id":102296800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940222/why-there-is-no-ef-core-oftypetype-type-method#comment102296800_57940222"},{"owner":{"reputation":122508,"user_id":5202563,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mKKQ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ivan Stoev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5202563/ivan-stoev"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568544863,"post_id":57940222,"comment_id":102300957,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940222/why-there-is-no-ef-core-oftypetype-type-method#comment102300957_57940222"},{"owner":{"reputation":383,"user_id":5455223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qnQgM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitriy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5455223/dmitriy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":122508,"user_id":5202563,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mKKQ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ivan Stoev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5202563/ivan-stoev"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568587788,"post_id":57940222,"comment_id":102310356,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940222/why-there-is-no-ef-core-oftypetype-type-method#comment102310356_57940222"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":383,"user_id":5455223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qnQgM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitriy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5455223/dmitriy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568592459,"post_id":57949043,"comment_id":102310975,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940222/why-there-is-no-ef-core-oftypetype-type-method/57949043#comment102310975_57949043"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":122508,"user_id":5202563,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mKKQ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ivan Stoev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5202563/ivan-stoev"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568592035,"creation_date":1568592035,"answer_id":57949043,"question_id":57940222,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57949043","body_markdown":"The generic method `OfType&lt;T&gt;` is a standard LINQ method which EF Core supports.  \r\n\r\nThere is no standard `OfType(Type)` method and EF Core designers didn&#39;t find a reason of implementing such custom EF Core specific extension.\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not hard to be implemented. TPH (and other future database inheritance strategies) are supported in LINQ to Entities queries by `is`, `as` and `cast` operators. So what you need is the equivalent of \r\n\r\n    Where((BaseClass e) =&gt; e is some_type)\r\n\r\nSuch expression cannot be created at compile time, but can easily be created using the `Expression` class methods (in particular [Expression.TypeIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression.typeis?view=netframework-4.8)) like this:\r\n\r\n    public static IQueryable&lt;T&gt; OfType&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; source, Type type)\r\n    {\r\n    \tvar parameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(T), &quot;e&quot;);\r\n    \tvar body = Expression.TypeIs(parameter, type);\r\n    \tvar predicate = Expression.Lambda&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt;(body, parameter);\r\n    \treturn source.Where(predicate);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt;And the second question - how is it possible to get inherited data types from DbSet?  \r\n\r\nEF Core metadata is exposed through `DbContext.Model` property. You can use `FindEntityType` to get the `IEntityType` describing the entity type\r\n\r\n    var entityType = dbContext.Model.FindEntityType(typeof(BaseClass));\r\n\r\nand now there are a lot of available methods regarding inheritance like `GetDerivedTypes`, `GetDerivedTypesInclusive`, `GetDirectlyDerivedTypes`, `GetConcreteDerivedTypesInclusive` etc. The last one can be used to retrieve the whole TPH hierarchy excluding the abstract types. And also `GetDiscriminatorProperty` and `GetDiscriminatorValue` to get the discriminator column name, type and value for each entity in the TPH. For instance\r\n\r\n    var discriminatorProperty = entityType.GetDiscriminatorProperty();\r\n    var typeInfo = entityType\r\n    \t.GetConcreteDerivedTypesInclusive()\r\n    \t.Select(t =&gt; new\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tType = t,\r\n    \t\tDiscriminatorValue = t.GetDiscriminatorValue()\r\n    \t})\r\n    \t.ToList();\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940222/why-there-is-no-ef-core-oftypetype-type-method/57949043#57949043","title":"Why there is no EF Core OfType(Type type) method?"}],"owner":{"reputation":383,"user_id":5455223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qnQgM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitriy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5455223/dmitriy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57949043,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568592035,"creation_date":1568507020,"question_id":57940222,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57940222","body_markdown":"I currently use EF Core 3.0.\r\nSo, I want to realize TPH model data selection through  the base table requesting. \r\nLet&#39;s see the example:\r\n\r\n    public class BaseClass\r\n    {\r\n       public int Base {get;set;}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Foo : BaseClass\r\n    {\r\n       public int FooMember {get;set;}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Bar : BaseClass\r\n    {\r\n      public int BarMember {get;set;}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public DbSet&lt;BaseClass&gt; dbSet {get;set;}\r\n\r\nAnd I want to implement code like this:\r\n\r\n    var getInheritedSet = dbSet.OfType(typeIStronglyNeed);\r\n\r\nBut I can only do something like this:\r\n\r\n    var getInheritedSet1 = dbSet.OfType&lt;Foo&gt;;\r\n    var getInheritedSet2 = dbSet.OfType&lt;Bar&gt;;\r\n\r\nCould you explain why EF Core 3.0 has no `OfType(Type type)` but only `OfType&lt;TType&gt;()`?\r\n\r\nAnd the second question - how is it possible to get inherited data types from DbSet&lt;BaseClass&gt;?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940222/why-there-is-no-ef-core-oftypetype-type-method","title":"Why there is no EF Core OfType(Type type) method?"},{"tags":["react-native","react-navigation"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":349,"user_id":5811411,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3daa10171eb5c4c504f7a839395b80e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Telepresence","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5811411/telepresence"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568511637,"creation_date":1568511637,"answer_id":57940508,"question_id":57940219,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57940508","body_markdown":"Looking at your `package.json` file, it seems like you do not have the following libraries: `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-screens`.

working on a Twitter scraping project recently, I noticed that the tweets I scrape sometimes have the newline character in them - `\\n` - which means that there are line-breaks in some tweets.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for the `.csv` files I am creating with the scraped tweets, because Python&#39;s `csv.writer` keeps interpreting them as new lines, and my `.csv`&#39;s thus become littered with line-breaks everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis is a [picture][1] of a `.csv` I made, with line-breaks where `\\n`&#39;s were detected, and this is the code I am using to write each tweet in, one at a time,\r\n\r\n    with open(file_name, &#39;a&#39;) as f:\r\n        writer = csv.writer(f)\r\n        writer.writerow([\r\n            status.created_at, status.author.screen_name,\r\n

&quot;)` each time, as that does not seem to be efficient to me, and I have tried opening the csv with options like `newline=&#39;\\n&#39;`, but they do not seem to work for me.\r\n\r\nHow could I tell the `csv.writer` to not create new lines whenever it sees `\\n`&#39;s? I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://imgur.com/Cr2XmXa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940197/how-to-force-csv-writer-to-include-ns-instead-of-creating-newlines","title":"How to force csv writer to include \\n&#39;s, instead of creating newlines?"},{"tags":["ios","swift","video-streaming","drm","fairplay"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21102,"user_id":210785,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a561cd4d29738e18d9e565a6265d86ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"szatmary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/210785/szatmary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568514248,"post_id":57940194,"comment_id":102296334,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940194/how-to-convert-image-to-video-with-drm-fairplay#comment102296334_57940194"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":9523890,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uF89TFlI6KM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/mTDxOZYUBmE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tanya Marchuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9523890/tanya-marchuk"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":21102,"user_id":210785,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a561cd4d29738e18d9e565a6265d86ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"szatmary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/210785/szatmary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568543467,"post_id":57940194,"comment_id":102300677,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940194/how-to-convert-image-to-video-with-drm-fairplay#comment102300677_57940194"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":9523890,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uF89TFlI6KM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/mTDxOZYUBmE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tanya Marchuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9523890/tanya-marchuk"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":21102,"user_id":210785,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a561cd4d29738e18d9e565a6265d86ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"szatmary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/210785/szatmary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568543721,"post_id":57940194,"comment_id":102300736,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940194/how-to-convert-image-to-video-with-drm-fairplay#comment102300736_57940194"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":915,"user_id":3303824,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92d481a4b63883196f2f427f6e14b20a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"andrea-f","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3303824/andrea-f"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570618417,"creation_date":1570618417,"answer_id":58302551,"question_id":57940194,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58302551","body_markdown":"For how Digital Rights Management (DRM) works for video check [this][1] blogpost.

   char* shmemPtr = (char*) shmat(shmid, 0, 0);\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ve got now a pointer to your shared memory block.

If you&#39;re using C++, you can also help your compiler help you from shooting yourself in the foot:\r\n\r\n    int* iPtr = reinterpret_cast&lt;int *&gt;(shmemPtr);\r\n\r\nForging ahead, we come next to:\r\n\r\n    foo* fPtr = (foo*) ((void*) shmemPtr[sizeof(int)]);\r\n\r\nCongratulations. `shmemPtr[sizeof(int)]` is, apparently, `shmemPtr[4]`, or the fifth byte in your shared memory block; and you just dragged your compiler, kicking and screaming, into converting that single byte into a `void *`, first, then into a `foo *`. \r\n\r\nObviously, you meant to compute the ***address*** of that byte, and then reinterpret it.\r\n\r\n    foo* fPtr = (foo *)(shmemPtr + sizeof(int));   /* C default */\r\n\r\n    foo* fPtr = reinterpret_cast&lt;foo *&gt;(shmemPtr + sizeof(int)); /* Preferred in C++ */\r\n\r\nThis still may or may not be 100% correct, due to platform-specific alignment issues. But this will be a good first start.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940174/how-does-shmget-allocate-memory-cannot-access-with-linear-addressing-address-b/57940208#57940208","title":"How does shmget allocate memory?

However, it errors out with an &quot;Address Boundary error&quot;.\r\n\r\nFor a MacOS system (but should be the same on Linux), I tried to allocate the exact amount of memory the two data structures should have taken and tried to byte address them linearly. \r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;\r\n\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n  int f1;\r\n  int f2;\r\n} foo;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  // Size of memory.

I expected the `int*` and `foo*` to be valid pointers to shared memory.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m just dabbling with some systems stuff with C/C++ so forgive me if I&#39;m trivially missing anything here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940174/how-does-shmget-allocate-memory-cannot-access-with-linear-addressing-address-b","title":"How does shmget allocate memory?

This does not happen when, say, I am drawing using a finger, and I introduce a second simultaneous touch.  I also notice that the touchCount does not increase when I have a pencil touch and a finger touch simultaneously. Similarly (perhaps by design) gestures don&#39;t work with mixed touch types. Below I show how I&#39;m accounting for active touches during `touchesMoved`\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        ...\r\n        self.view.isMultipleTouchEnabled = true\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func touchesMoved(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, event: UIEvent?) {\r\n        \r\n        if let touch = touches.first {\r\n            \r\n          let event = event\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          let touchCount = touches.count\r\n          print (&quot;[ComponentPagePaint]: TOUCH COUNT = \\(touchCount)&quot;)\r\n          \r\n          let numFingersOnScreen: Int = ((event?.allTouches!.count)!)\r\n          print (&quot;[ComponentPagePaint]: FINGr COUNT = \\(numFingersOnScreen)&quot;)\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt appears that mixing touch types results in the UIView ending the first touch and switching to the second. This does not happen when I have multiple simultaneous TouchType.direct touches.  Note that this behavior also seems to be present in Apple&#39;s drawing [demo][1] project.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to change this behavior?  Ideally, I&#39;d like my pencil-triggered touch cycle to NOT be interrupted by a second touch. \r\n\r\nIf the latter is not possible, is there a way for me to properly account for ALL active touches so that I can cancel  the current stroke, or do something else?

I&#39;m learning&#39;s Apache Beam and working on a streaming pipeline (Python 3.7, apache-beam v 2.15, DirectRunner for now) reading from PubSub source. \r\n\r\nApplying multiple transforms process to the same PCollection to produces multiple outputs to ultimately sink the output into to 2 different BQ tables.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run the pipeline it seems each of these transforms are are influencing each other (by mutating element) and thus causing a schema mismatch when executing bigquery.WriteToBigQuery transform \r\n\r\nEach PubSub message, along with message attributes is formatted as follows: \r\n\r\n`{&#39;data&#39;: json.dumps({ &quot;key1&quot;: &quot;val1&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;: &quot;val2&quot;}).encode(),\r\n&#39;attributes&#39;:{&#39;evt_time&#39;: &#39;2019-09-14T22:12:43.323546Z&#39;}}`\r\n\r\nId like to read these messages and dump to 2 BQ tables:\r\n\r\n- table1 `raw_table` schema: `evt_time,date` (storing raw data along with event_time extracted from message attribute) `{&#39;evt_time&#39;: &#39;2019-09-14T22:12:43.323546Z&#39;, &#39;payload&#39;: &#39;{&quot;key1&quot;: &quot;val1&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;: &quot;val2&quot;}&#39;}`\r\n\r\n- table2 `parsed_table` schema: `evt_time,key1,key2` (parsing &amp; storing each KV pair in the data as a flat table along with event_time extracted form message attribute) `{&#39;evt_time&#39;: &#39;2019-09-14T22:12:43.323546Z&#39;, &#39;key1&#39;: &#39;val1&#39;, &#39;key2&#39;: &#39;val2&#39;}`\r\n\r\nthis my pseudo code so far\r\n\r\n1) \r\nmessage is read into pipeline and then apply map transform which essentially extracts `data` to `payload` field and `evt_time` to `evt_time` field\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrow = p \r\n| &quot;read_sub&quot; &gt;&gt; beam.Create([ {&#39;data&#39;: json.dumps({ &quot;key1&quot;: &quot;val1&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;: &quot;val2&quot;}).encode(),\r\n&#39;attributes&#39;:{&#39;evt_time&#39;: &#39;2019-09-14T22:12:43.323546Z&#39;}}])\r\n| &quot;add_timestamps&quot; &gt;&gt; beam.Map(add_timestamps)`\r\n```\r\n\r\n2)\r\nI then store `row` into table1 `raw_table`\r\n```python\r\nrow | &quot;raw_stream_to_bq&quot; &gt;&gt;bigquery.WriteToBigQuery(project = PROJECT,\r\n dataset = BQ_DATASET, table =&quot;test_raw&quot;, schema=SCHEMA_RAW_TABLE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) apply further parsing to `row` extracting KV pair before strong each message element to table2 `parsed_table`\r\n``` python\r\nrow | &quot;parse&quot; &gt;&gt; beam.Map(parse_payload) \\\r\n    | &quot;parsed_stream_to_bq&quot; &gt;&gt; bigquery.WriteToBigQuery(project=PROJECT, \r\ndataset=BQ_DATASET,\ttable=&quot;test_parsed&quot;, schema=SCHEMA_PARSED_TABLE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nfollowing map functions `add_timestamps ` and `parse_payload` are defined as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add_timestamps(e,timestamp=beam.DoFn.TimestampParam, *args,**kwargs):\r\n\t\tpayload = e[&#39;data&#39;].decode()\r\n\t\tevt_time = e[&#39;attributes&#39;][&#39;evt_time&#39;]\r\n\t\trow = {&#39;evt_time&#39;

 Errors are [&lt;InsertErrorsValueListEntry\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; errors: [&lt;ErrorProto\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; debugInfo: &#39;&#39;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; location: &#39;key1&#39;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; message: &#39;no such field.&#39;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;

Don&#39;t put multiple expressions on the same line, you are not getting paid by the number of lines you save, and DO space your code better, it makes your code much more readable (especially for those with older eyes...). For example there is no reason for not a single space in:\r\n\r\n    pushNum(atoi(argv[args]));\r\n\r\nAdd validations at each step in your code and give all functions that can either succeed or fail a meaningful return type that can indicate success or failure. For example, what if the character passed to `void handleOp(int op)`&lt;sup&gt;**[1]**&lt;/sup&gt; is `&#39;z&#39;` and not one of the operators? Better as:\r\n\r\n    int handleOp(int op)\r\n    {\r\n        switch(op){\r\n            ...\r\n            default: \r\n                return 0;\r\n        }\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow on to the fundamental logic errors in your code. In `popNum()` you `return numstack[numpointer--];` This is wrong. You must decrement `numpointer` BEFORE using it as an index. Currently your code might as well be `return numstack[numpointer];` as that is what your expression evaluates to. In order to be correct, you would need to either use the prefix increment `return numstack[--numpointer];`, or better simply:\r\n\r\n    int popNum()\r\n    {\r\n        if (numpointer--)   /* must decrement numpointer BEFORE return */\r\n            return numstack[numpointer];\r\n        \r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext, your code should not compile as you are trying to, e.g. `pushNum(popNum + popNum);` There `popNum` is the *function pointer* NOT the evaluated return of `popNum()`. Your `handleOp()` function should instead use the return of the function itself, e.g.\r\n\r\n    int handleOp(int op)\r\n    {\r\n        switch(op){\r\n            case &#39;+&#39;:\r\n                pushNum(popNum() + popNum());  /* note the &#39;()&#39; making the function call */\r\n                break;\r\n            ...\r\n\r\nAdditionally, thereafter, your *division* is actually evaluated as `divisor / dividend` (reversed) instead it should be `dividend / divisor`, to fix the issue you can use:\r\n\r\n            case &#39;/&#39;:\r\n                {\r\n                    int a = popNum(), b = popNum();\r\n                    pushNum (b / a);\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n\r\nIn `main()`, you must use `while (args &lt; argtot)` NOT `while (args &lt;= argtot)`. Recall, `argv[argc]` is a `NULL` pointer.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, never use `atoi` in code other than for testing. It provides **ZERO** ability to evaluate whether the conversion succeeded or failed. You could have `atoi(&quot;dog&quot;)` and it still wouldn&#39;t tell you things had gone wrong, and all you know is you got `0` from it. Instead, always use the `strtoX` family of functions (e.g. `strtol, strtoul, strtod, etc..`) There you have the ability to fully validate every conversion.\r\n\r\nThose were the major problems, though there are certainly more. Resolving those issues allows it to work correctly for your example and the division now works as well. Putting those fixes together you could do something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;limits.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;errno.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    void printhelp()    /* you are not paid on the no. of lines you save */\r\n    {\r\n        printf(&quot;\\nhelp\\n&quot;);     /* TODO make this more accurate */\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int numstack[32];       /* avoid the use of global variables */\r\n    int numpointer = 0;\r\n    \r\n    char pushNum(int in)\r\n    {\r\n        if (numpointer &lt; 31) {\r\n            numstack[numpointer++] = in;\r\n            return 0; \r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int popNum()\r\n    {\r\n        if (numpointer--)   /* must decrement numpointer BEFORE return */\r\n            return numstack[numpointer];\r\n        \r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int handleOp(int op)\r\n    {\r\n        switch(op){\r\n            case &#39;+&#39;:\r\n                pushNum(popNum() + popNum());\r\n                break;\r\n            case &#39;-&#39;:\r\n                pushNum(popNum() - popNum());\r\n                break;\r\n            case &#39;*&#39;:\r\n                pushNum(popNum() * popNum());\r\n                break;\r\n            case &#39;/&#39;:\r\n                {\r\n                    int a = popNum(), b = popNum();\r\n                    pushNum (b / a);\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n            default: \r\n                return 0;\r\n        }\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /* MAIN */\r\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\r\n        \r\n        int args = 1;       /* declares vars at beginning of scope for those */\r\n        int argtot = argc;  /* pour souls still stuck with C89 compilers */\r\n        int num;\r\n        \r\n        switch (argc) {\r\n        case 1:\r\n                printhelp();\r\n                return 0;\r\n        case 2:\r\n                if (argv[1][0] == &#39;-&#39;) {\r\n                    if(argv[1][1] == &#39;h&#39;)\r\n                        printhelp();\r\n                    return 0;\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        while (args &lt; argtot) {\r\n            if (isdigit (*argv[args])) {                /* validate digit */\r\n                char *endptr = NULL;\r\n                num = strtol (argv[args], &amp;endptr, 0);  /* never use atoi */\r\n                if (endptr == argv[args]) { /* atoi provides ZERO validation */\r\n                    fputs (&quot;error: no digits converted.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n                    return 1;\r\n                }\r\n                else if (errno) {\r\n                    fputs (&quot;error: over/underflow occured.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n                    return 1;\r\n                }\r\n                else if (num &lt; 0 || INT_MAX &lt; num) {\r\n                    fputs (&quot;error: value negative or exceeds INT_MAX.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n                    return 1;\r\n                }\r\n                pushNum (num);\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                if (!handleOp (*argv[args])) {\r\n                    fputs (&quot;error: unrecognized OP.\\n&quot;, stderr);\r\n                    return 1;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            args++;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        printf(&quot;total: %d\\n&quot;, popNum());\r\n        \r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(**note:** the opening `&#39;{&#39;` following a function name generally goes on the next line (except for `main() {` where a space can precede it))\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example Use/Output**\r\n\r\n    $ ./bin/calcpostfix 2 3 + 4 &#39;*&#39;\r\n    total: 20\r\n\r\nWith division:\r\n\r\n    $ ./bin/calcpostfix 2 3 + 4 &#39;*&#39; 5 &#39;*&#39; 10 /\r\n    total: 10\r\n\r\nLook things over and let me know if you have further questions.\r\n\r\n**Footnotes:**\r\n\r\n**1)** While not an error, C generally avoids the use of `camelCase` or `MixedCase` variable and function names in favor of all *lower-case* while reserving *upper-case* names for use with macros and constants.

Some like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .dropdown {\r\n        display: inline-block;\r\n        position: relative;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu {\r\n        display: none;\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\r\n        width: auto;\r\n        border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\r\n        border-radius: var(--border-radius);\r\n        background-color: #ffffff;\r\n        z-index: 99;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu.right {\r\n        right: 0;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu ul {\r\n        padding: 0;\r\n        margin: 0;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu ul &gt; li {\r\n        list-style: none;\r\n        margin: 0;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu ul &gt; li.content {\r\n        padding: 0.6rem 1.2rem;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu ul &gt; li.divider {\r\n        height: 1px;\r\n        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu ul &gt; li &gt; a {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        text-decoration: none;\r\n        padding: 0.6rem 1.2rem;\r\n        color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .menu ul &gt; li &gt; a:hover {\r\n        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.025);\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown .trigger.hover + .menu:hover,\r\n    .dropdown .trigger.hover:hover + .menu {\r\n        display: block;\r\n    }\r\n    .dropdown button.trigger + .menu:active,\r\n    .dropdown button.trigger:focus + .menu {\r\n        display: block;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;dropdown&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;button class=&quot;trigger hover&quot;&gt;Pick your fruit from a list &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-angle-down&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ul&gt;\r\n                        &lt;li class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;\r\n                            Fruits\r\n                        &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;li class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Bananas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Mangoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Pineapples (on a Pizza)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Peaches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the pineapples choice on the list could take up more space, but it doesn&#39;t and instead goes to a new line because of its parent element.

As security best practice, I want key vault to be accessible from selected virtual networks, selected azure services and from trusted internet ip&#39;s. Of course, I would use a service principal and appropriate permissions (list/get).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Azure DevOps is not one of the trusted service. So, my alternative is to white-list the DevOps IPs. I found out my DevOps is in US East 2 region and I downloaded Azure Datacenter IPs (filtered with US East2). There are about 285 IP&#39;s in US East 2. Key Vault firewall has a limit on how many firewall rules you can add and it&#39;s 127! So, I am out of luck!\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I can get secrets from key vault at build pipeline only if I allow all networks! Yea, I still have to authenticate to get the secrets but I lost on defense in depth. I really need to lockdown the key vault to trusted networks but I can&#39;t. Why?

0; i &lt; strlen(word); i ++){\r\n        int match = 1;\r\n        for (k = 0; match &amp;&amp; k &lt; sizeof(&quot;&#225;&quot;) - 1; k++)\r\n            if (!word[i+k] || word[i+k] == &quot;&#225;&quot;[k])\r\n                match = 0;\r\n        if (match)\r\n            wordoutput[j++] = word[i];\r\n        else {\r\n            i += sizeof(&quot;&#225;&quot;) - 2;\r\n            wordoutput[j++] = &#39;a&#39;;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    wordoutput[j++] = 0;\r\n\r\nWe build up the string in wordoutput, replacing all &#225; with a in the process.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940058/compare-spanish-char-in-c/57940090#57940090","title":"Compare spanish char in C"}],"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":3663235,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c3d76ec6c9e119b0dbd81c487fe61f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joaco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3663235/joaco"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1568595889,"accepted_answer_id":57940090,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568513654,"creation_date":1568504326,"question_id":57940058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57940058","body_markdown":"I need to compare every char of a string to another char and change this char `&#39;&#225;&#39;` to `&#39;a&#39;`.\r\nHere is what i have. \r\nIm getting this error: `warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar]\r\n         if(word[i] == &#39;&#225;&#39;){`\r\n\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\r\n\r\n    int main(){\r\n\r\n    char word[50] = &quot;b&#225;sica&quot;;

You need to create a coroutine that spawns two independent tasks, each running a coroutine of its own &quot;in the background&quot;. One task will handle reading from the websocket, and the other the UDP data. Both coroutines can feed a queue which your main coroutine reads off of.\r\n\r\nThe websocket coroutine will look very similar to what you already have, but with the infinite loop pushed into the coroutine, and the data transmitted into a queue provided by the caller:\r\n\r\n    async def readWsStratux(inURL, queue):\r\n        while True:\r\n            async with websockets.connect(inURL, close_timeout=0.1) as ws:\r\n                try:\r\n                    data = await ws.recv()\r\n                    await queue.put((&#39;websocket&#39;, data))\r\n                except websockets.error:\r\n                    return None\r\n\r\nNext, you will want a similar coroutine doing UDP. Instead of manually creating a non-blocking socket, it&#39;s a good idea to use asyncio&#39;s [support for UDP](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint). You can start with a simplified version of the [example class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#asyncio-udp-echo-client-protocol) from the docs:\r\n\r\n    class ClientProtocol:\r\n        def __init__(self, queue):\r\n            self.queue = queue\r\n    \r\n        def datagram_received(self, data, addr):\r\n            self.queue.put_nowait((&#39;udp&#39;, data))\r\n    \r\n        def connection_lost(self, exc):\r\n            self.queue.put_nowait((&#39;udp&#39;, b&#39;&#39;))\r\n\r\n    async def read_udp(queue):\r\n        transport, protocol = await loop.create_datagram_endpoint(\r\n            lambda: ClientProtocol(queue),\r\n            remote_addr=(PCC_IP, PCC_PORT))\r\n        # wait until canceled\r\n        try:\r\n            await asyncio.get_event_loop().create_future()\r\n        except asyncio.CancelledError:\r\n            transport.close()\r\n            raise\r\n\r\nWith those two in place, you can write the main coroutine that spawns them and collects the data from the queue while they are running:\r\n\r\n    async def read_both(in_url):\r\n        queue = asyncio.Queue()\r\n        # spawn two workers in parallel, and have them send\r\n        # data to our queue\r\n        ws_task = asyncio.create_task(readWsStratux(in_url, queue))\r\n        udp_task = asyncio.create_task(read_udp(queue))\r\n\r\n        while True:\r\n            source, data = await queue.get()\r\n            if source == &#39;ws&#39;:\r\n                print(&#39;from websocket&#39;, data)\r\n            elif source == &#39;udp&#39;:\r\n                if data == b&#39;&#39;:\r\n                    break  # lost the UDP connection\r\n                print(&#39;from UDP&#39;, data)\r\n\r\n        # terminate the workers\r\n        ws_task.cancel()\r\n        udp_task.cancel()\r\n\r\nYour main program now consists of a trivial invocation of `read_both`:\r\n\r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n        asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(read_both(IP_STRATUX))\r\n\r\nPlease note that the above code is untested and may contain typos.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940029/non-blocking-websocket-receive-with-asyncio/57943224#57943224","title":"Non-Blocking Websocket Receive with Asyncio"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11827049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_11lbVzKIg8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcg2GWo4nD-s8DC2xSjSYQprF8CHw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jordan H.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11827049/jordan-h"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3504,"user_id":10746224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25bb2589e5ce6b9bd2c2fa2d81961c95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caleb Goodman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10746224/caleb-goodman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57943224,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568561390,"creation_date":1568503986,"last_edit_date":1568535389,"question_id":57940029,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57940029","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a Python-3 program that is trying to do two things:\r\n(1) Read data (Type 1) from an external websocket (non-blocking) and\r\n(2) Receive data (Type 2) on a regular UDP socket (non-blocking)\r\n\r\nThere are long periods of time where there is no data on neither the websocket nor the UDP socket.

Defaults to `false`.\r\n\r\nBe aware, that this will also print other information from the browser into the console. If you are looking only for the console data, you can use the second option.\r\n\r\n### Only logging calls to `console.log`, etc.\r\n\r\nTo only get the data which is logged to `console.log` or `console.info`, etc. you can listen to the [`console`][2] event.\r\n\r\n```js\r\npage.on(&#39;console&#39;, consoleMessage =&gt; {\r\n    console.log(consoleMessage.text());\r\n    if (consoleMessage.type() === &#39;error&#39;) {\r\n        // handle error output\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, you can grab all output going into the console. You can even use [`consoleMessage.type()`][3] to differentiate between error, warnings and normal output.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.19.0/docs/api.md#puppeteerlaunchoptions\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.19.0/docs/api.md#event-console\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.19.0/docs/api.md#consolemessagetype","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940027/how-do-you-return-mochas-test-results-from-puppeteer/57946913#57946913","title":"How do you return mocha&#39;s test results from puppeteer?"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":8313230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34ba2bbc73d6f5cb7f2c5281f792721a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8313230/alex"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23,"user_id":8313230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34ba2bbc73d6f5cb7f2c5281f792721a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8313230/alex"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":57946913,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568571186,"creation_date":1568503954,"last_edit_date":1568504739,"question_id":57940027,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57940027","body_markdown":"I want to run my [mochajs](https://mochajs.org) front-end unit tests in a headless browser, specifically using [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

I only do service discovery on Android App (no service registration needed on this side). There are several instances of the same type of service published at the same time on the network.\r\n\r\nI started using the sample code provided by Google (https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd) but I had fatal errors due to reusing the same resolver object at the same time for more than one service resolution. \r\nThen I found several people suggesting to create a new resolver object each time (like in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25815162/listener-already-in-use-service-discovery). \r\n\r\nI did this and the fatal error was replaced by a Resolve Failure error code 3 that meant that the resolve process was active. Better than before, but only the first service was resolved and the rest was ignored due to this failure. \r\n\r\nThen I found a person suggesting to give a special treatment to Error Code 3 by resending the resolve request recursively until it eventually becomes resolved ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16736142/nsnetworkmanager-resolvelistener-messages-android).\r\n\r\nI implemented this solution in Kotlin and it kind of works but I&#39;m not really satisfied because:\r\n\r\n 1. I believe that I&#39;m creating a lot of additional Resolver objects\r\n    and I&#39;m not sure if they are later garbage collected or not.\r\n 2. I&#39;m retrying several times in a loop, maybe causing additional and\r\n    unnecessary burden on the device and the network. Not sure if I\r\n    should add a short sleep before invoking service resolution again.\r\n 3. If there is some network problem, the program may try thousand of\r\n    times to resolve the same service instead of just abandoning the\r\n    resolution and waiting for the service to be discovered again.\r\n\r\nThe people of RxBonjour2 have come with a more complex and robust solution but it&#39;s too complex for me to follow it: https://github.com/mannodermaus/RxBonjour/blob/2.x/rxbonjour-drivers/rxbonjour-driver-nsdmanager/src/main/kotlin/de/mannodermaus/rxbonjour/drivers/nsdmanager/NsdManagerDiscoveryEngine.kt \r\n\r\nI feel frustrated that Google&#39;s official examples do not handle these problems correctly. The nsd_chat sample uses a single resolver object and fails when more than one service with the same type is published at the same type on the network.\r\n\r\nCan you suggest a better solution?

I&#39;ll start with this grouping:\r\n\r\n * The main bulk of a repository, which you get even with `git clone --bare`, is a sort of database, or really, a pair of databases, plus a bunch of auxiliary files needed to use them.  This is the stuff that is in the `.git` directory in a normal (non-bare) clone.\r\n\r\n The things in this database are in a form suitable for *Git* to use, but not a form suitable for you, or everything else that you do on your computer, to use.  Hence:\r\n\r\n * The other part of the repository is your *work-tree*.  The work tree, or working tree, or some variant on this name, is where you do your work.  A bare clone omits the work-tree, so that you cannot do any work in it.\r\n\r\n * In between the repository proper and your work-tree lies Git&#39;s *index*, which Git also calls the *staging area* (or, rarely these days, the *cache*).  The current actual implementation of the index is a file in `.git/index` plus, sometimes, one or more additional files to make things go a bit faster, although in general you shouldn&#39;t concern yourself too much with the inner workings of the index.\r\n\r\nThe index does not fit terribly well into this picture, and there&#39;s a good reason for that: it&#39;s really intended to *group together with the work-tree*, not with the main Git repository.  Cloning a repository does not clone the index, and since Git 2.5, Git has offered a command, `git worktree`, that allows you to add more work-trees.  When you *do* add a work-tree, you actually get a whole set of extra files: &amp;lt;`HEAD` and other special references such as those for `git bisect`; index; work-tree&amp;gt;.  But since `HEAD` and these various references *also* don&#39;t get copied by `git clone`, and *do* all live somewhere under the `.git` directory, you always have to deal with this slightly muddled, mixed-up image.\r\n\r\nFrom a good distance, then, there&#39;s a clean separation: `.git` holds the stuff that gets cloned (and that Git deals with), and your work-tree holds the stuff you work on (that doesn&#39;t get cloned).  A bare repository has only the stuff that gets cloned.  But in fact there&#39;s stuff in `.git` that doesn&#39;t get cloned too, including the index/staging-area.  A bare repository still has a `HEAD` and an index, even though they don&#39;t get cloned.  Last, adding work-trees with `git worktree add` not only creates the new work-tree, it also creates a bunch of files inside `.git` that also don&#39;t get cloned, and that are meant for the added work-tree only.\r\n\r\n&gt; Is the repository just the history of the changes ...\r\n\r\nIn some sense this doesn&#39;t matter, but Git is very up-front about its storage system, and this needs a bit of adjustment:  Git doesn&#39;t store *changes* at all!  Instead, Git stores *snapshots*.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in my first bullet-point that what&#39;s in `.git` is primarily a pair of databases.  These two databases are both simple key-value stores.  One database, usually rather smaller, stores *names* and *hash IDs*.  The names are a generalized form of branch, tag, and other names.  For instance the name `master`, which is almost certainly a branch name, is really `refs/heads/master`, which is *definitely* a branch name.  The name `v2.5.0`—the Git version that introduces `git worktree`—is a *tag* name and is really `refs/tags/v2.5.0`.  Running `git rev-parse` allows you to turn an arbitrary name, including a branch or tag name, into a hash ID, if there is such a name in this database:\r\n\r\n    $ git rev-parse v2.5.0\r\n    8d1720157c660d9e0f96d2c5178db3bc8c950436\r\n\r\nThis hash ID is the key to the bigger, and in some sense main, database.  That database maps hash IDs to Git *objects*.  A Git object is how Git stores data and metadata, including commits and the files that act as the snapshots in that commit.\r\n\r\nGiven any hash ID, you can have a low-level Git command get you the object&#39;s type:\r\n\r\n    $ git cat-file -t 8d1720157c660d9e0f96d2c5178db3bc8c950436\r\n    tag\r\n\r\nor contents:\r\n\r\n    $ git cat-file -p 8d1720157c660d9e0f96d2c5178db3bc8c950436 | sed &#39;s/@/ /&#39;\r\n    object a17c56c056d5fea0843b429132904c429a900229\r\n    type commit\r\n    tag v2.5.0\r\n    tagger Junio C Hamano &lt;gitster pobox.com&gt; 1438025401 -0700\r\n    \r\n    Git 2.5\r\n    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n    Version: GnuPG v1\r\n    \r\n    iQIcBAABAgAGBQJVtoa5AAoJELC16IaWr+bLRtQP/0RYjVe9fLubiN5vLaAJ98B5\r\n    K3apw8bScJ4bZQJiOGMZg7AJ8pSB9XchqopjNlO2v8XVrZEkFPQ7ln3ELjOITusO\r\n    [snip rest of PGP signature]\r\n\r\nIn this case, the *tag* object holds the hash ID of the *commit* object.  That&#39;s the first line of the above.  So next, we can have Git fish out the commit object, and print that:\r\n\r\n    $ git cat-file -p a17c56c056d5fea0843b429132904c429a900229 | sed &#39;s/@/ /&#39;\r\n    tree deec48fbc77f5951f81d7b5559360cdefe88ce7e\r\n    parent 7a2c87b1524e7e0fbb6c9eef03610b4f5b87236a\r\n    author Junio C Hamano &lt;gitster pobox.com&gt; 1438025387 -0700\r\n    committer Junio C Hamano &lt;gitster pobox.com&gt; 1438025387 -0700\r\n    \r\n    Git 2.5\r\n    \r\n    Signed-off-by: Junio C Hamano &lt;gitster pobox.com&gt;\r\n\r\nThe above are, in fact, the full contents of the commit that is Git 2.15 (with `@` changed to space to perhaps, maybe, cut down on spam-load).  The `tree` line is how the commit saves a full snapshot of every file, as that gives yet another hash ID of yet another internal object:\r\n\r\n    $ git cat-file -t deec48fbc77f5951f81d7b5559360cdefe88ce7e\r\n    tree\r\n\r\nIf we look inside the `tree` we&#39;ll find, e.g., that it has an entry reading:\r\n\r\n    100644 blob 5ca601ee14fd2ab3b78577aa22a5db778bc7fbe0    base85.c\r\n\r\nwhich gives us the hash ID of the complete file `base85.c` that is part of that commit.\r\n\r\nThat file is still the same in the *current* version of Git, and we can see that using `git rev-parse`:\r\n\r\n    $ git rev-parse master:base85.c\r\n    100644 blob 5ca601ee14fd2ab3b78577aa22a5db778bc7fbe0    base85.c\r\n\r\nwhich is a shortcut way to do what we just did above:\r\n\r\n    $ git rev-parse v2.5.0:base85.c\r\n    5ca601ee14fd2ab3b78577aa22a5db778bc7fbe0\r\n\r\nGit looked up `v2.5.0` (as `refs/tags/v2.5.0`) in the first database and found that it was a tag hash ID.  So `git rev-parse` found the actual commit, and the tree, and the line for `base85.c`, and extracted the hash ID.\r\n\r\nUsing that hash ID, we can extract the full contents of `base85.c` directly, with `git cat-file -p`.  The file begins this way:\r\n\r\n    $ git cat-file -p 5ca601ee14fd2ab3b78577aa22a5db778bc7fbe0\r\n    #include &quot;cache.h&quot;\r\n    \r\n    #undef DEBUG_85\r\n    \r\n    #ifdef DEBUG_85\r\n    #define say(a) fprintf(stderr, a)\r\n    #define say1(a,b) fprintf(stderr, a, b)\r\n    #define say2(a,b,c) fprintf(stderr, a, b, c)\r\n    #else\r\n    #define say(a) do { /* nothing */ } while (0)\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a direct line from hash ID to contents, and a somewhat less direct line from names—whether they&#39;re branch or tag names, or composites like `v2.5.0:base85.c`—to contents, that involves following the tag to the commit to the tree to the specific entry to get the hash ID.\r\n\r\n### Getting from snapshots to changes\r\n\r\nAlmost everything Git does starts with this kind of database lookup.  Should you wish to *compare* two commits, though, you can have Git extract *both* of them, and just tell you what&#39;s *different*.  Commit `745f6812895b31c02b29bdfe4ae8e5498f776c26`, for instance, has commit `d4b12b9e07eba2e4ec1eff38a4151c9302bd1e2c` as its parent, so we can run:\r\n\r\n    git diff d4b12b9e07eba2e4ec1eff38a4151c9302bd1e2c 745f6812895b31c02b29bdfe4ae8e5498f776c26\r\n\r\nto have Git extract *both* commits, *compare* them, and show us what changed:\r\n\r\n    $ git diff d4b12b9e07eba2e4ec1eff38a4151c9302bd1e2c 745f6812895b31c02b29bdfe4ae8e5498f776c26\r\n    diff --git a/Documentation/RelNotes/2.24.0.txt b/Documentation/RelNotes/2.24.0.txt\r\n    new file mode 100644\r\n    index 0000000000..a95a8b0084\r\n    --- /dev/null\r\n    +++ b/Documentation/RelNotes/2.24.0.txt\r\n    [actual diff snipped]\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nNote that when we looked at the 2.5.0 commit, we saw:\r\n\r\n    tree deec48fbc77f5951f81d7b5559360cdefe88ce7e\r\n    parent 7a2c87b1524e7e0fbb6c9eef03610b4f5b87236a\r\n\r\nThat *parent* line gives Git the hash ID of the commit that comes *before* the `2.5.0` commit.  So Git can automatically compare a commit to its parent.  If we know the hash ID of one commit, we can make Git fish out the hash ID of its parent—and in fact, instead of running `git diff`, we can run `git show`, which does this all for us.  So that&#39;s what we tend to do.\r\n\r\nA simple:\r\n\r\n    git show master\r\n\r\nreally consists of:\r\n\r\n * parse the name `master` to get a hash ID\r\n * use that to find the commit\r\n * show the commit&#39;s author, time-stamps, log message, etc\r\n * use the commit to find the commit&#39;s parent\r\n * use the two commit hash IDs to extract the two trees\r\n * compare all the files *in* the two snapshots\r\n * for each file that&#39;s different, show what&#39;s different\r\n\r\nAll of this takes place through the stuff in the `.git` repository.  What&#39;s in the index, and in your work-tree, is not important and not required here, so all of this can be done with a bare repository.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nShould you want to actually do any *work* with a Git repository, you need a non-bare repository, so that you have a work-tree.  Git will extract stuff *from* the object database, as found by big ugly hash IDs, into your work-tree so that you can see it and work on it.  Git will let you use names, provided those names are in the name-to-hash-ID database, in place of hash IDs.  Git *needs* the hash IDs; but you probably need the names just to *find* the hash IDs.\r\n\r\nThe *index* or *staging area* sits *between* the work-tree and the repository.  Its main function is to hold copies of files extracted from the repository—from the object database—so that they&#39;re ready to go into *new* commits.  As such, you can think of it as the place you assemble your new commits.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n * Your work-tree holds files in your computer&#39;s ordinary format, rather than in the special Git-only format that the index / staging-area holds and that goes into each new commit you make.\r\n\r\n * The index / staging-area holds the *proposed next snapshot*.  This starts out the same as the *current* snapshot: the commit you checked out so as to get it into your work-tree.  If you *change* a file in your work-tree, you need to *copy it back into the index* so that the updated file is the one that goes into the next commit.\r\n\r\n * Each commit contains a full snapshot of every file, as of whatever form it had in the index at the time you ran `git commit`.\r\n\r\n * History, in a Git repository, is nothing more than the commits themselves.  Each commit remembers its immediate predecessor—the raw hash ID of that earlier commit—and every commit is found *by* its hash ID.  Names like `master` are mostly for mere humans, who for some reason can&#39;t seem to remember random-looking hash IDs.\r\n\r\nBranch and tag names have another important role, but for that, you should start with [Think Like (a) Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940010/git-working-directory-vs-staging-area-vs-local-repo-vs-git-folder/57940307#57940307","title":"git working directory vs staging area vs local repo vs .git folder"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5061,"user_id":1143850,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2927fac544c9960cd5433688fe4cae1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Serge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1143850/serge"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568510465,"creation_date":1568510465,"answer_id":57940433,"question_id":57940010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57940433","body_markdown":"There are 2 concepts which you need to understand:\r\n\r\n1. `git directory` which contains git metadata, commit history, branch info, ...\r\n\r\n2. `work tree` which contains files checked out from the git directory (your working directory).\r\n\r\nGit repository usually means both: git directory and work tree.
