Though it shows these error when editing, the codes **_can run normally_** in the simulator or iPhone. And &#39;thanks to&#39; the problem Xcode cannot autocomplete code normally. \r\n\r\nWhat I have tried:\r\n\r\n1. Quitted Xcode and restarted my Mac for times;\r\n2. Changed all .c file into .m;\r\n3. Changed all .c file&#39;s type to `Objective-C source` in Identity and Type.\r\n\r\nBut none of them work for me.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 10/17: After I update my Mac to 10.15, the problems disappeared and everything goes normally. \r\n\r\n\r\nTLPlayerSubViewController.h\r\n```\r\n#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;\r\n\r\n@class TLMovieObject;\r\n@class TLOverlayView;\r\n\r\nNS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN\r\n\r\nextern NSString *const TLSubViewDismissNotification;\r\n\r\n@interface TLPlayerSubViewController : UIViewController\r\n\r\n@property (strong, nonatomic) TLOverlayView *playerView;\r\n@property (strong, nonatomic) TLMovieObject *video;\r\n\r\n- (void)playVideo;\r\n\r\n@end\r\n\r\nNS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTLPlayerSubViewController.m\r\n```\r\n#import &quot;TLPlayerSubViewController.h&quot;\r\n#import &quot;TLOverlayView.h&quot;\r\n#import &quot;TLMovieObject.h&quot;\r\n\r\nNSString *const TLSubViewDismissNotification = @&quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n@interface TLPlayerSubViewController () &lt;TLOverlayViewDelegate&gt;\r\n\r\n@end\r\n\r\n@implementation TLPlayerSubViewController\r\n\r\n- (void)viewDidLoad {\r\n    [super viewDidLoad];\r\n    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.\r\n    \r\n    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];\r\n    [self.view addSubview:self.playerView];\r\n    \r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI explain my question more clearly. Before the system update, I have already include/import `&lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;` `&lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;` in the .h file or .m file. It is strange that I NEVER modify ANY codes but update the system to the latest version and then the error message disappeared. \r\n\r\nNotice that:\r\n\r\n1. Though the error messages shows, the project can run normally. I don&#39;t think missing .h file the code can still run normally.\r\n2. I use FFMpeg in my project and there are some .c file in it. I try to change THOSE .c file into .m file but no works. I write Objective-C codes in .m file(as the picture shows), not .c file.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it is a bug in Xcode 11 or the system...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379642/unknown-type-name-nsstring-in-xcode-11","title":"Unknown type name &#39;NSString&#39; in Xcode 11"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","amazon-s3","pre-signed-url"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":100133,"user_id":174777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6PnNW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Rotenstein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/174777/john-rotenstein"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571084468,"post_id":58379641,"comment_id":103115171,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379641/amazon-s3-presigned-post-url-with-short-lived-expiry-behavior#comment103115171_58379641"}],"owner":{"reputation":7997,"user_id":4629810,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gcabh64Le4c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/GquVsg_lVoA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mircea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4629810/mircea"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571066124,"creation_date":1571066124,"question_id":58379641,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58379641","body_markdown":"I am generating an S3 presigned url in order to upload a file.

After launching the EMR cluster you can copy the *.xml (e.g. *core-site.xml*) files from EMR master into some location on the airflow node and then point to those files in your spark-submit task in airflow. At least we&#39;re doing it that day in our product. To extend that logically, if you&#39;re planning to reuse an existing cluster, all you need is to know where these *.xml files are already stored. Then, the rest will be the same. You need to only refer to those files when triggering the task.\r\n\r\n**More details**\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know of any such doc, so I can only suggest you to explore the following, which is based on the knowledge that I have gathered:\r\n\r\n 1. We need to write a custom plugin for spark-submit. As part of this custom-plugin module let&#39;s define a `CustomSparkSubmitOperator` class. It needs to extend the `BaseOperator`. You can find plenty of articles on writing custom plugins in airflow. [This][1] might be a good place to start. [Here][2], you can see more details of the `BaseOperator`.\r\n\r\n 2. In `BaseOperator`, you&#39;ll find a method called `pre_execute`. It&#39;s a viable option to perform following actions inside this method:\r\n    \r\n  a. Wait until your cluster is up. You can easily do that using boto3, if you pass the cluster-id.\r\n\r\n  b. Once the cluster is up, get the ip of the EMR master node, and copy stuffs matching `/etc/hadoop/conf/*-site.xml` to your airflow node. It&#39;s doable via subprocess call in python.\r\n\r\n  c. Once you&#39;ve got the xml file, in `execute` method, just use the `SparkSubmitHook` to submit your spark-job. You need to make sure the spark binaries on your airflow node are using this path for spark-submit.\r\n\r\n  d. You can clean up the cluster in the `post_execute` method in case that&#39;s required. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://airflow.apache.org/plugins.html\r\n  [2]: https://airflow.apache.org/_api/airflow/models/baseoperator/index.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379637/i-have-an-existing-emr-cluster-in-aws-i-want-to-run-a-dag-from-airflow-to-an-aw/58520133#58520133","title":"I have an existing EMR cluster in AWS.

You could write this\r\n\r\n```\r\nctx.fillStyle = &#39;red&#39;;\r\n\r\nfunction renderLoop(time) {\r\n   ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);\r\n   ctx.fillRect(x, y, 20, 20);  // assume X and Y are animated\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s again it&#39;s not normal to only draw one thing so most people, even if they only start with 1 thing would do this\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction renderLoop(time) {\r\n   ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);\r\n   ctx.fillStyle = &#39;red&#39;;\r\n   ctx.fillRect(x, y, 20, 20);  // assume X and Y are animated\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEven though it&#39;s redundant to set the `fillStyle` every frame. They do it because they expect to draw more things later so it becomes a pattern to *set the state related to the thing you want to draw right before you draw it*.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction renderLoop(time) {\r\n   ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);\r\n   ctx.fillStyle = &#39;red&#39;;\r\n   ctx.fillRect(x, y, 20, 20);  // assume X and Y are animated\r\n   ctx.fillStyle = &#39;blue&#39;;\r\n   ctx.fillRect(x2, y2, 20, 20);  // assume x2 and y2 are animated\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for VAO state see [this](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-attributes.html) and texture state see [this](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-texture-units.html)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379626/why-are-we-use-twice-bindvertexarrayvao/58389266#58389266","title":"Why are we use twice bindVertexArray(vao)?"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6074164,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5a15f44a57125c5e3bef132321dea5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gurbuz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6074164/gurbuz"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58389266,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571124560,"creation_date":1571066086,"question_id":58379626,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58379626","body_markdown":"I am new person for WebGL and I am trying to learn WebGL2. But I don&#39;t really understand how to work WebGL. Especially, VAOs and VBOs. I looked for diagrams of how memory works, but I couldn&#39;t find it. I have given the following example and I will try to explain how the example works.\r\n```js\r\nfunction main(){\r\n    // initialize GL\r\n    // create vertex shader and fragment shader\r\n    // create program\r\n\r\n    var positionAttributeLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(program, &quot;a_position&quot;);\r\n\r\n    var positionBuffer = gl.createBuffer();\r\n\r\n    gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBuffer);\r\n\r\n    // define positions with array\r\n\r\n    gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(positions), gl.STATIC_DRAW);\r\n\r\n    var vao = gl.createVertexArray();\r\n\r\n    gl.bindVertexArray(vao);\r\n\r\n    gl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionAttributeLocation);\r\n\r\n    // ....\r\n    gl.vertexAttribPointer(\r\n        positionAttributeLocation, size, type, normalize, stride, offset\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    gl.viewport(0, 0, 400, 300);\r\n\r\n    // clear canvas\r\n    // use program\r\n\r\n    gl.bindVertexArray(vao);        // why we use that here ?\r\n\r\n    var primitiveType = gl.TRIANGLES;\r\n    var offset = 0;\r\n    var count = 3;\r\n    gl.drawArrays(primitiveType, offset, count);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1. Firstly, I got attribute in vertex shader program, we&#39;ll use for VAO. I able to think it&#39;s slot 0.\r\n2. Then I created buffer for positions (array).\r\n3. Activated buffer with `bindBuffer()` function.\r\n4. Then positions added in buffer.\r\n5. Created VAO and activated with `bindVertexArray()`.\r\n6. Enabled slot 0 and I will add the data (positions) in slot 0. It is as parameter for `vertexAttribFunction()`.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the situation I can understand. Then the situation gets confused. Why are we call again bindVertexArray(vao)? Are there also detailed schemes of how VAOs and VBOs work within the WebGL?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379626/why-are-we-use-twice-bindvertexarrayvao","title":"Why are we use twice bindVertexArray(vao)?"},{"tags":["php","routes","lumen","prefix","optional-parameters"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":70,"user_id":4439528,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TNpKW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"bechicco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4439528/bechicco"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571068416,"post_id":58379968,"comment_id":103108875,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379625/lumen-5-8-12-multiple-optional-paramter-with-prefix/58379968#comment103108875_58379968"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":22425,"user_id":487813,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lU5if.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"apokryfos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/487813/apokryfos"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571067416,"creation_date":1571067416,"answer_id":58379968,"question_id":58379625,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58379968","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to do this directly.

you appear to have is a CSV format type text file where there are specific rows of comma delimited columnar data. However usually a CSV file will start with a **Header** line indicating the Column Names (not always the case though) which you appear to not need so we can ignore that part of it. \r\n\r\nI think an ideal situation in this particular case would be a method that reads the text file and can retrieve either all or specific columns of data from each row as that file is read. The retrieved data is then written to a supplied output file. \r\n\r\nA slight problem though is that some of the columnar data is within quotation marks (&quot;...&quot;) some of which also contains the very same delimiter that separates all other columns within any given record row. This can pose a problem so care must be taken to handle this situation when retrieving data otherwise incomplete data could be acquired and written to the desired output file and returned within the 2D String Array.\r\n\r\nThe code example I provide below does all this within a single method. It is relatively basic therefore it would be up to you had deal with any specific enhancements if so required. The method contains three parameters, two of type String and one of optional int args[] and it returns a Two Dimensional String Array containing the retrieved data. If you don&#39;t want the method to return anything then the code can be somewhat reduced.\r\n\r\nHere is the **getFromCSV()** method. It is well commented:\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * This is a very basic parsing type method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n     * \r\n     * Usage: {@code String[][] data = getFromCSV(&quot;Data.txt&quot;, &quot;DataOutput.txt&quot;, 13, 16, 17, 28, 29); }\r\n     * \r\n     * @param csvFilePath (String) The full path and file name of the Data file.&lt;br&gt;\r\n     * \r\n     * @param destinationPath (String) The full path and file name of the desired output file. \r\n     * the retrieved data will be store there.&lt;br&gt;\r\n     * \r\n     * @param desiredLiteralColumns (Optional - Integer Args or int[] Array) The literal\r\n     * data columns to acquire row data from.

If the text file is located within the Class-Path then just the file name should suffice. If not then the full path and file name is expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; **The destinationPath parmeter:**\r\n\r\nA string argument must be supplied here which indicates where the output text file is to be created and written to within the local file system. If the output file is to be located within the application&#39;s project folder then just the file name should suffice. If not then the full path and file name to it desired location is expected. Make sure permissions exist within your Operating System for this to be achievable. If the supplied destination path doesn&#39;t already exist within the local file system then it is automatically created, again, make sure permissions exist within your Operating System for this to be achievable.\r\n\r\n&gt; **The desiredLiteralColumns parameter:**\r\n\r\nEither an integer array (**int[ ]**) can be supplied here or a series of comma delimited integer arguments which denote the desired literal columns to retrieve data from in each file data row. By &quot;**literal**&quot; we mean that the data located at Column Index 0 is literally Column 1. The data in Column Index 7 is literally Column 8. It is the literal values you want to supply. Here is an quick example:\r\n\r\nIf I have a data row in file which looks like:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Doe, John&quot;, 62, &quot;6558 Cook Road, Atlanta, Georgia&quot;, 30336, $78,564.77\r\n\r\nand we want to retrieve the data in 1st column (persons name), the 3rd column (Address), and the 4th column (postal code) then we could supply the following to the **getFromCSV()** method:\r\n\r\n    String[][] myData = getFromCSV(&quot;My_CSV_File.csv&quot;, &quot;MY_Output_File.txt&quot;, 1, 3, 5);\r\n\r\n                                    O R\r\n\r\n    int[] columns = {1, 3, 5};\r\n    String[][] myData = getFromCSV(&quot;C:\\\\MyDataFile\\\\My_CSV_File.csv&quot;,\r\n                                   &quot;C:\\\\MyOuputFiles\\\\MY_Output_File.txt&quot;, \r\n                                   columns);\r\n\r\nThen when the code is run the output file and the returned 2D String Array will contain:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Doe, John&quot;, &quot;6558 Cook Road, Atlanta, Georgia&quot;, 30336\r\n\r\nIf no arguments are supplied to the optional **desiredLiteralColumns** parameter then **all** Columnar data is retrieved, so:\r\n\r\n    String[][] myData = getFromCSV(&quot;My_CSV_File.csv&quot;, &quot;MY_Output_File.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\nwill place the following into the output file and the returned 2D String Array will contain the very same.\r\n\r\n    &quot;Doe, John&quot;, 62, &quot;6558 Cook Road, Atlanta, Georgia&quot;, 30336, $78,564.77\r\n\r\nI believe that there are delimiter positioning issues within the data lines you supplied in your post as examples. I think you are missing some commas. Look it over **carefully**. Once you&#39;ve done that....To build exactly what you need you would do something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    String[][] data = getFromCSV(&quot;StaffHoursOverviewReport_10102019 (1).txt&quot;,\r\n                                 &quot;outFile.txt&quot;, \r\n                                 13, 16, 17, 28, 29);\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {\r\n        String dataString = data[i][0].replace(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;) + &quot;, &quot; + \r\n                            data[i][1] + &quot; &quot; + data[i][2] + &quot; , &quot; + \r\n                            data[i][3].replace(&quot;.&quot;, &quot; &quot;) + data[i][4];\r\n        System.out.println(dataString);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis ***should*** ouput to the console window and be placed within your desired output file:\r\n\r\n    Smith, Lehron, Billable 4.10 , Non Bill 2.57\r\n\r\nwhich is **exactly** like the example you provided for the desired output.

But assuming that you explicitly want an array structure (as opposed to say a linked list, as in rdf:list), e.g of form:\r\n\r\n    [e_0,e_1,..,e_n]\r\n\r\nyou could represent this as:\r\n\r\n    [] a my:Array ;\r\n      my:length n;\r\n      my:contains\r\n       [\r\n        a my:ArrayElement ;\r\n          my:index 0 ;\r\n          my:value e_0\r\n       ],\r\n       [\r\n        a my:ArrayElement ;\r\n          my:index 1 ;\r\n          my:value e_1\r\n       ],\r\n       ...\r\n       [\r\n        a my:ArrayElement ;\r\n          my:index n ;\r\n          my:value e_n\r\n       ] .\r\n\r\n(Assuming &quot;my&quot; is a vocabulary defining classes for Array, ArrayElement, and additional properties\r\n\r\nYou could then define (switching to manchester syntax for clarity):\r\n\r\n    ArrayOfInts EquivalentTo Array and my:contains only (my:value some integer)\r\n\r\nAnd assert your array to be of this type.\r\n\r\nYou could add other axioms declaring my:value and my:index to be functional.\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s worth pausing here and asking what your broader goals are. OWL is not a great language for representing and reasoning about computational data structures. For one thing, OWL makes the Open World Assumption, and for reasoning about data structures (e.g. for validation purposes) you typically want the Closed World assumption. However, there may be circumstances where this is an accord with your use case, e.g. if you want to reason about incomplete information about a program or data structure. But even then there may be other branches of logic that are better suited.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s often the case that when something is modeled in a computer program as an array, there is a more natural non-array representation in OWL. For example, if we wanted to represent a list of runners ordered by their finishing position in a race, it would be more natural to model the event of finishing the race for each runner, together with a timing, and derive the array at query time.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know your exact use case, but hopefully this is relevant to you.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379557/mapping-an-array-in-json-schema-to-owl/58385824#58385824","title":"Mapping an array in JSON Schema to

am trying to map an array defined in JSON Schema to OWL 2.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple example of JSON Schema:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;properties&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;nm_prop&quot;: { \r\n

Schemas to OWL for later use in a data integration application.\r\n\r\nUsing the JSON Schema example of the original question and cmungall&#39;s explanation, a possible representation of the schema in

:array_integer .\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\n- *:JS_id* is the main class;\r\n\r\n- *array_integer* is a definition of an array datatype, that extend the array definition in OntoDT;\r\n\r\n- *array_integer* have a restriction: It only accepts integers;\r\n\r\n- *nm_prop* is the array atribute in the schema.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd a new question: is this writing correct and would it be equivalent to the JSON Schema in the example?\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://ontodm.com/ontodt/OntoDT.owl\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379557/mapping-an-array-in-json-schema-to-owl","title":"Mapping an array in

Please try to avoid Debian buster for the moment because is still contain some bugs and you may encounter later errors.\r\n\r\nAny Ubuntu Server or Debian Stretch will be just great. Just download the image from the internet, and install it on your support (laptop/virtual machine).\r\n\r\nOn a fresh install make sure you have all your requirements installed on the latest version.\r\nThis is the list:\r\n\r\n```\r\n gcc              \r\n\r\n make             \r\n\r\n libpcre3-dev     \r\n\r\n zlib1g-dev       \r\n\r\n libluajit-5.1-dev\r\n\r\n libpcap-dev      \r\n\r\n openssl          \r\n\r\n libssl-dev       \r\n\r\n libnghttp2-dev   \r\n\r\n libdumbnet-dev   \r\n\r\n bison            \r\n\r\n flex             \r\n\r\n libdnet   \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the command to install them all:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install -y gcc make libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libluajit-5.1-dev libpcap-dev openssl libssl-dev libnghttp2-dev libdumbnet-dev bison flex libdnet\r\n```\r\nOnce everything is installed I will ask you to make a folder where to work the install process.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo mkdir working-direcotry\r\ncd working-directory/\r\n```      \r\nNow, please download both DAQ and Snort fallowing the official recommendations from Snort.org\r\n\r\nCurrently you can paste the fallowing code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/daq-2.0.6.tar.gz &amp;&amp; sudo wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-2.9.15.tar.gz &amp;&amp; sudo tar xvzf daq-2.0.6.tar.gz &amp;&amp; sudo tar xvzf snort-2.9.15.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnter in your daq folder:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd daq-2.0.6\r\n```\r\nPLEADE DO NOT RUN ``` ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install```\r\n\r\nThis is where most of the new people are getting lost into errors. If something is not installed correctly you will not see only the first error, but also the rest of errors cause by the first missing dependency.\r\n\r\nPlease run then one by one to ensure a proper error troubleshooting :\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo ./configure  \r\nsudo make\r\nsudo make install\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow, please lave daq folder and go to snort\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd..\r\ncd snort-2.9.15\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere do the same as on DAQ install and perfom each action separate.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo ./configure --enable-sourcefire \r\nsudo make \r\nsudo make install\r\nsudo ldconfig\r\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/snort /usr/sbin/snort\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease check your install with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhich snort\r\nsnort --version\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you have fully install Snort will all its dependencies. All is left is to make the setting inside the system in order to properly allow Snort to function.\r\n\r\nFor security reasons you must create a special user inside your system, user that can be use later with a database or anything else that you may want to experiment with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo groupadd snort\r\nsudo useradd snort -r -s /sbin/nologin -c SNORT_IDS -g snort\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour misfortune with all the errors was the fact that Snort actually expect a certain folder structure inside your system, and nothing until now create it. So do it yourself and remember to give the correct user permission to each folder  :\r\n   \r\n```\r\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/rules\r\nsudo mkdir /var/log/snort\r\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules\r\nsudo chmod -R 5775 /etc/snort\r\nsudo chmod -R 5775 /var/log/snort\r\nsudo chmod -R 5775 /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules\r\nsudo chown -R snort:snort /etc/snort\r\nsudo chown -R snort:snort /var/log/snort\r\nsudo chown -R snort:snort /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not all, you are still missing critical files from your ```/etc/snort/``` folder\r\n\r\nNow you suppose to be in ```snort-2.9.15``` folder. Please type ```ls```. You see the ```etc``` folder inside the ```snort-2.9.15``` folder? Go inside.\r\n\r\nIf lost just go to your ```working-directory```, where you download the source codes for DAQ and Snort and type  \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Access the correct &#39;etc&#39; folder\r\ncd snort-2.9.15/etc/\r\n\r\n# Copy all missing files to the correct position inside the system.\r\nsudo cp *.conf /etc/snort\r\nsudo cp *.config /etc/snort\r\nsudo cp *.map /etc/snort\r\n```\r\n\r\nALL DONE.\r\nSnort is FUNCTIONAL WITH ALL ITS FILES IN PLACE.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately you can not validate the configuration just yet because you do not have any rules in place.\r\nPlease set the correct rules path inside your ```/etc/snort/snort.conf``` file\r\n\r\n````\r\nsudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf\r\n````\r\nGot to line 104 by pressing &#39;CTRL&#39;+&#39;SHIFT&#39;+&#39;-&#39; (undersocre)\r\nYou will find \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Path to your rules files (this can be a relative path)\r\n# Note for Windows users:  You are advised to make this an absolute path,\r\n# such as:  c:\\snort\\rules\r\nvar RULE_PATH .../rules\r\nvar SO_RULE_PATH .../so_rules\r\nvar PREPROC_RULE_PATH .../preproc_rules\r\n\r\n# If you are using reputation preprocessor set these\r\n# Currently there is a bug with relative paths, they are relative to where snort is\r\n# not relative to snort.conf like the above variables\r\n# This is completely inconsistent with how other vars work, BUG 89986\r\n# Set the absolute path appropriately\r\nvar WHITE_LIST_PATH .../rules\r\nvar BLACK_LIST_PATH .../rules\r\n```\r\nChange everything to look like below (you can replace the entire section from the file)\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Path to your rules files (this can be a relative path)\r\nvar RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules\r\nvar SO_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/so_rules\r\nvar PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules\r\n\r\n# Set the absolute path appropriately\r\nvar WHITE_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules\r\nvar BLACK_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules\r\n```\r\nSave and exit.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserve that we declare the absolute path to the folders. Now,please de-active all the rules from the configuration file. To do this paste the fallowing into console :\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Make a backup with all the rules activated. \r\n\r\nsudo cp /etc/snort/snort.conf /etc/snort/snort.original\r\n\r\nsudo sed -i &#39;s/include \\$RULE\\_PATH/#include \\$RULE\\_PATH/&#39; /etc/snort/snort.conf\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nVALIDATE YOUR INSTALL\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell Done. Snort 100% functional. But no rules. From now, is about you to play with rules and add them into the configuration file. If something is not working just create another copy of ```snort.original``` and replace &#39;original&#39; with &#39;conf&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an extra, I create a script that make everything described above plus add an full set of rules ready to be tested. The rules set is not up to date, but will work just fine for your home security or learning purposes. \r\n\r\nTo use my script, please install git\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt install git\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, clone my repo into your ```working-directory``` , decompress the archive and runt the SFDS script\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt install git \r\nsudo mkdir your-folder\r\ncd your-folder\r\nsudo git clone https://github.com/WillyWeiss/SnortFastDeploymentScript.git\r\nsudo tar xvfz sourcecode.tar.gz\r\nsudo chmod +x SFDS\r\nsudo ./SFDS\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease fallow the git instructions to run your Snort.

function][2] takes the `created_at` value from the previous record (second parameter: step length, third parameter: default value if no previous record == current value) within the ordered `user_id` partition (group). Then the difference between current `created_at` value an the previous one is calculated. If this value is &gt; 10 minutes, the result is `true`; `false` otherwise. This boolean can be casted into an `int` value, which results in `0` or `1`\r\n2. Cumulative `SUM()` over the `0`/`1` values, which results in `group_id`s for every new session per `user_id`\r\n3. The first created_at timestamp per `user_id` and session `group_id` can be get by `first_value()` window function, the last one by `first_value()` and `DESC` order. The difference gives you the length of each session. The `DISTINCT` clause is used, because the difference value is put onto every record. But we need this only once.\r\n4. Finally, you can group and `AVG()` this difference for the users.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_12&amp;fiddle=668d7963299d2c42a41971c1c25f3cf9\r\n  [2]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379514/group-rows-by-datediff-and-then-use-diff-function/58379795#58379795","title":"Group rows by datediff and then use diff function"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12215263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93640588af16c9aadd94e7d9e0eb67b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tomasgabrs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12215263/tomasgabrs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58379795,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571132059,"creation_date":1571065597,"last_edit_date":1571072354,"question_id":58379514,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58379514","body_markdown":"I have table in PostgreSQL with timestamp column `created_at` and integer column `user_id`.\r\n\r\n    id | created_at | user_id\r\n    1 | 2019-10-14 09:26:53.813 | 1\r\n    2 | 2019-10-14 09:26:54.813 | 1\r\n    3 | 2019-10-14 09:46:53.813 | 1\r\n    4 | 2019-10-14 09:46:54.813 | 2\r\n    5 | 2019-10-14 09:46:55.813 | 1\r\n    6 | 2019-10-14 09:46:56.813 | 1\r\n    7 | 2019-10-14 09:46:57.813 | 2\r\n\r\nEach row represents some action from user.

My suspicion is that somehow the theme isn&#39;t updating between the two. Is there a better way to share the style info between the components? Would it be possible to use React context to do this? Frankly, I&#39;m stumped. :-(","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379444/how-to-refactor-material-ui-demo-that-shares-theme-information","title":"How to refactor material-ui demo that shares theme information"},{"tags":["wordpress","woocommerce"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":836,"user_id":5757195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99821f8be62e328a434738182a3664?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jack Robson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5757195/jack-robson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571066818,"creation_date":1571066818,"answer_id":58379827,"question_id":58379442,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58379827","body_markdown":"This ended up being the solution:\r\n\r\n    function jdr_qty_sold_by_product_id( $product_id ) {\r\n      global $wpdb;\r\n\r\n      $data = jdr_get_orders_ids_and_item_ids_from_product_id( $product_id );\r\n\r\n      $order_item_ids = array_map(function ($obj) { return $obj-&gt;order_item_id;

personal experience making unconventional 2D environments, all I can say is to try different things and see what works. I can&#39;t discern from your description if you&#39;d be able to just brute-force the collision detection or if you&#39;d need a quadtree; There&#39;s a possibility you may need to multithread this if you have an extraordinary number of curves.\r\n\r\nI think an appropriate thing to do would be to make a `Segment` class for each of your polylines (because they&#39;re essentially a collection of segments, not a curve), and use a quadtree to discriminate which segments are nearest to the circle, which would also be placed into the quadtree. That way whenever you trigger a collision, you can mark each overlapping segment as &quot;selected&quot; and do whatever it is you need to do. I think only having them as an array of points makes life harder, and is only really something the graphics pipeline would find useful. \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re finding that your lines are too dense with points, I would suggest looking at Polyline Decimation algorithms to reduce their complexity; if that would still suit your purposes, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58379439/line-erase-scene-circle-and-curve-intersection-problem-in-two-dimensional-space/58379791#58379791","title":"Line Erase Scene: circle and curve intersection problem in two-dimensional space"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":6676972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TotvU8qdfQA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/-Kg59N1l4D8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"聂小涛","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6676972/%e8%81%82%e5%b0%8f%e6%b6%9b"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571068333,"creation_date":1571065378,"question_id":58379439,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58379439","body_markdown":"At present, I encounter a line erasure scenario in my project.
