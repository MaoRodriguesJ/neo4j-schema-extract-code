caused because the Corda Enterprise uses `com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin` of version **2.9.7** and which overrides the default one for Braid **2.9.5** and Braid seems not to like it.\r\n\r\nIf you will browse the repo of `jackson-module-kotlin` and look at the constructor of the class `KotlinModule`, you can see the following change, \r\nin **2.9.5** it was declared as \r\n```\r\nclass KotlinModule(val reflectionCacheSize: Int = 512) : SimpleModule(PackageVersion.VERSION)\r\n```\r\nand in **2.9.7** it was changed to \r\n```\r\nclass KotlinModule(val reflectionCacheSize: Int = 512, val nullToEmptyCollection: Boolean = false, val nullToEmptyMap: Boolean = false) : SimpleModule(PackageVersion.VERSION)\r\n```\r\n which is causing the reflection api not being able to find it.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492344/corda-io-bluebank-braid-has-a-problem-with-corda-enterprise","title":"Corda

The Jupyter notebook URL did have the token and so I was able to open the notebook instance in the browser. But I cannot use it in that server for other reasons. So I have to make it work in this server.\r\n\r\nNow here&#39;s something that had happened before.\r\n\r\nSo I used to run the Jupyter notebook through the ```nohup``` command so that it would keep running in the background even if the terminal session window closes. Now one fine day, I accidently killed all the ```nohup``` processes and since then I haven&#39;t been able to start Jupter anymore.\r\n\r\nThe internet and SO in general hasn&#39;t provided any direction as to what could cause this.\r\n\r\nAny help will be much

behavior of spawning a new worker process is called overlapped recycling.  You can disable this behavior and allow for the worker process to shut down completely before the new process is started.  You can even disable recycling on configuration change.\r\n\r\nFor local IIS, modify the advanced properties of the app pool and configure the **Disable Overlapped Recycle** and/or **Disable Recycling for Configuration Changes** options.  I believe the latter is only available in IIS 10+.\r\n\r\n[![Configure Applcation Pool][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe process for Azure is a bit trickier.  It involves updating the applicationHost.config for which you need to use Kudu.  See [this thread][2] for detailed instructions.\r\n\r\nEssentially, it involves creating an XDT (transform) file to update the config file.  An example can be found:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Xdt-transform-samples#remove-all-your-recycling-options-from-your-net-4-application-pool-and-make-it-available-always\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nIf the above does not prevent two worker processes running concurrently, you may also need to configure the **Shutdown Time Limit**.  In the transform file, include the second line in the following block:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;add name=&quot;yourAppPoolNameHere&quot; autoStart=&quot;true&quot; managedRuntimeVersion=&quot;v4.0&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;processModel shutdownTimeLimit=&quot;00:00:01&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWord of caution, the above will result in svchost.exe killing the w3wp.exe process after 1 second without any grace.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/QhTvS.png\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27421024/disable-pool-recycling-on-azure-websites","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492279/how-to-share-a-semaphore-across-2-w3wp-exe-iis-processes/58492941#58492941","title":"How to share a Semaphore across 2 w3wp.exe IIS processes"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":9177351,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P1CwK1m1ync/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/Ysa1wTqPmQs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"john blair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9177351/john-blair"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571831977,"creation_date":1571831977,"answer_id":58522389,"question_id":58492279,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58522389","body_markdown":"This is a workaround - not an answer - but posting it here in case it helps others - as it is buried in one of my comments which is hidden by default.\r\n\r\nSetting WEBSITE_DISABLE_OVERLAPPED_RECYCLING to 1 in the Azure Application Settings worked in terms of serializing the w3wp processes i.e. one would shutdown completely before the other started up - in my case this avoided the need for the semaphore.

I use a semaphore to synchronize between the 2. This has worked well up until now i.e. On local IIS - config changes normally just start a new app domain, but on Azure a new w3wp.exe process is started. And this new process does not recognise an existing named semaphore.\r\n\r\nThe following code always indicates the semaphore does not exist. Even when I create a standalone console app and create the semaphore - I still get it does not exist in my web app. There seems to be a namespace in play for semaphores in IIS on Azure. I had seen another post on an early version of IIS that semaphores only became globally shared across processes if they had &quot;Global\\&quot; as a name prefix - this does not work on Azure and I can&#39;t find out what the &quot;global&quot; namespace should be - any ideas?\r\n\r\nFYI - If I run a console application - 2 instances - that both access the same semaphore they can both see it. But 2 processes running in IIS on Azure cannot.\r\n\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        // Open the semaphore \r\n        //\r\n        _semaphore2 = Semaphore.OpenExisting(name);\r\n        doesNotExist = false;\r\n    }\r\n    catch (WaitHandleCannotBeOpenedException)\r\n    {\r\n        _logger.Info&lt;MainDom&gt;(&quot;Semaphore ({name}) does not exist&quot;, name);\r\n        doesNotExist = true;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492279/how-to-share-a-semaphore-across-2-w3wp-exe-iis-processes","title":"How to share a Semaphore across 2 w3wp.exe IIS processes"},{"tags":["wordpress","iis","bad-request"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7035,"user_id":2851870,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b2a9c45d271e7b497f7e7edcf27922d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos K.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2851870/tasos-k"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571683815,"post_id":58492278,"comment_id":103314889,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492278/wordpress-all-inner-pages-returning-404-after-migrating-to-linux-server-from-win#comment103314889_58492278"},{"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":9655497,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2e494e8abb6e11980ffdcd86cec83979?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"KGreene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9655497/kgreene"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571685976,"post_id":58492278,"comment_id":103315793,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492278/wordpress-all-inner-pages-returning-404-after-migrating-to-linux-server-from-win#comment103315793_58492278"},{"owner":{"reputation":1382,"user_id":11147346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9Id5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jalpa Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11147346/jalpa-panchal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571731578,"post_id":58492278,"comment_id":103328187,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492278/wordpress-all-inner-pages-returning-404-after-migrating-to-linux-server-from-win#comment103328187_58492278"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":5743664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDgiN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brainstorm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5743664/brainstorm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571731544,"post_id":58495215,"comment_id":103328176,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492278/wordpress-all-inner-pages-returning-404-after-migrating-to-linux-server-from-win/58495215#comment103328176_58495215"},{"owner":{"reputation":1382,"user_id":11147346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9Id5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jalpa Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11147346/jalpa-panchal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":5743664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDgiN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brainstorm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5743664/brainstorm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571731702,"post_id":58495215,"comment_id":103328245,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492278/wordpress-all-inner-pages-returning-404-after-migrating-to-linux-server-from-win/58495215#comment103328245_58495215"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":4939328,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af6e58b3624d4d89fd3609fa26882ede?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wrkman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4939328/wrkman"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571699399,"creation_date":1571699399,"answer_id":58495215,"question_id":58492278,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58495215","body_markdown":"Just 3 steps can help you:\r\n\r\n1.

Here is what I want to do :\r\n````\r\nvec3 temp = CalcPointLight(pointLights[1], norm, FragPos, viewDir, fragDiffuse, fragSpecular);\r\ntemp *= (1.0 - ShadowCalculationPointLight(FragPos, pointLights[1].position, pointLights[1].shadowCubeMap));\r\ntemp *= pointLights[1].use;\r\nresult += temp\r\n````\r\nSo I have an array of structures `pointLights` and I&#39;ll just do the same thing for all 10 of them, and in order to avoid branching by adding `if`statements to check if the attribute `use`is equal to 1 I multiply the result of the light / shadow calculation by the `pointLights[1].value`.\r\n\r\nBut for some reasons it seems that if the different attributes of `pointLights[1]`are not initialized, then the `result`variable (which is later sent as the fragment color) is not drawn anymore, even when the `temp` vector is supposed to be multiplied by 0.\r\n\r\nTo me there are two solutions to that problem : either I have to generate / write a shader for each number of point lights I have to deal with (so if I want to use up to 10 lights I&#39;ll have to write 11 different shaders) ; or I always initialize all of my 10 lights with values that will make my functions always return `(0,0,0)`. For the latter solution I am not sure about how to initialize a `samplerCube` such that it will contain exclusively 0s... Or is there another solution ?\r\n\r\nEDIT : I am trying to implement the second solution but as I mentioned earlier but again, how should I initialize the samplerCube ? Should I have 6 textures of 1x1px loaded as a cubemap in the GPU memory and when I want to initialize the uniforms in my shaders, then send that &quot;empty&quot; cubemap sent, or is there a more fancy way of doing so (having a sampler giving only (0,0,0,1) ) ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492231/glsl-behavior-when-dealing-with-non-initialized-uniforms","title":"GLSL behavior when dealing with non-initialized uniforms"},{"tags":["mysql","interchange"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2060,"user_id":900032,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s0kW7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Farooq Ahmed Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/900032/farooq-ahmed-khan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571683235,"post_id":58492229,"comment_id":103314635,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492229/mysql-interchange-column-value-from-one-row-onto-another#comment103314635_58492229"},{"owner":{"reputation":474971,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571683892,"post_id":58492229,"comment_id":103314927,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492229/mysql-interchange-column-value-from-one-row-onto-another#comment103314927_58492229"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11461671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbdd296efe7790c401c3149375c80386?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"codenoob9000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11461671/codenoob9000"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571684020,"post_id":58492229,"comment_id":103314982,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492229/mysql-interchange-column-value-from-one-row-onto-another#comment103314982_58492229"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11461671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbdd296efe7790c401c3149375c80386?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"codenoob9000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11461671/codenoob9000"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11461671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbdd296efe7790c401c3149375c80386?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"codenoob9000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11461671/codenoob9000"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571683049,"creation_date":1571682733,"last_edit_date":1571683049,"question_id":58492229,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58492229","body_markdown":"    SELECT OlineDate, OlineOrder, OlineDesc, OlineGroup, OlinePrice\r\n    FROM tblorderlines\r\n    WHERE DATE(OlineDate) = &#39;2019-10-19&#39; AND OlineOrder = 170\r\n    AND OlineGroup IN (&#39;spec&#39;)\r\n\r\n    |====================================================================|\r\n    | OlineOrder |OlineDate   | OlineDesc | OlineGroup     | OlinePrice  |\r\n    |============+============+===========+================+=============|\r\n    | 10         | 2019-10-19 | Coupon    |    spec        |   -2.42     |\r\n    |------------+------------+-----------+----------------|-------------|\r\n    | 10         | 2019-10-19 | 10% OFF   |    spec        |    0.00     |\r\n    |------------+------------------------+----------------+-------------|\r\n    \r\nI am looking for a query that would interchange the &#39;10% off&#39; value over the &#39;Coupon&#39; value.

The scheme is if the `ParentAccountId` is null it&#39;s the top level parent, if the `ParentAccountId` is of length 2 then it&#39;s the 1st level child if the `ParentAccountId` is of length 5 then it&#39;s the 3rd level child then if `ParentAccountId` is of length 8 then it&#39;s 4th level child then `ParentAccountId` is of length 11 then it&#39;s 5th level child. As the 1st level child have 2 length of `ParentAccountId` then the subsequent children will have the `ParentAccountId` as `Code` of the parent plus. For better understading please see the second because my English is not that better.\r\n\r\nI am confused about the logic.

*untracked*.  Proceeding with the next `git cherry-pick` that is part of the `git rebase` sequence will overwrite them.  (The main tricky bits here are that `git rebase` mainly consists of a series of `git cherry-pick` commands, and that `git cherry-pick` uses Git&#39;s merge mechanism, so that even though you&#39;re doing a `git rebase` you are getting some files merged.)\r\n\r\n&gt; ... But I don&#39;t see those file in the folder it says the are. There is no `vendor/soundasleep` folder when I check atom ...\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the truly puzzling part.  Git definitely sees the files as existing in your work-tree.

So, I loop 7 times to each strategies and each time I remove 1 year from the Strip, the Entry Date and the Exit Date. With those new parameters I query a database with all the historical prices that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDate          Price\r\n2018-11-01    40.90\r\n2018-11-02    41.25\r\n2018-11-05    45.00\r\n2018-11-06    45.10\r\n2018-11-07    44.90\r\n2018-11-08    45.00\r\n2018-11-09    46.10\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I get a result table that look like this showing the past 7 years of the profit for buying on entry date and selling on exit date. That Also examine every day in between to identify the highest price and the lowest price of in the holding period:\r\n\r\n```\r\nId Year EntryDate\tExitDate\tEntryPrice ExitPrice Profit BestDate\tBest WorstDate Worst\r\n1\t2018 2018-11-01 2018-11-09\t40.9\t   46.1\t     5.2\t2018-11-09\t5.2\t 2018-11-02 0.35\r\n1\t2017 2017-11-01 2017-11-10\t35.55\t   38.2\t     2.65\t2017-11-09\t3.35 2017-11-02\t0.30\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor x in range(0,1470000):\r\n    #Here I populate variables from the strategy parameter table\r\n    for y in range(0,7):\r\n        #Here I modify the variables to represent each of the past seven years and then I query the prices for each of the past 7 years and populate the result table\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I have 1,470,000 strategies which populate a result table of (7 years *  1,470,000 strategies) = 10,290,000 lines, it takes way too long.

I want to take advantage of the dynamic configuration via docker-compose labels.  I would like to apply the stripPrefix middleware option so I can use the same application routing as if each app were served at the root.  However, once these rules are applied it results in a 504 Gateway Timeout response.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my set up:\r\n\r\n* Traefik 2.0.1\r\n* Docker 19.03.2, Compose 1.24.1\r\n* NGINX:latest images\r\n* A `global` docker network on which the Traefik container runs\r\n* Multiple multi-container applications, each of which includes an NGINX web server\r\n* All applications have their own `local` networks and the NGINX containers are also on the `global` network.\r\n* Each application is configured to be listening at `/` \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the `docker-compose.yml` definition for the offending NGINX container:\r\n```\r\nnginx:\r\n        image: nginx:latest\r\n        container_name: &quot;mps_nginx&quot;\r\n        volumes:\r\n        - ./nginx/confs/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/default.conf\r\n        - ./static:/www/static\r\n        restart: &quot;always&quot;\r\n        labels:\r\n            - traefik.http.routers.mps.rule=Host(`localhost`) &amp;&amp; PathPrefix(`/mps`)\r\n            - traefik.http.middlewares.strip-mps.stripprefix.prefixes=/mps\r\n            - traefik.http.routers.mps.middlewares=strip-mps@docker\r\n        networks:\r\n        - default\r\n        - mps\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe aggravating part is, when I comment out the `middlewares` labels, it runs just fine but cannot find a matching URL pattern.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to this I tested my approach using the `whoami` container that is defined in the [Traefik Quickstart Tutorial](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guides/docker-compose/basic-example/):\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Test service to make sure our local docker-compose network functions\r\n  whoami:\r\n    image: containous/whoami\r\n    labels:\r\n      - traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=Host(`localhost`) &amp;&amp; PathPrefix(`/whoami`)\r\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.strip-who.stripprefix.prefixes=/whoami\r\n      - traefik.http.routers.whoami.middlewares=strip-who@docker\r\n```\r\n\r\nA request to `http://localhost/whoami` returns (among other things)\r\n`GET / HTTP/1.1`. \r\n\r\nThis is exactly how I expected my routing approaches to work for all my other applications.  The Traefik dashboard shows green all around for every middleware I register and yet all I see is 504 errors.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any clues I would sincerely appreciate it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492175/adding-traefik-stripprefix-middleware-to-docker-compose-labels-results-in-504","title":"Adding Traefik StripPrefix middleware to docker-compose labels results in 504"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1624,"user_id":6659511,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cl0nfkTWr20/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABi4/PFJScYlYuao/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ma3oun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6659511/ma3oun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571682959,"post_id":58492174,"comment_id":103314512,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492174/python-how-to-convert-an-array-into-a-matrix-with-error-attributeerror-matr#comment103314512_58492174"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12086391,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q5r-dcSIHO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfYRkzfmUlB4cwbVfmxsCfpP03b4Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Stan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086391/stan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1624,"user_id":6659511,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cl0nfkTWr20/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABi4/PFJScYlYuao/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ma3oun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6659511/ma3oun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571683143,"post_id":58492174,"comment_id":103314596,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492174/python-how-to-convert-an-array-into-a-matrix-with-error-attributeerror-matr#comment103314596_58492174"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12086391,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q5r-dcSIHO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfYRkzfmUlB4cwbVfmxsCfpP03b4Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Stan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086391/stan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571683655,"post_id":58492366,"comment_id":103314810,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492174/python-how-to-convert-an-array-into-a-matrix-with-error-attributeerror-matr/58492366#comment103314810_58492366"},{"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":6013663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4a7b2e785ad782e5103fd679b9ec849?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Masudur Rahman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6013663/masudur-rahman"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12086391,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q5r-dcSIHO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfYRkzfmUlB4cwbVfmxsCfpP03b4Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Stan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086391/stan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571684051,"post_id":58492366,"comment_id":103314993,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492174/python-how-to-convert-an-array-into-a-matrix-with-error-attributeerror-matr/58492366#comment103314993_58492366"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":6013663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4a7b2e785ad782e5103fd679b9ec849?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Masudur Rahman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6013663/masudur-rahman"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571683343,"creation_date":1571683343,"answer_id":58492366,"question_id":58492174,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58492366","body_markdown":"You can just replace your `a = np.matrix(a)` with `a = Matrix(a)`.

wish to draw two triangles (having one common vertex) with two different colors using an index buffer. How can I do so?\r\n\r\nWithout using an index buffer, two such triangles can easily be drawn by just repeating the common vertex data. Yes, I can still use an index buffer. But in that case, there is no advantage of using an index buffer. My vertex data is given below:\r\n\r\n    glm::vec4 positions[] = {\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+0.0f, +0.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+1.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(-1.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(-1.0f, -1.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+1.0f, -1.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f)\r\n        };\r\n    glm::vec4 colors[] = {\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+1.0f, +0.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+1.0f, +0.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+1.0f, +0.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+0.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f),\r\n\t    glm::vec4(+0.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f)\r\n        };\r\n\r\n    int indices[] = {\r\n\t    0, 1, 2,\r\n\t    0, 3, 4\r\n        };\r\n\r\nI set the attribute layout in the following way:\r\n\r\n    int positionStride = sizeof(vertex-&gt;position) + sizeof(vertex-&gt;color);\r\n\t   int positionOffset = 0;\r\n\t   glEnableVertexAttribArray(vertex-&gt;POSITION);\r\n\t   glVertexAttribPointer(vertex-&gt;POSITION, vertex-&gt;position.length(), \r\n           GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, positionStride, (const void*)positionOffset);\r\n\r\n\tint colorStride = sizeof(vertex-&gt;color) + sizeof(vertex-&gt;position);\r\n\t   int colorOffset = positionOffset + sizeof(vertex-&gt;position);\r\n\t   glEnableVertexAttribArray(vertex-&gt;COLOR);\r\n\t   glVertexAttribPointer(vertex-&gt;COLOR, vertex-&gt;color.length(), GL_FLOAT, \r\n          GL_FALSE, colorStride, (const void*)colorOffset);\r\n\r\nMy vertex class is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n    class Vertex\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n\t    Vertex();\r\n\t    ~Vertex();\r\n\t    enum Attribute\r\n\t    {\r\n\t\t    POSITION,\r\n\t\t    COLOR\r\n\t    };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUsing the above set up I get a perfect red triangle but not the green one as expected. Moreover, despite having only two unique colors, I have to repeat the colors. Since the triangle is the simplest type of geometric object which forms a plane, there are many cases where two adjacent triangles (sharing one or two vertices) need to be rendered with different constant colors. I want to take advantage of using an index buffer and at the same time also want to render two adjacent triangles with constant colors.\r\n\r\nUsing two unique colors instead of 5 redundant colors will be an added bonus.\r\n\r\nIs there any efficient way to accomplish this?\r\n\r\n[@ Nicol Bolas: I checked that link even before posting this question. Since I am allowed to use only one index buffer, the trick is really in ordering the indices to fit both the position and color data. However, there are 5 positions and two unique colors. If I arrange the indices to fit the position, I have to define\r\n\r\n    int indices[] = {\r\n\t    0, 1, 2,\r\n\t    0, 3, 4\r\n        };\r\nHowever, if I wish to fit the color data, I need the indices as\r\n\r\n    int indices[] = {\r\n\t    0, 1, 2,\r\n\t    3, 3, 4\r\n        };\r\n\r\nprovided I duplicate the colors.\r\n]","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492158/how-can-i-draw-two-triangles-using-index-buffer","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How can I draw two triangles using index buffer?"},{"tags":["javascript","html","canvas","xmlhttprequest","tiff"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":55596,"user_id":3702797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LbM0l.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kaiido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3702797/kaiido"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571702430,"post_id":58492156,"comment_id":103320720,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492156/load-tif-tiff-in-html5-canvas-and-avoid-download#comment103320720_58492156"},{"owner":{"reputation":677,"user_id":8801301,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dca7b2d50e6b81e1418448c4ea4b8cc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Juan I.

The **userIP** in the response object allways contains the server IP instead of the client IP.\r\n\r\n```\r\nip: req.ip\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492146/express-create-new-request-with-the-ip-adress-of-the-client-to-google-cloud-fun","title":"Express: Create new request with the IP-Adress of the client to Google Cloud Functions"},{"tags":["python","pandas"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571682828,"creation_date":1571682828,"answer_id":58492248,"question_id":58492145,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58492248","body_markdown":"My guess is that your data is a Pandas dataframe.

Python doesn&#39;t enforce type coercion like this - the notation you use here (`left: Expr`) is called &quot;type *hinting*&quot;, and is solely for the purposes of documentation and APIs - it&#39;s not in any way enforced by the language as it&#39;s running. If someone does\r\n\r\n    myOp = BinOp(&#39;+&#39;, 3.5, 4.8)\r\n\r\nthen `BinOp()` gets passed a string and two floats - *not `Expr`s*. This is different from languages like C, where the arguments might be automatically coerced, or Java, which might throw a compile-time error. At which point the error is obvious - floats don&#39;t have an `evaluation()` method.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know where your `Expr` class comes from, but you might need to coerce `left` and `right` to `Expr()` inside the `BinOp` constructor:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef __init__(self, op, left, right):\r\n    self.operator = op\r\n    self.left = Expr(left)\r\n    self.right = Expr(right)\r\n```\r\n\r\nif `Expr` is a well-designed data structure, than passing an instance to a constructor should probably produce a copy, which is sufficient for our purposes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58492132/evaluating-an-expression/58492228#58492228","title":"Evaluating an expression"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10808147,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1247720252045220/picture?type=large","display_name":"shiroshiro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10808147/shiroshiro"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58492228,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571682730,"creation_date":1571682313,"question_id":58492132,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58492132","body_markdown":"I was working on a small coding question about implementing a method for evaluating a simple expression. \r\n\r\nOthers methods are working correctly but I keep getting &quot;AttributeError: &#39;float&#39; object has no attribute &#39;evaluation&#39; &quot; .
