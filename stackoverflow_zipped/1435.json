Here is how to do this:\r\n\r\nWe first off need a List of the operations we want to perform.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar methodList = new List&lt;Func&lt;QCTraceSimulator, long, Task&lt;QVoid&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n{\r\n    QuantumOperation.Run,\r\n    // Add more methods here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a List of [Func](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-func-delegate)s. A Func is a delegate type that represents a method with a parameter and a return value. Here our methods need to look like this to be able to be added to our List:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic Task&lt;QVoid&gt; SomeName(QCTraceSimulator sim, long parameter)\r\n{ ...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also need a list of parameters you want to try this with:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar paramsList = new List&lt;long&gt;\r\n{\r\n    1,\r\n    2,\r\n   -2147483648,\r\n    2147483647\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can iterate through these and run our method like so:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic void RunMethodsOnSimulator(QCTraceSimulator sim)\r\n{\r\n    // Iterate through every method\r\n    foreach (var method in methodList)\r\n    {\r\n        // Iterate through every parameter\r\n        foreach (var parameter in paramsList)\r\n        {\r\n            // Execute the given method with the given parameter\r\n            Task&lt;QVoid&gt; result = method(sim, parameter);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now do whatever you want with the `result`. This will result in every method being called with every parameter once\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this answer only solves this problem for methods that return a `Task&lt;QVoid&gt;` and take a `QCTraceSimulator` and a `long` as parameter. This solution however avoids having to modify any `QuantumOperation` classes (and hopefully teaches you a little about delegates)\r\n\r\nHere is what the `paramsList` and the `RunMethodsOnSimulator` method would like with 2 or more parameters:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nmethodList = new List&lt;Func&lt;QCTraceSimulator, long, int, Task&lt;QVoid&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n{\r\n    QuantumOperation.Run,\r\n    // Add more methods here\r\n}\r\n\r\nparamsList = new List&lt;Tuple&lt;long, int&gt;&gt;\r\n{\r\n    new Tuple&lt;long, int&gt;(1, 1),\r\n    new Tuple&lt;long, int&gt;(2, 1),\r\n    new Tuple&lt;long, int&gt;(1, 2),\r\n    new Tuple&lt;long, int&gt;(-2147483648, 1)\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void RunMethodsOnSimulator(QCTraceSimulator sim)\r\n{\r\n    // Iterate through every method\r\n    foreach (var method in methodList)\r\n    {\r\n        // Iterate through every parameter\r\n        foreach (var parameter in paramsList)\r\n        {\r\n            // Execute the given method with the given parameter\r\n            Task&lt;QVoid&gt; result = method(sim, parameter.Item1, parameter.Item2);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200757/using-methods-from-a-type-passed-as-a-parameter-in-c/58201492#58201492","title":"Using methods from a type passed as a parameter in C#"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8148,"user_id":952296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f745173fd1182dbe88a6a6f6196c89ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Flater","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/952296/flater"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570025926,"creation_date":1570025926,"answer_id":58203414,"question_id":58200757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58203414","body_markdown":"Calling a method on an object whose type is generically defined requires you to use a [generic constraint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/constraints-on-type-parameters) which ensures that the used generic type defines the expected method.\r\n\r\nAt its core, this relies on polymorphism to ensure that even though the specific type can vary, it is known that all usable generic types (which can be limited via constraints) contain this specific method you wish to call.\r\n\r\n**Static classes and methods lack this feature**. They cannot inherit, nor can they implement interfaces, nor can you pass them via method parameters (and trying to do it via generic is not the solution). There is no way to create an &quot;inheritance-like&quot; link between two static methods of two different static classes; even if the methods have the same signature otherwise.\r\n\r\nAre there other ways?

If you are able to do this, this is the superior option.\r\n\r\n**(2)** If you can&#39;t avoid statics, you can still wrap your static in an instanced wrapper, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    public class IWrapper\r\n    {\r\n        void DoTheThing(int foo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public QuantumOperationWrapper : IWrapper\r\n    {\r\n        public void DoTheThing(int foo)\r\n        {\r\n            QuantumOperationWrapper.Run(foo);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public OtherStaticOperationWrapper : IWrapper\r\n    {\r\n        public void DoTheThing(int foo)\r\n        {\r\n            OtherStaticOperationWrapper.Run(foo);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis effectively &quot;unstatics&quot; the static code, in a way that you can now rely on the knowledge that all your wrappers implement/inherit the common `BaseWrapper` and thus both implement the `DoTheThing` method.\r\n\r\nYour generic method can then rely on this:\r\n\r\n    public void DoTheGenericThing&lt;T&gt;(T obj) where T : IWrapper\r\n    {\r\n        obj.DoTheThing(123);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n_Note: In this particular case you don&#39;t even need generics to begin with. I assume you don&#39;t really need generics in this case, but since the answer can apply to both generic and non-generic cases, I&#39;ve left the generic parameter in the solution. There may be specific cases in which you still need to use generics, though I suspect this is not one of them._\r\n\r\n**(3)** A third but **very dirty** option is to use reflection to call the method anyway and just assume you never pass in a type which does not have the expected static method. But this is a really bad practice approach which will be fraught with bugs, it will be nigh impossible to debug, and it&#39;s absolutely not refactor-friendly.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200757/using-methods-from-a-type-passed-as-a-parameter-in-c/58203414#58203414","title":"Using methods from a type passed as a parameter in C#"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":4839516,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mGj5ZPobb4M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/cZTgby9ywmE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sam Jaques","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4839516/sam-jaques"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570107696,"post_id":58206505,"comment_id":102815198,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200757/using-methods-from-a-type-passed-as-a-parameter-in-c/58206505#comment102815198_58206505"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":166,"user_id":8773388,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb5cb1de56888440f40c982df71b8a33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"El capi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8773388/el-capi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570037592,"creation_date":1570037592,"answer_id":58206505,"question_id":58200757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58206505","body_markdown":"The way the Q# simulation tests deal with this is by having a method that receives a delegate with some code you want to execute on the simulator, in particular, the simulator unittests have the [`RunWithMultipleSimulators`](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/8b5a0c4c7546eb841f0c6677f89d5ee52adb9e61/src/Simulation/Simulators.Tests/OperationsTestHelper.cs#L143) method that is broadly used in places like [CoreTests.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/master/src/Simulation/Simulators.Tests/CoreTests.cs); this is an example of how it is used:\r\n\r\n\r\n        [Fact]\r\n        public void RandomOperation()\r\n        {\r\n            Helper.RunWithMultipleSimulators((s) =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                Circuits.RandomOperationTest.Run(s).Wait(); // Throws if it doesn&#39;t succeed\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200757/using-methods-from-a-type-passed-as-a-parameter-in-c/58206505#58206505","title":"Using methods from a type passed as a parameter in C#"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":4839516,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mGj5ZPobb4M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/cZTgby9ywmE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sam Jaques","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4839516/sam-jaques"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570108030,"post_id":58206585,"comment_id":102815387,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200757/using-methods-from-a-type-passed-as-a-parameter-in-c/58206585#comment102815387_58206585"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":9931593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbd379d206d431b11998f19b66b1dde6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alan Geller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9931593/alan-geller"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570037970,"creation_date":1570037970,"answer_id":58206585,"question_id":58200757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58206585","body_markdown":"I think you&#39;re having two separate problems: you&#39;re not getting the results back, and dealing with classes is making looping through different operations difficult. Let me try to address them separately.\r\n\r\nResults from running an operation are returned from the `Run` method, not stored in the simulator. More specifically, if you invoke an operation that returns a Q# `int`, the return value of the `Run` method will be `Task&lt;long&gt;`. You can then use the `value` property of the task to get the actual result, or use the `async`/`await` pattern, whichever you like.\r\n\r\nAll of the operation classes can be instantiated, and they all implement the `ICallable` interface. This interface has an `Apply` method that gets passed the arguments to the operation and returns the (asynchronous) results. Each instance has to get properly instantiated with a reference to the simulator; the easiest way to do this is to call the `Get` generic method on the simulator instance.\r\n\r\nIf you look at [SimulatorBase.cs][1], in the implementation of the `Run` method on line 101, you can see how this is done. In this method, `T` is the class of the operation; `I` is the class of the operation input; and `O` is the class of the operation return value. You could use basically the same code to create a list of objects that you then call `Apply` on with varying arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/8b5a0c4c7546eb841f0c6677f89d5ee52adb9e61/src/Simulation/Common/SimulatorBase.cs#L101","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200757/using-methods-from-a-type-passed-as-a-parameter-in-c/58206585#58206585","title":"Using methods from a type passed as a parameter in C#"}],"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":4839516,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mGj5ZPobb4M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/cZTgby9ywmE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sam Jaques","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4839516/sam-jaques"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":122,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58201492,"answer_count":6,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570037970,"creation_date":1570016363,"last_edit_date":1570018969,"question_id":58200757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200757","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working in Q#, a quantum programming language based on C#. Quantum operations become C# classes, from which you can do things like \r\n\r\n    QuantumOperation.run(simulator, param1, param2);\r\n\r\nwhich will use a quantum simulator `simulator` to run the operation `QuantumOperation` with the parameters `param1` and `param2`.\r\n\r\nI have many different operations which I want to run using different simulators and different parameters. What I would like to do is pass the quantum operation to another method, which will iterate through all the simulators and parameters. Then I can call this method with all the quantum operations I want. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that - as far as I can tell - a quantum operation is really a *class* and not an object. So, for example, if I write:\r\n\r\n`static void someMethod&lt;Qop&gt;(){...}`\r\n\r\nthen I can call this with a quantum operation `QuantumOperation` as:\r\n\r\n`someMethod&lt;QuantumOperation&gt;()`\r\n\r\nand it compiles fine. However, if I try to do something like \r\n\r\n    static void someMethod&lt;Qop&gt;(Qop quantumOperation){ ...}\r\n    \r\n    someMethod&lt;QuantumOperation&gt;(quantumOperation);\r\n\r\nI get an error of &quot;`QuantumOperation` is a type, which is not valid in the given context&quot; for the second line. \r\n\r\nIf I try:\r\n\r\n    static void someMethod&lt;Qop&gt;(...){\r\n        ...\r\n        Qop.Run(...);\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nit similarly says: &quot;&#39;Qop&#39; is a type parameter, which is not valid in the given context&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be happening here is that I&#39;m passing the class as a type. But then when I want to treat the type as a class, I can&#39;t. I looked for ways to pass a class as an argument, but I only see ways to do this that will create objects in that class. But I can&#39;t use an object, since &quot;Run&quot; is a static method. \r\n\r\n(I could try passing an object and getting the class from that, but (a) I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to create objects of quantum operation classes, and (b) I can only find `public Type GetType`, which returns a type and not a class, giving the same problem).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to pass a *class* as an argument, then reference static methods of that class, without ever instantiating an object?\r\n\r\nNow, maybe I&#39;m asking too much, since, as far as C# is concerned, it&#39;s a coincidence that all these classes have a method called &quot;Run&quot;. It maybe *shouldn&#39;t* be able to attempt to call methods with the same name from different classes. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, I could construct a method for each quantum operation and then pass those methods. The method would look like:\r\n\r\n    static void QuantumOperationWrapper(QuantumSimulator simulator, Int int_parameter){\r\n        QuantumOperation.Run(simulator, in_parameter);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI would need to make a new method for each quantum operation, but that&#39;s not that bad. Then I can pass this as a delegate or Func to the methods I want. The problem is that the results I want are contained in the `QuantumSimulator` object. So what I want to do is something like:\r\n\r\n    QuantumOperationWrapper(simulator, 3);\r\n    simulator.GetResults();\r\n\r\nBut when I do this, the results are empty. My guess is that, somehow, the simulator is being passed by value, or treated as immutable, or something that prevents `QuantumOperationWrapper` from altering internal parameters of the simulator. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to I can ensure that a delegate/Func will alter the internal state of its arguments?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I can make a delegate for the `Run` method, as follows:\r\n\r\n`public delegate System.Threading.Tasks.Task&lt;Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.Core.QVoid&gt; RunQop(QCTraceSimulator sim, long n);`\r\n\r\nThen I can construct `static void someMethod(RunQop runner, ...)`, and pass `QuantumOperation.Run` as the first argument. \r\n\r\nHowever, I have the same problem, that the `QCTraceSimulator` I pass as an argument does not keep any of the simulation results it makes when I call this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200757/using-methods-from-a-type-passed-as-a-parameter-in-c","title":"Using methods from a type passed as a parameter in C#"},{"tags":["json.net","schema"],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":5882707,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1cc87989a3e4f93cd4dabb2e8357a0f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user5882707","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5882707/user5882707"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570016360,"creation_date":1570016360,"question_id":58200756,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200756","body_markdown":"Using Newtonsoft.Json.Schema I can write a Json schema for a C# class using this code snippet:\r\n\r\n    JSchemaGenerator generator = new JSchemaGenerator();\r\n    generator.GenerationProviders.Add(new StringEnumGenerationProvider());\r\n    JSchema schema = generator.Generate(typeof(MyClass));\r\n\r\nWhat I need is a schema that conforms to json-schema &#39;draft-04&#39; \r\nIs it possible to tell the &#39;generator which schema version to use for output?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200756/jschemagenerator-for-writing-draft-4","title":"JSchemaGenerator for writing draft 4"},{"tags":["javascript","momentjs"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":397,"user_id":11094437,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1bd72b2ae0963ec8e8c8f55a45af4e3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Petro Gromovo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11094437/petro-gromovo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570117729,"creation_date":1570117729,"answer_id":58222720,"question_id":58200754,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58222720","body_markdown":"I managed it with mixin method :\r\n        momentDatetime(datetime, datetime_format, default_val) {\r\n\r\n        if (typeof datetime == &quot;object&quot;) {\r\n            return  Vue.moment(datetime).format(datetime_format);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n and calling it :\r\n\r\n        this.momentDatetime( Vue.moment(),\r\n\r\nIt works !","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200754/how-correctly-convert-date-time-to-moment-format/58222720#58222720","title":"How correctly convert date time to moment format?"}],"owner":{"reputation":397,"user_id":11094437,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1bd72b2ae0963ec8e8c8f55a45af4e3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Petro Gromovo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11094437/petro-gromovo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58222720,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570117729,"creation_date":1570016349,"question_id":58200754,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200754","body_markdown":"Using vuejs 2.6 I have a function to which I sent datetime in string format like : 2019-06-03 16:53:29 , convert it to \r\nmoment format and next I converto to other string format, like:\r\n\r\n    momentDatetime(datetime, datetime_format, default_val) {\r\n\r\n        let dt= datetime\r\n        if (typeof datetime == &quot;string&quot;) {\r\n            if (datetime_format == &quot;&quot;) return &#39;&#39;;\r\n\r\n            dt = Vue.moment(String(datetime));\r\n\r\n        } // if (typeof datetime == &quot;string&quot;) {\r\n\r\n            \r\nThat works if datetime is string, now I want to send (current) datetime, like :\r\n\r\n        item.created_at= this.momentDatetime( moment( new Date() ), this.settings_js_moment_datetime_format )\r\n\r\nI failed with line above.

what is happening has nothing to do with `cursor.execute`. It is just the way you are formatting the string in python.\r\n\r\nWe should first note that %s %d can be specific to SQL, and that these can also be used in python for string formatting.\r\n\r\nSo taking this into account, I think you have no need to use %s for string formatting (which on top does not help with readability). And since you are `cursor.execute`ing straight to your database, you could format your string straight away in python.\r\n\r\nSmall check to see whats happening:\r\n\r\n```\r\np = &quot;23.34.67.0/22&quot;\r\nas_tmp = &quot;hello&quot;\r\n_day = &quot;3&quot;\r\nprint(&quot;SELECT %s CONCAT(%s, %s) %s FROM Jule&quot;, (p, &#39;DAY_&#39; + _day, as_tmp, &#39;DAY_&#39; + _day))\r\n# output\r\n# SELECT %s CONCAT(%s, %s) %s FROM Jule (&#39;23.34.67.0/22&#39;, &#39;DAY_3&#39;, &#39;hello&#39;, &#39;DAY_3&#39;)\r\n# ^^^^ so this is what is being sent in cursor.execute (with all the quotes and so on)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you format with an f-string you will increase readability, and you should get rid of your problem with the quotes\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(f&quot;SELECT &#39;{p}&#39; CONCAT(DAY_{_day}, &#39;{as_tmp}&#39;) DAY_{_day} FROM Jule&quot;)\r\n# output\r\n# SELECT &#39;23.34.67.0/22&#39; CONCAT(DAY_3, &#39;hello&#39;) DAY_3 FROM Jule\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the solution could be: \r\n```\r\ncursor.execute(f&quot;SELECT &#39;{p}&#39; CONCAT(DAY_{_day}, &#39;{as_tmp}&#39;) DAY_{_day} FROM Jule&quot;)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200722/python-adds-single-quote-to-my-query-parameters/58201276#58201276","title":"Python adds single quote to my query parameters"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1122,"user_id":1506086,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MaFbv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rob Streeting","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1506086/rob-streeting"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570019617,"creation_date":1570019617,"answer_id":58201620,"question_id":58200722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58201620","body_markdown":"The reason that you end up with quotes is because `cursor.execute` adds these around values you pass in as arguments. This is totally appropriate for your second argument, because if the value &#39;hello&#39; was inserted into the query as-is you would end up with a query like this:\r\n\r\n     SELECT &#39;23.34.67.0/22&#39; CONCAT(DAY_31, hello) DAY_31 FROM Jule\r\n\r\nand you would have errors telling you that MySQL can&#39;t identify what `hello` should refer to.\r\n\r\nObviously though, this is not appropriate for situations where you want to pass in **field names**, or any other part of the query that is not a primitive string value. In these cases, you will need to splice them into your string before executing the query. One way you could do that is with [f-strings][1], but there are other alternatives as well. Here&#39;s your `cursor.execute` line with the field names spliced in using f-strings:\r\n\r\n    cursor.execute(f&quot;SELECT %s, CONCAT({&#39;DAY_&#39;+_day}, %s) {&#39;DAY_&#39;+_day} FROM Jule&quot;, (p, as_tmp))\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that I&#39;ve removed the `&#39;DAY_&#39;+_day` from the arguments list as well.\r\n\r\n**Important note:**\r\n\r\nWhile this should work like this (although I think you also needed an extra comma after `SELECT &#39;23.34.67.0/22&#39;`, which I&#39;ve added in the example above), it&#39;s very important that if `day` has a value that originates from outside of your application (e.g. passed in by a user in a form field) that you make sure it is exactly in the format you want before splicing it in to your query. [Checking that the string value is an integer][2] could be one way to do that. The reason that it is important is that without this, your application could be prone to [SQL injection][3], which would potentially allow users to run arbitrary SQL on your database. If the value of `day` is calculated solely by your application, you shouldn&#39;t need to worry about this.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1267145/1506086\r\n  [3]: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200722/python-adds-single-quote-to-my-query-parameters/58201620#58201620","title":"Python adds single quote to my query parameters"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10858386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d483e45e004883cf978059eff7ac5514?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brodario","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10858386/brodario"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570019617,"creation_date":1570016232,"question_id":58200722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200722","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to execute thi query:\r\n\r\n    SELECT &#39;23.34.67.0/22&#39; CONCAT(DAY_31, &#39;hello&#39;) DAY_31 FROM Jule\r\n\r\nusing pymysql.

For e.g. During Jul 19, Client Group &quot;A&quot; was under segment type &quot;Private Business&quot;, BU=&quot;X&quot;, profit center=&quot;001&quot;, LoS=&quot;Tax&quot; and having revenue of &#163;100. During Sep 19, Client Group &quot;A&quot; came under segment type &quot;Equity Business&quot; therefore its profit center got changed to &quot;007&quot; with same BU &amp; LoS. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, we implemented a dimension to hold these hierarchy but there is no time period involved in that, that means for Client Group &quot;A&quot;, you will always see values in current hierarchy for e.g. segment type &quot;Private Equity&quot;. It impacts on revenue, as it shows dip &#163;100 for &quot;Private Business&quot; in Jul 19 and growth of &#163;100 for &quot;Equity Business&quot; in Sep 19 in reporting. This issue occurs because fact table during all time periods points to current hierarchy since dimension holds current hierarchy only.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome this issue and during analysis, I found there is another table in SAP HANA which records all these hierarchy changes over a period and holds client group hierarchy valid during that point of time. I am planning to create a work table similar to hierarchy dimension with additional columns such as effective_from &amp; effective_to for hierarchy. Then I will join this table with fact using fact&#39;s fiscal period to get exact hierarchy and update hierarchy dimension and it hash keys.\r\n\r\nWould like to hear more from you guys on whether this approach will work or do I need think differently? Please let me know if need more information.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200716/designing-a-solution-for-hierarchy","title":"Designing a solution for hierarchy"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6987,"user_id":2636929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85fa83a02c04af43fcd224821ca9b750?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stultuske","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2636929/stultuske"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570016310,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102779318,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102779318_58200715"},{"owner":{"reputation":1234,"user_id":1777956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05766f2d2a2bd141d211b9393b9c5035?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Elias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1777956/elias"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570016491,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102779404,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102779404_58200715"},{"owner":{"reputation":101057,"user_id":1393766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h0FSp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pshemo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1393766/pshemo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570016508,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102779417,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102779417_58200715"},{"owner":{"reputation":1234,"user_id":1777956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05766f2d2a2bd141d211b9393b9c5035?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Elias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1777956/elias"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570016573,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102779455,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102779455_58200715"},{"owner":{"reputation":97233,"user_id":3788176,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c18d321d8948803c05643d87b003dc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andy Turner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3788176/andy-turner"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570016730,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102779541,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102779541_58200715"},{"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":5433503,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b1e13a02740781af198c520621e726e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vaibhav shanker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5433503/vaibhav-shanker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570017073,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102779706,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102779706_58200715"},{"owner":{"reputation":102,"user_id":3382606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48f56d843bf757f161e48a9b2ebcd227?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M06494h","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3382606/m06494h"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570017982,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102780208,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102780208_58200715"},{"owner":{"reputation":25472,"user_id":85421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e56d684a3291bbab986c3e8e5d389ff9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Carlos Heuberger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/85421/carlos-heuberger"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570020638,"post_id":58200715,"comment_id":102781686,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200715/what-does-dot-represent-in-a-java-statement#comment102781686_58200715"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9745732,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad7f53d74f8e2429a927cecf965a30f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Th3_Fr3d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9745732/th3-fr3d"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":5,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1570016432,"creation_date":1570016432,"answer_id":58200783,"question_id":58200715,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58200783","body_markdown":"As you suggested the dots allow you you to access subclasses methods or fields of a class or an object (depending on their protection modifiers).

the values you want to set are all non-null, you could use a statement like\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nupdate sometable set column1 = coalesce(?, column1), colum2 = coalesce(?, column2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen when the value should not be updated, use either `PreparedStatement.setNull` with an appropriate `java.sql.Types` value or a `PreparedStatement.setXXX` of the appropriate type with a `null` as value.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the comments, an alternative if you do need to update to `null`, is to use a custom function with a sentinel value (either for updating to null or for using the current value). Something like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nupdate sometable set column1 = conditional_update(?, column1), colum2 = conditional_update(?, column2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `conditional_update` would be something like (using Firebird 3 PSQL syntax):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncreate function conditional_update(new_value varchar(500), original_value varchar(500)) \r\n  returns varchar(500)\r\nas\r\nbegin\r\n  if (new_value = &#39;$$NO_UPDATE$$&#39;) then\r\n     return original_value;\r\n  else\r\n     return new_value;\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere using `$$NO_UPDATE$$` is a sentinel value for not updating. A potential downside of this solution is the typing of columns as a string type. You always need to use string types (I&#39;m not sure if there are databases that would supports dynamic parameters and return types in this situation).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200709/jdbc-preparedstatement-in-batch-when-columns-to-set-vary-from-row-to-row/58204853#58204853","title":"JDBC PreparedStatement in batch when columns to set vary from row to row"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8708484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/602ccf9840945db48f88fa68eaef28ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"oysandvik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8708484/oysandvik"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570094453,"creation_date":1570016179,"question_id":58200709,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200709","body_markdown":"I am trying to batch updates using PreparedStatement where the data you get in varies in what you have available.\r\n\r\nSimple example:\r\n\r\nYou have a table with column x and y. Your inputdata is a representation of rows where only the modified column is present. So for row 1 you have x=&#39;foo&#39; and for row 2 you have y=&#39;bar&#39;. In order to batch these with a PreparedStatement you need one SQL statement: &quot;update table where x=?,y=? where etc&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe solution that I am working towards is setting the column where you dont have any value to the value that is already present, but I&#39;m not sure if this is possible. In raw SQL you could write &quot;update table where x=x and y=&#39;foo&#39; where etc&quot;, however I haven&#39;t found any ways to achieve this by setting the &quot;?&quot; parameter to be a reference to the column, it seems it&#39;s not possible. \r\n \r\nIs it possible to handle this case at all with PreparedStatements?

SQL Server there&#39;s a concept named [Data Type Precedence][1]. It&#39;s there in cases such as these when two different data types need to be combined because there needs to be a method to decide on what the data type of the final output will be.\r\n\r\nIn your case you&#39;re combining NVARCHAR and NUMERIC data types and as NUMERIC has the higher precedence the approach it takes is to try and convert your text data into a number which it can&#39;t do, hence the error.\r\n\r\nIf you need the conversion to run in a way other than defined in the normal precedence order then you need to explicitly make the conversion yourself with either CAST or CONVERT. In your case you need to multiply the needed numbers, convert those to text and then concatenate the currency symbol. \r\n\r\nSubsequent errors come from using fields that are neither within an aggregate or specified in the Group By of your select statement. Adding you currency field in there should resolve the other issue assuming you can&#39;t have one order with multiple currencies involved.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together gives you the following:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n    \t Orders.fkOrder,\r\n    \t Currencies.strCurrencySymbol\r\n    \t  + CAST(SUM(Items.dcUnitPrice * Items.intItemQuantity) AS varchar(50)) AS TotalPrice\r\n    FROM

managed to solve it by adding `dbo.tblCurrencies.strCurrencySymbol` into the group by and using `CONCAT()`\r\n\r\nMy query now looks like this:\r\n\r\n    SELECT        dbo.tblItems.fkOrder, { fn

dbo.tblItems.fkOrder\r\n    GROUP BY      dbo.tblItems.fkOrder, dbo.tblCurrencies.strCurrencySymbol\r\n\r\nIt also works without the `CONCAT()` \r\n\r\n    SELECT        dbo.tblItems.fkOrder,

It sounds like you want to just look at the files in a given directory.  For that, consider [`os.scandir()`][2], which returns an iterator of all files and subdirectories in a given directory.  You will just have to filter out elements that are directories:\r\n\r\n    root = &quot;/home/rob/Desktop/projects/zenjobv2&quot;\r\n    for entry in os.scandir(root):\r\n        if entry.is_dir():\r\n            continue  # Just in case there are strangely-named directories\r\n        if entry.path.endswith(&quot;.pdf&quot;) or entry.path.endswith(&quot;.xml&quot;):\r\n            # Process the file at entry.path as you see fit\r\n\r\nPrevious answer based on a poor understanding of the question:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are implicitly specifying the [`arcname` argument][3] in your call to `ZipFile.write()`, which will create a file in the archive with exactly the path you give it, subdirectories and all.  If the file you are adding to the archive is at path `/home/rob/Desktop/projects/zenjobv2/subdir1/subdir2/file.pdf`, then using the definition of [`os.path.relpath()`][4], your code effectively translates to:\r\n\r\n    fantasy_zip.write(&quot;/home/rob/Desktop/projects/zenjobv2/subdir1/subdir2/file.pdf&quot;,\r\n                      arcname=&quot;subdir1/subdir2/file.pdf&quot;,\r\n                      compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)\r\n\r\nBecause the `arcname` argument has directory separators in it, the file will be added to the archive in a subdirectory named `subdir1/subdir2`.\r\n\r\nYou probably intend to do something like this instead:\r\n\r\n    fantasy_zip.write(os.path.join(folder, file), arcname=file)\r\n\r\nThis will leave the directory structure out of the archive.

One of the input fields is a specific document name that exists in another database. There is no relationship between the database used in the application and the database for the document name. This means, that wrong document names can be entered.\r\n\r\nNow I want to make it possible to make an overview of all requests that do not have a valid document name, based on some kind of filter. \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say the user searchs for some requests with a choosen filter. 80.000 requests are found. Of these 80,000 requests, only the requests must be shown with a valid document number.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 WebApi&#39;s. The first WebApi is for the application itself. The other for interaction with de document database.\r\n\r\nMy question: Is there a fast way to only return the requests with a valid document name working with these 2 WebApi&#39;s? I think it&#39;s more a question of how to join a list of strings to another database table existing in another WebApi.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I tried so far:\r\n\r\n**Application WebApi:** \r\n   \r\n\r\n - Retrieving requests for filter\r\n - Retrieving a list of all valid document numbers by passing all document numbers (myStringList) of the requests to the second WebApi\r\n - Inner joining the list of requests with the document numbers.\r\n\r\nThis works good enough for small amount of request. In the application itself this problem is resolved by working with pagination. But an export to Excel function requires all data to be loaded without pagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Document WebApi:**\r\n\r\nThese are some sql methods i tried to use. myStringList = the list of all document numbers from the requests.\r\n\r\nThe first method takes more than one minute to execute for 80.000 document numbers.\r\nThe second method takes 30 sec for 80.000 document numbers.\r\n\r\n    var commaSeparatedList = string.Join(&quot;,&quot;, myStringList.Select(item =&gt;

is a Rolling Sum problem. In MySQL 8.0.2 and above, you can solve this using [Window functions with Frames][3]. In older versions, we can do the same using User-defined Session variables.\r\n\r\n - We first calculate the rolling sum using [Session variables][1].\r\n - Then, use the result-set in a [Derived table][2], and find the id where total sum crosses the &quot;barrier&quot; of 300. Barrier is reached when the New rolling Sum is greater than 300. We set the barrier value to 1 at this point, 0 for rows before it, and 2 and more, for the rows afterwards.\r\n - We will only consider the rows where barrier is 0.\r\n\r\nTry (works for all MySQL

The KMS paradigm is to use policy to grant access to a Customer Master Key (CMK).  As Mark pointed out above, there is a limit on the number of keys.\r\n\r\nHave a look at [this walkthrough][1]\r\n\r\nThere is a section at the bottom about Key rotation strategies that might help:\r\n\r\n&quot;A recommended approach to manual key rotation is to use key aliases within AWS KMS. This allows users to always select the same key alias when configuring databases, while the key administrator rotates the underlying CMK. By keeping the old CMK, you allow any applications that currently use this key to still decrypt any data that was encrypted by it, as long as the CMK key policy still gives the AWSServiceRoleForRDS role permission as a Key User. It also allows for any new data to be encrypted with the new CMK.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/encrypting-amazon-aurora-using-aws-kms-and-your-own-cmk/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200584/how-to-encrypt-data-in-aws-rds-with-aws-kms-on-the-column-level/58205819#58205819","title":"How to encrypt data in AWS RDS with AWS KMS on the column level?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5969,"user_id":1645712,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48781792c1fb7d61086b4fb612938c13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gusto2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1645712/gusto2"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570177092,"creation_date":1570177092,"answer_id":58232460,"question_id":58200584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58232460","body_markdown":"&gt; I would additionally like to have encrypted some particular columns in the database. \r\n\r\nThen I assume you will use a form of key wrapping ( [data keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys) ) \r\n\r\n&gt; The main problem which I observed will be the rotation of the key &lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt; ..&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt; encrypt everything again and store data in RDS &lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt; store the new key in the KMS\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the key rotation is limit amount of data encrypted by a single key, not to re-encrypt the whole encrypted content. \r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n\r\n - as already linked - encrypt your data using a random (per row?) data key. \r\n - encrypt the data key using the user-specific key. \r\n - encrypt the user-key with a KMS-key\r\n\r\nKey Rotation (KMS) should be transparent for you with no action to do. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to manually rotate the user keys, you may, IMHO it is not so critical - the user keys are used to encrypt the data keys - relatively short data with high entropy.\r\n\r\nIMHO the action by rotation taken should be creating a new key and preserving the old one for decryption purposes, not to re-encrypt all the database records\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200584/how-to-encrypt-data-in-aws-rds-with-aws-kms-on-the-column-level/58232460#58232460","title":"How to encrypt data in AWS RDS with AWS KMS on the column level?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2079,"user_id":4086321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24330b080ff7a3ae61f4f468f0b81bd6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Piotr Pradzynski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4086321/piotr-pradzynski"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570177092,"creation_date":1570015742,"question_id":58200584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200584","body_markdown":"I found that [AWS RDS allows encrypting DB resources][1] with AWS KMS.

I searched for this problem, but couldn&#39;t exactly find this particular problem.\r\n\r\nSo I am developing an app and I am using SQLiteOpenHelper to manage my database. So far so good. I have to make calls to the database every couple of seconds. I&#39;ve read quite a bit about how to properly manage the database connection, getting only an instance and such, so I implemented the Singleton design pattern. It&#39;s probably wrong, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine, the queries all run good, I am overall happy, but from time to time (and that&#39;s a rare case, which I can&#39;t reproduce willingly) I get an exception, which crashes my app. It says \r\n&gt;Fatal Exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException. Cannot perform this operation because the connection pool has been closed.\r\n\r\nLooks really simple to solve, right? Just don&#39;t close the connection. The thing is, I don&#39;t. **I never call db.close() or anything similar to that.** When I need a database instance, I call this method:\r\n\r\n    public static synchronized DBHelper getInstance(Context ctx) {\r\n     if (mInstance == null) {\r\n     mInstance = new DBHelper(ctx.getApplicationContext());\r\n     }\r\n     return mInstance;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhich should be okay, *theoretically*. I don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m doing wrong, because I never close the instance. **(should I?)** So I thought maybe there is some garbage collection, which just closes everything it considers a leak, but I am not confident that this is it. \r\n\r\nI couldn&#39;t find anything this specific anywhere. What am I doing wrong?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200574/android-database-singleton-handling","title":"Android database singleton handling"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7999}
