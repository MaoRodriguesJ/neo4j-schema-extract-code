So I would set both the Criterion and the delay in its application, counting from the &quot;Sent&quot; date/time.\r\n\r\nI could do that with scripting in gmail.\r\n\r\n**Is that possible with Outlook?**\r\n\r\nA possible convoluted way of doing it is via [a Powershell script][1], which is scheduled in Windows to be run every day, implementing all filters.\r\n\r\nI am looking for something

Blog\r\n 2. Case study\r\n 3. Webinar\r\n\r\n`Subject` can be:\r\n\r\n 1. Indoor\r\n 2. Outdoor\r\n\r\nI have two drop down menus in WordPress backend where a user can select what `type` and `subject` they want to show from `resources` (my custom post type).\r\n\r\nSay, for example, the following posts exist in `resources`:\r\n\r\n - **Post 1**: Tagged with `type` blog and `subject` outdoor.\r\n - **Post 2**: Tagged with `type` blog and `subject` indoor.\r\n - **Post 3**: Tagged with `subject` indoor.\r\n\r\nThe user can either filter by `type` or `subject`. By this I mean not both are required, only one can be selected. But, if the user does choose both a `type` and `subject`, I want it to display posts with both tags.\r\n\r\n**Current approach:**\r\n\r\n    $args = array(  \r\n      &#39;post_type&#39; =&gt; &#39;resources&#39;,\r\n      &#39;post_status&#39; =&gt; &#39;publish&#39;,\r\n      &#39;posts_per_page&#39; =&gt; 8,\r\n      &#39;tax_query&#39; =&gt; array(\r\n        &#39;relation&#39; =&gt; &#39;AND&#39;,\r\n        array(\r\n            &#39;taxonomy&#39; =&gt; &#39;type&#39;,\r\n            &#39;field&#39;    =&gt; &#39;slug&#39;,\r\n            &#39;terms&#39;    =&gt; $resource_type,\r\n        ),\r\n        array(\r\n            &#39;taxonomy&#39; =&gt; &#39;subject&#39;,\r\n            &#39;field&#39;    =&gt; &#39;slug&#39;,\r\n            &#39;terms&#39;    =&gt; $resource_subject,\r\n        ),\r\n      ),\r\n      &#39;tax_query&#39; =&gt; array(\r\n        &#39;relation&#39; =&gt; &#39;OR&#39;,\r\n        array(\r\n            &#39;taxonomy&#39; =&gt; &#39;type&#39;,\r\n            &#39;field&#39;    =&gt; &#39;slug&#39;,\r\n            &#39;terms&#39;    =&gt; $resource_type,\r\n        ),\r\n        array(\r\n            &#39;taxonomy&#39; =&gt; &#39;subject&#39;,\r\n            &#39;field&#39;    =&gt; &#39;slug&#39;,\r\n            &#39;terms&#39;    =&gt; $resource_subject,\r\n        ),\r\n      )\r\n    \r\n    );\r\n\r\n - `$resource_type`: Is the variable holding the dropdown value for\r\n   `type`. \r\n - `$resource_subject`: Is the variable holding the dropdown\r\n   value for `subject`.\r\n\r\n**Current results:**\r\n\r\n - When filtering by `subject` alone - it works.\r\n\r\n - When filtering by `type` alone - it works.\r\n\r\n - When filtering with both - it doesn&#39;t work. I.e. I&#39;ve filtered by `type` blog and `subject` indoor and it is showing me `subject` outdoor posts.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the following works when querying both, but does not work when only choosing one:\r\n\r\n     $args = array(  \r\n        &#39;post_type&#39;

am struggling with the following task: for our cross-platform application I want to enable a capslock warning for the user. This works perfectly on Windows and macOS and is a bit unnecessarily complicated but doable on Linux with X11, though I cannot find out how to do it properly on Wayland.\r\n\r\nWe are using Qt5, so the more Qt APIs I can use for this, the better. I see that Qt has a very extensive Wayland framework, but it seems to be designed primarily for writing your own compositor and not for accessing specifics of the underlying platform plugin.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the code as far as I have it:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;QGuiApplication&gt;\r\n#include &lt;qpa/qplatformnativeinterface.h&gt;\r\n\r\n// namespace required to avoid name clashes with declarations in XKBlib.h\r\nnamespace X11\r\n{\r\n#include &lt;X11/XKBlib.h&gt;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid checkCapslockState()\r\n{\r\n    // ... Windows and macOS one-liners\r\n\r\n    // Here starts the Linux mess.\r\n    // At least I can query the display with this for both X11 and Wayland.\r\n    QPlatformNativeInterface* native = QGuiApplication::platformNativeInterface();\r\n    auto* display = native-&gt;nativeResourceForWindow(&quot;display&quot;, nullptr);\r\n    if (!display) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const QString platform = QGuiApplication::platformName();\r\n    if (platform == &quot;xcb&quot;) {\r\n        unsigned state = 0;\r\n        if (X11::XkbGetIndicatorState(reinterpret_cast&lt;X11::Display*&gt;(display), XkbUseCoreKbd, &amp;state) == Success) {\r\n            // works fine\r\n            newCapslockState = ((state &amp; 1u) != 0);\r\n        }\r\n    } else if (platform == &quot;wayland&quot;) {\r\n        // but how to proceed here?\r\n        // struct wl_display* waylandDisplay = reinterpret_cast&lt;struct wl_display*&gt;(display);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that I have to get hold of the Wayland `wl_seat` object somehow, which holds information about the `wl_keyboard`. However, I cannot find a way to access these objects from the `wl_display` object alone without instantiating all sorts of contexts. The Qt application itself is already running as a Wayland client, so there should be a way to access these objects, I would assume. Unfortunately, the Wayland documentation on this is very sparse and quite opaque for someone not familiar with the whole architecture and Wayland&#39;s user base is still too small that things pop up on Google.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58499240/get-capslock-state-on-linux-with-wayland","title":"Get Capslock state on Linux with Wayland"},{"tags":["php","fuelphp","fuelphp-orm"],"owner":{"reputation":93,"user_id":1752065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e54a0e441f775cd2897a8a25f07817ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1752065","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1752065/user1752065"},"last_editor":{"reputation":93,"user_id":1752065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e54a0e441f775cd2897a8a25f07817ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1752065","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1752065/user1752065"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571743884,"creation_date":1571729831,"last_edit_date":1571743884,"question_id":58499239,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58499239","body_markdown":"I have upgraded my fuelphp version from 1.6 to 1.8.After that i noticed some MSSQL query errors.\r\n\r\nError Message i got is \r\n\r\n    Fuel\\Core\\Database_Exception [ HY000 (156) ]:\r\n    SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 156 Incorrect syntax near the keyword &#39;WHERE&#39;.

v-bind:class=&quot;{&#39;is-complete&#39;:todo.completed}&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;\r\n          &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; v-on:change=&quot;markComplete&quot;&gt;\r\n          {{todo.title}}\r\n          &lt;button @click=&quot;$emit(&#39;del-todo&#39;, todo.id)&quot;class=&quot;del&quot;&gt;x&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/template&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    export default {\r\n      name: &quot;TodoItem&quot;,\r\n      props:[&quot;todo&quot;],\r\n      methods: {\r\n        markComplete(){\r\n          this.todo.completed = !this.todo.completed\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;style scoped&gt;\r\n      .todo-item {\r\n        background: #f4f4f4;\r\n        padding: 10px;\r\n        border-bottom: 1px #ccc dotted;\r\n      }\r\n      .is-complete {\r\n        text-decoration: line-through;\r\n      }\r\n      .del {\r\n        background: #ff0000;\r\n        color: #fff;\r\n        border: none;\r\n        padding: 5px 9px;\r\n        border-radius: 50%;\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n        float: right;\r\n      }\r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\nNow what confuses me is the syntax surrounding the emitted events. \r\nIn TodoItem, I have this emitted event from the button:\r\n\r\n    &lt;button @click=&quot;$emit(&#39;del-todo&#39;, todo.id)&quot;class=&quot;del&quot;&gt;x&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\nNow this is completely understandable for me because we have the event trigger specified with &quot;@click&quot;. \r\nThis is then exported to parent, Todos.vue, and there we can see this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;TodoItem v-bind:todo=&quot;todo&quot; v-on:del-todo=&quot;$emit(&#39;del-todo&#39;, todo.id)&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nHere Im starting to get confused. \r\nAgain, in the long syntax, a event trigger is defined:\r\n\r\n    v-on:del-todo\r\n\r\nBut del-todo is not an event trigger. Its neither click, nor change, nor input. \r\nSo how can this code even work? What does vue.js imply when it encounters code like above?\r\n\r\nMy confusion then gets even worse in Home.vue\r\n\r\n    &lt;Todos v-bind:todos=&quot;todos&quot; v-on:del-todo=&quot;deleteTodo&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nFor the third time, an event trigger is specified.\r\nAnd for the second time, this event trigger doesn&#39;t specify a &quot;native&quot; trigger like click. \r\n\r\nNow I already wrapped my head around this and I could at least beat SOME sense into it. \r\nIn Todos.vue and Home.vue, the specified events seem to execute when del-todo has fired. So they are like callbacks, they take the return value of del-todo.\r\nIn Todos.vue, triggering del-todo emits del-todo to its parent, Home.vue. \r\nIs that correct? \r\n\r\nHome.vue then triggers deleteTodo when del-todo is fired. \r\nHowever, deleteTodo requires an id to be handed over through the parameter, but interestingly, `&lt;Todos v-bind:todos=&quot;todos&quot; v-on:del-todo=&quot;deleteTodo&quot;/&gt;` doesnt.\r\nStill, the function works. So how does id ever arrive in deleteTodo?\r\n\r\nA similar problem arises in TodoItem.vue. Here, del-todo is called, but actually we haven&#39;t any sort of declaration of this function anywhere in the script inside TodoItem.vue. So again, what does vueJS imply when it encounters a situation where a function is emitted/called which wasn&#39;t defined anywhere?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58499211/why-does-this-event-actually-trigger","title":"Why does this event actually trigger?"},{"tags":["pdf","adobe","adobe-illustrator"],"owner":{"reputation":1378,"user_id":3248096,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":32,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bfF9d.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"koalaok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3248096/koalaok"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571729721,"creation_date":1571729721,"question_id":58499208,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58499208","body_markdown":"I know that I can automate file job via Adobe scripting. \r\nWhat I was thinking, if there&#39;s a way where I could possibly setup a webservice having a backend server: \r\n\r\ntaking as input some parameters\r\n\r\nhaving a backend processing using programmatically Adobe Scripting &amp; the Adobe Suite as engine\r\n\r\ncreating Adobe *.ai or *.pdf files\r\n\r\nreturning them as response attachment download.

The public key has the X.509 format:\r\n\r\n        openssl ec -in &lt;path to private key file&gt; -pubout -outform der -out &lt;path to public key file&gt;\r\n\r\n- Determine the binary data of the public key with a hex-editor, e.g. [online][2].  At this point it is made use of the fact that the raw public key is located *directly at the end* of the public key. In the case of B-233, the raw public key has a length of 60 bytes, i.e. the last 60 bytes of the generated public key must be exchanged with the 60 bytes of your current raw public key. This is the searched public key as DER, which contains your raw public key.\r\n\r\n- For the verification process with OpenSSL, the DER-format is sufficient if the `-keyform DER` option is used, e.g. \r\n\r\n        openssl dgst -ecdsa-with-SHA1 -keyform DER -verify &lt;path to public key file&gt; -signature &lt;path to signature file&gt; &lt;path to file for which signature is&gt;\r\n\r\n- For the verification process in PHP with [`openssl_verify`][3] the PEM-format is required. A conversion to the PEM-format is easiest if the DER-data are Base64-encoded, e.g. [online][4]. Finally you have to add header (`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\\n`) and footer (`\\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`). Please make sure that there is exactly one line break immediately after the header and immediately before the footer. In the last parameter, the hash algorithm used to create the signature must be specified, e.g.: \r\n\r\n        $data = hex2bin(&lt;binary data from file for which signature is&gt;); \r\n        $signature = hex2bin(&lt;binary data from signature file&gt;);\r\n        $pub_key_id = &quot;-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\\nMFIwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEABsDPgAEAfERAiIKyPaby4+efUcRmv8ucekCFMnjc6fN1IeQAO6EMcKCcFLhKRJUHijUNp0Dv/CWYLUdeN0qNOI6\\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----&quot;;\r\n        $result = openssl_verify($data, $signature, $pub_key_id, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA1);\r\n        print($result);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[0]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/30471945/9014097\r\n[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8422#appendix-A\r\n[2]: https://www.mobilefish.com/services/hex_editor/hex_editor.php\r\n[3]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-verify.php\r\n[4]: https://cryptii.com/pipes/hex-to-base64\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58499196/ecdsa-convert-a-binary-public-key-of-60-bytes-into-pem-format-for-using-it-with/58519654#58519654","title":"ECDSA: Convert a binary public key of 60 bytes into PEM format for using it with PHP openssl_verify()"}],"owner":{"reputation":1612,"user_id":8783885,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvEUy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wiimm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8783885/wiimm"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1612,"user_id":8783885,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvEUy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wiimm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8783885/wiimm"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571823122,"creation_date":1571729700,"last_edit_date":1571816096,"question_id":58499196,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58499196","body_markdown":"I want to proof a Wii signature in PHP.

So we will not loose any information from the original error, but we can also add some metadata to represent special type of error. Consider\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // we are copying orginal error to not loose the data:\r\nconst createCustomerError = (e: Error) =&gt; ({...e, errorType: &#39;CREATE_CUSTOMER&#39;});\r\nconst otherError = (e: Error) =&gt; ({...e, errorType: &#39;OTHER&#39;});\r\n```\r\nThanks to that you have the stacktrace, message but also additional information. You can add whenever metadata you want. Nice would be also to model such errors in type:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype ErrorType = &#39;CREATE_CUSTOMER&#39; | &#39;OTHER&#39; // can be also enum\r\ntype MyError = {errorType: ErrorType } &amp; Error;\r\n\r\n// also we should define our error function output as MyError:\r\nconst createCustomerError = (e: Error): MyError =&gt; ({...e, errorType: &#39;CREATE_CUSTOMER&#39;});\r\nconst otherError = (e: Error): MyError =&gt; ({...e, errorType: &#39;OTHER&#39;});\r\n\r\n```\r\nThanks to that type you can make a handler with standard switch/if to handle specific errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// some parent handler which will handle those re thrown errors\r\nswitch(error.errorType) {\r\n  case &#39;CREATE_CUSTOMER&#39;: \r\n     someHandler();\r\n     break;\r\n  case &#39;OTHER&#39;: \r\n     someHandler2();\r\n     break;\r\n  default:\r\n     defaultErrrorHandler();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLast but not least. Using function error constructors looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n  this.stripe.customers.create({ ... });\r\n} catch(e) {\r\n  throw createCustomerError(e);\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58499086/rethrowing-custom-exceptions-javascript/58500478#58500478","title":"Rethrowing custom exceptions JavaScript"}],"owner":{"reputation":2031,"user_id":1221132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5046ae2fcac22bc44c6663a121f0cc8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"theva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1221132/theva"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1226,"user_id":2389281,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e73c94ffec464b1eb9fcad8fc3302404?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"wanttobeprofessional","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2389281/wanttobeprofessional"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571737213,"creation_date":1571729205,"last_edit_date":1571737213,"question_id":58499086,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58499086","body_markdown":"How should I throw Exceptions the correct way so that I dont lose any information?\r\n\r\nConsider this example: \r\n\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n  this.stripe.customers.create({ ... });\r\n} catch(e) {\r\n  throw new MyCustomCreateCustomersException();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case I can see in my logs that `MyCustomCreateCustomersException` was thrown and where.

Dropdownlist was unable to select the data. Anything I am missing? I also need to get values inside `acs`.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT (as requested by Tomato32):\r\n\r\n`BankList` is also JSON the we deserialize it to a model. I can get the list and added to a dropdown, but I am not able to select the value from the nested JSON above.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:
