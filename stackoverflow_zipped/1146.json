I have tried the following:\r\n\r\n - SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().show(htmlApp);\r\n - SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().toast(message);\r\n - SpreadsheetApp.getUi().alert(&#39;Wrong input.&#39;);\r\n - SpreadsheetApp.getUi().showSidebar(html);\r\n - Browser.msgBox(&#39;Wrong input.&#39;);\r\n\r\nNothings seems to work, I always see the error &quot;Authorisation is required to perform that action&quot; within the stackdriver logs.\r\n\r\nWhat would work is to create an &quot;error sheet&quot; and log all input errors into it, or to make one cell within the main sheet to an &quot;error cell&quot; and log all input errors into it. I think this is not a good solution in terms of user experience.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this problem has something to do with the authMode: https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/editor-auth-lifecycle#authorization_modes\r\nBecause &quot;Access to user interface&quot; is only possible within &quot;FULL&quot; authMode, which is not the case during onEdit().\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is, that other add-ons are able to show an alert/popup. Is this a hack? Or do I need more scopes? Or do I have to change anything else?\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT 08.10.2019:**\r\n\r\n@Jacques-Guzel Heron:\r\nFor instance: the user inputs a date in cell A1 and another in cell B1. Within the onEdit(e) trigger I want to check if the date in B1 is after the date in A1, if not I want to alert the user. All the above listed methods lead to the error &quot;Authorisation is required to perform that action&quot;, when the app is published. When the app is not published .toast(), .alert() and .msgBox() work within my test environment. The strange thing is, that these methods then create a DIV-element, whereas the other add-ons create an IFRAME-element for their alert/dialog-box. Therefore I think they use another method and it has nothing to do with scopes. In addiation I had a look during the OAuth verification process of these add-ons and the scopes are listed within the dev-tools. They do not use any special &quot;ui-scope&quot;, so I doubt the cause for this error is scope related.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 09.10.2019:**\r\nNow I know how an alert/dialog-box containing of an IFRAME-element can be made. To do this, these methods can be used:     \r\n    \r\n    var htmlString, msg, htmlOutput;\r\n\r\n    htmlString = &#39;&lt;p&gt;my html string&lt;/p&gt;&#39;;\r\n    msg = &#39;my message&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    htmlOutput = HtmlService\r\n        .createHtmlOutput(htmlString)\r\n        .setSandboxMode(HtmlService.SandboxMode.IFRAME)\r\n        .setHeight(140);\r\n    \r\n    SpreadsheetApp\r\n        .getUi()\r\n        .showModalDialog(htmlOutput, msg);\r\n\r\nBut it is also not possible to call this method during onEdit(e).\r\n\r\nAll the above listed methods can be called, through clicking on the menu items and also through clicking on buttons within the sidebar, but not during onEdit(e).\r\n\r\nIn addition I have added all the scopes which other add-ons are using, but in vain. So again my assumption got confirmed that the problem is not scope related.\r\n\r\nI have the impression that some smart people have managed to find an inofficial workaroung, please let me know

I&#39;m unaware of having predefined defaults for environment variables to be set through CloudFormation for Lambdas however - One possible option is instead of using env variables in CloudFormation add a lambda layer with all the config and pull the values from there. \r\n\r\nBenefits of this are that if a value changes you only have to update your layer once then update lambdas to use new layer which could be a single parameter instead of manually updating every single one. \r\n\r\nDocs here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html\r\n\r\nAnother option would

Also, the `resource_href` gives `/requests/*` URLs instead of `/health/*` URLs.\r\n- How can we simulate driver location change in Sandbox ?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269753/uber-ride-requests-on-sandbox-using-health-api","title":"Uber ride requests on Sandbox using health API"},{"tags":["python","json","pandas","csv"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12176292,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gGJ5l0-ZCK0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reeZqLjFVZTcqoW3rdaEjJevshVGg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rei M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176292/rei-m"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570456883,"post_id":58270052,"comment_id":102909270,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269752/converting-json-with-different-format-to-csv/58270052#comment102909270_58270052"},{"owner":{"reputation":2002,"user_id":11897007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pF96z44wutQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdeeZDWbm77oankq63ZDO97C-GYIA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Celius Stingher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11897007/celius-stingher"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12176292,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gGJ5l0-ZCK0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reeZqLjFVZTcqoW3rdaEjJevshVGg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rei M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176292/rei-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570457198,"post_id":58270052,"comment_id":102909460,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269752/converting-json-with-different-format-to-csv/58270052#comment102909460_58270052"},{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12176292,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gGJ5l0-ZCK0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reeZqLjFVZTcqoW3rdaEjJevshVGg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rei M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176292/rei-m"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570462713,"post_id":58270052,"comment_id":102912371,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269752/converting-json-with-different-format-to-csv/58270052#comment102912371_58270052"},{"owner":{"reputation":2002,"user_id":11897007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pF96z44wutQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdeeZDWbm77oankq63ZDO97C-GYIA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Celius Stingher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11897007/celius-stingher"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12176292,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gGJ5l0-ZCK0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reeZqLjFVZTcqoW3rdaEjJevshVGg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rei M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176292/rei-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570462900,"post_id":58270052,"comment_id":102912464,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269752/converting-json-with-different-format-to-csv/58270052#comment102912464_58270052"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2002,"user_id":11897007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pF96z44wutQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdeeZDWbm77oankq63ZDO97C-GYIA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Celius Stingher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11897007/celius-stingher"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2002,"user_id":11897007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pF96z44wutQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdeeZDWbm77oankq63ZDO97C-GYIA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Celius Stingher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11897007/celius-stingher"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570457136,"last_edit_date":1570457136,"creation_date":1570453067,"answer_id":58270052,"question_id":58269752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58270052","body_markdown":"Yes, you are getting that answer because each value for the given key in the dictionary contains a list and not a single element. Therefore there are two levels you should address when working with that kind of json format. \r\n\r\n`data` is a list that contains two dictionaries with the same keys each. Either dictionary contains keys that contain a list. Therefore we need to iterate over the first list (to address each dictionary) and then over the second to adress each value for any specified key. The output will be the table as you desire. It should be noted that this code will work as length of the list values of `&quot;Names&quot;` is the same as `&quot;Salary&quot;` and `&quot;Id&quot;`. \r\n \r\n    import pandas as pd \r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    data = [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;Names&quot;: [&quot;James&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;David&quot;],\r\n            &quot;Salary&quot;: [&quot;2000$&quot;,&quot;5000$&quot;,&quot;6000$&quot;],\r\n            &quot;Id&quot;: [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;]},\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;Names&quot;: [&quot;John&quot;,&quot;Charles&quot;,&quot;Harry&quot;],\r\n            &quot;Salary&quot;: [&quot;1000$&quot;,&quot;2000$&quot;,&quot;3000$&quot;],\r\n            &quot;Id&quot;: [&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;]}\r\n    ]\r\n    to_df = {&#39;Names&#39;:[],&#39;Salary&#39;:[],&#39;Id&#39;:[]}\r\n    for i in range(len(data)):\r\n    \tfor j in range(len(data[i][&#39;Id&#39;])):\r\n    \t\tto_df[&#39;Names&#39;].append(data[i][&#39;Names&#39;][j])\r\n    \t\tto_df[&#39;Salary&#39;].append(data[i][&#39;Salary&#39;][j])\r\n    \t\tto_df[&#39;Id&#39;].append(data[i][&#39;Id&#39;][j])\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame(to_df)\r\n    print(df)\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n         Names Salary Id\r\n    0    James  2000$  1\r\n    1      Bob  5000$  2\r\n    2    David  6000$  3\r\n    3     John  1000$  4\r\n    4  Charles  2000$  5\r\n    5    Harry  3000$  6","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269752/converting-json-with-different-format-to-csv/58270052#58270052","title":"converting json with different format to csv"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":227,"user_id":8124260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e27720af5a9dbaab0bf7c2dd1ffd3dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"naive","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8124260/naive"},"last_editor":{"reputation":227,"user_id":8124260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e27720af5a9dbaab0bf7c2dd1ffd3dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"naive","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8124260/naive"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570453585,"last_edit_date":1570453585,"creation_date":1570453087,"answer_id":58270060,"question_id":58269752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58270060","body_markdown":"    a = [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;Names&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;James&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Bob&quot;,\r\n                &quot;David&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;Salary&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;2000$&quot;,\r\n                &quot;5000$&quot;,\r\n                &quot;6000$&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;Id&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;1&quot;,\r\n                &quot;2&quot;,\r\n                &quot;3&quot;\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;Names&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;John&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Charles&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Harry&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;Salary&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;1000$&quot;,\r\n                &quot;2000$&quot;,\r\n                &quot;3000$&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;Id&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;4&quot;,\r\n                &quot;5&quot;,\r\n                &quot;6&quot;\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nI think this might solve your problem:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    col_names = [k for k,v in a[0].items()]\r\n    frames = [pd.io.json.json_normalize(a, str(col)) for col in col_names]\r\n    final_df = pd.concat(frames, axis = 1)\r\n    final_df.columns = col_names\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n&#39;\r\n\r\n      Id Salary    Names\r\n    0  1  2000$    James\r\n    1  2  5000$      Bob\r\n    2  3  6000$    David\r\n    3  4  1000$     John\r\n    4  5  2000$  Charles\r\n    5  6  3000$    Harry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269752/converting-json-with-different-format-to-csv/58270060#58270060","title":"converting json with different format to csv"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":387,"user_id":5934705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/55dc3d236d4b6b7934f86f36ad0152bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fnguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5934705/fnguyen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570453145,"creation_date":1570453145,"answer_id":58270073,"question_id":58269752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58270073","body_markdown":"The problem isn&#39;t in the function but in the way the json is defined.

The pattern matches:\r\n\r\n - `^` - start of string\r\n - `(?=\\d+(?:[_-]\\d+)?$)` - a positive lookahead that makes sure there is 1+ digits, then `_` or `-`, and then again 1+ digits up to the end of string,\r\n - `[\\d_-]{6,7}` - matches 6 or 7 digits, `-` or `_`\r\n - `$` - end of string.\r\n\r\nThe second approach involves regex only and the `^` anchor is replced with `(?&lt;!\\S)` and `$` is replaced with `(?!\\S)` that act as whitespace boundaries. ``(?&lt;!\\S)`` is a negative lookbehind that requires a whitespace or start of string right before the current position and the `(?!\\S)` is a negative lookahead that requires a whitespace or end of string right after the current position.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ideone.com/GX8Iud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269727/using-regular-expression-to-extract-number/58270402#58270402","title":"Using regular expression to extract number"}],"owner":{"reputation":3205,"user_id":8329213,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Db9cx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"cph_sto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8329213/cph-sto"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3205,"user_id":8329213,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Db9cx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"cph_sto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8329213/cph-sto"},"comment_count":15,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58270402,"answer_count":4,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570454315,"creation_date":1570451935,"last_edit_date":1570452919,"question_id":58269727,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58269727","body_markdown":"How can I extract a numeric expression from a `string`, which may or may not have `underscore` or `hyphen`.

So I am looking to do something as follow: \r\n\r\n    func main() {\r\n    \r\n    \t// echo instance\r\n    \te := echo.New()\r\n    \te.GET(&quot;/&quot;, startProcessing)\r\n    \te.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(&quot;:8099&quot;))\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    func startProcessing(c echo.Context) error{\r\n    \r\n    \tcommand := c.QueryParam(&quot;command&quot;)\r\n    \t\r\n    \tif(command == &quot;start&quot;){\r\n    \t\tprocessing()\r\n    \t}else if(command == &quot;stop&quot;){\r\n    \t\tif (/* ? processing is running ? */){\r\n    \t\t\t/* ? stop processing process? */\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}    \t\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhat is the correct way to do this with Go?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269694/how-to-start-and-stop-a-function","title":"How to start and stop a function"},{"tags":["java","file"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12176618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A1B-lCV3j8U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcDNzMpzSjUf5AhDPXtdUmtZCoutg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"bisharah Qraitem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176618/bisharah-qraitem"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570452688,"post_id":58269762,"comment_id":102906823,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269691/file-reads-but-doesnt-write-to-this-database/58269762#comment102906823_58269762"},{"owner":{"reputation":7725,"user_id":152578,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d67e85ea8bc85f3e8fa3029babde07a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CPerkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/152578/cperkins"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570453520,"post_id":58269762,"comment_id":102907290,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269691/file-reads-but-doesnt-write-to-this-database/58269762#comment102907290_58269762"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20078,"user_id":3199595,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwK8q.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Malt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3199595/malt"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570452053,"creation_date":1570452053,"answer_id":58269762,"question_id":58269691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58269762","body_markdown":"&gt; it used to work fine on my unix laptop but it doesn&#39;t write to the txt file on my windows PC i made sure the txt file is not read-only\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re using `\\n` (Line Feed) as a delimiter, which is fine for Linux, but on Windows the default line delimiter uses two characters - `\\r\\n` (Carriage Return + Line Feed).\r\n\r\nIf your text file was created on windows, you need to take it into account and use `\\r\\n`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269691/file-reads-but-doesnt-write-to-this-database/58269762#58269762","title":"File reads but doesn&#39;t write to this &quot;database&quot;"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":84363,"user_id":984823,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2KYN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joop Eggen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/984823/joop-eggen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570454245,"creation_date":1570454245,"answer_id":58270386,"question_id":58269691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58270386","body_markdown":"You are using the underlying platform&#39;s character encoding.

The app is all about teaching some kind of neuronal network to play tic-tac-toe using reinforcement learning. In order to do so, you can have the `AIPlayer` play against a `RandomPlayer`, an `AlgorithmicPlayer`, itself or yourself. The `AIPlayer` is supposed to learn form every game it played by updating the underlying model using the game&#39;s outcome and the picks it made during the game.\r\n\r\n## The problem \r\nThe problem is, that initializing the `MLUpdateTask` fails after a specific amount of updates with a signal SIGABRT. Thus, the app crashes. The exact amount depends on the device. When running it on my iPhone 6s, the 240th initialization of `MLUpdateTask` fails, on the Simulator, it&#39;s the 243rd one.\r\n\r\nThe error message I get:\r\n```\r\nlibc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error: Error loading file: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/714E7417-B792-4F80-8EAE-A2855E138A95/TicTacToe.app/UpdatableNNClassifier.mlmodelc/model.espresso.weights\r\n```\r\n\r\nI traced the error down to that line...the whole code is on GitHub. \r\nhttps://github.com/theMomax/TicTacToe/blob/0182db0af27498d504fb5dcfd0556267e23c063b/TicTacToe/MLBase.swift#L132\r\n\r\n## What I tried to solve the problem:\r\nI tried to reduce the amount of layers in my model. No effect.\r\n\r\nI tried to only have one update task at a time. No effect.\r\n\r\nI ported the whole app over to macOS. That &quot;solved&quot; the problem.\r\n\r\n## Model\r\n[This][1] notebook is the basis for [the one I used to produce the CoreML Model][2]. I only changed what was necessary to adapt the model to my I/O formats. Probably the model I have right now won&#39;t be able to actually learn/get better, because of its structure, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s relevant right now.\r\n\r\n## System\r\nMac: 10.15 Beta (19A582a)\r\n\r\niPhone: 13.1.2 (17A860)\r\n\r\nXcode: 11.1 (11A1027)\r\n\r\n## Updating Code\r\n\r\n[Here][3] is the file on GitHub.

I tried to remove the unnecessary parts below and add some comments describing when each function is called...\r\n```\r\n\r\n// is initialized once on startup\r\nclass MLWrapper {\r\n    \r\n    let bundle = Bundle(for: UpdatableNNClassifier.self)\r\n    \r\n    let updatableModelURL: URL\r\n    \r\n    var model = UpdatableNNClassifier()\r\n    \r\n    var trainingData: [(gameboard: [Position: FieldState], pick: Position)] = []\r\n    \r\n    init() {\r\n        self.updatableModelURL = bundle.url(forResource: &quot;UpdatableNNClassifier&quot;, withExtension: &quot;mlmodelc&quot;)!\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Returns a randomly selected alternative to pick. \r\n    private func other(than pick: Position, in gameboard: [Position: FieldState?]) -&gt; Position? {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private func convertInput(gameboard: [Position: FieldState]) -&gt; MLMultiArray {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private func convertOutput(output: UpdatableNNClassifierOutput) -&gt; Position? {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // is called each time the `AIPlayer` is supposed to make a pick\r\n    func predict(on gameboard: [Position: FieldState]) -&gt; Position? {\r\n        let input = convertInput(gameboard: gameboard)\r\n        if let output = try? model.prediction(gameboard: input) {\r\n            if let result = convertOutput(output: output) {\r\n\r\n                // record input and output, so that it can be used to train\r\n                // train the model, when the game&#39;s outcome is known\r\n                trainingData.append((gameboard, result))\r\n                return result\r\n            } else {\r\n                return nil\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            print(&quot;Unexpected runtime error in \\(model).&quot;)\r\n            return nil\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // is called after a game is completed\r\n    func reflect(on outcome: Outcome) {\r\n        do {            \r\n            let bp: MLBatchProvider = try MLArrayBatchProvider(dictionary: [&quot;gameboard&quot;: trainingData.compactMap { i in\r\n                return convertInput(gameboard: i.gameboard)\r\n            }, &quot;pick&quot;: trainingData.compactMap({ I in\r\n\r\n                // in case the `AIPlayer` won or achieved a draw, its pick was good, otherwise, try any other pick next time\r\n                outcome != .defeat ? i.pick.description() : other(than: i.pick, in: i.gameboard)?.description() ?? i.pick.description()\r\n            })])\r\n            // reset trainingData\r\n            trainingData = []            \r\n\r\n            // the line below is the one that fails\r\n            let updateTask = try MLUpdateTask(forModelAt: updatableModelURL, trainingData: bp, configuration: self.model.model.configuration, completionHandler: { ctx in\r\n                if ctx.task.error == nil {\r\n                    self.model.model = ctx.model\r\n                } else {\r\n                    print(ctx.task.error!)\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n\r\n            updateTask.resume()\r\n        } catch {\r\n            print(error)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The question\r\nSo, my basic question is: Is there something wrong with my updating code? Or is this most likely a beta-bug? Do you have any suggestions on what I could try to solve this?\r\n\r\nAll of that code above is called from a DispatchQueue in `Controller.swift`. Could that be a problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/apple/coremltools/blob/master/examples/updatable_models/updatable_mnist.ipynb\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/theMomax/TicTacToe/blob/master/MLModel/UpdatableNNClassifier.ipynb\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/theMomax/TicTacToe/blob/master/TicTacToe/MLBase.swift\r\n  [4]: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/704/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269678/initializing-mlupdatetask-causes-signal-sigabrt-error-loading-file-mlmodelc","title":"Initializing MLUpdateTask causes signal SIGABRT: Error loading file: *.mlmodelc/model.espresso.weights"},{"tags":["java","concordion"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7806759,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b857c272a04ee40c53ba93a961ce3f14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shridevi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7806759/shridevi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570613847,"post_id":58269670,"comment_id":102964995,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269670/getting-unable-to-find-specification-exception-while-running-concordion-fixure-f#comment102964995_58269670"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7806759,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b857c272a04ee40c53ba93a961ce3f14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shridevi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7806759/shridevi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570451750,"creation_date":1570451750,"question_id":58269670,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58269670","body_markdown":"I have kept fixure and html (specification) file under the same package &#39;test/java/com/mypckg/&#39;.

should do the trick:\r\n\r\n    Set&lt;String&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(collection);\r\n    boolean containsAll = set.isEmpty() || stream.map(Object::toString)\r\n                                                 .anyMatch(s -&gt; set.remove(s) &amp;&amp; set.isEmpty());\r\n\r\n----------\r\nThe solution might look confusing, but the idea is straightforward:\r\n\r\n1. In order to prevent multiple iterations over `collection` we wrap it into a `HashSet`. (In case your `stream` is a parallel one, then you will have to use a concurrent hash set. See [this post][1] for more details)\r\n2. If the `collection` (or `set`) is empty then we return `true` without processing the `stream`\r\n3. For each entry of `stream` we try to remove it from `set`. In case the result of `Set::remove` is `true` (hence it was contained by `set`) and the `set` is empty after removal, we can conclude that `stream` contained all the elements of initial `collection`.\r\n4. The terminal operation `Stream::anyMatch` is a short-circuiting one. So it will stop iterating over `stream` once the `set` is empty. In worst case we will process the entire stream.   \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a bit more readable form:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Set&lt;String&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(collection);\r\n    boolean containsAll = set.isEmpty() || stream.map(Object::toString)\r\n                                                 .filter(set::remove)\r\n                                                 .anyMatch(__ -&gt; set.isEmpty());\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf the `collection` can contain duplicates and there is a requirement to check if `stream` contains all of them, then we will need to maintain a concurrent map of counters.\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;String, AtomicLong&gt; map = new ConcurrentHashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n    collection.forEach(s -&gt; map.computeIfAbsent(s, __ -&gt; new AtomicLong()).incrementAndGet());\r\n    boolean containsAll = map.isEmpty() || stream.map(Object::toString)\r\n                                                 .filter(map::containsKey)\r\n                                                 .filter(s -&gt; map.get(s).decrementAndGet() == 0)\r\n                                                 .filter(s -&gt; map.remove(s) != null)\r\n                                                 .anyMatch(__ -&gt; map.isEmpty());\r\n\r\nThe code slightly changed but the idea is the same.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6992643/10584605","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269632/is-there-a-way-to-check-if-a-stream-contains-all-collection-elements/58273123#58273123","title":"Is there a way to check if a Stream contains all collection elements?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7425560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e2222328b08d0d85a747d8dec3639e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael Mesfin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7425560/michael-mesfin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570605463,"creation_date":1570605463,"answer_id":58298916,"question_id":58269632,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298916","body_markdown":"    boolean allMatch = stream.map(Object::toString)\r\n                .allMatch(s -&gt;

No I need it again and restarted the old Apache-Archiva 2.2.3, ... and nothing will work.\r\n\r\nOk (two years), so I do the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1. I create/set up a new virtual machine (OpenSuse Tumbleweed), installed a default Apache-Archiva 2.2.4, started it, activate the &amp;lt;downloadRemoteIndexOnStartup&amp;gt; and redirected my local **settings.xml** to this new *Central*.\r\n    \r\n        &lt;settings\txmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0&quot;\r\n\t\t            xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n\t        \t    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd&quot;\r\n                    &gt;\r\n          &lt;mirrors&gt;\r\n            &lt;mirror&gt;\r\n              &lt;id&gt;internal&lt;/id&gt;\r\n              &lt;name&gt;Archiva Managed Internal Repository&lt;/name&gt;\r\n              &lt;url&gt;http://archiva.FOO.intern:8080/archiva/repository/internal/&lt;/url&gt;\r\n              &lt;mirrorOf&gt;*&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;\r\n            &lt;/mirror&gt;\r\n          &lt;/mirrors&gt;\r\n        &lt;/settings&gt;\r\n\r\n 2. Then I completely deleted my local Maven repository.\r\n\r\n 3. and wanted to test the download functionality by doing a **mvn clean** in a current Maven project.\r\n\r\nThe result was: `[ERROR] Plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-failsafe-plugin:2.18.1 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Could not find artifact org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-failsafe-plugin:jar:2.18.1 in internal (http://archiva.FOO.intern:8080/archiva/repository/internal/)`\r\n\r\nIn the Apache-Archiva logs I can see the request: `172.18.8.27 -  -  [07/Oct/2019:09:20:51 +0000] &quot;GET /archiva/repository/internal/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/2.18.1/maven-failsafe-plugin-2.18.1.jar HTTP/1.1&quot; 404 1479 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Apache-Maven/3.6.1 (Java 1.8.0_221; Windows 7 6.1)&quot;`\r\n\r\nIf I use the user which runs the Apache-Archiva daemon and do the following command `curl --output &quot;maven-failsafe-plugin-2.18.1.jar&quot; &quot;http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/2.18.1/maven-failsafe-plugin-2.18.1.jar&quot;` in a bash in the virtual machine, I get the requested jar-file.\r\n\r\nThat means it exists no firewall or other network infrastructure problems.\r\n\r\nThis also means that Apache-Archiva could do its work if its would do.\r\n\r\nUpto now:\r\n\r\n - I found no messages / errors that would explain me, why Apache-Archiva\r\n   do not work (from _journalctl_ and/or _/var/archiva/logs/*_);\r\n   \r\n - and my network sniffer can see no repository access from the new Apache-Archiva-2.2.4 virtual machine to the (default) configured Maven repositories in the internet.\r\n\r\nBut I noticed a few oddities.\r\n\r\n - In the Apache-Archiva log:\r\n\r\n        2019-10-07 11:08:00,036 [WrapperSimpleAppMain] WARN  JPOX.RDBMS [] - Error initialising derby schema : Schema &#39;SA&#39; does not exist\r\n          java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Schema &#39;SA&#39; does not exist\r\n        \tat org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.SQLExceptionFactory40.getSQLException(Unknown Source)\r\n        \t...\r\n\r\n   But this seems to be a ... frontend problem (because of ...AppMain]).\r\n\r\n - Wireshark found a lot of tries to get results from:\r\n\r\n        http://www.terracotta.org/kit/reflector?pageID=update.properties&amp;patch=UNKNOWN&amp;tc-product=ehcache-core+2.7.5&amp;tc-version=2.7.5&amp;uptime-secs=6&amp;kidID=ehcache.default&amp;jvm-version=1.8.0_222&amp;os-name=Linux&amp;id=-1408104395&amp;source=ehcache-core&amp;jvm-name=OpenJDK+64-Bit+Server+VM&amp;platform=amd64\r\n\r\n   And this seems maybe ... a problem. The through wireshark captured response status is `HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` and a message says: `The owner of this website (www.terracotta.org) has banned your access based on your browser&#39;s signature (521f0006ab85c286-ua21).` The captured user-agent was: `Java/1.8.0_222`, what seems related to the backend. But on the other hand a grep for `www.terracotta.org` found only hits in the **frontend parts** of the Apache-Archiva folder.\r\n\r\nHmmmmm...\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so I now come to the ultimate question.\r\n\r\nHas anyone an idea why Apache-Archiva 2.2.4 does _not will_ do the download work?\r\n\r\nPS.: Two years ago I do the same steps with the Apache-Archiva 2.2.3 and it works.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269629/apache-archiva-2-2-4-do-not-download-maven-artifacts","title":"Apache-Archiva 2.2.4 do not download maven artifacts"},{"tags":["azure","selenium-webdriver","azure-devops","continuous-integration","azure-pipelines"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":8380535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c33530082edcb54cc491d034ff13ff75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kermi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8380535/kermi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570522760,"post_id":58279958,"comment_id":102930571,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269627/azure-devop-set-screen-resolution-interactive-mode/58279958#comment102930571_58279958"},{"owner":{"reputation":1335,"user_id":11882186,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b92c34b6a0c9be45ff9af37d4cc8005?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Levi Lu-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11882186/levi-lu-msft"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":28,"user_id":8380535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c33530082edcb54cc491d034ff13ff75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kermi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8380535/kermi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570523159,"post_id":58279958,"comment_id":102930754,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269627/azure-devop-set-screen-resolution-interactive-mode/58279958#comment102930754_58279958"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":8380535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c33530082edcb54cc491d034ff13ff75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kermi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8380535/kermi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570534069,"post_id":58279958,"comment_id":102935794,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269627/azure-devop-set-screen-resolution-interactive-mode/58279958#comment102935794_58279958"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":8380535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c33530082edcb54cc491d034ff13ff75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kermi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8380535/kermi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570534273,"post_id":58279958,"comment_id":102935890,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269627/azure-devop-set-screen-resolution-interactive-mode/58279958#comment102935890_58279958"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1335,"user_id":11882186,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b92c34b6a0c9be45ff9af37d4cc8005?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Levi Lu-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11882186/levi-lu-msft"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1335,"user_id":11882186,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b92c34b6a0c9be45ff9af37d4cc8005?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Levi Lu-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11882186/levi-lu-msft"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570507225,"last_edit_date":1570507225,"creation_date":1570506559,"answer_id":58279958,"question_id":58269627,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58279958","body_markdown":"You can either reconfig your agent to interactive mode(check below detailed steps), or install a new agent and config it to interactive mode on your VM.

am looking to use Serial Modbus with my SBC running Windows 10 IoT Core. I am able to write through the serial port using RS-485 when using the SerialDevice class from the **Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication** library.\r\n\r\nThe serial ports on my SBC are not labelled COM1, COM2, etc. I had to find them using ``devcon.exe stack *`` command. My ports have the name PNP0501#1 and PNP0501#2 which I was able to use as the port name in SerialDevice and it works.\r\n\r\nThis code works for sending message through the serial port\r\n```\r\nDeviceInformationCollection devices = await DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync();\r\n            if (devices.Count &gt; 0)\r\n            {\r\n                for (int i = 0; i &lt; devices.Count; i++)\r\n                {\r\n                    if (devices[i].Id.Contains(&quot;PNP0501#2&quot;))\r\n                    {\r\n                        GpioStatus = string.Format(&quot;Connecting... {0} found&quot;, devices[i].Id);\r\n                        DeviceInformation deviceInfo = devices[i];\r\n                        SerialDevice serialDevice = await SerialDevice.FromIdAsync(deviceInfo.Id);\r\n                        serialDevice.BaudRate = 9600;\r\n                        serialDevice.DataBits = 8;\r\n                        serialDevice.StopBits = SerialStopBitCount.Two;\r\n                        serialDevice.Parity = SerialParity.None;\r\n                        serialDevice.Handshake = SerialHandshake.None;\r\n\r\n                        DataWriter data = new DataWriter(serialDevice.OutputStream);\r\n                        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 15; j++)\r\n                        {\r\n                            data.WriteString(&quot;Test message&quot;);\r\n                            GpioStatus = string.Format(&quot;Message sent {0}&quot;, j);\r\n                            await data.StoreAsync();\r\n                            await Task.Delay(250);\r\n                        }\r\n\r\n                        data.DetachStream();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am looking to use a Modbus library to make it easier to follow the Modbus protocol. I was looking into EasyModbusTCP but am open to any library that works with serial communication.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to setup a modbus client with this library, it asks for a port name and I enter PNP0501#1 because that is the name of that port and it successfully worked for straight serial messaging. However, It throws an error every time saying that that name does not start with COM. \r\n\r\n```\r\n            SerialPort serialPort = new SerialPort(&quot;PNP0501#2&quot;);\r\n            IModbusSerialMaster f = ModbusSerialMaster.CreateRtu(serialPort);\r\n            byte slaveId = 1;\r\n            ushort startAddress = 100;\r\n            ushort[] registers = new ushort[] { 1, 2, 3 };\r\n\r\n            f.WriteMultipleRegisters(slaveId, startAddress, registers);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Is there any way to change the name of this device to use the COM name so it can work with this library? Is there any library that will take the full name of this device without the word COM. Any help would be much appreciated!**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269602/how-to-change-name-of-ports-for-use-with-libraries","title":"How to Change Name of Ports for use with

Here is the result:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nAnd here is my code:\r\n\r\n    import cv2\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import argparse\r\n    \r\n    ap = argparse.ArgumentParser()\r\n    ap.add_argument(&quot;-i&quot;, &quot;--image&quot;, required=True, help=&quot;path to the imput image&quot;)\r\n    args = vars(ap.parse_args())\r\n    \r\n    img = cv2.imread(args[&#39;image&#39;])\r\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\r\n    edges = cv2.Canny(gray,50,150,apertureSize = 3)\r\n    cv2.imwrite(&#39;edges_found.jpg&#39;,edges)\r\n    lines = cv2.HoughLines(edges, 1, np.pi/180, 200)\r\n    \r\n    for r,theta in lines[0]:\r\n        a = np.cos(theta)\r\n        b=np.sin(theta)\r\n        x0 = a*r\r\n        y0 = b*r\r\n        x1 = int(x0 + 1000*(-b))\r\n        y1 = int(y0 + 1000*(a))\r\n        x2 = int(x0 - 1000*(-b))\r\n        y2 = int(y0 - 1000*(a))\r\n    \r\n        cv2.line(img, (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (0,0,255), 2)\r\n    \r\n    cv2.imwrite(&#39;linesDetected.jpg&#39;,img)\r\n\r\nI am using the tutorial / code here:  https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_houghlines/py_houghlines.html\r\n\r\nThis seems straight forward but in the tutorial, the images used is a sudoku in a newspaper and many lines are returned where I&#39;m getting a single line.  As you can see in the code, I have output `edges` to a separate image to see what is going on there, and this is the result:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nIt appears that many edges have been found, yet I&#39;m only getting a single red line, rather than many.  Where is my code incorrect?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DF6rd.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jCtgs.jpg\r\n  [3]:

you can set your array to the range in one go:\r\n\r\n```vba\r\nContentsList = wsContents.Range(&quot;ContentsArray&quot;).Value\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will then need to loop through your array for each sheet in your workbook to check if it exists... Something like the below (if you use the same method for the array as you already have, else you will need another way to determine `j` (the number of elements in your array)):\r\n\r\n```vba\r\nDim ws As Worksheet\r\nDim i As Long\r\n\r\n    For Each ws In Thisworkbook.Worksheets\r\n        For i = 1 To j\r\n             If ws.Name = ContentsList(i) Then\r\n                 &#39;if found exit for as we do not want to hide\r\n                 Exit For\r\n             End If\r\n             &#39;if not found then hide\r\n             If i = j Then\r\n                 ws.Visible = xlSheetHidden\r\n             End If\r\n        Next j\r\n    Next ws\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269587/hide-all-sheets-except-selected-excel-vba/58270548#58270548","title":"Hide all sheets except selected - Excel VBA"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12176558,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCtz-cOE5vlX9sxNPGuHD5cTOky02_YhTjhk5M5Pg=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"David Blakeborough","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176558/david-blakeborough"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32752,"user_id":3219613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b01a7cc73ab19f844bdbcd951876ecb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pᴇʜ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3219613/p%e1%b4%87%ca%9c"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58270548,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570517163,"creation_date":1570451475,"last_edit_date":1570517163,"question_id":58269587,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58269587","body_markdown":"First post so please excuse any poor etiquette.\r\n\r\nI am writing a VBA which produces an information pack for our customers to use. This pack is built to be dynamic based on certain user selections - for example FAQ pages will be specific to selections made by the user. I have built each module to add the relevant sheet names to a contents sheet as it runs. At the end, I pick up this list of sheets, select them and produce a PDF.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is hide all of the other sheets other than the ones that are selected - I can do this by calling them specifically by name, or by adding &quot;zzz&quot; to the end of sheet names which are pure reference sheets, but I am hoping there is a better way.\r\n\r\nThe code I want would do this:\r\n\r\n 1. Select all of the sheets which have been added to the contents page and create an array (this already works)\r\n 2. Produce the PDF for the selected sheets (this also works)\r\n 3. Hide any sheet which is not in the array (this is what I am struggling with)\r\n\r\nCode for producing the PDF is below - note that due to some ill-planned naming, &quot;Contents Array&quot; is a named range on the contents sheet, and &quot;ContentsList&quot; is the VBA array:\r\n\r\n    For Each cell In wsContents.Range(&quot;ContentsArray&quot;)\r\n        ContentsList(j) = cell.Value\r\n
