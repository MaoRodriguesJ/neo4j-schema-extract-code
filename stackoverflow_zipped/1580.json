Storing the hashtags of a post in one column tsvector inside the Posts table is all good, as you are not using it in any other table. But in case if u need hashtags for any scenario where you need to join tables, then it would be better to keep them in another table for flexibility.\r\n\r\n2. It is good to keep records as such, you are keeping the id&#39;s right. So it won&#39;t result in any bottleneck. I believe you are going to use CSV&#39;s.\r\n\r\n3. You can always optimize your queries, use your joins wisely, make sure you are using the right join at the right place.\r\n\r\n4. It will be better if you separate comments for posts and comments for photos as you will find it way more easier to retrieve and store data. You can anyways combine them when needed. This will avoid any data congestion.\r\n\r\n5.  Yes sounds ok.

Hashtags in a post - is it fine what I did, i.e - storing the hashtags of a post in one column *tsvector* inside the Posts table? \r\n\r\n  two additional ideas I had in mind :\r\n\r\n  a. have a separate table for hashtags, like this : `id|post_id|tag_name`, and each record will represent each individual hashtag. Sounds a bit inefficient though, will results in too many records..\r\n\r\n b. same as a, but the &quot;tag_name&quot; would be a tsvector representing all of the hashtags of the posts. This would result in far less records in the table than option &#39;a&#39;. \r\n\r\n 2. Saved posts - what if I have a 10k posts, and each of them will be liked by 1k people. This would result in 10 millions of records! that doesn&#39;t sound efficient.\r\n\r\n 3. Normalization - it seems to me there are too many tables which will require a lot of JOINS to retrieve a whole Post object to the clients (along will the comments, likes, photos and their comments/likes, etc.), as well as be very complex to write to. Will the queries to retrieve/write different Posts be too slow / cumbersome?\r\n 4. Comments - should I separate comments for posts and comments for photos like I did in the design above? or combine them into one table?\r\n5. I want to have 1-level replies inside the comments. Should I just add a column of &quot;parent_comment_id&quot; inside the Comments table?

This process could save the data off to an additional storage location (e.g. [memcached](https://memcached.org/)) for immediate access of the latest value, thus leaving the queue untouched.\r\n\r\n2. You could configure a secondary queue/service combination. When messages are published, they can then be routed to both queues. The first queue is for your heavy processing, and the second queue would be a service whose only task is to update the latest value in memcached or some other fast storage/retrieval system.  Thus, message lifetime in this queue would presumably be much shorter.\r\n\r\n3. You could implement multiple processing steps. The first step would be to update the current state (presumably a quick operation), after which the message is then re-published to the longer processing step&#39;s queue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166635/rabbitmq-support-for-lifo-or-time-based-priority-queue/58222318#58222318","title":"RabbitMQ support for LIFO or time based priority queue"}],"owner":{"reputation":13082,"user_id":340088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01618347bd158e35c34cce5bc006a92?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jbx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/340088/jbx"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570116290,"creation_date":1569841536,"question_id":58166635,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166635","body_markdown":"Is there any way to make a RabbitMQ queue behave as a Stack, i.e. the client gets the last message that was posted in the queue (LIFO) rather than the first one? Or maybe alternatively make it a priority queue using a timestamp which the client could set?\r\n\r\nRabbitMQ does support priority queues but the priority it allows is just a number up to 255 (recommended to use up to 10). \r\n\r\nWhat I want to achieve is that the latest messages are processed first because they contain the latest information about the source. I still want to process the old messages, but in situations when the client cannot keep up (or there was some downtime and the client is recovering) I want to process the latest state information first.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I came up with so far is to use a TTL on the messages of the main queue and have them go to a dead letter queue when they expire, which is also processed by the client. However this is not so clean, and if the source of the message takes longer than the TTL to send a new status update, the latest state will be stuck in queue behind the other older expired messages still to be processed.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible to achieve with RabbitMQ, is there any other recommended messaging framework that supports this requirement?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166635/rabbitmq-support-for-lifo-or-time-based-priority-queue","title":"RabbitMQ support for LIFO or time based priority queue"},{"tags":["dialogflow","service-accounts","google-apis-explorer"],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11825985,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wGW8aciQOXk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/fjHTSCS8Tfg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rais Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11825985/rais-ali"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11825985,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wGW8aciQOXk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/fjHTSCS8Tfg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rais Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11825985/rais-ali"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569845736,"creation_date":1569841520,"last_edit_date":1569845736,"question_id":58166629,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166629","body_markdown":"I am setting up automation for Dialogflow agents and its services.

You can also add\r\n\r\n    declare const FunnelGraph: any\r\n\r\nin order to compile without errors. This has been taken from [an answer to a stackoverflow question][1] and [this guide][2]. Remember to include the css files in that json too!\r\n\r\n**EDIT END**\r\n\r\nYou get that error because the code tries to look for an HTML element with a class named &quot;funnel&quot;, but cannot find it. Since this is a directive, it would be better if it was a little more generalized.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you should move your graph-generating code inside the constructor, since that&#39;s were the directive logic resides. To better generalize this directive, it would be best if you gave a unique id to that element and change the code accordingly. This is how I would do it:\r\n\r\nHTML:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;funnel-graph-1&quot; appFunnelGraph&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nJS:\r\n\r\n    import { Directive, ElementRef } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    // It should be fine to just import this in the html with a script tag\r\n    // import * as graph from &#39;funnel-graph-js/dist/js/funnel-graph.js&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    @Directive({\r\n      selector: &#39;[appFunnelGraph]&#39;\r\n    })\r\n    export class FunnelGraphDirective {\r\n      style: any;\r\n      constructor(el: ElementRef) {\r\n        el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = &#39;yellow&#39;;\r\n        \r\n        var graph = new FunnelGraph({\r\n          // Generalize the container selector with the element id\r\n          container: &#39;#&#39; + el.nativeElement.id,\r\n          gradientDirection: &#39;horizontal&#39;,\r\n          data: {\r\n            labels: [&#39;Impressions&#39;, &#39;Add To Cart&#39;, &#39;Buy&#39;],\r\n            subLabels: [&#39;Direct&#39;, &#39;Social Media&#39;, &#39;Ads&#39;],\r\n            colors: [\r\n              [&#39;#FFB178&#39;, &#39;#FF78B1&#39;,

If i run the function without the 0 values it will work as intended.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst minVal = Math.min(...this.wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.valueText) || Number(d.value)));\r\nconst maxVal = Math.max(...this.wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.valueText) || Number(d.value)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if we have values from 2 - 0.00003 - 0 the minimum value should be 0 and the maximum value should be 2.\r\n\r\nnow if it was lets say 10 to 0.000000001 it will work or if we will have 1 to 10000 it will work.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let wells = [];\r\n\r\n    wells.push({\r\n      posCol: 0,\r\n      posRow: 0,\r\n      valueText: 2\r\n    });\r\n    wells.push({\r\n      posCol: 1,\r\n      posRow: 0,\r\n      valueText: 4\r\n    });\r\n    wells.push({\r\n      posCol: 2,\r\n      posRow: 0,\r\n      valueText: 0\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    const minVal = Math.min(...wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.valueText) || Number(d.value)));\r\n    const maxVal = Math.max(...wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.valueText) || Number(d.value)));\r\n\r\n    console.log(minVal);\r\n    console.log(maxVal);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow I&#39;ll add an example that will work\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let wells = [];\r\n\r\n        wells.push({\r\n          posCol: 0,\r\n          posRow: 0,\r\n          valueText: 2\r\n        });\r\n        wells.push({\r\n          posCol: 1,\r\n          posRow: 0,\r\n          valueText: 4\r\n        });\r\n        wells.push({\r\n          posCol: 2,\r\n          posRow: 0,\r\n          valueText: 1\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        const minVal = Math.min(...wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.valueText) || Number(d.value)));\r\n        const maxVal = Math.max(...wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.valueText) || Number(d.value)));\r\n\r\n        console.log(minVal);\r\n        console.log(maxVal);\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n**SOLUTION FOR ANYONE WHO COMES ACROSS THIS ISSUE Ref @VLAZ Explanation**\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n        let wells = [];\r\n\r\n        wells.push({\r\n          posCol: 0,\r\n          posRow: 0,\r\n          valueText: 2\r\n        });\r\n        wells.push({\r\n          posCol: 1,\r\n          posRow: 0,\r\n          valueText: 4\r\n        });\r\n        wells.push({\r\n          posCol: 2,\r\n          posRow: 0,\r\n          valueText: 0\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        const minVal = Math.min(...wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.value) || Number(d.valueText)));\r\n        const maxVal = Math.max(...wells.map(d =&gt; Number(d.value) || Number(d.valueText)));\r\n\r\n        console.log(minVal);\r\n        console.log(maxVal);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe issue was that value of 0 was evaluated as falsy and as such went to a fallback that in that instance was an undefined property which resulted in NaN.

There are many ways to implement a smudge effect based on what you want to achieve visually.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a very rough proof of concept:\r\n\r\n    PFont font;\r\n    PGraphics pg;\r\n    \r\n    int pressX;\r\n    int pressY;\r\n    \r\n    void setup (){\r\n      //font = createFont(&quot;Pano Bold Kopie.otf&quot;, 600);\r\n      font = createFont(&quot;Verdana&quot;,600);\r\n    \r\n      size(800, 800, P2D);\r\n      // clear main background once\r\n      background(0);\r\n      // prep fading background\r\n      noStroke();\r\n      // black fill with 10/255 transparnecy\r\n      fill(0,10);\r\n    \r\n      pg = createGraphics(800, 800, JAVA2D);\r\n      pg.beginDraw();\r\n      // leave the PGraphics instance transparent\r\n      //pg.background(0);\r\n      pg.fill(255);\r\n      pg.noStroke();\r\n      pg.textFont(font);\r\n      pg.textSize(400);\r\n      pg.pushMatrix();\r\n      pg.translate(width/2, height/2-140);\r\n      pg.textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);\r\n      pg.text(&quot;a&quot;, 0 , 0);\r\n      pg.popMatrix();\r\n      pg.endDraw();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void draw () {\r\n      image(pg,0,0);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void mousePressed(){\r\n      pressX = mouseX;\r\n      pressY = mouseY;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void mouseDragged(){\r\n      // sample the colour where mouse was pressed\r\n      color sample = pg.get(pressX,pressY);\r\n      // calculate the distance from where the &quot;smudge&quot; started to where it is\r\n      float distance = dist(pressX,pressY,mouseX,mouseY);\r\n      // map this distance to transparency so the further the distance the less smudge (e.g. short distance, high alpha, large distnace, small alpha)\r\n      float alpha = map(distance,0,30,255,0);\r\n      // map distance to &quot;brush size&quot;\r\n      float size = map(distance,0,30,30,0);\r\n      // extract r,g,b values\r\n      float r = red(sample);\r\n      float g = green(sample);\r\n      float b = blue(sample);\r\n      // set new r,g,b,a values\r\n      pg.beginDraw();\r\n      pg.fill(r,g,b,alpha);\r\n      pg.ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,size,size);\r\n      pg.endDraw();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs the comments mention, one idea is to sample colour on press then use the sample colour and fade it as your drag away from the source area. This shows simply reading a single pixel. You may want to experiment with sampling/reading more pixels (e.g. a rectangle or ellipse).\r\n\r\n[![smudge a demo][2]][2]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the code above isn&#39;t optimised.\r\nA few things could be sped up a bit, like reading pixels, extracting colours, calculating distance, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    void mouseDragged(){\r\n      // sample the colour where mouse was pressed\r\n      color sample = pg.pixels[pressX + (pressY * pg.width)];\r\n      // calculate the distance from where the &quot;smudge&quot; started to where it is (can use manual distance squared if this is too slow)\r\n      float distance = dist(pressX,pressY,mouseX,mouseY);\r\n      // map this distance to transparency so the further the distance the less smudge (e.g. short distance, high alpha, large distnace, small alpha)\r\n      float alpha = map(distance,0,30,255,0);\r\n      // map distance to &quot;brush size&quot;\r\n      float size = map(distance,0,30,30,0);\r\n      // extract r,g,b values\r\n      int r = (sample &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF; // Like red(), but faster\r\n      int g = (sample &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF;\r\n      int b =  sample &amp; 0xFF;\r\n      // set new r,g,b,a values\r\n      pg.beginDraw();\r\n      pg.fill(r,g,b,alpha);\r\n      pg.ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,size,size);\r\n      pg.endDraw();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe idea is to start simple with clear, readable code and only at the end, if needed look into optimisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://processing.github.io/processing-javadocs/core/processing/core/PGraphics.html\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/FCS1A.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166590/draw-permanently-on-pgraphics-processing/58167081#58167081","title":"Draw permanently on PGraphics (Processing)"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":10969680,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TXwJp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kaktus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10969680/kaktus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":48,"user_id":10969680,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TXwJp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kaktus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10969680/kaktus"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58167081,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569919348,"creation_date":1569841369,"last_edit_date":1569846932,"question_id":58166590,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166590","body_markdown":"I would like to create a brush for drawing on a PGraphics element with Processing. I would like past brush strokes to be visible. However, since the PGraphics element is loaded every frame, previous brush strokes disappear immediatly. \r\n\r\nMy idea was then to create PGraphics `pg` in setup(), make a copy of it in void(), alter the original graphic `pg` and update the copy at every frame. This produces a NullPointerException, most likely because `pg` is defined locally in setup().\r\n\r\nThis is what I have got so far:\r\n\r\nPGraphics pg;\r\nPFont font;\r\n\r\n    void setup (){\r\n      font = createFont(&quot;Pano Bold Kopie.otf&quot;, 600);\r\n      size(800, 800, P2D);\r\n      pg = createGraphics(800, 800, P2D);\r\n      pg.beginDraw();\r\n      pg.background(0);\r\n      pg.fill(255);\r\n      pg.textFont(font);\r\n      pg.textSize(400);\r\n      pg.pushMatrix();\r\n      pg.translate(width/2, height/2-140);\r\n      pg.textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);\r\n      pg.text(&quot;a&quot;, 0 , 0);\r\n      pg.popMatrix();\r\n      pg.endDraw();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void draw () {\r\n      copy(pg, 0, 0, width, height, 0, 0, width, height);\r\n      loop();\r\n      int c;\r\n    \r\n      loadPixels();\r\n      for (int x=0; x&lt;width; x++) {\r\n        for (int y=0; y&lt;height; y++) {\r\n          pg.pixels[mouseX+mouseY*width]=0;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      updatePixels();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy last idea, which I have not attempted to implement yet, is to append pixels which have been touched by the mouse to a list and to draw from this list each frame. But this seems quite complicated to me as it might result into super long arrays needing to be processed on top of the original image. So, I hope there is another way around!\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: My goal is to create a smudge brush, hence a brush which kind of copies areas from one part of the image to other parts.

When `mode` is set to `&#39;distributed&#39;` the behavior of the program is unpredictable. Sometimes it runs, sometimes it gives me strange errors (`TypeError(&#39;cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object&#39;)`) but mostly it simply hangs while instantiating `data_queue1`, `data_queue2` and `output_queue`. (See code below.)\r\n\r\nThe two `data_queue` objects are generated by a class `ModeQueue` which uses a `Manager` to hold the queue(s). `output_queue` is instantiated with the help of a class `QueueManager` which inherits from `BaseManager`.

@Lu&#237;sMarques and @jsagrera This is exactly the explanation I was looking for, so now I can understand the problem. In the article it is said that: \r\n\r\n&quot;Since CSDK version 2.80, the ODBC driver is Unicode enabled, this means all the data the driver handles has to be in Unicode format. This means that a extra conversion has to be done&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe version of the csdk in the old server is 2.71. The version in the new server is 4.10.\r\n\r\nNow, the &quot;UNDOC&quot; was there for that reason, the DB was created using en_us.819 but that was ignored with the &quot;undoc&quot; variable for my client app, which assumes the data comes in CP1252 and print it out in CP1252, without any internal conversion the program worked.\r\n\r\nBut the data in the DB is corrupted anyway. After upgrading the driver that internal conversion being made produces the error. \r\n\r\nI still can work around it, I don&#39;t use the &quot;UNDOC&quot; in the ODBC connection, then I get the stream of bytes from the DB and do a conversion from 8859-1 to CP1252 in my C# code. That way I get exactly the same output as in the old server. \r\n\r\nHowever this is not a correct solution but a mitigation of the problem, and the final solution will be to change the DB to UTF8 to avoid any more problems. And that&#39;s what we will finally do.\r\n\r\nThank you @jsagrera I&#39;d like to mark your answer as the correct one. I&#39;m new to the platform so I don&#39;t know well how it works.

For example, the data was corrupted in the data store but the row was still retrievable.&quot;\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation we have found the problem to be in a string that has some unicode characters in it.\r\n\r\nThis is the part of the text that is generating the problem (only part of the text to illustrate the problem:\r\n\r\n&quot;17&quot;-Leichtmetallr&#228;der ...... Ziffern - Schaltknauf&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is a German text and seems ok, the problem is  actually with the &quot;-&quot;. Looking at the db record in Hex, the first &quot;-&quot; is coded as &quot;3F&quot;, however the second dash is coded as &quot;C296&quot;, which corresponds to U+0096 (a dash in unicode)\r\n\r\nThe settings for the DB is en_US.819 (which corresponds to ISO-8859-1 to support for all languages that need to be supported).\r\n\r\nNow, the problem is that when running the program in Windows 2003 the result is written in a file correctly like:\r\n\r\n&quot;17&quot;-Leichtmetallr&#228;der ...... Ziffern - Schaltknauf&quot;\r\n\r\nHowever in Windows 2016 the exception above is raised and nothing gets written.\r\n\r\nI worked on some code changes, the first thing I did was to change OleDB for Odbc connection and the exception dissapeared, however the text in the output is incorrect:\r\n\r\n&quot;17&quot;-Leichtmetallr&#228;der ...... Ziffern ? Schaltknauf&quot;\r\n\r\nNotice how the same code with odbc connection is unable to understand the unicode dash.\r\n\r\nThis is the OleDB code that works in Windows 2003:\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n\r\n    OleDbConnection ConnOleDbIDD = new OleDbConnection(&quot;Provider=Ifxoledbc.2;Data Source=db;INFORMIXSERVER=localhost;IFMX_UNDOC_B168163=1;&quot;);\r\n    string sConnectTemplateDB = &quot;Data Source=SQLServerDB;Initial Catalog=DB1; Connect Timeout = 28800; Integrated Security=True&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    ConnOleDbIDD.Open();\r\n    \r\n    sExportSQL = &quot;SELECT * From MyTable&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    OleDbCommand cmdIDD = new OleDbCommand(sExportSQL, ConnOleDbIDD);\r\n    cmdIDD.CommandTimeout = 28800;\r\n    \r\n    SqlDataAdapter da;\r\n    ConnSchemaIDD = new SqlConnection (sConnectTemplateDB);\r\n    ConnSchemaIDD.Open();\r\n    SqlCommand cmdSQLServerTemplate = new SqlCommand(sExportSQL.Replace(&quot;TRIM&quot;,&quot;LTRIM&quot;), ConnSchemaIDD);\r\n    cmdSQLServerTemplate.CommandTimeout = 28800;\r\n    da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmdSQLServerTemplate);\r\n    \t\r\n    \r\n    OleDbDataReader dr;\r\n    DataSet ds = new DataSet();\r\n    da.MissingSchemaAction = MissingSchemaAction.AddWithKey;\r\n    da.Fill(ds, sSourceTable);\r\n    DataTable dt = ds.Tables[sSourceTable];\r\n    dr = cmdIDD.ExecuteReader()\r\n    \r\n    iEnCodingFrom = 1252;\r\n    iEnCodingTo = 1252;\r\n    \r\n    while (dr.Read())\r\n    {\r\n    \tsValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \tsCurrentValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \tbDelimiterPosition = false;\r\n    \tforeach (DataColumn cCol in dt.Columns)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \r\n    \t\tobject oval = dr.GetValue(dr.GetOrdinal(cCol.ColumnName));\r\n    \t\tstring val = Convert.ToString(dr[cCol.ColumnName]);\r\n    \t\tsCurrentValue = System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(iEnCodingTo).GetString(System.Text.Encoding.Convert(System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(iEnCodingFrom), System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(iEnCodingTo), System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(iEnCodingFrom).GetBytes(val)));\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tif (bDelimiterPosition == true)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\tsValue = sValue + sDelimiter + sCurrentValue.Trim();\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\telse\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\tsValue = sValue + sCurrentValue.Trim();\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\tbDelimiterPosition = true;\r\n    \r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tw.WriteLine(sValue);\r\n    \tw.Flush();\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    dr.Close();\r\n\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\nAssume for this example that &quot;Mytable&quot; has 2 columns, the first is an integer ID and the second is a char(3100).\r\n\r\nAs you see the code does some weird things like getting the column description from an schema of the table in a SQLServer database, and a conversion of the db output from CP1252 to CP1252. I am not sure why it was coded that way.\r\nMy workaround for this problem has been doing these changes to the code (using odbc connection instead of oledb):\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n\r\n    iEnCodingFrom = 28591;\r\n    ...\r\n       sCurrentValue = Encoding.GetEncoding(iEnCodingTo).GetString(Encoding.GetEncoding(iEnCodingFrom).GetBytes(val.ToCharArray()));\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nSo changing the connection to an ODBC conection to the informix DB which prevents the exception to be raised, and doing a conversion from codepage 28591 (8859-1) to 1252 (CP1252) produces in Windows 2016 the same result as the old code in Windows 2013.\r\n\r\nSo I have a workaround and can use it, however I would like to understand why this happens, why can&#39;t I keep using OleDB and if there is a way I can make it work in a new Windows environment (fails also in windows 10) without having to change the code.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166555/encoding-problem-when-migrating-a-legacy-tool-to-a-new-windows-version-with-oled","title":"Encoding problem when migrating a legacy tool to a new Windows version with OleDB"},{"tags":["azure","azure-application-insights"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11576,"user_id":932728,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybvAd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Bons","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/932728/peter-bons"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569842849,"post_id":58166554,"comment_id":102715406,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166554/how-to-reduce-data-retention-period-in-azure-appinsight#comment102715406_58166554"},{"owner":{"reputation":1473,"user_id":2745682,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rGVt8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Manas Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2745682/manas-kumar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11576,"user_id":932728,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybvAd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Bons","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/932728/peter-bons"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569845103,"post_id":58166554,"comment_id":102716403,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166554/how-to-reduce-data-retention-period-in-azure-appinsight#comment102716403_58166554"},{"owner":{"reputation":11576,"user_id":932728,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybvAd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Bons","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/932728/peter-bons"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569845205,"post_id":58166554,"comment_id":102716449,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166554/how-to-reduce-data-retention-period-in-azure-appinsight#comment102716449_58166554"},{"owner":{"reputation":20443,"user_id":13687,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83fd7d4059fec16d3f138f4f351b6423?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gardner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13687/john-gardner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569979126,"post_id":58166554,"comment_id":102767135,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166554/how-to-reduce-data-retention-period-in-azure-appinsight#comment102767135_58166554"}],"owner":{"reputation":1473,"user_id":2745682,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rGVt8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Manas Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2745682/manas-kumar"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569843000,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569841222,"creation_date":1569841222,"question_id":58166554,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166554","body_markdown":"In Azure AppInsight the data retained for 90 days by default.

that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166553/how-to-restart-an-lapply-loop-within-a-renderui","title":"How to restart an lapply loop within a

It is possible to outweigh this cost by bulking the data, but the resulting algorithm will be more complex and creates additional undesired side effects (like allocations). \r\n\r\nOtherwise, don&#39;t parallelize.\r\n\r\nSee below example of various implementations with long/short computations times and their resulting benchmark.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that unless you compute a long

fact that they are ***right associative*** means that these are parsed &quot;right-to-left&quot; so to speak. It thus means that *x &amp;oplus; y &amp;oplus; z* is parsed as *x&amp;oplus; (y &amp;oplus; z)*. So that means that `x ++ y : z` is indeed parsed as `x ++ (y : z)`.\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons to make both `(:)` and `(++)` right associative. For the &quot;cons&quot; `(:)` operator, it means that we can write `1 : 4 : 2 : []`, since it is parsed as `1 : (4 : (2: []))`, which is correct in terms of the types. If would parse it like `((1:4):2:[])`, then `1:4` would for example be wrong, since it expects an item as the first operand, and list of these items as the second operand. We can of course still let the Haskell parser parse it as a list, but that would result in a large amount of extra parenthesis.\r\n\r\nFor `(++)` it is better to parse it right-to-left as well due to performance reasons. `x ++ y` takes linear time in the size of `x`. So that means that if we parse `x ++ (y ++ z)`, it will take *|x| + |y|* steps. If we would parse this as `(x ++ y) ++ z`, it would take *2&amp;times;|x|+|y|*, since the first time we apply `(x ++ y)` it runs in the size of `x`, but then `(x ++ y) ++ z` runs in the size of `x ++ y`. This thus would mean that if we concatenate *n* lists each with a size of *m*, it will not run in *O(n&amp;times;m)*, but in *O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;m)*.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166444/haskell-parsing-x-y-z/58166483#58166483","title":"Haskell Parsing: x ++ y :
