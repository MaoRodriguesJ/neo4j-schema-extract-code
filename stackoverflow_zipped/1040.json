This can be extended on and you can pass type parameters if you want.  \r\nHere is an [example from the changelog](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/36e4d5e3c206822246dc525498c4b011f4755f6c/CHANGELOG.md#language):\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nextension CurryFunction&lt;R, S, T&gt; on R Function(S, T) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can extend any [`typedef`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/12545762/6509751) of a function.\r\n\r\nFor adding the `toAsync` and `callAsync` functionality a generic return type `R` will do. Note that this will only extend functions without parameters as `Function()` takes no parameters:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nextension FancyFunction&lt;R&gt; on R Function() {\r\n  Future&lt;R&gt; Function() toAsync() =&gt; () async =&gt; this();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this could be used like this:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nvoid syncHello() =&gt; print(&#39;Hello&#39;);\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  final asyncHello = syncHello.toAsync();\r\n\r\n  asyncHello().then((_) =&gt; print(&#39;, World!&#39;));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How do I implement calling?\r\n\r\nEvery class in Dart can [implement the `call` method](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#callable-classes). You can either execute this method simply using **parentheses** or with `.call()`.  \r\nHere is an example implementation:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nextension FancyFunction&lt;R&gt; on R Function() {\r\n  Future&lt;R&gt; call() async =&gt; this();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince every `Function` already implements `call`, the extension member cannot be called *implicitly*.\r\nInstead, you will have to **explicitly** declare your function as a `FancyFunction` to be able to call it:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nvoid syncHello() =&gt; print(&#39;Hello&#39;);\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  FancyFunction(syncHello)()\r\n      .then((_) =&gt; print(&#39;, World!&#39;));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `FancyFunction(syncHello)()` is the same method call as `FancyFunction(syncHello).call()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, now we have two problems:\r\n\r\n * We have to *explicitly declare* our function to be a `FancyFunction`, which somewhat defeats the purpose of having an extension.\r\n\r\n * The `call` method will always return a `Future` as the regular call method cannot be accessed anymore when we declare a `FancyFunction`.\r\n\r\nInstead, adding a method like `callAsync` seems like a better solution:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nextension FancyFunction&lt;R&gt; on R Function() {\r\n  Future&lt;R&gt; callAsync() async =&gt; this();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, `callAsync` can be used implicitly again:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nvoid syncHello() =&gt; print(&#39;Hello&#39;);\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  syncHello.callAsync()\r\n      .then((_) =&gt; print(&#39;, World!&#39;));\r\n\r\n  syncHello(); // regular call\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58295050/how-can-i-extend-functions-in-dart/58295051#58295051","title":"How can I extend functions in Dart?"}],"owner":{"reputation":17518,"user_id":6509751,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/260caa996ae8ac9fcee35487aa8d7c81?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"creativecreatorormaybenot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6509751/creativecreatorormaybenot"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58295051,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570575969,"creation_date":1570575969,"question_id":58295050,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58295050","body_markdown":"I know about [the `extension` feature in Dart](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58288266/6509751), but how can I use it with functions?  \r\n\r\nEssentially, I am facing two problems:\r\n\r\n 1.

I&#39;ve read about string descriptors https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb5.shtml and my understanding is that a Configuration descriptor or report descriptor lists an index that points to a string. The string is stored somewhere else. and the host can then request the string by the index via a &quot;get&quot;string&quot;Descriptor&quot; request.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m pretty mystified by the implementation though. I&#39;ve been trawling through the STM32F04 example libraries (available for download from STM or duplicated here https://github.com/caozoux/arm/blob/master/stm32/STM32F0x2_USB-FS-Device_Lib%20V1.0.0/Libraries/STM32_USB_Device_Library/Class/dfu/src/usbd_dfu_core.c ) and found this:\r\n```c\r\n    /* USB DFU device Configuration Descriptor */\r\n    const uint8_t usbd_dfu_CfgDesc[USB_DFU_CONFIG_DESC_SIZ] =\r\n    {\r\n      0x09, /* bLength: Configuration Descriptor size */\r\n      USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE, /* bDescriptorType: Configuration */\r\n      USB_DFU_CONFIG_DESC_SIZ,\r\n      /* wTotalLength: Bytes returned */\r\n      0x00,\r\n      0x01,         /*bNumInterfaces: 1 interface*/\r\n      0x01,         /*bConfigurationValue: Configuration value*/\r\n      0x02,         /*iConfiguration: Index of string descriptor describing the configuration*/\r\n      0xC0,         /*bmAttributes: bus powered and Supports Remote Wakeup */\r\n      0x32,         /*MaxPower 100 mA: this current is used for detecting Vbus*/\r\n      /* 09 */\r\n```\r\nwhich gives the index of iConfiguration at 0x02. I then searched all the files of another reference to 0x02 or a configuration string and found nothing. I expected to find some sort of array of strings that could be indexed into by the 0x02 index or at least a configuration string.

have requirement for the component which has a dropdown, which fills from web api, that dropdown is bound with a list box, which displays an unordered list, that unordered list displays items with editable (selectable) checkboxes, and this component has a download button.\r\n\r\nBasically how it does is, \r\n1. dropdown shows the directories in a folder, each directory is shown as an item in the dropdown (just as string items though​). \r\n\r\n2. When a directory is selected, the dropdown change event makes a call to the api, which shows all the files within that directory. these files are just shown as names with checkboxes as unordered list within the listbox that&#39;s bound with the dropdown\r\n\r\n3. Until user selected at least one checkbox or all checkboxes the download button wouldn&#39;t be visible, it should become invisible if all the items in the listbox are unselected automatically. \r\n\r\n4. Once the user makes the selection and clicks on download, it calls the web api which zips all the selected files and names it as the selected text of the dropdown and lets user download the zip file at the client side.\r\n\r\nCan anybody please suggest me for something from the below Code, how to achieve this functionality - thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n    class AccessData extends React.Component {\r\n    state = {\r\n        files: [],\r\n        communities: [],\r\n        selectedCommunity: { display: &#39;Select a Community...&#39;, value: &#39;&#39;

If you want include members with 0 Acts, you cannot return `acts.users_id`. Use  `memberships.users_id` instead.\r\n2. The condition `a.created_at &gt;= (CURRENT_DATE - 6)` in the `WHERE` clause voids all attempts with `LEFT JOIN`. Move that condition into the `JOIN` clause. See:\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40465260/postgres-left-join-with-where-condition/40477254#40477254\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT m.users_id  -- !!!\r\n     , u.username, avatar_url\r\n     , COUNT(a.users_id) AS ct_acts\r\nFROM   memberships m\r\nJOIN   users       u ON m.users_id = u.id \r\nLEFT   JOIN acts   a ON a.users_id = u.id \r\n                    AND a.created_at &gt;= (CURRENT_DATE - 6)  -- !!!\r\nWHERE  m.groups_id = &#39; + req.params.group_id + &#39;\r\nGROUP  BY 1, 2, 3\r\nORDER  BY COUNT(*) DESC;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming referential integrity between `memberships` and `users` (FK constraint), so the join to users can remain as `[INNER] JOIN`.\r\n\r\nAlso assuming *&quot;all group members&quot;* is suppose to mean all `WHERE m.groups_id = &#39; + req.params.group_id + &#39;`, or we need to do more.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly are you counting there? Currently, this looks like a multiplication of acts with group memberships. May be a misunderstanding.

Try removing and re-adding the integration, updating the credentials if they have been changed at all for the Google Sheets account being used. If able to re-add without getting an error, that should resolve any invalid access errors and you can re-run the integration on your existing submissions. This error can also be a problem with &quot;Protected sheets and ranges&quot; if you&#39;ve altered your spreadsheet lately.\r\nIf Google Sheets returns a Bad Request - &quot;Unable to retrieve cells&quot; error, this is because you do not have column labels in the first row of your sheet. You have to create the sheet and fields on your sheet across the top row first before they will show in Formstack  - make sure the field names are the same as the field labels on your form.\r\n\r\nI can only assume you submit the data and then immediately query it.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a very strong chance that the server has not processed / stored the data that you are currently trying to access.\r\n\r\n&gt; This error can also be a problem with &quot;Protected sheets and ranges&quot; if you&#39;ve altered your spreadsheet lately.\r\n\r\nThe solution would be non-sophisticated and would involve one of two things:\r\n\r\n 1. `try / catch` block to attempt to query the site / data &amp; if an error is returned, just process the page without any data\r\n 2. Wait 1 second then `try / catch` query. If error - wait 2 seconds then `try / catch` query. Repeat with increasing durations until 5 seconds and then just load the page without any data if no data is able to be retrieved after 5 queries.\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever it would be good to double check that these are correct with relation to your spreadsheet / code combination (we do not have access to your spreadsheet):\r\n\r\n- Your query is correctly formatted - particularly in reference to column names: [400 Bad Request : Invalid Query parameter value][2]\r\n- The document you&#39;re trying to access is PUBLIC\r\n- The query has correct ranges references: [Error: Unable to parse range][3]\r\n- A correct API key is being used (if applicable): [Google API Key for Google Sheets][4]\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt; \r\n\r\n**Hopefully that helps, I&#39;ve had similar issues with Sharepoint online queries before.**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://help.formstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019521651-Google-Sheets-Commonly-Returned-Errors\r\n  [2]: https://support.workato.com/support/solutions/articles/1000229348-google-sheets-error-400-bad-request-invalid-query-parameter-value-for-sq-\r\n  [3]: https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/59bm63/trouble_with_google_sheets_api_quickstart_error/\r\n  [4]: https://www.vmix.com/help19/index.htm?GoogleAPIKey.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294967/error-400-when-submitting-form-but-information-is-still-received-in-google-sheet/58295113#58295113","title":"Error 400 when submitting form but information is still received in google sheet"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":11381454,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ddfFLCuHbQM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/TmB4hDjVRfs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"NMALM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11381454/nmalm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570645981,"post_id":58304479,"comment_id":102981998,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294967/error-400-when-submitting-form-but-information-is-still-received-in-google-sheet/58304479#comment102981998_58304479"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3360,"user_id":11599789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4650ead58d59d090529a6f31ab3462cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ziganotschka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11599789/ziganotschka"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570625227,"creation_date":1570625227,"answer_id":58304479,"question_id":58294967,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58304479","body_markdown":"**Most likely** \r\n\r\n+ Either the sheet `&#39;FormResponse&#39;` does not exist in the spreadsheet to which the script is bound\r\n+ `DriveApp.getFolderById()` does not contain a valid folder Id\r\n+ Or you do not have the right to access this folder\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294967/error-400-when-submitting-form-but-information-is-still-received-in-google-sheet/58304479#58304479","title":"Error 400 when submitting form but information is still received in google sheet"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":11381454,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ddfFLCuHbQM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/TmB4hDjVRfs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"NMALM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11381454/nmalm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570647207,"creation_date":1570647207,"answer_id":58310502,"question_id":58294967,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58310502","body_markdown":"This might seem dumb, but it doesn&#39;t seem as though I use /action_page.php to collect the data, it is all done in JS through the functions saveImage and renderSignature.

IMHO  [Formik][1] is probably the best.\r\n\r\nWith the three fields that you have there, you could implement something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { Formik } from &#39;formik&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst BasicExample = () =&gt; (\r\n  &lt;div&gt;\r\n    &lt;Formik\r\n      initialValues={{ email: &#39;&#39;, password: &#39;&#39;, accessCode: &#39;&#39; }}\r\n      onSubmit={(values, actions) =&gt; {\r\n        setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n          alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));\r\n          actions.setSubmitting(false);\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n      }}\r\n      render={props =&gt; (\r\n        &lt;form onSubmit={props.handleSubmit}&gt;\r\n          &lt;input\r\n            type=&quot;email&quot;\r\n            onChange={props.handleChange}\r\n            onBlur={props.handleBlur}\r\n            value={props.values.email}\r\n            name=&quot;email&quot;\r\n          /&gt;\r\n          {props.errors.email &amp;&amp; &lt;div id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;{props.errors.email}&lt;/div&gt;}\r\n          &lt;input\r\n            type=&quot;password&quot;\r\n            onChange={props.handleChange}\r\n            onBlur={props.handleBlur}\r\n            value={props.values.password}\r\n            name=&quot;password&quot;\r\n          /&gt;\r\n          {props.errors.password &amp;&amp; &lt;div id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;{props.errors.password}&lt;/div&gt;}\r\n          &lt;input\r\n            type=&quot;text&quot;\r\n            onChange={props.handleChange}\r\n            onBlur={props.handleBlur}\r\n            value={props.values.accessCode}\r\n            name=&quot;accessCode&quot;\r\n          /&gt;\r\n          {props.errors.accessCode &amp;&amp; &lt;div id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;{props.errors.acessCode}&lt;/div&gt;}\r\n          &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;/form&gt;\r\n      )}\r\n    /&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the above is just from memory - which to some extent speaks to it&#39;s simplicity. As `initialValues` are supplied to Formik, you can build complex component hierarchies without having to pass down form state but that&#39;s just one of the various benefits. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294925/page-not-re-rendering-after-hook-state-update/58295032#58295032","title":"Page not re-rendering after hook state update"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":4521938,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Upr10.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kirsanv43","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4521938/kirsanv43"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570575869,"creation_date":1570575869,"answer_id":58295042,"question_id":58294925,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58295042","body_markdown":"I have an assumption.\r\n\r\nIn registerFormValidation doesn&#39;t modify errors object.

To avoid that, we can use a single `StringBuilder` to build all Strings:\r\n\r\n\tvoid generateStrings(String[][] possibleCharacters, StringBuilder prefix, List&lt;String&gt; results) {\r\n\t    var index = prefix.length();\r\n\t    if (index == possibleCharacters.length) {\r\n\t        results.add(prefix.toString());\r\n\t    } else {\r\n\t        for (String c : possibleCharacters[index]) {\r\n\t          prefix.append(c);\r\n\t          generateStrings(possibleCharacters, prefix, results);\r\n\t          prefix.delete(index, prefix.length());\r\n\t        }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAnother possible problem is that the list of generated strings gets really big really quick, so storing them all in memory before processing them might be considered wasteful. In phython, you&#39;d use a generator for that. In Java, the closest semantic equivalent would be a `Stream`, but they are hard to provide, so a simple callback is probably the better choice. That is, rather than passing a `List&lt;String&gt;` to receive the results, you&#39;d pass a `Consumer&lt;String&gt;` that is to be invoked for every result.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294917/build-all-strings-where-each-digit-is-a-charachter-from-a-set/58295161#58295161","title":"Build all strings where each digit is a charachter from a set"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11020703,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ba55e2b1a4e07cbb7b905e94621b5e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"James Palmer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11020703/james-palmer"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570576373,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570696884,"creation_date":1570574699,"question_id":58294917,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294917","body_markdown":"If I have a two dimensional String array of charachters \r\n\r\n`{{&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;},{&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, F&quot;} ... {&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;R&quot;}, {&quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;W&quot;}}` \r\n\r\nThen how would I build a string with the length of the main array, and each digit is a charachter from the inner array?

 // classA member handler\r\n                 \r\nSo classA uses handler. \r\nin handler.h, there is a &quot;functionA()&quot; virtual function that i can mock:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    virtual bool functionA() const;\r\n       \r\ni have a mock class for handler:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class MockHandler: public Handler{\r\n        public:\r\n\r\n        MockHandler():Handler(&quot;sth for default&quot;) {}  // mockHandler constructor, same as Handler\r\n        MOCK_CONST_METHOD0(functionA, bool());

How can I test my constructor? One way i can think about is to copy the whole `classA.cpp` and `classA.h` to `mockclassA.cpp` and `mockclassA.h` and just change\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\n    Handler d_handler;\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n    MockHanlder d_hanlder;\r\n\r\nand in my test i will use `&quot;mockclassA&quot;` instead of `&quot;classA&quot;`. But this will duplicate code and it makes code harder to maintain.

My code reads in each sheet, performs the operations on the sheet, then I start the same process for the next sheet (8 times) before using .concat to merge them. \r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    inputfile = &quot;input.xlsx&quot; \r\n    outputfile = &quot;merged.csv&quot;\r\n\r\n    ##LN X: READ FIRST SHEET AND ASSIGN HEADER INFORMATION TO COLUMNS\r\n\r\n    df1 = pd.read_excel(inputfile, sheet_name=0, usecols=&quot;A:N&quot;, index=0)\r\n\r\n    #Define cell locations of fields in the header area to be assigned to \r\n    columns\r\n    #THIS CELL LOCATIONS ARE SAME ON ALL SHEETS\r\n    A = df1.iloc[3,4]\r\n    B = df1.iloc[2,9]\r\n    C = df1.iloc[3,9]\r\n    D = df1.iloc[5,9]\r\n    E = df1.iloc[4,9]\r\n\r\n    #Insert well header info as columns in data for worksheet1\r\n    df1.insert(0,&quot;column_name&quot;, A)\r\n\r\n    df1.insert(1,&quot;column_name&quot;, B)\r\n\r\n    df1.insert(4,&quot;column_name&quot;, E)\r\n\r\n    # Rename the columns in `enter code here`worksheet1 DataFrame to reflect \r\n    actual column headers\r\n    df1.rename(columns={&#39;Unnamed: 0&#39;: &#39;Header1&#39;, \r\n                   &#39;Unnamed: 1&#39;: &#39;Header2&#39;, }, inplace=True)         \r\n\r\n    df_merged = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3, df4, df5, df6, df7, \r\n      df8],ignore_index=True, sort=False)\r\n\r\n    #LN Y: Remove non-numerical entries\r\n\r\n    df_merged = df_merged.replace(np.nan, 0)\r\n          \r\n    ##Write results to CSV file\r\n\r\n    df_merged.to_csv(outputfile, index=False)\r\n\r\nSince this code will be used on other Excel files with varying numbers of sheets, I am looking for any pointers on how to include the repeating operations in each sheet in a loop. Basically repeating the steps between LN X to LN Y for each sheet (8 times!!). I am struggling with how to use a loop function Thanks in advance for your assistance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294909/python-loop-through-excel-sheets-assign-header-info-to-columns-on-each-sheet","title":"Python: Loop through Excel sheets, assign header info to columns on each sheet, then merge to one file"},{"tags":["sas"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4111819,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000188518594/picture?type=large","display_name":"Felipe Aleshinsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4111819/felipe-aleshinsky"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570574587,"creation_date":1570574587,"question_id":58294908,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294908","body_markdown":"I have a database with hierarchical structure and variable binary response, eg students (level 1) and schools (level 2).

But instead the green one spans the entire half (same size as the red one).\r\n\r\nWhy is that happening? &lt;strike&gt;How could I get the expected result without using a Stack?&lt;/strike&gt;\r\n\r\nFor more context I&#39;m trying to work around the issue with GestureDetector not responding correctly after translation with a Transform widget:\r\nhttps://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27587\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nAfter a good night of sleep the solution to achieve the expected result came easily, I added some margin to the inner container as follow:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) =&gt; Container(\r\n        height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.5,\r\n        width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,\r\n        color: Colors.green.withOpacity(0.3),\r\n        child: Container(\r\n          margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.25 * 0.5),\r\n          color: Colors.red.withOpacity(0.3),\r\n        ),\r\n      );\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I&#39;m way more interested in understanding why the first code is not working as expected. I read the source code for the Container widget but I can&#39;t find any obvious cause. Does anyone know?\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2:**\r\n\r\n@Pablo Barrera Answers gave me the idea to try adding the alignment to the first container instead (which is the way it should be indeed). \r\n\r\nIt also makes the second container take the expected size, which is unexpected. Still curious to know if there is a logical explanation for this. \r\n\r\n```dart\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) =&gt; Container(\r\n        height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.5,\r\n        width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,\r\n        alignment: Alignment.center,\r\n        color: Colors.green.withOpacity(0.3),\r\n        child: Container(\r\n          height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.25,\r\n          color: Colors.red.withOpacity(0.3),\r\n        ),\r\n      );\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294901/nested-container-not-respecting-size-constraints","title":"Nested container not respecting size constraints"},{"tags":["c","algorithm","postfix-notation","infix-notation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25512,"user_id":857132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fd51ed5980999c7c6ce3729d6cb2184?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John3136","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/857132/john3136"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570574723,"post_id":58294900,"comment_id":102953549,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294900/unable-to-find-the-reason-for-segmentation-error#comment102953549_58294900"},{"owner":{"reputation":89738,"user_id":2410359,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pIl9T.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2410359/chux"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570575355,"post_id":58294900,"comment_id":102953665,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294900/unable-to-find-the-reason-for-segmentation-error#comment102953665_58294900"},{"owner":{"reputation":89738,"user_id":2410359,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pIl9T.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2410359/chux"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570575473,"post_id":58294900,"comment_id":102953686,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294900/unable-to-find-the-reason-for-segmentation-error#comment102953686_58294900"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11358867,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72acd598a23637ed1c8c41ec14d4d362?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user999299292","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11358867/user999299292"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570574529,"creation_date":1570574529,"question_id":58294900,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294900","body_markdown":"I have 2 seperate working c programs 1. postfix to inxfix -&gt;\r\n```\r\n#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n\r\n//*******************************************\r\n//** STACK\r\n#define size 10\r\n\r\nstruct stack {\r\n\t\r\n\tint count;\r\n\tchar* stack[size];\r\n} s;\r\n\r\nvoid display() {\r\n\t\r\n\tif(s.count == 0) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tprintf(&quot;Stack is empty!&quot;);\r\n\t}\r\n\telse {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tprintf(&quot;Stack data:&quot;);\r\n\t\tfor(int i = s.count - 1;

But the problem is I would still have is to be able to set `TestContext`, and if the test fails inside of the for loop, then it seems like it would be more of a headache to fix. \r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t fleshed this idea out but those were some of the alternatives that I&#39;ve considered.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294856/is-there-a-way-to-set-the-number-of-rows-to-run-on-the-testcontext-from-the-numb","title":"Is there a way to set the number of rows to run on the TestContext from the number of rows that was returned"},{"tags":["css-animations","fade","react-bootstrap"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1501,"user_id":288096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7aa1ac62349de7aebf7d43020c799dfe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"windmaomao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/288096/windmaomao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570584873,"post_id":58294855,"comment_id":102955385,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294855/cant-get-fade-working-with-react-bootstrap#comment102955385_58294855"},{"owner":{"reputation":165,"user_id":11838970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3697a49a8e98b1ae3a47843c0e9a7830?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"robertwerner-goodyear","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11838970/robertwerner-goodyear"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1501,"user_id":288096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7aa1ac62349de7aebf7d43020c799dfe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"windmaomao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/288096/windmaomao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570723696,"post_id":58294855,"comment_id":103012425,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294855/cant-get-fade-working-with-react-bootstrap#comment103012425_58294855"}],"owner":{"reputation":165,"user_id":11838970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3697a49a8e98b1ae3a47843c0e9a7830?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"robertwerner-goodyear","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11838970/robertwerner-goodyear"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570574176,"creation_date":1570574176,"question_id":58294855,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294855","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve created a simple message component in React.

were so close :) Everything looks just fine except one thing, you&#39;re using `multiprocessing.Queue` to store running processes in order to join them later on with the `Joiner` instance. From the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html) you&#39;ll know the following\r\n\r\n&gt; Note: When an object is put on a queue, the object is pickled and a\r\n&gt; background thread later flushes the pickled data to an underlying\r\n&gt; pipe.\r\n\r\nThat is, the process gets serialized when putting into the queue which gives the following error\r\n\r\n&gt; TypeError: Pickling an AuthenticationString object is disallowed for\r\n&gt; security reasons\r\n\r\nThis happens because of a unique [authentication key](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-auth-keys) each process has. This key is a byte string which can be thought of as a password which is of type `multiprocessing.process.AuthenticationString` and cannot be pickled.\r\n\r\nThe solution is simple, just use `queue.Queue` instance to store your long-running processes.

As I understand it, it suggests running a seperate thread that monitors a FIFO Queue, and then putting the process handle in the queue before returning the parent function.
