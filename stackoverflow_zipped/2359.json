The expressions to extract fields are a bit complex to write (an maintain).\r\n - Using the XML Parser, but you have to convert your data to XML before, and design an XML schema.

The *user* code is instrumented during runtime via the normal `ClassFileTransformer::transform` method.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to track value flows through *JDK* methods. Thus, we need to instrument the Java runtime as well. We cannot use `transform`, because hundreds of runtime methods are loaded prior to the first time we get control at `transform`.\r\n\r\nPrior to Java 9, we handled this in an offline step that reads `rt.jar`, instruments its methods, and writes out a modified version as `dcomp-rt.jar`.   The user placed `dcomp-rt.jar` on the bootclasspath to ensure our modified Java runtime methods were loaded instead of the standard ones.  The user program invocation would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -cp .:.../daikon/daikon.jar \\\r\n  -Xbootclasspath/p:.../daikon/java/dcomp_rt.jar:.:.../daikon/daikon.jar \\\r\n  -javaagent:.../daikon/java/dcomp_premain.jar={various dcomp arguments} \\\r\n  {user program} {user program arguments}\r\n```\r\nNow to Java 9+.  Our first approach was to read in and instrument the class files within the Java runtime jmod files (via the new `jrt:/` file system) and create a `dcomp_rt.jar` as before.  The problem we are experiencing is that we cannot get the system to use the contents of this jar instead of `jrt:/java.base` (for example).  We tried various `--module-path` and `-Xbootclasspath` (only `/a` is available now, might be part of problem) options to no avail.  Still hoping there might be a way to do this?  \r\n\r\nIf not, I&#39;m guessing we need to make modified versions of each of the interesting runtime jmods and then use a `--patch-module` argument for each of them.  Would this ensure our modified code is loaded instead of the standard runtime?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts/suggestions?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976989/instrumenting-java-9-runtime-modules","title":"Instrumenting Java 9+ runtime modules"},{"tags":["reactjs","material-ui"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1147,"user_id":10641422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10641422/ido"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568732993,"post_id":57976983,"comment_id":102364053,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976983/react-materials-ui-how-can-i-close-two-dialogs-at-the-same-time#comment102364053_57976983"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":398,"user_id":9591860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4ed3d1778c6e164c30e279a52345a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"HungryBird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9591860/hungrybird"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568734717,"post_id":57977296,"comment_id":102364979,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976983/react-materials-ui-how-can-i-close-two-dialogs-at-the-same-time/57977296#comment102364979_57977296"},{"owner":{"reputation":20298,"user_id":4035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9RZFi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dance2die","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4035/dance2die"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":398,"user_id":9591860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4ed3d1778c6e164c30e279a52345a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"HungryBird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9591860/hungrybird"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568738138,"post_id":57977296,"comment_id":102366553,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976983/react-materials-ui-how-can-i-close-two-dialogs-at-the-same-time/57977296#comment102366553_57977296"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20298,"user_id":4035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9RZFi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dance2die","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4035/dance2die"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568733216,"creation_date":1568733216,"answer_id":57977296,"question_id":57976983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57977296","body_markdown":"There are ways to achieve this but it depends on how you&#39;d want to implement it or makes sense.\r\n\r\nAs there is no specific code provided, will provide some ways you can consider.\r\n\r\n1. [Liffing state up][1].\r\n2. Notify parent via callback\r\n3. Context API\r\n\r\n## 1. Lifting state up\r\n\r\nYou can simply move the states for dialog 1 &amp; 2 to the parent component.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Parent() {\r\n  const [dialogStates, setDialogStates] = useState({\r\n    isDialog1Open: false,\r\n    isDialog2Open: false\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Notify parent via callback\r\n\r\nYou can provide a function to be called when child dialog is called.\r\n\r\nCheck out the sorta-pseudo code like snippet below.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction ParentDialog() {\r\n  const [isDialogOpen, setIsDialogOpen] = useState(false);\r\n  const [isChildDialogOpen, setIsChildDialogOpen] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Dialog isOpen={isDialogOpen}&gt;\r\n      &lt;ChildDialog onCancel={() =&gt; setIsDialogOpen(false)} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Dialog&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction ChildDialog({ onCancel }) {\r\n  return &lt;Dialog onCancelClick={onCancel}&gt;...&lt;/Dialog&gt;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Context API\r\n\r\nYou can notify the parent from children to close using a dispatch.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the ways to implement it.\r\n(And you can make the context API more sharable using [this post][2]).\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst DialogStateContext = createContext();\r\nconst DialogActionContext = createContext();\r\n\r\nfunction dialogReducer(state, action) {\r\n  ... toggle dialog states here...\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction DialogContainer({children}) {\r\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(dialogReducer, initialState)\r\n  \r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;DialogStateContext.Provider value={state}&gt;\r\n      &lt;DialogActionContext.Provider value={dispatch}&gt;\r\n       {children}\r\n      &lt;/DialogActionContext.Provider&gt;\r\n    &lt;/DialogStateContext.Provider&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction ParentDialog() {\r\n  const state = useContext(DialogStateContext)\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Dialog isOpen={state.isParentDialogOpen}&gt;\r\n      &lt;ChildDialog onCancel={() =&gt; setIsDialogOpen(false)} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Dialog&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction ChildDialog({ onCancel }) {\r\n  const dispatch = useContext(DialogActionContext)\r\n  return &lt;Dialog onCancelClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: &#39;close parent dialog&#39;})}&gt;...&lt;/Dialog&gt;;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html\r\n  [2]: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976983/react-materials-ui-how-can-i-close-two-dialogs-at-the-same-time/57977296#57977296","title":"React Materials UI - How can I close two dialogs at the same time"}],"owner":{"reputation":398,"user_id":9591860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4ed3d1778c6e164c30e279a52345a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"HungryBird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9591860/hungrybird"},"last_editor":{"reputation":398,"user_id":9591860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4ed3d1778c6e164c30e279a52345a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"HungryBird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9591860/hungrybird"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57977296,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568733216,"creation_date":1568732116,"last_edit_date":1568732433,"question_id":57976983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57976983","body_markdown":"I have a nested popup dialog component(From materials UI) which including two dialogs, each of them maintains state &#39;open&#39;, this state is used to determine if the dislog window is open.

note that it assumes PowerShell _Core_; for _Windows PowerShell_, replace `pwsh` with `powershell`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Run from PowerShell\r\n\r\n# Define the alias.\r\n# Note the unexpected need to escape &quot;

`[alias]\r\n  unchanged = !git ls-files -v | sls -pattern ^h -casesensitive`\r\n\r\nmeans that `sh` / `bash` is executing the command, as explained above.\r\n\r\nWhile the command is _syntactically_ valid there, it fails because `sls` is looked for as an _external program_ (given that it is neither a `sh` / `bash` builtin, nor a user-defined function, nor a *`sh` / `bash`* alias), which doesn&#39;t exist (&quot;`command not found`&quot;).\r\n\r\nOnly PowerShell knows that `sls` is an alias for the `Select-String` cmdlet (and even using the latter&#39;s actual name wouldn&#39;t allow it to be called from _outside of PowerShell_, given that it is implemented via a PowerShell-specific _DLL_).\r\n\r\nBy contrast, `git ls-files -v` by itself works in `sh` / `bash` as well, because it is a call to `git`, an _external program_ (a *platform-native executable* that _any_ shell can call).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976980/how-to-fix-command-not-found-git-alias/57978398#57978398","title":"How to fix : Command not found - Git Alias"}],"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":8215157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7916ee82586fc2ccf1bbd41fce311883?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"badgerboy86","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8215157/badgerboy86"},"last_editor":{"reputation":83,"user_id":8215157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7916ee82586fc2ccf1bbd41fce311883?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"badgerboy86","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8215157/badgerboy86"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57978398,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568795670,"creation_date":1568732107,"last_edit_date":1568732413,"question_id":57976980,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57976980","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to setup a git alias to list all files that are marked &#39;assume-unchanged&#39;

I also found heuristic methods to solve quadratic equality constrained problems: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6008/57c54df025e732238425cf55f55997b4a67c.pdf\r\nhttps://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/qcqp.pdf\r\n\r\nHowever, I think they are not suitable to combine them with linear fractional programming. \r\n\r\nI would be very glad if someone could mention any solution to this problem. \r\n\r\nbest regards\r\nLeo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried to linearize the constraints around different random points and took the result with the lowest costs. However, the solution does not fullfil the quafratic equallity constraints.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976962/which-solver-can-solve-fractional-linear-costfunction-with-quadratical-non-con","title":"Which solver can solve Fractional Linear (Costfunction) with quadratical non-convex equality constraints?"},{"tags":["android","android-layout","android-recyclerview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5057,"user_id":1315447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6YH8k.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1315447/ali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568732703,"post_id":57976958,"comment_id":102363897,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976958/how-to-create-a-bottom-view-which-is-scrollable-in-some-cases-not-programmatica#comment102363897_57976958"},{"owner":{"reputation":632,"user_id":4774963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6t-NGeVZjmQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/K_bWH3H-Kmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anh-Tuan Mai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4774963/anh-tuan-mai"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5057,"user_id":1315447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6YH8k.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1315447/ali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568733630,"post_id":57976958,"comment_id":102364402,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976958/how-to-create-a-bottom-view-which-is-scrollable-in-some-cases-not-programmatica#comment102364402_57976958"},{"owner":{"reputation":1082,"user_id":1954960,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIle.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zafer Celaloglu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1954960/zafer-celaloglu"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568734308,"post_id":57976958,"comment_id":102364766,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976958/how-to-create-a-bottom-view-which-is-scrollable-in-some-cases-not-programmatica#comment102364766_57976958"},{"owner":{"reputation":820,"user_id":4135511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efd2a9701c0f354d3cf04a8f554fccb2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lukas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4135511/lukas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568752986,"post_id":57976958,"comment_id":102372724,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976958/how-to-create-a-bottom-view-which-is-scrollable-in-some-cases-not-programmatica#comment102372724_57976958"}],"owner":{"reputation":632,"user_id":4774963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6t-NGeVZjmQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/K_bWH3H-Kmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anh-Tuan Mai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4774963/anh-tuan-mai"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34008,"user_id":2649012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4SzF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fant&#244;mas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649012/fant%c3%b4mas"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568751101,"creation_date":1568732021,"last_edit_date":1568737178,"question_id":57976958,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57976958","body_markdown":"In my xml layout, I have:\r\n\r\n - a recycler view (height variable)\r\n\r\n - a bottom button (56dp = H1)\r\n\r\n\r\nBehavior expected: \r\n\r\n - if recycler view height &lt;

If so, you need to notify EF of this fact:\r\n\r\n    HasKey(x =&gt; x.Id)\r\n      .Property(x =&gt; x.Id)\r\n      .HasDatabaseGeneratedOption(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity);\r\n\r\nSame goes for the Invoice Id configuration.  Otherwise your database will insert the first record with ID = 0, and follow up inserts would lead to duplicate PKs.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you need to map the FK from Invoice to the two Address records. I&#39;ll assume that the Invoice table will have Address1Id and Address2Id to point to the two addresses:\r\n\r\nIn the invoice configuration:\r\n\r\n    HasOptional(x =&gt; x.Address1)\r\n       .WithMany()\r\n       .Map(x =&gt; x.MapKey(&quot;Address1Id&quot;);\r\n    HasOptional(x =&gt; x.Address2)\r\n       .WithMany()\r\n       .Map(x =&gt; x.MapKey(&quot;Address2Id&quot;);\r\n\r\nThis assumes EF6 where your Invoice Entity does not expose properties for the two FKs. (preferrable) If you do expose the FK properties then replace the `.Map(...)` calls with `.HasForeignKey(x =&gt; x.Address1Id)`.  If this is EF Core you replace `.Map(...)` with `.HasForeignKey(&quot;Address1Id&quot;)` to create a shadow property for the mapping.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re still having issues, update your question to include:\r\n\r\n- The complete class and configuration for the two entities. (Invoice and Address)\r\n- The exact error message that you are getting\r\n\r\n... and we can take it from there.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976954/correct-way-to-save-an-object-containint-a-one-on-one-relationship-with-another/57982426#57982426","title":"Correct way to save an object

(see: http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/)\r\n```\r\n function(username, password, done){}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use both as a username, you might want to consider creating your own custom strategy. This is going to be a little more in-depth, but you can start learning on the Passport Github page (https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-strategy)\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that you are trying to get Passport to send a response in the local strategy which is not what it is intended to do. Instead, you should be passing the errors and return values to Passport&#39;s `done()` function, which will process them accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what your local strategy should look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npassport.use(\r\n\tnew LocalStrategy(async (email, phone, password, done) =&gt; {\r\n\t\tconst options = {\r\n\t\t\tcriteria: { email, phone },\r\n\t\t\tselect: &#39;name username email hashed_password salt&#39;,\r\n\t\t};\r\n\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tconst user = await User.load(options);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t/**\r\n\t\t\t * If null is returned meaning there was no user found, send the done call\r\n\t\t\t * with the false flag. This tells passport to redirect to the failure URL.\r\n\t\t\t */\r\n\t\t\tif (!user) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn done(null, false);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t/**\r\n\t\t\t * If the user&#39;s password is incorrect, also return the done function with the false\r\n\t\t\t * flag. This tells passport to redirect to the failure URL.\r\n\t\t\t */\r\n\t\t\tif (!user.authenticate(password)) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn done(null, false);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t/**\r\n\t\t\t * If a user is found and their password is verified, send the user object to\r\n\t\t\t * the done function. This will tell Passport to call the next middelware attaching\r\n\t\t\t * the user object.\r\n\t\t\t */\r\n\t\t\treturn done(null, user);\r\n\t\t} catch (err) {\r\n\t\t\t/**\r\n\t\t\t * If there is an error with the DB call, return generic message\r\n\t\t\t * for security purposes.\r\n\t\t\t */\r\n\t\t\treturn done(&#39;There was an internal server error.&#39;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t})\r\n);\r\n```\r\nand an example of what your load function should look like:\r\n```\r\nload: options =&gt; {\r\n\treturn new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n\t\toptions.select = options.select || &#39;email phone&#39;;\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tconst user = await this.findOne(options.criteria)\r\n\t\t\t\t.select(options.select)\r\n\t\t\t\t.exec();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tresolve(user);\r\n\t\t} catch (err) {\r\n\t\t\treject(err);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a general best practice, I changed your callbacks to the newer method of promises (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises).\r\n\r\nThis should work in the way you are intending to use Passport.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976945/typeerror-function-is-not-a-function-in-passport-local-strategy/57979826#57979826","title":"TypeError: [function] is not a function in Passport local strategy"}],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":7350092,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c2f7ee4daaf1056c9dfbc2855973d0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ElMassas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7350092/elmassas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568743752,"creation_date":1568731989,"question_id":57976945,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57976945","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to authenticate users locally with Passport.js while not keeping session and using my own JWTokens.\r\n\r\nI was following this tutorial:\r\n [Learn using JWT with Passport authentication][1]\r\n\r\nWhile also reading Passport.js documentation.

Note, converting to `TitleCase` does not work for all upper. So, we will need to put the string `ToLower()`:\r\n\r\n    Get-ChildItem -Path &quot;C:\\Path&quot; -Recurse | Rename-Item -NewName {$_.Name -replace &quot;$($_.Name)&quot;, &quot;$((Get-Culture).TextInfo.ToTitleCase($_.Name.ToLower()))&quot;}\r\n\r\nAnother note, this will change &quot;RX PPLLC&quot; to `TitleCase` as well. If you need to ignore that, you might need to use `substring` to get around it. \r\n\r\nUpdate: -- If you want to keep &quot;RX PPLLC&quot;:\r\n\r\n    Get-ChildItem -Path &quot;C:\\Test&quot; -Recurse | Rename-Item -NewName {\r\n        $lefSide = $_.Name.Substring(0,$_.Name.IndexOf(&#39;-&#39;))\r\n        $rightSide = $_.Name.Substring($_.Name.IndexOf(&#39;-&#39;) + 1)\r\n        $rightSide = $((Get-Culture).TextInfo.ToTitleCase($rightSide.ToLower()))\r\n        $newName = $leftSide + $rightSide\r\n        $_.Name -replace &quot;$($_.Name)&quot;, &quot;$newName&quot;    \r\n    }\r\nThere are much better ways of doing this. Basically, this will take the file name into two strings (a left side and right side). It will change the right then put it back into a variable called `$newName` . This will only work if your file name contains a `-`. If you wanted to handle for those situations, you would need a condition or a regEx... this is just a quick example","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976943/how-do-i-change-uppercases-to-correct-casing-for-specific-words/57977189#57977189","title":"How do I change UPPERCASES to Correct casing for specific words?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12079305,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EYV54yegHts/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdPWLB1zCJKnHK4v1-BfTnsptJk_g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gabriel Balenton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079305/gabriel-balenton"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568734001,"creation_date":1568731983,"question_id":57976943,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57976943","body_markdown":"Hi I need to change the cases of the specific words\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - PAIN - Lidocaine\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - PAIN - Fenoprofen\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - DERMATITIS - Diflorasone\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - SCAR - Silvex Pad\r\n\r\nShould be like this:\r\n\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - Pain - Lidocaine\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - Pain - Fenoprofen\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - Dermatitis - Diflorasone\r\n- RX PPLLC - Dr. Smith - John Smith - OH - Scar - Silvex Pad\r\n\r\nI have tried this:\r\n\r\n`get-childitem -recurse | rename-item -newname { $_.name -replace &quot;PAIN&quot;,&quot;Pain&quot; }`        \r\n`get-childitem -recurse | rename-item -newname { $_.name -replace &quot;SCAR&quot;,&quot;Scar&quot; }`        \r\n`get-childitem -recurse | rename-item -newname { $_.name -replace &quot;DERMATITIS&quot;,&quot;Dermatitis&quot; }`\r\n\r\nNow the question is, is there anyway that I could consolidate this into one code?

are numerous issues in your code.\r\n\r\n###Starting a signature twice\r\n\r\nForemost: In your second part (*Embed the returned PKCS1 into PDF*) you start again with the original file and create a new signature field therein. This results in a slightly different PDF than the one you prepared in your first part; thus, the signature value you have retrieved between the two parts obviously cannot be used for this new PDF.\r\n\r\nYou must change your architecture.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep your two-step approach, you have to keep the file you created in your first part in `outputStream` and re-use it in the second part. And to fill in the retrieved signature, you must use `PdfSigner.signDeferred` instead of starting with a `new PdfSigner`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can do it in one step, putting the signature server call into a custom `IExternalSignatureContainer` implementation.\r\n\r\n###Signing the wrong PDF data\r\n\r\nIn your first part you appear to set the `outputStream` contents as the data to sign (actually you even put it into a field that by its name, `responseObject.base64Hash`, should only hold a hash value; I don&#39;t understand that at all). But the bytes to sign are not the complete `outputStream` contents, a placeholder therein for the final signature value must be excluded.\r\n\r\nYou must only sign the resulting PDF without that placeholder. You can get it if instead of the `ExternalBlankSignatureContainer` as is you extend it by overriding the `byte[] Sign(Stream data)` method and grabbing the `Stream` parameter thereof. This stream contains exactly the bytes to sign.\r\n\r\n###The wrong signature format\r\n\r\nYou mention you get *the signed Pkcs1* from your signing server. What you need, though, is a CMS signature container.\r\n\r\nIf your signature server also offers to return CMS (or PKCS#7) signature containers, use that kind of call.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you must build a CMS container yourself, e.g. using the iText `PdfPKCS7` class or BouncyCastle mechanisms.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976915/sign-hash-using-asynchronous-call/57989938#57989938","title":"Sign hash using asynchronous call"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":3984220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3QPAJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Muddassir Awan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3984220/muddassir-awan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":3984220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3QPAJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Muddassir Awan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3984220/muddassir-awan"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571825810,"creation_date":1568731871,"last_edit_date":1571825810,"question_id":57976915,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57976915","body_markdown":"I am using iText7 for performing PDF and signing operations.

I tested the decoder on the website you mentioned, and it doesn&#39;t work for all filetypes. For some files, it just returns a general .bin. As far as detection goes, it might try decoding the string and testing to see if a certain file type fits.

want to implement in my application something similar to instagram&#39;s local notifications.\r\nThe main problem is that local notifications can be different types. For example:\r\n\r\n1) Simple one: &quot;`user` started following you&quot; (this is pretty straightforward)\r\n\r\n2) More complicated: &quot;`user` and +7 other liked your photo X&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first step of solution is to GROUP all notifications by `targeted_user`, `event_type` and `user_who_triggered_event`. For the first case it&#39;s okay as we will have all information. For the second case we will lack some information as Count of similar notifications. Also what if I need some additional information about those `+7` user&#39;s who also liked photo X?\r\n\r\n**What I&#39;ve tried:**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried to use GROUP BY which can work for the second case but is not okay for the first. Also I tried to do 2 separate querysets which has all needed data for each type of notification. But then I&#39;ll have a problem that I cannot combine them and also cannot use pagination. Also if I&#39;ll return 2 querysets it will be hard for front-end to sort them by datetime\r\n\r\nThe first queryset:\r\n\r\nReceivedNotification.objects.filter(user=user)\r\n\r\nThe second one:\r\nReceivedNotification.objects.filter(user=user, notification__event=Notification.LIKED_PHOTO).values_list(&#39;receiver&#39;, &#39;notification__event&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Notification(TimeStampedModel):\r\n    OPEN_PROFILE = &#39;open_profile&#39;\r\n    OPEN_PHOTO = &#39;open_photo&#39;\r\n    ACTION_CHOICES = (\r\n        (OPEN_PROFILE, _(&#39;Open profile&#39;)),\r\n        (OPEN_PHOTO, _(&#39;Open photo&#39;)),\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    LIKED_PHOTO = &#39;liked_photo&#39;\r\n    NEW_FOLLOWER = &#39;new_follower&#39;\r\n   \r\n\r\n    EVENT_CHOICES = (\r\n        (LIKED_PHOTO, _(&#39;Liked photo&#39;)),\r\n        (NEW_FOLLOWER, _(&#39;New follower&#39;))\r\n    )\r\n    action = models.CharField(\r\n        max_length=255,\r\n        choices=ACTION_CHOICES,\r\n    )\r\n    event = models.CharField(\r\n        max_length=255,\r\n        choices=EVENT_CHOICES,\r\n    )\r\n    title = models.CharField(\r\n        max_length=255,\r\n    )\r\n    body = models.TextField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        db_table = &#39;notifications&#39;\r\n```\r\nFor this example I have 2 notifications in data base.\r\n\r\nAlso I have `ReceivedNotification` model with FK to user and FK to notification and also data field(JSONField) to store actual information\r\nwhich particular user will get.\r\n\r\nExpected result is to get all local notifications for particular user is a single query.\r\nSome notifications should have only basic info and other should have Counter of similar notifications if there are more than 3 similar and also list of Id&#39;s of that users.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976842/queryset-with-different-datasets-based-on-obj-type","title":"Queryset with different datasets based on obj

Since arrays have a fixed number of elements, I had to find another way to add the specific options besides the default ones into the JComboBox. And so what I did was, I created a LinkedList and used the asList method from Arrays to load the default options of the array inside it, then add the other options which vary from one user to another:\r\n\r\n    private List&lt;String&gt; allJobs = new LinkedList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(JOB_TYPE));\r\n\r\nallJobs can now be passed on as an argument for the JCombobox using the toArray() method:\r\n\r\n    private JComboBox\tjobType\t= new JComboBox(allJobs.toArray());\r\n\r\nNow, I have all the default options in allJobs, and since it&#39;s no longer an array, I can also add to it the specific options which will be loaded as follows:\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (int j = 0; j &lt; modelJobCustomType.getSize(); j++) {\r\n\t\t\tallJobs.add(((XmlJobCustomElem) modelJobCustomType.getElementAt(j)).getName());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nNow, here&#39;s my problem:\r\n\r\nWhen I check the content of the JComboBox, I only find the default options, and not the specific ones even though I can see using the debugger that the list size has increased and it contains the specific options as well.\r\n\r\nMy guess is, since jobType, JOB_TYPE and allJobs are global variables, the ComboBox is being populated way before the compiler gets to the part of the code where it loads the specific options as well, and that&#39;s probably why I can only see the default options.\r\n\r\nIs this correct? And if so, how can I fix this problem.

The idea is to create 4-dimensional index arrays that apply the `W_K[i, j, i:i+2, j:j+2, ...]` part of your second loopy example.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a slightly modified version of your example, just to make sure that some relevant dimensions differ (because this makes bugs easier to find: they would be proper errors rather than mangled values):\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n# parameter setup\r\nk1, k2, nch, nf = 2, 4, 3, 2 \r\nm1, m2 = 5, 6 \r\nw1, w2 = m1 - k1 + 1, m2 - k2 + 1 \r\nK = np.random.random((k1, k2, nch, nf)) \r\nA = np.random.random((m1, m2, nch)) \r\n \r\n# your loopy version for comparison\r\nW_K = np.zeros((w1, w2, nf, m1, m2, nch)) \r\nfor i, j in np.ndindex(w1, w2): \r\n    W_K[i, j, :, i:i+k1, j:j+k2, ...] = K.transpose(-1, 0, 1, 2) \r\n  \r\nW_K2 = np.zeros((w1, w2, m1, m2, nch, nf))  # to be transposed back\r\ni,j = np.mgrid[:w1, :w2][..., None, None]  # shape (w1, w2, 1, 1) \r\nk,l = np.mgrid[:k1, :k2]  # shape (k1, k2) ~ (1, 1, k1, k2)  \r\n \r\nW_K2[i, j, i+k, j+l, ...] = K \r\nW_K2 = np.moveaxis(W_K2, -1, 2) \r\n \r\nprint(np.array_equal(W_K, W_K2))  # True\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe first create an index mesh `i,j` that span the first two dimensions of `W_K`, then create two similar meshes that span its (pre-`moveaxis`) second and third dimensions. By injecting two trailing singleton dimensions into the former we end up with 4d index arrays that together span the first four dimensions of `W_K`.\r\n\r\nAll that&#39;s left is to assign to this slice using the original `K`, and move back the dimension. Due to how advanced indexing changes behaviour when the sliced (non-advanced) indices in an expression are not all next to one another, this is much easier to do with your `moveaxis` approach. I first tried to create `W_K2` with its final dimensions, but then we&#39;d have `W_K[i, j, :, i+k, j+l, ...]` that has subtly different behaviour (in particular, different shape).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57976816/numpy-way-to-generate-linear-operation-matrix-from-a-convolution-kernel/57977904#57977904","title":"Numpy way to generate linear operation matrix from a convolution kernel"}],"owner":{"reputation":1012,"user_id":1682673,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c93dd597cdf4fa73876e42f96f17b2b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rnbguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1682673/rnbguy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23002,"user_id":5067311,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qjltV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andras Deak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5067311/andras-deak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57977904,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568736055,"creation_date":1568731567,"last_edit_date":1568735800,"question_id":57976816,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57976816","body_markdown":"A 2D convolution kernel, `K`, of shape `(k1, k2, n_channel, n_filter)` applies on a 2D vector, `A`, of shape `(m1, m2, n_channel)` and generates another 2D vector, `B`, of shape `(m1 - k1 + 1, m2 - k2 + 1, n_filter)` (with _valid_ padding).\r\n\r\nIt is also true that for each `K`, there exists a `W_K` of shape `(m1 - k1 + 1, m2 - k2 + 1, n_filter, m1, m2, n_channel)`, such that tensor dot of `W_K` and `A` is equal to `B`. i.e. `B = np.tensordot(W_K, A, 3)`.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find a pure NumPy solution to generate this `W_K` from `K` without using any python loops.\r\n\r\nI can see `W_K[i,j,f] == np.pad(K[...,f], ((i,m1-i-k1), (j,m2-j-k2)), &#39;constant&#39;, constant_values=0)` or simply `W_K[i, j, f, i:i+k1, j:j+k2, ...] == K[..., f]`.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m looking for is almost similar to a Toeplitz matrix.
