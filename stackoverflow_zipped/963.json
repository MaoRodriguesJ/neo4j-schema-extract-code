For example for `numpy.stack`, the very first example is indeed exactly what you want to do.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313330/numpy-appending-two-dimensional-arrays-together/58313435#58313435","title":"Numpy appending two-dimensional arrays together"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5759380,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":22,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da923a84b6660c1dabfdbdd22e13f874?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"swedishfished","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5759380/swedishfished"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570663493,"creation_date":1570661932,"question_id":58313330,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313330","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a function which exponentiates a 2-D matrix and keeps the result in a 3D array, where the first dimension is indexing the exponent. This is important because the rows of the matrix I am exponentiating represent information about different vertices on a graph. So for example if we have A, A^2, A^3, each is shape (50,50) and I want a matrix D = (3,50,50) so that I can go D[:,1,:] to retrieve all the information about node 1 and be able to do matrix multiplication with that. My code is currently as \r\n\r\n    def expo(times,A,n):\r\n        temp = A;\r\n        result = csr_matrix.toarray(temp)\r\n        for i in range(0,times):\r\n        \ttemp = np.dot(temp,A)\r\n        \tif i == 0:\r\n        \t\tresult = np.array([result,csr_matrix.toarray(temp)]) # this creates a (2,50,50) array\r\n        \tif i &gt; 0:\r\n        \t\tresult = np.append(result,csr_matrix.toarray(temp),axis=0) # this does not work\r\n        return result\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not working because in the &quot;i&gt;0&quot; case the temp array is of the shape (50,50) and cannot be appended. I am not sure how to make this work and I am rather confused by the dimensionality in Numpy, e.g. why thinks are (50,1) sometimes and just (50,) other times.

However, it looks like you are missing some annotations from your Test class.\r\n\r\nI am going to assume that the signature of your method findMaxNum looks like the following:\r\n\r\n    public int findMaxNum(int i, int j)\r\n\r\nBased on this your test code should look something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\npublic class ProgrammingProject4Test {\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testFindMaxNumFirst() {\r\n    // Arrange\r\n    ProgrammingProject4 programmingProject4 = new ProgrammingProject4();\r\n    \r\n    // Act and Assert\r\n    assertEquals(&quot;First number should be bigger than second&quot;,2, programmingProject4.findMaxNum(1,2));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testFindMaxNumSecond() {\r\n    // Arrange\r\n    ProgrammingProject4 programmingProject4 = new ProgrammingProject4();\r\n    \r\n    // Act and Assert\r\n    assertEquals(&quot;Second number should be bigger,2, programmingProject4.findMaxNum(2,1));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCouple of things to note from your code:\r\n\r\n1. You are missing the annotations for the testing framework e.g. @Test. This means your build tool won&#39;t be able to find and run the tests.\r\n2. You have the expected result after the result from the method. In JUnit asserts they should be the other way (as per my example).\r\n3. Your code runs two tests in one method. This is bad practice because it makes debugging the tests harder. Also if the first assert fails the second one won&#39;t be run. Therefore splitting the two tests into two different methods is better.\r\n\r\nYou can take a look at Diffblue&#39;s playground (full disclosure I work for Diffblue), this is a tool that will write unit tests for a small sample piece of Java code. https://playground.diffblue.com\r\n\r\nHope this all makes sense. There are quite a few points in the answer.

is an existing client-server application A which is out of my control. Server side is horizontally scalable and uses cisco load balancer which is configured to use cookies as a primary persistence policy and source IP as a secondary one. Balancing algoritm is Least Connections.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m writing a new client-server application B which have to use WCF service of application A. I cache cookies received from A per my user session and send them back to avoid jumping of user session between nodes. But at the same time I need fully utilize all nodes of application A. Currently it&#39;s always linked to a single node of A because initially fallback rule by source IP links application B server to a particular node of A (initial requests don&#39;t have cookies and some initialization requests go without user context at all). Even if I make B also horizontally scalable still there is no guarantee of full utilization as if when my application starts one of B nodes has least connections all my nodes can be linked to a single B node. Also for application A balancer connections from A end users and application B have the same weight what also can cause disbalance.\r\n\r\nSounds for me as a regular scenario but I really can&#39;t find any solution which will not require changes at application A load balancer.\r\n\r\nThanks in

have a `WPF` application using `LiveCharts` where I plot a `LineGraph` with X-Axis being `DateTime`. My end goal here is to achieve a &#39;two-way&#39; zoom. That is, I have two `DateTimePicker` controls (from [WPF Toolkit][1]) on my application that represent the minimum and maximum `DateTime` of the _currently displayed area_ of the graph, and if I use scroll wheel on the graph area to zoom in/out, the updated range should be reflected on the said controls, and (this is the part I&#39;m struggling with) conversely, if I set min/max on the `DateTimePicker` controls, the graph should zoom in/out accordingly.\r\n\r\nMy `XAML` is pretty simple:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Grid&gt;\r\n        &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\r\n            &lt;RowDefinition/&gt;\r\n            &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\r\n        &lt;lvc:CartesianChart Name=&quot;MyChart&quot;\r\n                            Series=&quot;{Binding SeriesCollection}&quot;\r\n                            Zoom=&quot;X&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;lvc:CartesianChart.AxisX&gt;\r\n                &lt;lvc:Axis LabelFormatter=&quot;{Binding Formatter}&quot;\r\n                          PreviewRangeChangedCommand=&quot;{Binding XRangeChangedCommand}&quot;\r\n                          MinValue=&quot;{Binding TimeStampMin, Mode=TwoWay}&quot;\r\n                          MaxValue=&quot;{Binding TimeStampMax, Mode=TwoWay}&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;/lvc:CartesianChart.AxisX&gt;\r\n        &lt;/lvc:CartesianChart&gt;\r\n        &lt;StackPanel Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;xceed:DateTimePicker Margin=&quot;4&quot; Width=&quot;160&quot; Name=&quot;dtpMinX&quot;\r\n                                  Format=&quot;Custom&quot; FormatString=&quot;yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss&quot;\r\n                                  Value=&quot;{Binding TimeStampMin, Mode=TwoWay}&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;xceed:DateTimePicker Margin=&quot;4&quot; Width=&quot;160&quot; Name=&quot;dtpMaxX&quot;\r\n                                  Format=&quot;Custom&quot; FormatString=&quot;yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss&quot;\r\n                                  Value=&quot;{Binding TimeStampMax, Mode=TwoWay}&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Grid&gt;\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my `DataPoint` class:\r\n\r\n    public class DataPoint\r\n    {\r\n        public DataPoint() { }\r\n\r\n        public DataPoint(DateTime timeStamp, double value)\r\n        {\r\n            TimeStamp = timeStamp;\r\n            Value = value;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public double Value { get; set; }\r\n        public DateTime TimeStamp { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s my `PlotGraph()` method that does all the plotting work. I&#39;ll include my entire `MainWindow()` code at the bottom of this post if you want to reproduce this application.\r\n\r\n    private void PlotGraph()\r\n    {\r\n        var mapper = Mappers.Xy&lt;DataPoint&gt;()\r\n            .X(dp =&gt; dp.TimeStamp.Ticks)\r\n            .Y(dp =&gt; dp.Value);\r\n        SeriesCollection = new SeriesCollection(mapper);\r\n\r\n        var lineSeries = new LineSeries\r\n        {\r\n            Values = DataPoints.AsChartValues(),\r\n            Fill = Brushes.Transparent\r\n        };\r\n        SeriesCollection.Add(lineSeries);\r\n\r\n        TimeStampMin = DataPoints.FirstOrDefault().TimeStamp;\r\n        TimeStampMax = DataPoints.LastOrDefault().TimeStamp;\r\n\r\n        Formatter = value =&gt; new DateTime((long)value).ToString(&quot;MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss&quot;);\r\n\r\n        DataContext = this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow when I run this and zoom in/out using mouse, the updated end value of my time stamps will be reflected on the `DateTimePicker` controls just fine. However if I try to set the value in the `DateTimePicker` controls in order to zoom in/out, it won&#39;t co-operate. When I try, in my `Output` window, I get the following two binding related error messages:\r\n\r\n&gt; System.Windows.Data Error: 5 : Value produced by BindingExpression is\r\n&gt; not valid for target property.; Value=&#39;10/09/2019 15:50:41&#39;\r\n&gt; BindingExpression:Path=TimeStampMin; DataItem=&#39;MainWindow&#39; (Name=&#39;&#39;);\r\n&gt; target element is &#39;Axis&#39; (Name=&#39;&#39;); target property is &#39;MinValue&#39;\r\n&gt; (type &#39;Double&#39;) \r\n\r\n&gt; System.Windows.Data Error: 5 : Value produced by\r\n&gt; BindingExpression is not valid for target property.; Value=&#39;10/09/2019\r\n&gt; 16:00:54&#39; BindingExpression:Path=TimeStampMax; DataItem=&#39;MainWindow&#39;\r\n&gt; (Name=&#39;&#39;); target element is &#39;Axis&#39; (Name=&#39;&#39;); target property is\r\n&gt; &#39;MaxValue&#39; (type &#39;Double&#39;)\r\n\r\nThis tells me that the problem is in binding, that `Axis.MinValue` and `Axis.MaxValue` are expecting a double whereas my `TimeStampMin` and `TimeStampMax` are, obviously, `DateTime` objects. How would I do the conversion so that I can achieve the two-way zoom?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[Here][2] is my entire `MainWindow` code if you want to reproduce it. I&#39;m using `MVVMLight` toolkit for commands etc., so you might have to get the `NuGet` package if you want to run this as is.\r\n\r\nLooks like some people can&#39;t access the link so here&#39;s the full code:\r\n\r\n    public partial class MainWindow : Window, INotifyPropertyChanged\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;\r\n    \tprotected virtual void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tPropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic SeriesCollection SeriesCollection\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tget;\r\n    \t\tset;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Func&lt;double, string&gt;

So it&#39;s technically an XY problem, but I&#39;ll still take a direct answer to the question as stated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I ended up doing:\r\n\r\n 1. Separate the speed-critical section into its own function, and prevent it from inlining:\r\n-\r\n\r\n```C\r\nvoid __attribute__((noinline)) _fast_function(uint8_t arg1, uint8_t arg2)\r\n{\r\n    //start speed-critical section\r\n    SYNC_TO_TIMER();\r\n    MINIMAL_SPEED_CRITICAL_CODE(arg1, arg2);\r\n    //end speed-critical section\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid normal_function(void)\r\n{\r\n    if (READY)\r\n    {\r\n        ACKNOWLEDGE();\r\n\r\n        SETUP_PART1();\r\n        SETUP_PART2();  //determines arg1, arg2\r\n\r\n        _fast_function(arg1, arg2);\r\n\r\n        CLEANUP();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat keeps the speed-critical stuff together, and by itself.  It also adds some overhead, but that happens OUTSIDE the fast part, where I can afford it.\r\n\r\n 2. Manually unroll some loops:\r\n-\r\nThe original code was something like this:\r\n```C\r\nuint8_t data[3];\r\n\r\nuint8_t byte_num = 3;\r\nwhile(byte_num)\r\n{\r\n    byte_num--;\r\n\r\n    uint8_t bit_mask = 0b10000000;\r\n    while(bit_mask)\r\n    {\r\n        if(data[byte_num] &amp; bit_mask)   WEIRD_OUTPUT_1();\r\n        else                            WEIRD_OUTPUT_0();\r\n\r\n        bit_mask &gt;&gt;= 1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe new code is like this:\r\n```C\r\n#define WEIRD_OUTPUT(byte,bit)                  \\\r\n    do                                          \\\r\n    {                                           \\\r\n        if((byte) &amp; (bit))  WEIRD_OUTPUT_1();   \\\r\n        else                WEIRD_OUTPUT_0();   \\\r\n    } while(0)\r\n\r\nuint8_t data[3];\r\n\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b10000000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b01000000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b00100000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b00010000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b00001000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b00000100);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b00000010);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[2],0b00000001);\r\n\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b10000000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b01000000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b00100000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b00010000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b00001000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b00000100);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b00000010);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[1],0b00000001);\r\n\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b10000000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b01000000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b00100000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b00010000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b00001000);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b00000100);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b00000010);\r\nWEIRD_OUTPUT(data[0],0b00000001);\r\n```\r\nIn addition to dropping the loop code itself, this also replaces an array index with a direct access, and a variable with a constant, each of which offers its own speedup.\r\n\r\nAnd it still barely fits in the time available.  **But it does fit!**  :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313255/speed-critical-section-in-gcc/58360457#58360457","title":"Speed-critical section in gcc?"}],"owner":{"reputation":281,"user_id":3491308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcfe857493736292ab775e24896ecbf3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AaronD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3491308/aarond"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570938827,"creation_date":1570661349,"question_id":58313255,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313255","body_markdown":"I&#39;m already using `-O3`, so I don&#39;t think I can do much better in general, but the generated assembly is still a tight fit for the timing requirements.  Is there a way to, for example, tell `avr-gcc` to keep non-speed-critical code out of a speed-critical section?\r\n\r\n```C\r\nif (READY)\r\n{\r\n    ACKNOWLEDGE();\r\n\r\n    SETUP_PART1();\r\n    SETUP_PART2();\r\n\r\n    //start speed-critical section\r\n    SYNC_TO_TIMER();\r\n    MINIMAL_SPEED_CRITICAL_CODE();\r\n    //end speed-critical section\r\n\r\n    CLEANUP();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nA tedious reading of the `-O3`-optimized assembly listing (`.lss` file) shows that `SETUP_PART2();` has been reordered to come between `SYNC_TO_TIMER();` and `MINIMAL_SPEED_CRITICAL_CODE();`.  That&#39;s a problem because it adds time spent in the speed-critical section that doesn&#39;t need to exist.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want to make the critical section itself any longer than it needs to be, so I&#39;m hesitant to relax the optimization.  (the same action that causes this problem may also be what makes the final version fit inside the time available)  So how can I tell it that &quot;this behavior&quot; needs to stay pure and uncluttered, but still optimize it fully?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used inline assembly before, so I&#39;m sure I could figure out again how to communicate between that and C without completely tying up or clobbering registers, etc.  But I&#39;d much rather stick with 100% C if I can, and let the compiler figure out how not to run over itself.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313255/speed-critical-section-in-gcc","title":"Speed-critical section in gcc?"},{"tags":["python","node.js","pyarrow","apache-arrow"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62981,"user_id":776560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c08a3eed709a9d1a2654cea45aa466f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Wes McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/776560/wes-mckinney"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570717772,"post_id":58313254,"comment_id":103009095,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313254/converted-apache-arrow-file-from-data-frame-gives-null-while-reading-with-arrow#comment103009095_58313254"},{"owner":{"reputation":6229,"user_id":403133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6286403e3f08bfc14dae6e781bd26a82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sarath","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/403133/sarath"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62981,"user_id":776560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c08a3eed709a9d1a2654cea45aa466f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Wes McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/776560/wes-mckinney"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570734632,"post_id":58313254,"comment_id":103017257,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313254/converted-apache-arrow-file-from-data-frame-gives-null-while-reading-with-arrow#comment103017257_58313254"},{"owner":{"reputation":3437,"user_id":109525,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1TSBj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arthur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/109525/arthur"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571214770,"post_id":58313254,"comment_id":103161806,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313254/converted-apache-arrow-file-from-data-frame-gives-null-while-reading-with-arrow#comment103161806_58313254"},{"owner":{"reputation":163,"user_id":9217240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f76c1c3ae07789c5c064969632028ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joe Quigley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9217240/joe-quigley"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62981,"user_id":776560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c08a3eed709a9d1a2654cea45aa466f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Wes McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/776560/wes-mckinney"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571257557,"post_id":58313254,"comment_id":103184593,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313254/converted-apache-arrow-file-from-data-frame-gives-null-while-reading-with-arrow#comment103184593_58313254"},{"owner":{"reputation":163,"user_id":9217240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f76c1c3ae07789c5c064969632028ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joe Quigley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9217240/joe-quigley"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571332556,"post_id":58313254,"comment_id":103215378,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313254/converted-apache-arrow-file-from-data-frame-gives-null-while-reading-with-arrow#comment103215378_58313254"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":163,"user_id":9217240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f76c1c3ae07789c5c064969632028ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joe Quigley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9217240/joe-quigley"},"last_editor":{"reputation":163,"user_id":9217240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f76c1c3ae07789c5c064969632028ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joe Quigley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9217240/joe-quigley"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571417544,"last_edit_date":1571417544,"creation_date":1571336634,"answer_id":58438662,"question_id":58313254,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58438662","body_markdown":"This is due to a format change in Arrow 0.15, as [mentioned by Wes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6921?focusedCommentId=16953979&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16953979) on the Apache JIRA.

If you can&#39;t update for some reason, you can instead use one of the workarounds below:\r\n\r\nPass `use_legacy_format=True` as a kwarg to `RecordBatchFileWriter`:\r\n\r\n```lang-py\r\nwith pa.RecordBatchFileWriter(&#39;file.arrow&#39;, table.schema, use_legacy_format=True) as writer:\r\n    writer.write_table(table)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet the environment variable `ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT` to 1:\r\n\r\n```lang-bash\r\n$ export ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT = 1\r\n$ python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyarrow as pa\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; table = pa.Table.from_pydict( {&quot;a&quot;: [1, 2, 3], &quot;b&quot;: [4, 5, 6]} )\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with pa.RecordBatchFileWriter(&#39;file.arrow&#39;, table.schema) as writer:\r\n...   writer.write_table(table)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr downgrade PyArrow to `0.14.x`:\r\n\r\n```lang-bash\r\n$ conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow=0.14.1\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313254/converted-apache-arrow-file-from-data-frame-gives-null-while-reading-with-arrow/58438662#58438662","title":"Converted apache arrow file from data frame gives null while reading with arrow.js"}],"owner":{"reputation":6229,"user_id":403133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6286403e3f08bfc14dae6e781bd26a82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sarath","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/403133/sarath"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6229,"user_id":403133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6286403e3f08bfc14dae6e781bd26a82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sarath","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/403133/sarath"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":84,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58438662,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1571417544,"creation_date":1570661319,"last_edit_date":1570706192,"question_id":58313254,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313254","body_markdown":"I converted one sample dataframe to `.arrow` file using `pyarrow`\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [10, 2, 3]})\r\n    df[&#39;a&#39;] = pd.to_numeric(df[&#39;a&#39;],errors=&#39;coerce&#39;)\r\n    table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\n    writer = pa.RecordBatchFileWriter(&#39;test.arrow&#39;, table.schema)\r\n    writer.write_table(table)\r\n    writer.close()\r\nThis creates a file `test.arrow`\r\n\r\n    df.info()\r\n        &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt;\r\n        RangeIndex: 3 entries, 0 to 2\r\n        Data columns (total 1 columns):\r\n        a    3 non-null int64\r\n        dtypes: int64(1)\r\n        memory usage: 104.0 bytes\r\n\r\nThen in NodeJS I load the file with arrowJS.\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/\r\n\r\n    const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\r\n    const arrow = require(&#39;apache-arrow&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    const data = fs.readFileSync(&#39;test.arrow&#39;);\r\n    const table = arrow.Table.from(data);\r\n    \r\n    console.log(table.schema.fields.map(f =&gt; f.name));\r\n    console.log(table.count());\r\n    console.log(table.get(0));\r\n\r\nThis prints like\r\n\r\n    [ &#39;a&#39; ]\r\n    0\r\n    null\r\n\r\nI was expecting this table will have a length 3 and `table.get(0)` gives the first row instead of `null`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the table scehem looks like `console.log(table._schema)`\r\n\r\n    [ Int_ [Int] { isSigned: true, bitWidth: 16 } ]\r\n    Schema {\r\n      fields:\r\n       [ Field { name: &#39;a&#39;, type: [Int_], nullable: true, metadata: Map {} } ],\r\n      metadata:\r\n       Map {\r\n         &#39;pandas&#39; =&gt; &#39;{&quot;index_columns&quot;: [{&quot;kind&quot;: &quot;range&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: null, &quot;start&quot;: 0, &quot;stop&quot;: 5, &quot;step&quot;: 1}], &quot;column_indexes&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;: null, &quot;field_name&quot;: null, &quot;pandas_type&quot;: &quot;unicode&quot;, &quot;numpy_type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;metadata&quot;: {&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;UTF-8&quot;}}], &quot;columns&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;field_name&quot;: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;pandas_type&quot;: &quot;int16&quot;, &quot;numpy_type&quot;: &quot;int16&quot;, &quot;metadata&quot;: null}], &quot;creator&quot;: {&quot;library&quot;: &quot;pyarrow&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.15.0&quot;}, &quot;pandas_version&quot;: &quot;0.22.0&quot;}&#39; },\r\n      dictionaries: Map {} }\r\n\r\nAny idea why it is not getting the data as expected?

There are no ghosts or capsules, only a maze and the &#39;fruit&#39;. I am having trouble, however, understanding the relationship between my heuristic function and my cost function.\r\n\r\nAs per the project, when defining the search problem, we need to specify a step cost that derives from: \r\n`score = -Nb Steps + 10*NbOfEatenDots + 200*NbOfEatenGhosts + (-500*isLoss) + (500*isWin)`\r\nThis cost is supposed to be always positive and so, for simplicity, I have decided to take: `1.5 - (0.5*AteAFoodDot)`. I have ignored ghosts and capsules since they do not exist and I have given a preferential score for moves tht end up eating a dot. I have also ignored steps that result in a loss (since they do not exist) and steps that result in a win state.\r\n\r\nNow as far as the A* algorithm itself is concerned, we have to implement a cost function and a heuristic function of our own:\r\n\r\nAs a cost function I have chosen: `Cost = sum(step costs to current state)` and as a heuristic: `h = Manhattan distance between pacman and the dot closest to him + manhattan distance of this dot and another dot that is furthest away from it, as long as it exists`, which is an admissible heuristic. I have also implemented this heuristic using real maze distances instead of manhattan distances, but this seemed too time consuming for mazes with many food dots.\r\n\r\nNow if I have understood correctly if `g(n)` is my cost function and `h(n)` my heuristic, I must always have: `g(n to goal) &gt;= h(n)` so that A* always returns an optimal path and the closest the values of `g` and `h` for a node n, the less nodes will be expanded. \r\n\r\nIn this respect, is it not in my interest to ignore how the score is computed, ignore the fact that a step results in eating a food dot or not and simply take `step_cost = 1` for all steps?\r\n\r\nThis is how I obtain the best results with respect to computation time and nodes expanded, but ignoring the cost function of the game seems wrong.\r\n\r\nCould someone clarify this for me? Is it a matter of rpeference/choice or is there an objective correct answer/best approach?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313250/pacman-ai-project-suitable-of-combination-of-step-cost-and-heuristic","title":"Pacman ai project - Suitable of combination of step cost and heuristic"},{"tags":["type-conversion","file-format"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6567920,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LlVF-1-5qlM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/mlMCMzIxx1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Srikanth Kuppa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6567920/srikanth-kuppa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570661285,"creation_date":1570661285,"question_id":58313248,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313248","body_markdown":"with my own thinking, I could not get an algorithmic perspective of converting a csv file to xlsx. it means, even though I got a piece of code for this requirement, I do not think I can use that code and write a code to convert a text file into xlsx or xls or some other format. \r\n\r\nI got a requirement where I have an input csv file and I need to convert to xlsx.

So for an element like the one below\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;p id=&quot;ex1&quot;  style=&quot;display:none&quot; &gt;The Chop’s popularity in Atlanta won’t soon abate, and even breaks out spontaneously when the Braves rally on the road (often to the irritation of the home team’s fans).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[This result should look like this][1]\r\n\r\nThis is what I came up by my own so far on the splitting and sorting part for one element:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;p id=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p id=&quot;ex1&quot;  style=&quot;display:none&quot; &gt;{{Ex1}}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nvar g1 = document.getElementById(&quot;ex1&quot;).textContent; ;\r\nvar g2=g1.split(&quot; &quot;);\r\nvar gx = g2.length;\r\nvar g3 = [];\r\nif (gx &lt;= 4) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 1){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 1));}}\r\n\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 8) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 2) { g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 2));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 12) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 3){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 3));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 16) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 4){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 4));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 20) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 5){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 5));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 24) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 6){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 6));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 28) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 7){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 7));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 32) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 8){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 8));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 36) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 9){ g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 9));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 40) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 10){g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 10));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 44) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 11){g3.push (g2.slice(i, i +11));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 48) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 12){g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 12));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 52) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 13){g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 13));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 56) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 14){g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 14));}}\r\nelse if (gx &lt;= 60) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 15){g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 15));}}\r\nelse if (gx &gt; 60) {for(var i = 0; i &lt; g2.length; i += 20){g3.push (g2.slice(i, i + 20));}}\r\n\r\n(function () {\r\n  // First sort the array\r\n  g3.sort();\r\n  // Then reverse it:\r\n  g3.reverse(&quot; &quot;);\r\n})();\r\n\r\nvar g4 = &quot;&quot;\r\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; g3.length; i++) {\r\n     g4 = g4 + &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; + g3[i] + &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;\r\n }\r\n\r\nvar g5 = g4.replace(/\\,/g, &#39;\t&#39;);\r\n document.getElementById(&quot;demo&quot;).innerHTML = g5;\r\n\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is my raw idea for randomly display element ex1:\r\n```\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nvar today = new Date();\r\nvar random = today.getMinutes()%3 + 1\r\nif (today.getHours() &lt;= 4) {\r\n random -= 1\r\n}\r\nif (random == 1) {\r\n $(&#39;#demo&#39;).show()\r\n} else if (random == 2) {\r\n $(&#39;#demo2&#39;).show()\r\n} else {\r\n $(&#39;#demo3&#39;).show()\r\n}\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question would be how to scale these approaches for an infinite (actually up to 8) number of elements and their sentences like \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;p id=&quot;ex1&quot;  style=&quot;display:none&quot; &gt;The Chop’s popularity in Atlanta won’t soon abate, and even breaks out spontaneously when the Braves rally on the road (often to the irritation of the home team’s fans).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p id=&quot;ex2&quot;  style=&quot;display:none&quot; &gt;The Chop’s popularity in Atlanta won’t soon abate, and even breaks out spontaneously when the Braves rally on the road (often to the irritation of the home team’s fans).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p id=&quot;ex3&quot;  style=&quot;display:none&quot; &gt;But his attitude of sullen grievance and simmering fury never abated fully&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Clustering them by class (e.g. class=examples) and then loop through each of them? \r\nOne really important condition for any approach would be, that if the randomly selected element doesn&#39;t have content (sentence) another element(sentence) should be displayed. Besides that an approach without jQuery would be perfect.\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated.

The literature sucks.\r\n\r\nAs best I can tell, the core ideas of implementing solutions using domain driven design came out of the world of Java circa 2003.  So the patterns described by Evans in chapters 5 and six of the blue book were understood to be object oriented (in the Java sense) domain modeling done right.\r\n\r\nChapter 6, which discusses the aggregate pattern, is specifically about life cycle management; how do you create new entities in the domain model, how does the application find the right entity to interact with, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd so we have `Factories`, that allow you to create instances of domain entities, and `Repositories`, that provide an abstraction for retrieving a reference to a domain entity.\r\n\r\nBut there&#39;s a third riddle, which is this: what happens when you have some rule in your domain that requires synchronization between two entities in the domain?  If you allow applications to talk to the entities in an uncoordinated fashion, then you may end up with inconsistencies in the data.\r\n\r\nSo the aggregate pattern is an answer to that; we organize the coordinated entities into graphs.  With respect to change (and storage), the graph of entities becomes a single unit that the application is allowed to interact with.\r\n\r\nThe notion of the aggregate root is that the interface between the application and the graph should be one of the members of the graph.  So the application shares information with the root entity, and then the root entity shares that information with the other members of the aggregate.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate root, being the entry point into the aggregate, plays the role of a coarse grained lock, ensuring that all of the changes to the aggregate members happen together.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not entirely wrong to think of this as a form of encapsulation -- to the application, the aggregate looks like a single entity (the root), with the rest of the complexity of the aggregate being hidden from view.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, over the past 15 years, there&#39;s been some semantic drift; people trying to adapt the pattern in ways that it better fits their problems, or better fits their preferred designs.  So you have to exercise some care in designing how to translate the labels that they are using.

To me this is the most important point.  One AR cannot contain another AR but can reference it by `Id` or some value object (VO) containing at least the `Id` of the referenced AR.  I tend to prefer to have an AR contain only other VOs instead of entities (YMMV).  To this end the AR is responsible for consistency and variants w.r.t. the AR.  Each VO can have its own invariants such as an `EMailAddress` requiring a valid e-mail format.  Even if one were to call contained classes entities I will call that semantics since one could get the same thing done with a VO.  A repository is responsible for AR persistence.\r\n\r\nThe example implementation you linked to is not something I would do or recommend.  I followed some of the comments and I too, as one commenter alluded to, would rather use a domain service to perform something like a `Transfer` between two accounts.  The registration of the transfer is not something that may necessarily be permitted and, as such, the domain service would be required to ensure the validity of the transfer.  In fact, the registration of a transfer request would probably be a `Journal` in an accounting sense as that is my experience.  Once the journal is approved it may attempt the actual transfer.\r\n\r\nAt some point in my DDD journey I thought that there has to be something wrong since it shouldn&#39;t be so difficult to understand aggregates.  There are many opinions and interpretations w.r.t. to DDD and aggregates which is why it can get confusing.  The other aspect is, in IMHO, that there is a fair amount of design involved that requires some creativity and which is based on an understanding of the domain itself.  Creativity cannot be taught and design falls into the realm of tacit knowledge.  The popular example of tacit knowledge is learning to ride a bike.  Now, we can read all we want about how to ride a bike and it may or may not help much.  Once we are on the bike and we teach *ourselves* to balance then we can make progress.  Then there are people who end up doing absolutely *crazy* things on a bike and even if I read how to I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll try :)\r\n\r\nKeep practicing and modelling until it starts to make sense or until you feel comfortable with the model.  If I recall correctly Eric Evans mentions in the Blue Book that it may take a couple of designs to get the model closer to what we need.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313234/what-is-an-aggregate-root/58316336#58316336","title":"What is an Aggregate

in mind that Mike Mogosanu is using a event sourcing approach but in any case (without ES) his approach is very good to avoid unwanted artifacts in mainstream OOP languages.\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. How can it be that the function is an AR, if there must be a globaly unique identifier to it, and there isn&#39;t, reason being that\r\n&gt; its a function. what does have a globaly unique identifier is the\r\n&gt; Domain Event that this function produces.\r\n\r\n`TransferNumber` acts as natural unique ID; there is also a GUID to avoid the need a full Value Object in some cases.\r\n\r\nThere is no unique ID state in the computer memory because it is an argument but think about it; why you want a globaly unique ID? It is just to locate the root element and its (non unique ID) childrens for persistence purposes (find, modify or delete it).\r\n\r\nOrder A has 2 order lines (1 and 2) while Order B has 4 order lines (1,2,3,4); the unique identifier of order lines is a composition of its ID and the Order ID: A1, B3, etc. It is just like relational schemas in relational databases.\r\n\r\nSo you need that ID just for persistence and the element that goes to persistence is a domain event expressing the changes; all the changes needed to keep consistency, so if you persist the domain event using the global unique ID to find in persistence what you have to modify the system will be in a consistent state.\r\n\r\nYou could do \r\n\r\n    var newTransfer = New Transfer(TransferNumber); //newTransfer is now an AG with a global unique ID\r\n    var changes = t.RegisterTransfer(Debit debit, Credit credit)\r\n    persistence.applyChanges(changes);\r\n\r\nbut what is the point of instantiate a object to create state in the computer memory if you are not going to do more than one thing with this object? It is pointless and most of OOP detractors use this kind of bad OOP design to criticize OOP and lean to functional programming.\r\n\r\n&gt; 2. Following question - How does an Aggregate Root looks like in code? is it the event? is it the entity that is returned? is it the function\r\n&gt; of the Aggregate class itself?\r\n\r\nIt is the function itself. You can read in the post: \r\n\r\n&gt; AR is a role , and the function is the implementation.\r\n\r\nAn Aggregate represents a single unit of work, meaning it has to be consistent. You can see how the function honors this. It is a single unit of work that keeps the system in a consistent state.\r\n\r\n&gt; 3. In the case that the Domain Event that the function returns is the AR (As stated that it has to have that globaly unique identifier),\r\n&gt; then how can we interact with this Aggregate? the first article\r\n&gt; clearly stated that all interaction with an Aggregate is by the AR, if\r\n&gt; the AR is an event, then we can do nothing but react on it.\r\n\r\nAnswered above because the domain event is not the AR.\r\n\r\n&gt; 4 Is it right to say that the aggregate has two main jobs: Apply the\r\n&gt; needed changes based on the input it received and rules it knows\r\n&gt; Return the needed data to be persisted from AR and/or need to be\r\n&gt; raised in a Domain Event from the AR\r\n\r\nYes; again, you can see how the static function honors this.\r\n\r\nYou could try to contat [Mike Mogosanu][1].

All interaction with an Aggregate is via the Aggregate Root. As such, an Aggregate Root MUST have a globally unique identifier within the system. Other Entites that are present in the Aggregate but are not Aggregate Roots require only a locally unique identifier, that is, an Id that is unique within the Aggregate.\r\n\r\nBut then, in [this](http://blog.sapiensworks.com/post/2016/07/14/DDD-Aggregate-Decoded-3) example I can see that an Aggregate Root is implemented by a static class called `Transfer` that acts as an Aggregate and a static function inside called `TransferedRegistered` that acts as an AR.\r\n\r\nSo the questions are:\r\n\r\n 1. How can it be that the function is an AR, if there must be a globaly unique identifier to it, and there isn&#39;t, reason being that its a function. what does have a globaly unique identifier is the Domain Event that this function produces.\r\n 2.

I don&#39;t like the &quot;file&quot; approach. Eg. ffmpeg is creating an `out.264` file which grows. Ideally it would simply send the stream to the RTSP server via some protocol.\r\n\r\nc. live555MediaServer just sucks\r\n\r\nIt looks like there is a way to run vlc server on my server as well, but I cannot figure out how to make ffmpeg feed the vlc server?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313227/streaming-from-generated-images-using-ffmpeg-vlc-live555","title":"streaming from generated images using ffmpeg / vlc / live555"},{"tags":["heroku","dns"],"owner":{"reputation":160,"user_id":9815465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/537d9345d5e65f148fded4749896c83a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"27mdmo7sn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9815465/27mdmo7sn"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570661096,"creation_date":1570661096,"question_id":58313224,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313224","body_markdown":"I successfully pointed my custom domain to my heroku app\r\n\r\nso https://appName.herokuapp.com became accessible through appName.com\r\n\r\nbut now the app still exist through https://appName.herokuapp.com\r\n\r\nhow to ban this subdomain , to make my app accessible through my custom domain only?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313224/how-to-ban-the-herokuapp-subdomain","title":"How to ban the herokuapp subdomain?"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","inheritance","orm"],"owner":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570711241,"creation_date":1570661061,"last_edit_date":1570711241,"question_id":58313222,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313222","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve read Fowler&#39;s patterns which allows to decide how to map objects hierarchy to the RDBMS and found 3 options.\r\n\r\nlet&#39;s say we have following hieararchy\r\n\r\n    absract class Parent{...}\r\n\r\n    class Child extends Parent{....}\r\n\r\n    class GrandChild extends Child {....}\r\n\r\n1.[Class Table Inheritance][1] - we will have 3 tables: fot `Parent` and `Child` and `GrandChild`  \r\n2.[Single Table Inheritance][2] -  we will have single table with all fields in hierarchy (for Parent and Child and GrandChild at this case)  \r\n3.

There is also the type Action in front of it which I believe is what I am trying to grasp 100%\r\n\r\nie. `public async System.Threading.Tasks.Task QBOApiCall(Action&lt;ServiceContext&gt; apiCallFunction) {`\r\n\r\nThe code that calls the QBOApiCall Method is:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Action&lt;ServiceContext&gt; apiCallFunction = new Action&lt;ServiceContext&gt;(CreateNewCustomer);\r\n        await _services QBOApiCall(apiCallFunction);\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parameter apiCallFunction which was passed into QBOApiCall is then called with it&#39;s own parameter at the end of the QBOApiCall Method.\r\n\r\n```\r\nServiceContext context = new ServiceContext(token.RealmId, IntuitServicesType.QBO, reqValidator,configurationProvider);\r\n                       \r\napiCallFunction(context); \r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand Overloading is taking place and I know apiCallFunction is translated to CreateNewCustomer(context) at the end of the QBOApiCall method but I don&#39;t understand how or what terminology is used to research this.\r\n\r\nHow does apiCallFunction become CreateNewCustomer? Is it that a method can be passed as a parameter without issue just like a string or integer?\r\n\r\n**Edit** \r\nMy question then is if the Action Delegate is permitting this to happen?

The product category links are in dropdowns (or expandable) elements on the webpage. I&#39;m using PyQt5 to emulate a client before extracting the html and converting it to text with Beautiful Soup.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you were visiting the site on your browser, you would have to click a button near the top-left corner of the page to open a category list that pops out from the left side of the screen (I will refer to this as the &quot;side-bar&quot;). Within each of those categories, when clicked, there is a list of more specific categories, each with a link that I am trying to acquire with my code (I will refer to these as &quot;sub-categories&quot;).\r\n\r\nThe initial category list elements come up in my Beautiful Soup even if the side-bar is hidden, but the sub-category elements remain hidden unless the sub-category header expanded (thus, they don&#39;t show up on my soup). I have confirmed this by inspecting elements in a Chrome browser manually. Here is a snippet of the webpage HTML with my own comments to help explain:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div aria-label=&quot;Fruits &amp;amp; Vegetables&quot; data-automation-id=&quot;taxonomy-toggle-Fruits &amp;amp; Vegetables&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;button aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; class=&quot;NavSection__sectionBtn___1_cAs&quot; data- \r\n       automation-id=&quot;nav-section-toggle&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt; #Initial category that contains sub-categories\r\n      &lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt; #Contains the links I need, but doesn&#39;t populate HTML text unless sub-category element is expanded\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how it looks if the sub-category element has been expanded:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div aria-label=&quot;Fruits &amp;amp; Vegetables&quot; data-automation-id=&quot;taxonomy-toggle-Fruits &amp;amp; Vegetables&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;button aria-disabled=&quot;true&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;NavSection__sectionBtn___1_cAs&quot; data- \r\n           automation-id=&quot;nav-section-toggle&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt; #Initial category that contains sub-categories\r\n          &lt;/button&gt;\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n             &lt;ul class&gt;\r\n               &lt;li class = &quot;NavSection__sectionLink__rbr40&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\r\n               &lt;li class = &quot;NavSection__sectionLink__rbr40&gt; &lt;/li&gt; #can open each li element up to acquire href link\r\n               &lt;li class = &quot;NavSection__sectionLink__rbr40&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\r\n             &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s my code:\r\n\r\n    import bs4 as bs\r\n    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication\r\n    from PyQt5.QtCore import QUrl\r\n    from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEnginePage\r\n    \r\n    #act as a client via Qt5 to acquire javascript elements from webpage\r\n    class Page(QWebEnginePage):\r\n    \r\n    \tdef __init__(self, url):\r\n    \t\tself.app = QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    \t\tQWebEnginePage.__init__(self)\r\n    \t\tself.html = &#39;&#39;\r\n    \t\tself.loadFinished.connect(self._on_load_finished)\r\n    \t\tself.load(QUrl(url))\r\n    \t\tself.app.exec_()\r\n    \r\n    \tdef _on_load_finished(self):\r\n    \t\tself.html = self.toHtml(self.callable)\r\n    \t\tprint(&quot;Load Finished&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    \tdef callable(self, html_str):\t\r\n    \t\tself.html = html_str\r\n    \t\tself.app.quit()\r\n    \r\n    page = Page(&quot;https://grocery.walmart.com&quot;)\r\n    soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(page.html, &#39;lxml&#39;)\r\n    print(soup.prettify())\r\n\r\nI know that if the `aria-expanded` and `aria-disabled` attributes of the `&lt;button&gt;` element are changed from &quot;False&quot; to &quot;True&quot; that the sub-category `&lt;li&gt;` elements will appear in the HTML. I confirmed this through manual inspection in Chrome browser.\r\n\r\nMy question is if it is possible to acquire the `href` from the `&lt;li&gt;` elements? My asumption is that I&#39;d have to edit the HTML to change the `aria` attributes from &quot;False&quot; to &quot;True&quot; after an initial parse and then re-parse the HTML with those changes. If not, is there any other method to get these elements from the webpage other than Selenium? I&#39;m trying to use a leaner approach (no opening of browser windows etc).\r\n\r\nI can provide the actual website URL and a screenshot of the webpage to help clarify, not sure if that&#39;s considered good practice or allowed on Stack Overflow (I&#39;m new here!).\r\n\r\nFor more background information on the method I&#39;m trying to use, see the following:\r\n\r\n[Sentdex&#39;s PyQt4 Dynamic Scraping Video][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[PyQt4 to PyQt5 library changes][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSH77vnOGqU\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42147601/pyqt4-to-pyqt5-mainframe-deprecated-need-fix-to-load-web-pages","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313185/pyqt5-qwebenginepage-possible-to-edit-the-html-to-open-dropdown","title":"PyQt5 QWebEnginePage - Possible to Edit the HTML to Open Dropdown?"},{"tags":["bootstrap-4","modal-dialog"],"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":11319591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb4c0b912f69245633e0937790ee0378?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ghostagent151","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11319591/ghostagent151"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570660763,"creation_date":1570660763,"question_id":58313184,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313184","body_markdown":"I have searched through previous SO posts regarding similar issues but none of the solutions put forth in those are working for this situation.\r\n\r\nI have one modal that opens when a user clicks on a button.

I have the following set up in a Swift file for for the main player:\r\n\r\n    import SpriteKit\r\n    \r\n    struct ColliderType {\r\n        static let Player: UInt32 = 1\r\n        static let Ground: UInt32 = 2\r\n        static let Collectables: UInt32 = 3\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class Player: SKSpriteNode {\r\n        \r\n        func initialize() {\r\n            \r\n            var walk = [SKTexture]()\r\n            \r\n            for i in 1...16 {\r\n                let name = &quot;Kidwalk\\(i)&quot;\r\n                walk.append(SKTexture(imageNamed: name))\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            let walkAnimation = SKAction.animate(with: walk, timePerFrame: 0.095, resize: true, restore: true)\r\n            \r\n            self.name = &quot;Player&quot;\r\n            self.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: self.size)\r\n            self.physicsBody?.affectedByGravity = true\r\n            self.physicsBody?.allowsRotation = false\r\n            self.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = ColliderType.Player\r\n            self.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = ColliderType.Ground | ColliderType.Collectables\r\n            self.position = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0)\r\n            self.zPosition = 5\r\n            self.run(SKAction.repeatForever(walkAnimation))\r\n            self.xScale = CGFloat(0.4)\r\n            self.yScale = CGFloat(0.4)\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        func jump() {\r\n            self.physicsBody?.velocity = CGVector(dx: 0, dy: 0)\r\n            self.physicsBody?.applyImpulse(CGVector(dx: 0, dy: 500))\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the main GameplayScene.swift file I have set up the following constant:\r\n\r\n    let phone = SKSpriteNode()\r\n\r\nAnd then I create the object as follows:\r\n\r\n    func createPhone() {\r\n         var ring = [SKTexture]()\r\n         \r\n         for i in 1...7 {\r\n         let name = &quot;phone\\(i)&quot;\r\n         ring.append(SKTexture(imageNamed: name))\r\n         }\r\n         \r\n         let ringAnimation = SKAction.animate(with: ring, timePerFrame: 0.095, resize: true, restore: true)\r\n         \r\n         phone.name = &quot;Phone&quot;\r\n         phone.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: CGSize(width: phone.size.width / 2, height: phone.size.height / 2))\r\n         phone.physicsBody?.affectedByGravity = true\r\n         phone.physicsBody?.allowsRotation = false\r\n         phone.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = ColliderType.Player\r\n         phone.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = ColliderType.Ground | ColliderType.Collectables\r\n         phone.position = CGPoint(x: 300, y: -50)\r\n         phone.zPosition = 5\r\n         phone.run(SKAction.repeatForever(ringAnimation))\r\n         phone.xScale = CGFloat(0.7)\r\n         phone.yScale = CGFloat(0.7)\r\n        \r\n            let move = SKAction.moveTo(x: -(self.frame.size.width * 2), duration: 15)\r\n    \r\n            let remove = SKAction.removeFromParent()\r\n            \r\n            let sequence = SKAction.sequence([move, remove])\r\n            \r\n            phone.run(sequence)\r\n            \r\n            addChild(phone)\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI am calling createPhone() in the didMove function at the top.\r\n\r\nAnd finally I have this setup for the collision detecting:\r\n\r\n    func didBegin(_ contact: SKPhysicsContact) {\r\n            var firstBody = SKPhysicsBody();\r\n            var secondBody = SKPhysicsBody();\r\n            \r\n            if contact.bodyA.node?.name == &quot;Player&quot; {\r\n                firstBody = contact.bodyA;\r\n                secondBody = contact.bodyB;\r\n            } else {\r\n                firstBody = contact.bodyB;\r\n                secondBody = contact.bodyA;\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            if firstBody.node?.name == &quot;Player&quot; &amp;&amp; secondBody.node?.name == &quot;Ground&quot; {\r\n                canJump = true;\r\n                print(&quot;canjump&quot;)\r\n            } else if firstBody.node?.name == &quot;Player&quot; &amp;&amp; secondBody.node?.name == &quot;Phone&quot; {\r\n                print(&quot;Collect)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nClearly there is something fundamentally wrong because the collision between the ground and the player is detected but the one between the phone and the player is not.\r\n\r\nI believe I have the struct set up correctly and I&#39;ve checked through the collision bit masks and categories of all the nodes and I cannot work out where I&#39;m going wrong.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313169/unable-to-detect-contact-of-skspritnode-swift-xcode","title":"Unable to detect contact of SKSpritNode (Swift Xcode)"},{"tags":["android","inetaddress"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":816527,"user_id":115145,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wDnd8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CommonsWare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570661025,"post_id":58313166,"comment_id":102987285,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313166/inetaddress-getbyname-stucks#comment102987285_58313166"},{"owner":{"reputation":270566,"user_id":207421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cfe5f7d64f44be04f147295f5c7b88e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user207421","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/207421/user207421"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570662610,"post_id":58313166,"comment_id":102987582,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313166/inetaddress-getbyname-stucks#comment102987582_58313166"},{"owner":{"reputation":182,"user_id":10034177,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-K3-VCiwvokM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAh4/iaS65kVBy7c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sami Tahri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10034177/sami-tahri"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570663082,"post_id":58313166,"comment_id":102987686,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313166/inetaddress-getbyname-stucks#comment102987686_58313166"}],"owner":{"reputation":5367,"user_id":1020704,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RpMk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"toom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020704/toom"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5367,"user_id":1020704,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RpMk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"toom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020704/toom"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570691146,"creation_date":1570660607,"last_edit_date":1570691146,"question_id":58313166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58313166","body_markdown":"I added the permissions \r\n\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot;
