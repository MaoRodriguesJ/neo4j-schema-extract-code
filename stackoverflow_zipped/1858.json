However, when I switch back after the hotfix is done to the current branch, and do a Maven update, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty well-known error based on some earlier stackoverflow questions I saw. Most answers you&#39;d find will say to [remove the entire `.settings` and `.project` files, and re-import the project](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19941737/1682559); or to [remove the `.metadata` of your workspace, and restart Eclipse](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24015976/1682559). In the past I remembered using [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35266937/1682559) of only deleting the `.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.e4.workbench/workbench.xmi` file of the workspace, so the damage to your Eclipse project settings is limited. However, it doesn&#39;t always work, and I&#39;m also getting a bit tired of getting this exception every single time I switch back and forth from a branch..\r\n\r\nNote that I&#39;ve already tried a bunch of other things without much avail:\r\n\r\n- Removing my entire .m2 folder and letting it download everything from our Nexus again\r\n- Looked in the Maven Console to see what is being logged, which isn&#39;t anything related to this NPE unfortunately\r\n- Do the Maven Update Project both with or without &quot;Force Update of Snapshots/Releases&quot; enabled\r\n- Do a Clean Build with the &quot;Update Snapshots&quot; enabled\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m mainly looking for right now is a stacktrace of this NullPointerException, so I can (hopefully) fix this issue at the core of the problem, instead of using all these workarounds like deleting Eclipse/Maven folders and/or settings (which only work halve of the time anyway)..\r\n\r\nIt gives a NullPointerException, so I assume I should be able to see the stacktrace of this NullPointerException to determine the cause somewhere in an Eclipse log or console, shouldn&#39;t I?\r\n\r\nIs there perhaps a mvn command flag/argument I could use? Or is this NullPointerException an issue of Eclipse rather than Maven?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ii7e6.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099852/maven-update-results-in-nullpointerexception-where-to-find-the-stacktrace-cause","title":"Maven update results in NullPointerException.

Not sure if this status reason transition validation is happening in UI layer or Server Business layer like OOB plugins. Also if there are multiple Status reason transitions available, it should popup a window to capture the &quot;to be&quot; status reason. How can it break? If the business logic is done only there in that popup screen, then Bulk-edit form may not have that logic built.\r\n\r\nBtw, I will create a ticket to see their response as they can check in their own internal Known issue database or existing tickets repository for answering us.

can check one of those method :\r\n\r\n 1. **The first** :\r\n\r\n is to remove the `spring boot` , because it&#39;s a hierarchic dependency of \r\n`spring-boot-starter-hateoas`\r\n\r\n in which I think this cause twice creation of the bean \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    \t    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    \t

create your own RestTemplate bean , since this last implement the [RestOperations][1] interface : \r\nand use it as folow :\r\n\r\n In a config class create a bean : \r\n\r\n        @Bean\r\n

.setReadTimeout(10000)\r\n                     .build();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n then replace the autowired \r\n\r\n\r\n        @Autowired\r\n        private RestOperations restTemplate; \r\n\r\n by

You should probably have a second duration set with a sustained test at this arrival rate.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://artillery.io/docs/script-reference/#how-do-ramps-work","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099805/artillery-how-exactly-does-rampto-work-in-artillery/58100956#58100956","title":"Artillery: How exactly does rampto work in artillery?"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":8760121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb9be32b00c3761bc1263b87dc5abaa9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tarun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8760121/tarun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32,"user_id":8760121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb9be32b00c3761bc1263b87dc5abaa9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tarun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8760121/tarun"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58100956,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569422344,"creation_date":1569418907,"last_edit_date":1569421147,"question_id":58099805,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58099805","body_markdown":"Not able to understand how rampto works in artillery\r\n\r\n    &gt;

The official documentation of flask-cache does not seem to offer this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099800/cache-stats-for-flask-cache","title":"Cache stats for flask-cache"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","arrow-functions","react-component"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569419004,"post_id":58099798,"comment_id":102591428,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099798/arrow-function-into-ordinary-function-expression-in-react-component#comment102591428_58099798"},{"owner":{"reputation":11671,"user_id":1218980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75c6b54df38abce7b1c35f499a1d4a67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Emile Bergeron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1218980/emile-bergeron"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569420722,"post_id":58099798,"comment_id":102592500,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099798/arrow-function-into-ordinary-function-expression-in-react-component#comment102592500_58099798"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1089,"user_id":9040866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WW6Gx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"silencedogood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9040866/silencedogood"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569418992,"creation_date":1569418992,"answer_id":58099824,"question_id":58099798,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58099824","body_markdown":"     &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;input\r\n        onChange={function(event) {\r\n              props.handleChange(&quot;email&quot;, event.target.value)\r\n             }\r\n       }\r\n      /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099798/arrow-function-into-ordinary-function-expression-in-react-component/58099824#58099824","title":"Arrow function into &quot;ordinary&quot;

is probably smarter about its `JOIN` syntax.  The above is standard SQL and allowed.  But I highly discourage it.  You can try using parentheses:\r\n\r\n    INNER JOIN\r\n    schemaA.providers prov\r\n    ON claims.prov_key = prov.prov_key LEFT JOIN\r\n    (schemaA.specialties spec INNER JOIN\r\n     schemaA.source src\r\n     ON spec.src_key = src.src_key AND src.src_cd &lt;&gt; &#39;NA&#39;\r\n    )\r\n    ON prov.prov_key = spec.prov_key \r\n\r\nThis might help the parser.  Otherwise, this probably does what you want:\r\n\r\n    INNER JOIN\r\n    schemaA.providers prov\r\n    ON claims.prov_key = prov.prov_key LEFT JOIN\r\n    schemaA.specialties spec\r\n    ON prov.prov_key = spec.prov_key LEFT JOIN\r\n    schemaA.source src\r\n    ON spec.src_key = src.src_key AND src.src_cd &lt;&gt; &#39;NA&#39;\r\n\r\nThis version is certainly easier for people to parse.  It should also be easier for the SAS processor to parse as well.\r\n\r\nNote:  This version is not *exactly* the same as your version.

is trying to stretch the `IValueConverter` framework a bit too far - you could have your converters implement `DependencyObject` to allow Binding but I think you will run in to trouble getting these to fire due to how these are instantiated from the xaml.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d recommend the [Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Wpf][1] nuget package - this allows you to attach `Behavior` instances that already extend `DependencyObject` and support Binding out of the box. Once the binding fires you can then set the `Content` on the `ContentControl` you&#39;re attached to via whatever logic you want. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class NodeToViewModelBehavior : Behavior&lt;ContentControl&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty NodeProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(&quot;Node&quot;, typeof(object), typeof(NodeToViewModelBehavior), new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(PropertyChangedCallback));\r\n    \r\n    public object Node\r\n    {\r\n        get { return (object) GetValue(NodeProperty); }\r\n        set { SetValue(NodeProperty, value); }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void PropertyChangedCallback(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        var nodeToViewModelBehavior = (NodeToViewModelBehavior)d;\r\n        var newNode = e.NewValue;\r\n        nodeToViewModelBehavior.SetContent(newNode);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void SetContent(object newNode)\r\n    {\r\n        var convertedObject = newNode; // insert logic here to grab whatever data you need\r\n        this.AssociatedObject.Content = convertedObject;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd usage in xaml as follows:\r\n\r\n```xaml\r\n&lt;ContentControl&gt;\r\n    &lt;i:Interaction.Behaviors&gt;\r\n        &lt;local:NodeToViewModelBehavior Node=&quot;{Binding SelectedNode}&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/i:Interaction.Behaviors&gt;\r\n&lt;/ContentControl&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere namespace i is declared as\r\n\r\n```\r\nxmlns:i=&quot;clr-namespace:Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors;assembly=Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors&quot;\r\n```\r\n  [1]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Wpf/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099786/how-to-create-a-model-in-xaml-and-assign-values-to-it/58101130#58101130","title":"How to create a model in XAML and assign values to it"}],"owner":{"reputation":6697,"user_id":397830,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23830a9037cb8e435a15c3261038b079?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"J4N","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/397830/j4n"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58101130,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569422840,"creation_date":1569418847,"question_id":58099786,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58099786","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve some weird case that I&#39;m trying to accomplish:\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve one &quot;Converter&quot; that require me to provide multiples values in parameters.

can decide which half of the month in which the date falls using the [`day`][1] function and branch accordingly using the [`iif`][2] function, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    iif(day(wkd)&lt;16, &lt;first half of month&gt;, &lt;second half of month&gt;)\r\n\r\nYou then need to calculate the appropriate dates corresponding to `&lt;first half of month&gt;` and `&lt;second half of month&gt;` in the above expression.\r\n\r\nFor this, I would personally use the [`dateserial`][3] function.\r\n\r\nThe end of the first half of the month (i.e. day 15) could be calculated using:\r\n\r\n    dateserial(year(wkd), month(wkd), 15)\r\n\r\nThe end of the second half of the month (i.e. the last day of the month) could be calculated using:\r\n\r\n    dateserial(year(wkd), month(wkd)+1, 0)\r\n\r\nThat is, the 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of the following month. The [`dateserial`][3] function is very useful in that it will always calculate a valid date from the supplied parameters - hence, if `year(wkd) = 2019` &amp; `month(wkd)+1 = 13`, then rather than returning an error because the month number is greater than 12, `dateserial(2019, 13, 0)` will return 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;sup&gt; December 2019, as expected.\r\n\r\nPutting the above together, we have the `FortnightEnding` field:\r\n\r\n    iif\r\n    (\r\n        day(wkd)&lt;16,\r\n        dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd),15), \r\n        dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd)+1,0)\r\n    ) as FortnightEnding\r\n\r\nAnd so we can construct the following SQL:\r\n\r\n    select\r\n        empid,\r\n        iif\r\n        (\r\n            day(wkd)&lt;16,\r\n            dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd),15), \r\n            dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd)+1,0)\r\n        ) as FortnightEnding,\r\n        sum(gross)\r\n    from\r\n        tblpayroll\r\n    group by\r\n        empid,\r\n        iif\r\n        (\r\n            day(wkd)&lt;16,\r\n            dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd),15), \r\n            dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd)+1,0)\r\n        )\r\n\r\nGrouping by the same calculation results in a summation of the `gross` field for all dates which fall in each group.\r\n\r\nIf you didn&#39;t want to repeat the calculation statement, you could calculate the grouping in a subquery and aggregate the results in the parent query, e.g.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    select t.empid, t.FortnightEnding, sum(t.gross)\r\n    from\r\n    (\r\n        select\r\n            empid,\r\n            iif\r\n            (\r\n                day(wkd)&lt;16,\r\n                dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd),15), \r\n                dateserial(year(wkd),month(wkd)+1,0)\r\n            ) as FortnightEnding,\r\n            gross\r\n        from\r\n            tblpayroll\r\n    ) t\r\n    group by t.empid, t.FortnightEnding\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/day-function-6c7fa9a6-15e6-4e64-b45a-01e9338b9415\r\n  [2]: https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/iif-function-32436ecf-c629-48a3-9900-647539c764e3\r\n  [3]: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/dateserial-function-a0128476-83a0-407c-831a-93f2b046f503","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099704/sum-and-group-salary-by-fortnight/58104842#58104842","title":"Sum and Group Salary by fortnight"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11115377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f05180e2f1b709e4be69b23b93b6d079?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"newbieDB Builder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11115377/newbiedb-builder"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10285,"user_id":7531598,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DKnSq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lee Mac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7531598/lee-mac"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569437650,"creation_date":1569418595,"last_edit_date":1569437650,"question_id":58099704,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58099704","body_markdown":"I am having some problems summing and grouping a payroll by fortnight.

The way I&#39;ve done this is with [UnityPython](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-python), which is basically just IronPython integrated within Unity. The way this works is the code input from the player is wrapped inside a Python script. This script is then run on another thread (this is working from the wrapper, using Python&#39;s `threading` class) which communicates with Unity to move the player. This system works fine on the editor, but not on the build.\r\n\r\nAt first, I have pinpointed the problem to be coming from the search paths used by the script engine not locating the proper library folder (because UnityPython itself is within the assets folder). The particular classes that I need are `threading` and `Queue`.\r\n\r\nThe engine initializer looks like this:\r\n```\r\nvar engine = UnityPython.CreateEngine();\r\nvar paths = engine.GetSearchPaths();\r\npaths.Add(Application.dataPath + &quot;/Python/Lib&quot;);\r\nengine.SetSearchPaths(paths);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne workaround I&#39;ve thought of is just copying the Python folder to the StreamingAssets folder, and then using `Application.streamingAssetsPath` on the third line instead. But the dev build debugger then gives me this weird error:\r\n\r\n&gt; System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for\r\n&gt; &#39;CodecsInfo&#39; threw an exception. ---&gt; System.NotSupportedException:\r\n&gt; Encoding 37 data could not be found. Make sure you have correct\r\n&gt; international codeset assembly installed and enabled.\r\n\r\nThis is where I am stuck at right now. Any thoughts on what this error means and how to go around it?\r\n\r\nEdit: the problem seems to be happening when the script is used by the engine. The code here goes like this:\r\n```\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n\tvar source = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromFile(scriptPath);\r\n\tsource.Compile();\r\n\t// script here is a dynamic variable\r\n\tscript = engine.Runtime.UseFile(scriptPath); // this is where the error is thrown\r\n\tscript.GameManager = this;\r\n\tscript.start();\r\n}\r\ncatch (Exception e)\r\n{\r\n\tDebug.Log(&quot;Error: &quot; + e);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099681/unitypython-working-on-editor-but-not-on-build","title":"UnityPython working on Editor but not on

For example:\r\n```\r\npublic class Answer {\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; fn0 = v -&gt; v + 5;\r\n\r\n    Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; fn1 = v -&gt; {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException(&quot;failed&quot;);\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; fn2 = v -&gt; {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Reached last function !&quot;);\r\n        return v;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt; fn0.apply(100))\r\n            .thenApply(fn1)\r\n            .thenApply(fn2)\r\n            .exceptionally(throwable -&gt; {\r\n                // next line prints the exception thrown by fn1, wrapped in java.util.concurrent.CompletionException\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Failed with error: &quot; + throwable); \r\n                return 0; // default value, used when exception is thrown\r\n            });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBasically, `CompletableFuture` chain will be interrupted by exception &quot;out of the box&quot;, so no additional handling is required.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you want a bit more general approach:\r\n```\r\npublic class Answer {\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    executeAsync(() -&gt; stepOne(100))\r\n            .thenApply(Answer::stepTwo)\r\n            .thenApply(Answer::finalStep)\r\n            .exceptionally(Answer::handleException);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static CompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; executeAsync(Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; task) {\r\n    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(task::get);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static Integer stepOne(Integer value) {\r\n    return value + 5;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static Integer stepTwo(Integer value) {\r\n    throw new RuntimeException(&quot;failed&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static Integer finalStep(Integer value) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Reached last function !&quot;);\r\n    return value;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static Integer handleException(Throwable throwable) {\r\n    // next line prints the exception thrown by any step before, wrapped in java.util.concurrent.CompletionException\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Failed with error: &quot; + throwable);\r\n    return 0; // default value\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n * Using `thenApply` you can chain as many function calls as you need\r\n \r\n * In the last example methods inside same class can be replaced by methods from other classes (not necessarily static ones)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099672/what-is-the-best-practice-to-stop-a-function-chain-execution-on-async-execution/58103245#58103245","title":"What is the best practice to stop a Function chain execution on Async execution?"}],"owner":{"reputation":143,"user_id":3781025,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aCHoh.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roger that","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3781025/roger-that"},"last_editor":{"reputation":143,"user_id":3781025,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aCHoh.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roger that","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3781025/roger-that"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":89,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58100880,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569434225,"creation_date":1569418478,"last_edit_date":1569419457,"question_id":58099672,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58099672","body_markdown":"I have this function here:\r\n\r\n    Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; func = (value) -&gt; value + 5;\r\n    \t\tfunc = func.andThen((value) -&gt; {\r\n                //Imagine that here some code executed and raised an exception, I&#39;m throwing it \r\n                //manually just for the sake of this example.\r\n    \t\t\tthrow new RuntimeException(&quot;failed&quot;);\r\n    \t\t});\r\n    \t\tfunc = func.andThen((value) -&gt; {\r\n    \t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Reached last function !&quot;);\r\n    \t\t\treturn value;\r\n    \t\t});\r\n    \t\texecuteFunction(func);\r\n\r\nNow, you can see that I am throwing a Runtime exception in the first andThen method.

I need to break the filter context of the ADDCOLUMNS function to sum up the hours of multiple rows. \r\n\r\nImportant is to use ALLSELECTED to keep any external filters in place. After this it is pretty straightforward to filter the table on a maximum CumulativeMeters of &lt;= 100 meters and where the row is a defect. Counting the rows in the resulting table gives you the result you are looking for:\r\n\r\n    # Defects last 100m = \r\n    CALCULATE (\r\n        COUNTROWS ( Items ),\r\n        FILTER (\r\n            ADDCOLUMNS (\r\n                Items,\r\n                &quot;CumulativeMeters&quot;, CALCULATE (\r\n                    SUM ( Items[Length(m)] ),\r\n                    FILTER (\r\n                        ALLSELECTED(  Items ),\r\n                        Items[Date] &lt;= EARLIER ( Items[Date] )\r\n                            &amp;&amp; Items[Id] &lt;= EARLIER ( Items[Id] )\r\n                    )\r\n                )\r\n            ),\r\n            [CumulativeMeters] &lt;= 100\r\n                &amp;&amp; Items[Defect] = 1\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n\r\nHope that helps,\r\n\r\nJan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58099662/dax-query-for-counting-values-based-on-another-cumulative-dax-measure/58101628#58101628","title":"DAX query for counting values based on another cumulative DAX measure"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6404976,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a06f8b9bee0b3d678667db30a6bdaa2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S.

For example, what are the amount of defects for site x in the last 100m, or what are the amount of defects in the last 100m that have an ID bigger than 1.\r\n\r\nFor the question &#39;What are the amount of defects for site x in the last 100m&#39;, I would like the result to be 2, as the table should look like this:\r\n\r\n    Id   Length(m) Length Cum.

The user tries to login with &#39;IHaveClaims&#39; user, it is authenticated but it is not redirected to the next page.\r\n\r\nMy code:\r\n\r\n    const isAccess = () =&gt;\r\n      pipe(\r\n        customClaims,\r\n        map(claims =&gt; {\r\n          return claims.access === true ? claims.access : [&#39;/auth&#39;];\r\n        })\r\n      );\r\n    \r\n    const routes: Routes = [\r\n      /** this is the login page */\r\n      {\r\n        path: &#39;auth&#39;,\r\n        loadChildren: () =&gt;\r\n          import(&#39;@project/section/auth&#39;).then(module =&gt; module.SectionAuthModule)\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        path: &#39;home&#39;,\r\n        loadChildren: () =&gt;\r\n          import(&#39;@project/section/home&#39;).then(module =&gt; module.SectionHomeModule),\r\n        canActivate: [AngularFireAuthGuard],\r\n        data: { authGuardPipe: isAccess }\r\n      },\r\n\r\nI noticed that after the successfull login with my Dummy user, my isAccess function is no longer called unless I refresh the page (F5). If I try to navigate to a protected after login-in with my IHaveClaims user, the guard will recognized the user now how the claims and will load the resource as expected, but it only works if I type the route in the browser (add a /home after localhost).\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for here is the following:\r\n\r\n1. User tries to login with &#39;dummy&#39; user, which has no Claims\r\n2. The user remains in the login page (I will add claim error handling later)\r\n3. The user tries to login with &#39;IHaveClaim&#39; user, which has claims\r\n4. The user is redirected to Home\r\n\r\nAnyone know what I am missing on my code?\r\n  [1]:
