am new to react and I have been checking ways of triggering a child function from my parent. So far I found two ways in the following threads.\r\n\r\n[useImperativeHandle][1] Post by `rossipedia`\r\n\r\n[UseEffect][2] - Post by `bennygenel`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, most examples i seen aside from the post by bennygenel are using reference to handle this issue. Which comes in the form of referencing the `child object` and calling it&#39;s `function` or through the usage of `useImperativeHandle` to directly reference the `function` itself. Hence, I am curious if `ref` is indeed a good way of approaching this, as there might be mutations in between causing ref to be somewhat dangerous to use. On the other hand, triggering through a props sent from the parent to the child to trigger a function `useEffect` seems safer as there is not a need to worry for mutations inbetween. \r\n\r\nPlease do

This means that the compiler has one and only one guarantee. That this object has the fields and methods associated with the `Animal` superclass. Test this out for yourself.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnimal myBird = new Bird();\r\n\r\nmyBird.getBeakSize(); // This won&#39;t compile.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s of type `Bird` because its reference type is `Animal`. \r\n\r\n# Different Approach\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is rethink your class design, such that your superclass has the necessary information for you to access.\r\n\r\nIf you need access to the specific subclass, then I would recommend keeping separate lists of each subclass, possibly inside of an object. \r\n\r\nAn alternative might be something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic abstract class Animal {\r\n\r\n  private String name; \r\n  public String getName() { ... }\r\n  public abstract String getFaceDepth(); //\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Bird {\r\n  public String getFaceDepth() {\r\n     // Return beak size here.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you&#39;ll notice here that *face depth* isn&#39;t particularly helpful. This is the problem of making general cases. Sometimes, they&#39;re so general, they lose the essence of the data they&#39;re representing. This can be a sign that your class structure needs to be thought about, depending on your problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320434/different-class-with-same-superclass-in-a-list/58320580#58320580","title":"Different Class, with same superclass in a List"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":5640623,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2738b87048ad999f5cf1733331553eee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lukaszwrzaszcz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5640623/lukaszwrzaszcz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":72,"user_id":5640623,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2738b87048ad999f5cf1733331553eee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lukaszwrzaszcz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5640623/lukaszwrzaszcz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570702927,"last_edit_date":1570702927,"creation_date":1570702656,"answer_id":58320630,"question_id":58320434,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58320630","body_markdown":"When you are retrieving elements from array, you can use &#39;instanceof&#39; method:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Animal animal = // get element/iterate over array\r\n    if(animal instanceof Dog) {\r\n      Dog dog = (Dog) animal;\r\n      // continue here...\r\n    }\r\n    if(animal instanceof Bird) {\r\n      Bird bird = (Bird) animal;\r\n      // continue here...\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320434/different-class-with-same-superclass-in-a-list/58320630#58320630","title":"Different Class, with same superclass in a List"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1950,"user_id":1042124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f41bd8db2424f7895f2d19df47253e82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6327816","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1042124/user6327816"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570704698,"creation_date":1570704698,"answer_id":58321236,"question_id":58320434,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58321236","body_markdown":"You need to have 2 interfaces\r\n\r\n    public interface Beak {\r\n       String getBeakSize();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public interface Tail {\r\n       String getTailSize();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow your code would look like this\r\n\r\n    public class Animal {\r\n    \r\n      private String name; \r\n      public String getName() { ... }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Dog extends Animal implements Tail {\r\n      private String tailLength;\r\n\r\n      @Override\r\n      public String getTailLength() { ... }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Bird extends Animal {\r\n      private String beakSize;\r\n\r\n      @Override\r\n      public String getBeakSize() { ... }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can add items as you were doing before.\r\n\r\n    private List&lt;Animal&gt; animals = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    animals.put(new Dog());\r\n    animals.put(new Bird());\r\n\r\nBut now, you can use the interfaces to find if the animal has tail or beak or both or nothing at all.\r\n\r\n    for(Animal animal in animals) {\r\n         if(animal instanceof Tail) {\r\n              System.out.println(((Tail)animal).getTailLength());\r\n         }\r\n         if(animal instanceof Beak) {\r\n              System.out.println(((Beak)animal).getBeakLength());\r\n         }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhy this is important?

The equivalent class for that in Java is [`LocalDate`][2]:\r\n\r\n&gt; `LocalDate` is an immutable date-time object that represents a date, often viewed as year-month-day. Other date fields, such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed. For example, the value &quot;2nd October 2007&quot; can be stored in a `LocalDate`.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; This class does not store or represent a time or time-zone. Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays. It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information such as an offset or time-zone.\r\n\r\nIf you need both date and time, then it makes sense to store that information in UTC. In Java, it can be represented with [`Instant`][3] or [`OffsetDateTime`][4].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58320402/1426227\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Instant.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/time/OffsetDateTime.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320355/mongodb-stores-incorrect-dob/58320685#58320685","title":"MongoDB stores incorrect DOB"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11288787,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EzdYpBRT7Q4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKrU/804ZWB9YA_I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sukesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11288787/sukesh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11288787,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EzdYpBRT7Q4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKrU/804ZWB9YA_I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sukesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11288787/sukesh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58320402,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570703171,"creation_date":1570701751,"last_edit_date":1570701960,"question_id":58320355,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58320355","body_markdown":"I am using Java Date to store DOB of Person and saving the details in MongoDB.

That&#39;s the message queue you process with your `GetMessage(HWND==NULL)` loop.\r\n\r\n`DispatchMessage` is the function which looks at `HWND` in `msg`, and chooses the correct window proc. It does so by looking up the window class of that HWND. \r\n\r\nSince `HWND==NULL` does not have a window class, it does not have a window proc either, and the message is not dispatched to any window. \r\n\r\nIf you want to send `WM_DUCKWND(HWND==NULL)` to all your windows, you&#39;ll have to dispatch it yourself. In this simple example, that&#39;s as simple as setting `msg.hWnd=hw` for `msg.message==WM_DUCKWND &amp;&amp; msg.hWnd==NULL`.\r\n\r\nSide note: it really should be `WM_APP+4`; the `WM_USER` range is for messages internal to a window class.

it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320306/postmessage-not-working-with-posting-custom-message/58320597#58320597","title":"PostMessage not working with posting custom

What do?\r\n\r\nLong version: I&#39;m building a function in Excel to remove all users in a shared workbook that have a login older than todays date. I found the beautiful `ActiveWorkbook.UserStatus` which returns all users, their status, and their login date/time in an array. The problem is that despite all my possible settings being in UK and standard date format being dd/mm/yyyy, the `.userstatus` returns it as m/d/yyyy. For example: 4th Oct gets returned as 10/4/2019. To make it worse, it&#39;s returned as a string instead of a &quot;Double&quot; date. So fixing this using `Format`, `CDate` or `CDbl` doesn&#39;t work. I would like to `dateadd` 1 day to this date and check it against the current date, but this is proving more challenging than expected.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSub user()\r\nDim users As Variant, row As Integer\r\nusers = ActiveWorkbook.UserStatus\r\n    Debug.Print users(1, 2) &#39;Returns 10/4/2019 7:28, for 4th of Oct.\r\n    Debug.Print DateAdd(&quot;d&quot;, 1, users(1, 2)) &#39;Returns 11/04/2019 07:28:00 which should be 5th of Oct.\r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Ps.** I realise I am asking this on 10/10, which is going to mess with your results when trying to replicate this issue. I sincerely apologise for this. It took me forever to find out this was the issue as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320284/how-to-handle-userstatus-returning-wrong-date-format","title":"How to handle Userstatus returning wrong date format"},{"tags":["jquery","npm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":669,"user_id":4720652,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MnRIv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saharsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4720652/saharsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570701614,"post_id":58320283,"comment_id":102999702,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320283/how-do-i-use-jquery-in-my-html-after-npm-install#comment102999702_58320283"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12015679,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FlU2Rs9b_0g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfdiwNlawZID0kvX-NNEjKbtjkMOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ksingh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12015679/ksingh"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":669,"user_id":4720652,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MnRIv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saharsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4720652/saharsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570709884,"post_id":58320283,"comment_id":103004116,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320283/how-do-i-use-jquery-in-my-html-after-npm-install#comment103004116_58320283"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12015679,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FlU2Rs9b_0g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfdiwNlawZID0kvX-NNEjKbtjkMOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ksingh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12015679/ksingh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570710205,"post_id":58320330,"comment_id":103004311,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320283/how-do-i-use-jquery-in-my-html-after-npm-install/58320330#comment103004311_58320330"},{"owner":{"reputation":2061,"user_id":10944219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUQfW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kmgt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10944219/kmgt"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12015679,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FlU2Rs9b_0g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfdiwNlawZID0kvX-NNEjKbtjkMOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ksingh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12015679/ksingh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570727517,"post_id":58320330,"comment_id":103014187,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320283/how-do-i-use-jquery-in-my-html-after-npm-install/58320330#comment103014187_58320330"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2061,"user_id":10944219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUQfW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kmgt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10944219/kmgt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2061,"user_id":10944219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUQfW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kmgt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10944219/kmgt"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570702049,"last_edit_date":1570702049,"creation_date":1570701651,"answer_id":58320330,"question_id":58320283,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58320330","body_markdown":"Just use it like this:\r\n\r\n    import $ from &#39;jquery&#39;;\r\n\r\n    $(function () {\r\n      // ...\r\n    });\r\n\r\nIf you use express add this as static route\r\n\r\n    app.use(&#39;/lib/jquery&#39;, express.static(path.join(__dirname, &#39;node_modules/jquery/dist&#39;)));\r\n\r\nAnd load it in your html file:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;/lib/jquery/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nMaybe you have to modify the pathes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320283/how-do-i-use-jquery-in-my-html-after-npm-install/58320330#58320330","title":"How do I use jQuery in my html after npm install?"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12015679,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FlU2Rs9b_0g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfdiwNlawZID0kvX-NNEjKbtjkMOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ksingh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12015679/ksingh"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1570702054,"accepted_answer_id":58320330,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570702049,"creation_date":1570701497,"question_id":58320283,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58320283","body_markdown":"After running ```npm install jquery```, what then?

I am facing the issue only when the editor component is inside modal.\r\n\r\n ```jsx\r\n&lt;Modal open={open} onClose={this.onCloseModal} classNames={{modal: &#39;modal-wrap&#39;}}&gt;\r\n    &lt;form&gt;\r\n        &lt;Editor name=&quot;signature&quot;\r\n                    tools={[\r\n                      [ Bold, Italic, Underline ],\r\n                      [ Undo, Redo ],\r\n                      [ Link, Unlink ],\r\n                      [ AlignLeft, AlignCenter, AlignRight ],\r\n                      [ OrderedList, UnorderedList, Indent, Outdent ]\r\n                    ]}\r\n                    contentStyle={{ height: 320 }}\r\n                    ref={editor =&gt; this.editor = editor}\r\n        /&gt;\r\n        &lt;button onClick={this.submitForm}&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n&lt;/Modal&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am expecting the Kendo editor could work inside modal also.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320279/kendo-editor-is-not-working-properly-within-react-responsive-modal","title":"Kendo editor is not working properly within react responsive modal"},{"tags":["excel","laravel","maatwebsite-excel"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":5470590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bnibtDnndHg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAw/elP4nS8VlfE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rashed Jhony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5470590/rashed-jhony"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570707059,"creation_date":1570707059,"answer_id":58321898,"question_id":58320277,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58321898","body_markdown":"I solve this issue here is the code.\r\n\r\n    foreach ($rows as $row){\r\n            $memberId = Member::create([\r\n                &#39;full_name&#39;     =&gt; $row[&#39;full_name&#39;],\r\n                &#39;father_name&#39;   =&gt; $row[&#39;father_name&#39;],\r\n                &#39;mother_name&#39;   =&gt; $row[&#39;mother_name&#39;],\r\n                &#39;cell_number&#39;   =&gt; $row[&#39;cell_number&#39;],\r\n            ]);\r\n            $applicationId  = LicenceApplication::create([                \r\n                &#39;member_id&#39;             =&gt; $memberId-&gt;member_id,\r\n                &#39;licence_category_name&#39; =&gt; $row[&#39;licence_category_name&#39;],\r\n            ]);\r\n            LicenceSuccess::create([\r\n                &#39;member_id&#39;         =&gt; $memberId-&gt;member_id,\r\n                &#39;application_id&#39;    =&gt; $applicationId-&gt;application_id,\r\n                &#39;application_type&#39;  =&gt; $row[&#39;application_type&#39;],\r\n            ]);\r\n        }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58320277/laravel-excel-multiple-table-primary-id-save-to-another-table-as-a-foreign-id/58321898#58321898","title":"Laravel Excel Multiple table primary_id save to another table as a foreign_id"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":5470590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bnibtDnndHg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAw/elP4nS8VlfE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rashed Jhony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5470590/rashed-jhony"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5068,"user_id":999617,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5fba9229a54aba29fe9efb1e3e9b6c0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vincent Decaux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/999617/vincent-decaux"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570707059,"creation_date":1570701486,"last_edit_date":1570701651,"question_id":58320277,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58320277","body_markdown":"I can successfully import Excel Data in Laravel and Insert into Database multiple tables.

I am developing a webapp that needs to communicate with another system on another domain. This communication needs to be async. And returns an XML document upon completion.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nThe problem however is that I cannot do cross-domain with XMLHttpRequest, and I cannot extract the data with fetch. Currently the furthest I have gotten is with fetch, where I am getting the data back, but I can&#39;t seem to extract it from the response.\r\n\r\nThe request code:\r\n``` lang-js\r\nconst HOST = &quot;http://192.168.1.202:6363/&quot;\r\n\r\nfunction setobjval(name, value) {\r\n    fetch(HOST + &#39;setobjval?objid=&#39; + name + &#39;&amp;objval=&#39; + value, {\r\n        method: &#39;get&#39;,\r\n        mode: &#39;no-cors&#39;\r\n    }).then(response =&gt; {\r\n        //I&#39;m guessing the problem is here\r\n        console.log(response)\r\n        var xml = response.text()\r\n        console.log(xml)\r\n        //do stuff with the what is supposed to be xml\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd the console:\r\n```\r\ninterface.js:14 Promise&#160;{&lt;pending&gt;}\r\ninterface.js:9 Response&#160;{type: &quot;opaque&quot;, url: &quot;&quot;, redirected: false, status: 0, ok: false,&#160;…}\r\ninterface.js:10 Promise&#160;{&lt;resolved&gt;: &quot;&quot;}\r\n```\r\nSo now I am writing this I see 2 problems:\r\n1.

I&#39;m using MacOS so I installed Jupyter with Brew:\r\n\r\n    pip3 install jupyter\r\n\r\nand then I installed Sage:\r\n\r\n    brew install cask\r\n    brew cask install sage\r\n\r\nFinally, I installed Sage in Jupyter:\r\n\r\n    jupyter kernelspec install --user /Applications/SageMath-8.9.app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath\r\n\r\nand then I did:\r\n\r\n    export SAGE_ROOT=/Applications/SageMath-8.9.app/Contents/Resources/sage\r\n\r\nWhen I write &quot;jupyter kernelspec list&quot; on the terminal, I get:\r\n\r\n    sagemath    /Users/inesguimaraes/Library/Jupyter/kernels/sagemath\r\n    python3     /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3\r\n\r\nAnd the kernel.json inside the Sage kernel in Jupyter looks like this:\r\n\r\n    {&quot;display_name&quot;: &quot;SageMath 8.9&quot;, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;sage&quot;, &quot;argv&quot;: [&quot;/Users/buildbot-sage/slave/binary_pkg/build/source/SageMath/jc4b6yulaujayb9sr94ia88eourzeqip0oidmas3/local/bin/sage&quot;, &quot;--python&quot;, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;sage.repl.ipython_kernel&quot;, &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;{connection_file}&quot;]}\r\n\r\nI know this post is really long and boring, but can someone figure out what&#39;s going on? I guess Jupyter isn&#39;t getting stuff from where it&#39;s supposed to or something...\r\nAny help is highly appreciated.

But I hope someone can help me out with what seems to be a rather simple mistake...\r\n\r\nI&#39;m working with Python in Jupyter Notebook and am trying to create my own module with some selfmade functions/loops that I often use. However, when I try to some of the functions from my module, I get an error related to the import of the built-in module that is used in my own module.\r\n\r\nThe way I created my own module was by:\r\n\r\n 1. creating different blocks of code in a notebook and downloading it\r\n    as  *&#39;Functions.py&#39;* file.\r\n 2. saving this *Functions.py* file in the folder that i&#39;m currently working in (with another notebook file)\r\n 3. in my current notebook file (where i&#39;m doing my analysis), I import my module with &#39;*import Functions&#39;*.\r\n\r\nSo far, the import of my own module seems to work. However, some of my self-made functions use functions from built-in modules. E.g. my *plot_lines()* function uses *math.ceil()* somewhere in the code. Therefore, I imported &#39;math&#39; in my analysis notebook as well. But when I try to run the function plot_lines() in my notebook, I get the error *&quot;NameError: name &#39;math&#39; is not defined&quot;*.\r\n\r\nI tried to solve this error by adding the code &#39;import math&#39; to the function in my module as well, but this did not resolve the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**So my question is**: how can I use functions from built-in Python modules in my own
