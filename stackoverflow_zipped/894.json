Something like this : --header &#39;authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to do that I do not think you need to change manually each request, but you need to change some POSTMAN settings.

Therefore, you need to further wrap your call to `drop_download` in a `try` statement. This way `filePutReport2()` either contains the value TRUE or an  invisible object of class &quot;try-error&quot;. Then you should be able to use a [need/validate function](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/0.14/validate.html) in your `renderUI` statement including a custom error message.

  nested: edge\r\n        terms: key\r\n            terms: value\r\n\r\nBased on this, you can then produce the expected results by combining the results of the the terms aggregations. \r\n\r\n\r\n

have a data model where each &quot;thing&quot; has a number of children and can be represented by JSON like the following.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;parent_1&quot;,\r\n        ... other parent fields ...\r\n        &quot;children&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1_a&quot;,\r\n

children whose `name` matches a certain pattern. \r\n\r\n**Constraints**\r\n\r\nWe have various constraints:\r\n\r\n1. We must store the data in Cosmos with the SQL API. \r\n2. We can only use Azure Search.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would store the each parent &quot;thing&quot; as a whole document in Cosmos with all its children. However, there can be lots of children meaning that the document size sometimes exceeds the 2MB limit for Cosmos documents.\r\n\r\n**Things I&#39;ve tried**\r\n\r\n**Attempt 1**\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to store separate parent and child documents in the same Azure Cosmos collection, distinguish the parents from the children with a `type` field and reference the parent with an `id` field. e.g.\r\n\r\n\r\nParent\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;parent_1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;parent&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nChild 1\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1_a&quot;,\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;child_1_a&quot;,\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;child&quot;,\r\n        &quot;parentId&quot;: &quot;1&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nChild 2\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1_b&quot;,\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;child_1_b&quot;,\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;child&quot;,\r\n        &quot;parentId&quot;: &quot;1&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, then searching on the child name can bring back many pages of results for the same parent, so to get only a few parents may require 1000s of pages of matching children to be brought back which is not ideal from a performance point of view.\r\n\r\n**Attempt 2**\r\n\r\nI thought I could use a JOIN in Cosoms to populate the Azure Search. However, this would need cross document joins which are not supported.\r\n\r\n**Other Alternatives**\r\n\r\nOther suggestions I&#39;ve seen are:\r\n\r\n- Facet on the id of the parent, but I&#39;ve read that this would perform badly.\r\n\r\n- Batch the children into into batches (e.g. of 500 children) and attach each batch to a parent. If there are multiple batches for a single parent, then denormalise the fields for the parent. This is currently the only option which works for the current data, although it seems to just delay the problem - e.g. at some point it is possible that the number of batches will become large enough to reduce search performance once more.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use Cosmos (SQL-API) and Azure Search for this requirement and if so how?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329661/azure-search-within-unbounded-array-of-child-objects-sourced-from-cosmos","title":"Azure Search within unbounded array of child objects sourced from Cosmos"},{"tags":["angular","typescript","angular-material","angular7","angular2-forms"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10495738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13ad82c63bc40458e706565814734ece?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"natDaGreat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10495738/natdagreat"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570739889,"creation_date":1570739889,"answer_id":58330739,"question_id":58329660,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58330739","body_markdown":"All, I was able to figure it out. \r\n\r\nthere is something called [compareWith] that goes in your &lt;mat-select&gt;\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-qpzg9s\r\n\r\n^^^stack blitz with solution.^^^ \r\n\r\ncode diffrence. \r\nin my-drop-down.html\r\ni added :\r\n\r\n     [compareWith]=&quot;byId&quot; \r\n\r\ninto the mat-select\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin my-drop-down.ts\r\ni added :\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    byId(obj1,obj2){\r\n     if(obj1 != undefined &amp;&amp; obj2 != undefined){\r\n        return obj1.id === obj2.id;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis was able to preSelect the options as objects. \r\n\r\nif anyone has a better answer im open ears. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329660/angular-preselected-options-in-custom-component-not-showing/58330739#58330739","title":"Angular preSelected options in custom component not showing"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10495738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13ad82c63bc40458e706565814734ece?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"natDaGreat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10495738/natdagreat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58330739,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570739889,"creation_date":1570734686,"question_id":58329660,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329660","body_markdown":"I am trying to make a component that has a multi select dropdown. when I create an instance of this component i want to pass it a list of objects (in my case ICatagory) to show as the options.

The idea is to perform all the DML operations in a SQL Server database, but we will be using Elastic Search for ALL the fetch (select) operations. \r\n\r\nThe data is replicated into ES from the SQL Server database.\r\n\r\nAt present our project structure looks something like this:\r\n\r\nController (UI Layer)\r\n\r\n    CreateStock(Stock stock) {\r\n        _serviceLayer.CreateStock(stock);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Stock&gt; GetStocks() {\r\n        var stocks =  _serviceLayer.GetStocks()  \r\n    }\r\n\r\nService layer:\r\n\r\n    CreateStock(Stock stock) {\r\n        // business logic\r\n        _repository.CreateStock(stock)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Stock&gt; GetStocks() {\r\n        return _repository.GetStocks(stock)  \r\n    }\r\n\r\nRepository:\r\n\r\n    CreateStock(Stock) {\r\n        // Insert data into SQL Server database with ADO.NET\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Stock&gt; GetStocks() {\r\n        // Get data from SQL Server database with ADO.NET\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFuture requirements:\r\n\r\nRepository:\r\n\r\n    CreateStock(Stock) {\r\n         // Insert data into SQL Server database with ADO.NET\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Stock&gt; GetStocks() {\r\n         // Get data from other data source (ElasticSearch)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nNow of course I could create whole new repository classes for new implementation with ElasticSearch as the data source. Both the repositories will inherit from common interface. But problem with that approach is that I will be duplicating the DML operations in both the classes. \r\n\r\nHow can I reuse the DML code in future? \r\n\r\n1. Should I create two repositories?

We can call this `_buttons`, for example.\r\n* A `Button` to store the currently selected button. We can call this `_enabledButton`, for example.\r\n* A `Random` to generate random numbers so you can select a button at random. We can call this `_rng`, for example.\r\n\r\nInside of `GenerateButton`, make sure you set `button.Enabled = false`, then also add `button` to the `_buttons` field.\r\n\r\nThen add a method to `Form1`, `ActivateRandomButton` for example, that does something like this...\r\n\r\n```lang-csharp\r\nprivate void ActivateRandomButton()\r\n{\r\n   if (_enabledButton != null)\r\n   {\r\n      // If one of the buttons is already enabled, disable it.\r\n      _enabledButton.Enabled = false;\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   // Randomly select a button that you&#39;ve created and enable it.\r\n   _enabledButton = _buttons[_rng.Next(0, _buttons.Count)];\r\n   _enabledButton.Enabled = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow after you&#39;ve generated all your `Button`s, you can call `ActivateRandomButton` to turn one of them &quot;On&quot;. You&#39;ll probably eventually add a `Timer` and you can call `ActivateRandomButton` in the `Tick` event.\r\n\r\nDo be aware that this is a pretty simplistic approach. It has some problems, for example there will always be one and only one button active at a time. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve played a game of Whack-a-Mole, but I feel like it&#39;s possible for there to be multiple moles &quot;active&quot; at a time, or even zero moles &quot;active&quot; at a time. Hopefully though, this answer will give you something to start with and build on.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329650/how-to-turn-generated-buttons-on-and-off/58330361#58330361","title":"How to turn generated buttons on and off?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19546,"user_id":1410664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGygm.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Caius Jard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1410664/caius-jard"},"last_editor":{"reputation":19546,"user_id":1410664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGygm.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Caius Jard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1410664/caius-jard"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570739429,"last_edit_date":1570739429,"creation_date":1570738851,"answer_id":58330548,"question_id":58329650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58330548","body_markdown":"Per my comment - please note this code is absolutely untested, might not even compile, because I&#39;m on a cellphone:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnamespace Whack_a_mole\r\n{\r\n    public partial class Form1 : Form\r\n    {\r\n        private Random _rng = new Random();

are searching for the `min`/`max` values before the array has been fully populated.\r\n\r\nYou should read the 5 integers using one loop, THEN look for the min/max values AFTER the 1st loop has finished:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    int numbers[5], minNum, maxNum;\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter five numbers: &quot;;                                // Type a number and press enter\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\r\n        cin &gt;&gt; numbers[i];                                         // Get user input from the keyboard\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    minNum = maxNum = numbers[0];\r\n\r\n    for ( int i = 1; i &lt; 5; i ++ ) {\r\n        if (numbers[i] &lt; minNum) {\r\n            minNum = numbers[i];\r\n        }\r\n        if (numbers[i] &gt; maxNum) {\r\n            maxNum = numbers[i];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Min &quot; &lt;&lt; minNum &lt;&lt; &quot;  Max &quot; &lt;&lt; maxNum &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use the standard [`std::minmax_element()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/minmax_element) algorithm instead:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;algorithm&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    int numbers[5];\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter five numbers: &quot;;                                // Type a number and press enter\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\r\n        cin &gt;&gt; numbers[i];                                         // Get user input from the keyboard\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    pair&lt;int*, int*&gt; nums = minmax_element(numbers, numbers + 5);\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Min &quot; &lt;&lt; *(nums.first) &lt;&lt; &quot;

The sample reloads the data in the fragments onResume function.\r\n\r\n**[TasksFragment.java][1]**\r\n\r\nReloads the whole dataSet in onResume function.\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onResume() {\r\n        super.onResume();\r\n        mTasksViewModel.start();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n**[tasks_frag.xml][2]**\r\n\r\n    &lt;ListView\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/tasks_list&quot;\r\n        app:items=&quot;@{viewmodel.items}&quot;\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n**[Adapter][3]**\r\n\r\n    public class TasksAdapter extends BaseAdapter {\r\n        private final TasksViewModel mTasksViewModel;\r\n        private List&lt;Task&gt; mTasks;\r\n        \r\n        private void setList(List&lt;Task&gt; tasks) {\r\n            mTasks = tasks;\r\n            notifyDataSetChanged();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**[TasksListBindings.java][4]**\r\n\r\n    public class TasksListBindings {\r\n\r\n        @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)\r\n        @BindingAdapter(&quot;app:items&quot;)\r\n        public static void setItems(ListView listView, List&lt;Task&gt; items) {\r\n            TasksAdapter adapter = (TasksAdapter) listView.getAdapter();\r\n            if (adapter != null)\r\n            {\r\n                adapter.setData(items);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI already implemented the **DiffUtil** as replacement of **notifyDataSetChanged** like this. \r\n\r\n    protected void setList(List&lt;Item&gt; tasks) {\r\n        Log.d(&quot;customeee&quot;, &quot;mTasks setList&quot;);\r\n        final ItemsDiffCallback diffCallback = new ItemsDiffCallback(this.mTasks, tasks);\r\n        final DiffUtil.DiffResult diffResult = DiffUtil.calculateDiff(diffCallback);\r\n\r\n        diffResult.dispatchUpdatesTo(this);\r\n        this.mTasks.clear();\r\n        this.mTasks.addAll(tasks);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut what happens is no matter what I do the **areContentsTheSame** function is always returning true. If I force a false, the update is working just fine.\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean areContentsTheSame(int oldItemPosition, int newItemPosition) {\r\n        final Item oldItem = mOldList.get(oldItemPosition);\r\n        final Item newItem = mNewList.get(newItemPosition);\r\n\r\n        Log.d(&quot;customeee&quot;, oldItem.getNote() + &quot; newItem: &quot;+newItem.getNote());\r\n        Log.d(&quot;customeee&quot;, &quot;New == old? &quot;+mOldList.equals(mNewList));\r\n\r\n        return oldItem.getNote().equals(newItem.getNote());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe oldItem.getNote() and newItem.getNote() are both returning the new value. I think this has something todo with the reference if the list object as oldList.equals(newList). \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/blob/todo-mvvm-live/todoapp/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/architecture/blueprints/todoapp/tasks/TasksFragment.java#L66\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/blob/todo-mvvm-live/todoapp/app/src/main/res/layout/tasks_frag.xml#L66\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/blob/todo-mvvm-live/todoapp/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/architecture/blueprints/todoapp/tasks/TasksAdapter.java#L107\r\n  [4]: https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/blob/todo-mvvm-live/todoapp/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/architecture/blueprints/todoapp/tasks/TasksListBindings.java","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329638/replace-notifydatasetchanged-with-diffutil-with-databinding-livedata-in-mvvm","title":"Replace notifyDataSetChanged with DiffUtil with Databinding, LiveData in MVVM"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","ecmascript-6","puppeteer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":138710,"user_id":497418,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/248d820c4cc1b6eb7924c658c45443b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"zzzzBov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/497418/zzzzbov"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570734828,"post_id":58329637,"comment_id":103017336,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329637/javascript-closure-and-async-function-arguments#comment103017336_58329637"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12197181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-he9TJscI1-Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcWZWJyWxsuV09I_H_ZEEaUsY4NOA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alexandre Marques","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12197181/alexandre-marques"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570805225,"post_id":58333846,"comment_id":103042507,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329637/javascript-closure-and-async-function-arguments/58333846#comment103042507_58333846"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10085,"user_id":2715393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LnJEF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vaviloff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2715393/vaviloff"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570764626,"creation_date":1570764626,"answer_id":58333846,"question_id":58329637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58333846","body_markdown":"Technically, from the point of view of Javascript your code is correct, `property` *should* be available in `page.$eval` callback.

does not cache web pages. It knows nothing about HTTP, so it cannot cache HTTP responses.\r\n\r\nIf you are indeed only using Winsock to send an HTTP request, and if you are doing this directly (not over a proxy), then it must be a [transparent proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Transparent_proxy) that is caching the requests. Some ISPs use them and this often causes technical trouble.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not convinced that this is a caching issue. If you are using Winsock to send an HTTP request, I suspect that it is more likely that there is something wrong with your HTTP request. For example, nowadays, many servers use virtual hosting and therefore require the client to send the &quot;Host&quot; field in the HTTP header, so that the request can be assigned to the correct virtual server. If you don&#39;t do this, you will be served by the wrong virtual server. This could be the reason you are receiving a HTTP 301 permanently moved response and it could also be why it works with WinInet (because it sends a correct &quot;Host&quot; header field).\r\n\r\nHowever, this contradicts your claim that sending a GET request for a certain URL does not send anything out to the internet. What exactly makes you think that this is the case?

I discovered that something in the system on my computer caches http 301 permanently moved responses. So if I send a GET request for a certain URL it returns an old response without sending anything out onto the web. Problem, because the cached response is faulty. I want to clear the cache, but don&#39;t even know who is doing the caching. \r\n\r\nI know how to clear this cache in my browser. Also, when I use wininet instead of winsock there is no problem. Where is the cache for winsock and how do I clear it? \r\n\r\nEDIT: Andreas&#39; response below occasions some remarks. My program is running as a proxy on localhost, receiving requests from Firefox and sending them out onto the web. So the requests are set up by Firefox and the host header is always there. The reason I think this has something to do with winsock on my own computer is that Firefox will get the page all right if I don&#39;t use my proxy server. No 301 response then. But Firefox had this problem too (without proxy) until I cleared its history (forget about this site). That&#39;s why I think it must be a winsock cache problem.\r\n\r\nSince Firefox succeeds (without proxy) when its cache is cleared it cannot be my ISP doing the caching. Note that the request sent out is identical whether going through my proxy or not. I don&#39;t change anything. Also, as I said, wininet works.\r\n\r\nI agree that winsock knows nothing about http. Yet, there seems to be something between winsock and the web having a cache function. What other explanation can there be? My proxy works all right with many other sites, but on a few ones I get this 301 permanently moved reponse with a faulty location header. How can I find out more about what&#39;s going on?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329610/how-to-clear-the-winsock-cached-http-redirects-301-permanently-moved","title":"how to clear the winsock cached http redirects (301 permanently moved)"},{"tags":["scala","functional-programming","hashmap"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":4244347,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca7b542dae284b969d6b3dfce640c221?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"smaug","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4244347/smaug"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5892,"user_id":4111404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kzPWJe4orps/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/L-IQwWBiNJU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Luis Miguel Mej&#237;a Su&#225;rez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4111404/luis-miguel-mej%c3%ada-su%c3%a1rez"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570735397,"post_id":58329609,"comment_id":103017601,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329609/how-to-count-the-occurrence-of-an-element-in-a-nested-map-in-scala#comment103017601_58329609"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3655,"user_id":1852681,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WiO0m.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"cheseaux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1852681/cheseaux"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3655,"user_id":1852681,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WiO0m.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"cheseaux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1852681/cheseaux"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570735789,"last_edit_date":1570735789,"creation_date":1570735470,"answer_id":58329822,"question_id":58329609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58329822","body_markdown":"You could use this\r\n\r\n    twoLevelMap.flatMap(_._2.values).flatten.groupBy(identity).mapValues(_.size)\r\n\r\nWhich produces the expected output :\r\n&gt;Map(1 -&gt;

expects that you will bind items of `SectionModel` type, because you passed `SectionModel` as a generic parameter. Apparently, you would like to use `StudentModel`. To achieve this, you might make your `StudentModel` conform to `SectionModelType` protocol, and then use `RxCollectionViewSectionedReloadDataSource&lt;StudentModel&gt;`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nextension StudentModel: SectionModelType {\r\n    // implement\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet dataSource = RxCollectionViewSectionedReloadDataSource&lt;StudentModel&gt;(configureCell: { (datasource, collectionView, indexPath, element) in\r\n    // configure a cell     \r\n})\r\nstudentCells.bind(to: studentsView.rx.items(dataSource: dataSource))\r\n    .disposed(by: disposeBag) // don&#39;t forget to setup disposal\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I suppose that `StudentModel` is describing a single cell, rather than an entire section. Is such case, it may be a better idea to map `StudentModel` to `SectionModel`, like this:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet dataSource = RxCollectionViewSectionedReloadDataSource&lt;SectionModel&gt;(configureCell: { (datasource, collectionView, indexPath, element) in\r\n    // configure a cell      \r\n})\r\nstudentCells\r\n    .map { [SectionModel(model: &quot;&quot;, items: $0)] }\r\n    .bind(to: studentsView.rx.items(dataSource: dataSource))\r\n    .disposed(by: disposeBag)\r\n```\r\nObviously, I mapped all your `studentCells` into a single section, which might not be your case. In more complex scenarios, you might consider implementing a custom type conforming to `SectionModelType`.\r\n\r\nAlso, you may pass something more valuable than an empty string as a `model`, but again it depends on your needs.\r\n\r\n**Attension!**\r\nIn an example above `SectionModel` stands for `RxDataSources.SectionModel`, not:\r\n```swift\r\nenum SectionModel {\r\n    case SectionOne(items: [SectionItem])\r\n    case SectionTwo(items: [SectionItem])\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329578/how-to-create-multiple-sections-in-uicollectionview-with-multiple-headers-using/58335754#58335754","title":"How to create multiple Sections in UICollectionView with multiple Headers using RxDatasource"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":12139340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63cc14b2a1d060797f97d470920e2de0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chalenger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139340/chalenger"},"last_editor":{"reputation":30,"user_id":12139340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63cc14b2a1d060797f97d470920e2de0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chalenger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139340/chalenger"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58335754,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570995745,"creation_date":1570734353,"last_edit_date":1570968816,"question_id":58329578,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329578","body_markdown":"Before Anyone makes it duplicate I have scene all the RxDatasource tags on SO and other sites also.

That&#39;s not how `match` works. There&#39;s no pattern that matches numbers greater than a certain value. Patterns are about structure and specific values (essentially).\r\n\r\nYou could replace your `match` with `if ... then ... else if ...` to get a meaningful function.\r\n\r\nYou can, as @TheoWinterhalter suggests, use `match x with ... | x when x &gt; 10 ...`, but this is just an elaborate way of writing an `if` statement.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329571/simple-recursion-program-in-ocaml-iterating-until-10/58329964#58329964","title":"Simple recursion program in OCaml, iterating until 10"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":11971155,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--oo7LWeYnTA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf4pgpeXDwCqYR__WWFwWIYhFcaFg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lamebro1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11971155/lamebro1"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58329964,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570736009,"creation_date":1570734341,"question_id":58329571,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329571","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a simple OCaml program using a recursive function which checks an input (x) and either increments by 1 or decrements by 1 until the value of x is 10.\r\n\r\nThis is what I currently have -\r\n\r\n    let rec until_ten x =\r\n      match x with\r\n      10 -&gt; 1\r\n      | x &gt; 10 -&gt; until_ten x - 1\r\n      | x &lt; 10 -&gt; until_ten x + 1\r\n      ;;\r\n\r\nWhere have I gone wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329571/simple-recursion-program-in-ocaml-iterating-until-10","title":"Simple recursion program in OCaml, iterating until 10"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","express","sequelize.js"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12197071,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pJMtHjGetAA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdvGXM-KYM03k54EqZKgoyXY7z2dg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Manuel Guzman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12197071/manuel-guzman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12197071,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pJMtHjGetAA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdvGXM-KYM03k54EqZKgoyXY7z2dg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Manuel Guzman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12197071/manuel-guzman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570741684,"creation_date":1570734311,"last_edit_date":1570741684,"question_id":58329565,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329565","body_markdown":"I&#39;m setting up a backend server with node, express, passport and sequelize with mysql as database.

generally don&#39;t want to nest class definitions the way you did.  What if you had a car that could use a different kind of engine?  Like, say, a 4-liter vs. a 2-liter?  Or normally aspirated vs. turbo charged?  What you might want to do instead is pass in the `Engine` as a parameter to the `Car`.\r\n\r\nRegarding your actual problem of obtaining values from these objects, you also need to define how values can be obtained and/or changed.  A constructor does the initial work, but what if the `Engine` or `Car` have values that need to be changed or obtained during the program&#39;s lifestyle?

Kafka then is probably using a different partitioning logic that send A and C to one partition while B and D are written to another.\r\n\r\nFlink doesn&#39;t seem to want to expose the key group for a given key, but if your parallelism for the sink is the same as the number of Kafka partitions, then you should be able to use the task_id of the sink instance in custom Kafka partitioning logic.

The only way I’ve found to get my desired output is too list all the possible timestamps…\n\n    $xml.root.Item&#160;|&#160;Select-Object&#160;IDValue,&#160;Date,&#160;ItemType,&#160;@{N=&#39;DataVal&#39;;E={$_.Info&#160;|&#160;ForEach-Object&#160;{@{&quot;$((Get-Date&#160;$_.Timestamp).ToString(&#39;HH:mm&#39;))&quot;=$_.Value}}}}&#160;|\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Select-Object&#160;IDValue,&#160;Date,&#160;ItemType,\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; @{N=&#39;00:00&#39;;E={$_.DataVal.&#39;00:00&#39;}},\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; @{N=&#39;00:15&#39;;E={$_.DataVal.&#39;00:15&#39;}},\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The above is just a simple cut-down version\n\nI think the use of ForEach-Object is outputting an array of hashtables, which makes it unsuitable for the -ExpandProperty to work as I want it?\n\nAny suggestion for what direction to go from here??\n\nThanks\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329538/powershell-object-with-hashtable-expanded-into-transposed-columns","title":"PowerShell object with hashtable expanded into transposed columns"},{"tags":["php","wordpress"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":9655497,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2e494e8abb6e11980ffdcd86cec83979?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"KGreene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9655497/kgreene"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570734735,"creation_date":1570734735,"answer_id":58329664,"question_id":58329535,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58329664","body_markdown":"The 2nd loop seems superfluous.\r\n\r\n    foreach ($offices as $office) {\r\n       $postMetaArray[$office-&gt;ID] = get_post_meta($office-&gt;ID, &#39;&#39;, false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nShould get you an array of all the meta data keyed with its  ID.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329535/get-post-meta-on-a-wp-query-call/58329664#58329664","title":"get_post_meta on a WP_Query call"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":6897985,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yfcu7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ususipse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6897985/ususipse"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570735781,"creation_date":1570735781,"answer_id":58329911,"question_id":58329535,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58329911","body_markdown":"Yes that is an infinite loop.\r\n\r\n    foreach ($offices as $office) {\r\n        while ($offices-&gt;have_posts()) {\r\n            get_post_meta($office, &#39;id&#39;, $office-&gt;id);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe foreach loop has no end as nothing is done with $office.

You can either rely on NHibernate trying to modify the current schema, or [write migration scripts yourself][1].\r\n\r\nFor example, adding a property will result in an additional column that will be created by NHibernate. That column will have no value for all the saga data that is already present. Removing a property will remove the column and the data will be lost.\r\n\r\nModifying a complex object in a collection will provide difficulties. The best way to know if this works for your project is actually perform the upgrade and verify during development and in a test environment.\r\n\r\nI suspect you&#39;re running for a while already, otherwise are SQL Persister (which doesn&#39;t use an OR/M) uses JSON serialized objects to store data inside a single column and it relies on the flexibility of the serializer to migrate from version to version. Our customers have had much better results with that than with NHibernate.\r\n\r\nBut as I said. An option is to look at the before and after states and create migration scripts yourself.

We&#39;re now in the process of refactoring our solution such that we&#39;ll have a specific project where properties of our NServiceBus classes will be defined. We&#39;re doing this to hopefully decouple the Nsb layer from the rest of the application, and to avoid avoid unnecessary pollution of our Nsb classes as the solution&#39;s Model project changes.\r\n\r\nThe Nsb specific Model (Nsb.Model) project will closely mirror the central Model project, and AutoMapper will take care of mapping our objects from Nsb.Model &lt;-&gt; Model.\r\n\r\nI think we don&#39;t need to be too worried about refactoring our Message classes, as it should be safe enough to simply deploy this change when there are no in-flight messages (we&#39;ll have plenty of opportunities to do this)\r\n\r\nI&#39;m more worried about our Saga and SagaData classes. There&#39;s always going to be some Saga&#39;s running (mostly dormant waiting for Timeouts) and I&#39;m worried that issues could come up with already running Saga&#39;s when we make changes to the SagaData class. The changes to the SagaData classes are basically referencing a new assembly (Nsb.Model) which has all the same classes as the old assembly (Model). One of the classes has been renamed in the new assembly, other than that they&#39;re all identical to the old ones.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;re using NHibernate as our persistance. I&#39;ve tried single Saga&#39;s on our testing environments and deploying the changes while the Saga waits for a Timeout, and it looks like it basically has no issues with the updated assembly nor the name change of one of it&#39;s properties class. However I&#39;m reluctant to deploy this to production without fully understanding what effects this could have and whether our application will stay healthy once this gets deployed.\r\n\r\nAny insight is very much appreciated.

I&#39;m jumping to Ionic 4 after only having experience in Ionic 1, and there are a lot of growing pains involved. In my Ionic 1 apps, I had a lot of functions that included ionic popups, and the popup would be integral to the function completing.\r\n\r\nNamely, I am using code similar to this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55041136/5306408\r\n\r\nThe way my overall code essentially works is that:\r\n\r\n - I have a clickable item in a page. \r\n - Clicking on that page initiates a service function. \r\n - The service function calls a URL, and under ideal circumstances returns the data retrieved from that URL to the page. \r\n - However, under some conditions, the user will be required to supply additional information. Ideally, I would like this to happen in a modal: once the user fills out the correct information, the modal is closed, and then the function would continue on to perform its initial goal of calling a URL and returning the data retrieved from it, and returning it to the page in step 1 as intended.\r\n\r\nBasically:\r\n\r\nPage:\r\n\r\n    ... \r\n    \r\n    pageFunction() void {\r\n        this.someService.someFunction(&#39;someURL&#39;).then(dataFromTheURL) =&gt; {\r\n            //do something with dataFromTheURL\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n\r\nsomeService:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    async openModal(params) {\r\n        const modal = await this.modalController.create({\r\n            component: someLoginModalPage,\r\n            componentProps: { ... }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        modal.onDidDismiss().then((dataReturned) =&gt; {\r\n            //need a way to pass dataReturned back to pageFunction()\r\n        });\r\n \r\n        return await modal.present();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    someFunction(url): Promise&lt;any&gt; {\r\n        return new Promise&lt;any&gt;((resolve) {\r\n            if (condition is fine and no modal is needed) {\r\n                this.http.get(url, {headers: someHeaderObject}).subscribe(result =&gt; {\r\n                    resolve(result)\r\n                })\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                //here is the crux of the problem - I need indicatorThatModalHasBeenClosed to come from the modal being closed, not opened\r\n                this.openModal(someParams).then((indicatorThatModalHasBeenClosed) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n                    //do something with indicatorThatModalHasBeenClosed\r\n\r\n                    this.http.get(url, {headers: someHeaderObject}).subscribe(result =&gt; {\r\n                        resolve(result)\r\n                    })\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs this possible to do with Angular modals? I&#39;m having difficulty finding any examples of it, because the code for `openModal` returns the `modal.present()` result, not the data that is passed through `modal.onDidDismiss()`. Ultimately, I want a function (returning a Promise) that opens the modal to resolve with the data that is provided by closing that same modal.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329514/resuming-a-function-after-modal-is-dismissed","title":"Resuming a function after modal is dismissed"},{"tags":["c#","process"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":5334191,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gaZ2GJ9PG1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARM/81w9_b_schg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"yob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5334191/yob"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570739655,"post_id":58329510,"comment_id":103019270,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329510/c-process-monitoring-application-that-is-not-a-child-process#comment103019270_58329510"},{"owner":{"reputation":121,"user_id":1561777,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XhulK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David.Warwick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1561777/david-warwick"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":117,"user_id":5334191,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gaZ2GJ9PG1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARM/81w9_b_schg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"yob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5334191/yob"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570744131,"post_id":58329510,"comment_id":103020824,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329510/c-process-monitoring-application-that-is-not-a-child-process#comment103020824_58329510"}],"owner":{"reputation":121,"user_id":1561777,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XhulK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David.Warwick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1561777/david-warwick"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570734078,"creation_date":1570734078,"question_id":58329510,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329510","body_markdown":"I have a solution of several Windows Forms applications. I also have a SQL Server. I created an app that is meant to show us who is using one of our applications and what machine they are on by uploading the name of the app, user name, path to the executable they launched, and date / time it launched to a table in the SQL Server. \r\n\r\nThe user starts one of our apps. We will call it the parent app. The parent app starts the WhoIsLoggedIn.exe app and passes the process ID of the parent app to it. The WhoIsLoggedIn app, uploads the info to the SQL Server and then periodically checks to see if the parent process is running. When it is no longer running, the WhoIsLoggedIn app runs a DELETE query to to delete the previously inserted record from the table.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the WhoIsLoggedIn app is a child of the parent app in the process tree, so if a user clicks End Task in the task manager, both apps end immediately and the WhoIsLoggedIn app doesn&#39;t have a chance to DELETE the record from the SQL Server table. If the user closes the parent app normally (or by End Process), then as soon as the WhoIsLoggedIn app notices that the parent process is no longer running, it runs a DELETE query to remove the User / Parent App record from the SQL Server table.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone brings it up, due to STIG&#39;s, we do not have access to the command prompt, so I cannot use CMD to start the WhoIsLoggedIn application.\r\n\r\nAre there other ways to do this besides say, creating a service that watches for our apps?\r\n\r\nI have tried setting ShellExecute to both True and False, but that didn&#39;t work. I tried starting the process from Program.cs and from the parent application Form_Load event, and nothing works.\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329510/c-process-monitoring-application-that-is-not-a-child-process","title":"C# Process Monitoring Application That Is Not a Child Process"},{"tags":["geojson","kml"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1533,"user_id":2062634,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a82e5fa55b83b78758074389161af09?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Meyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2062634/michael-meyer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570792979,"post_id":58329509,"comment_id":103035703,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329509/how-convert-kml-to-geojson-in-java#comment103035703_58329509"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12197092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b2a457551bb846a9c76c47caef6b824?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"evertonmacc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12197092/evertonmacc"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570734072,"creation_date":1570734072,"question_id":58329509,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329509","body_markdown":"I can not convert kml to geojson, someone can put an example code and also the libraries used in pom.xml.

The **front** of the queue is pointed at by `f` (which is where values are pulled from), and the **rear** of the queue is pointed at by `r` (where new values are added to the queue).\r\n\r\nThe queue first is empty, and the neighbors `j` of current vertex `v` are added to the queue (at its &quot;rear&quot; side). When a vertex `j` is in the queue, its `visit[j]` is set to 1, otherwise it is 0. This is to prevent that the same vertex is added twice to the queue.\r\n\r\nFrom the front of the queue, the next vertex is pulled. Now it is considered visited, so `visited[v]` is now set to 1 and `visit[v]` is cleared (this is a bit overkill, but OK). Again, this ensures that vertexes are only visited (and output) once.\r\n\r\nBy using a queue, we are sure that vertexes are visited in order of their distance (in terms of number of edges) from the initial vertex.\r\n\r\nAs there are `n` vertices, they will all be visited when the outer loop has iterated `n` times.

Apparently it includes the Harfbuzz library, since I had to build using `skia_use_system_harfbuzz=false`, so it seems like everything should be there under the hood.  If I draw, say, Chinese text with a Chinese font, no problems.  But if I ask for &quot;Helvetica&quot; and draw Chinese text, no good.  Both macOS and Windows let me do this, and they look up the best matching Chinese font under the hood and use that.  Skia does have SkFontMgr, which will find the typeface for a given unicode character.  So I would have to iterate through all the characters and figure out which pieces of the string need which typefaces, but there don&#39;t seem to be any functions exposed that produce an SkUnichar.  Furthermore, SkFontMgr returns SkTypeface*, but all the drawing functions require an SkFont, which gets constructed from sk_sp&lt;SkTypeface*&gt;.  I&#39;m guessing making a shared pointer from this pointer is a bad idea, especially as the documentation says I need to do typeface-&gt;unref() (but doesn&#39;t say when, and if I do, memory gets corrupted).
