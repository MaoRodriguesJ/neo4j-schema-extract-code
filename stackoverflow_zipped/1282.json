Essentially, the app appears to be frozen, but I don&#39;t get any error messages.\r\n\r\nAfter numerous attempts to fix the problem in two different pages that contain FocusNodes and TextEditingControllers, I went back to square one by incorporating a new page with code straight from Flutter&#39;s website, but the TextField in this barebones code still locks up the app.\r\n\r\n    import &#39;package:flutter/material.dart&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    class EventDetailForm extends StatefulWidget {\r\n      static const String routeName = &quot;/events/event-detail-form&quot;;\r\n      @override\r\n      _EventDetailFormState createState() =&gt; _EventDetailFormState();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class _EventDetailFormState extends State&lt;EventDetailForm&gt; {\r\n      final myController = TextEditingController();\r\n      @override\r\n      void dispose() {\r\n        myController.dispose();\r\n        super.dispose();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n        return Scaffold(\r\n          appBar: AppBar(title: Text(&#39;Event Detail&#39;)),\r\n          body: Padding(\r\n              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),\r\n              child: TextField(\r\n                controller: myController,\r\n              )),\r\n          floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\r\n            onPressed: () {\r\n              return showDialog(\r\n                  context: context,\r\n                  builder: (context) {\r\n                    return AlertDialog(\r\n                      content: Text(myController.text),\r\n                    );\r\n                  });\r\n            },\r\n            child: Icon(Icons.text_fields),\r\n          ),\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am not getting any error messages.  The cursor just blinks in the TextField and everything else loses function and I have to quit and restart.  I am not sure what else I should be considering.

that we&#39;ve gone over and clarified the requirements a bit, there&#39;s a couple of bad news for you:\r\n\r\n1. You&#39;re not getting away from the requirement to have a wrapping type. As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve discovered, this is because no floating-point type implements `Ord`\r\n2. You&#39;re also not getting away from a combinator of some sort\r\n\r\nFirst, we&#39;re going to clear up your `impl`, as they both have shortfalls described in the comments. In the future, it may make sense to use the wrapper traits in `eq-float`, as they already implement all this. The implementations at fault are `PartialEq` and `Ord`, and they both break down on a few points.

Your current combinator will force a range of elements to be stored temporarily in memory, to then discard one. We can do better by abusing the fact that `iter()` is a **sorted** iterator. So, we can skip while we search, and then take the first:\r\n\r\n            let mut first_element = ww.iter()\r\n                .skip_while(|(i, _)| *i &lt; &amp;FloatWrapper::new(1.5)) // Skipping all elements before it\r\n                .take(1) // Reducing the iterator to 1 element\r\n                .map(|(_, &amp;v)| v) // Getting its value, dereferenced\r\n                .next(); // Our result\r\n\r\nThis yields a 10% speedup in low-element-count situations over your first implementation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237337/can-i-perform-binary-tree-search-with-the-standard-library-without-wrapping-the/58238731#58238731","title":"Can I perform binary tree search with the standard library without wrapping the float type and abusing the BTreeMap?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9493,"user_id":3650362,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fqdi1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"trentcl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3650362/trentcl"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570548659,"creation_date":1570548659,"answer_id":58289562,"question_id":58237337,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58289562","body_markdown":"You said you wanted a std-only solution, but this is a common enough problem, so here&#39;s a solution using the crate `ordered-float`:\r\n\r\n### Cargo.toml\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[dependencies]\r\nordered-float = &quot;1.0&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### main.rs\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse ordered_float::OrderedFloat; // 1.0.2\r\nuse std::collections::BTreeMap;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut ww = BTreeMap::new();\r\n    ww.insert(OrderedFloat(1.0), &quot;one&quot;);\r\n    ww.insert(OrderedFloat(2.0), &quot;two&quot;);\r\n    ww.insert(OrderedFloat(3.0), &quot;three&quot;);\r\n    ww.insert(OrderedFloat(4.0), &quot;three&quot;);\r\n    let rez = ww.range(OrderedFloat(1.5)..).next().map(|(_, &amp;v)| v);\r\n\r\n    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, rez);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[prints](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=0306784d56d234723bc31fea69403354)\r\n\r\n    Some(&quot;two&quot;)\r\n\r\nNow, isn&#39;t that nice and clean?

I am not sure if &#39;kernel&#39; is the correct mathematical term (I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not), but it&#39;s what I&#39;m going to use.\r\n- The relation `R` is *reflexive* if `R(a, a)` for any `a` which occurs either in the domain or the range of the relation.\r\n- The *transitive closure* of `R`, `R*` is the relation such that `R*(a, b` if `R(a, b)` or (`R(a, c)` and `R*(c, b)`).\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m going to implement the kernel of the map just as a list, and I will explicitly use `car`, `cdr`, and `cons` to extract the parts of entries in the kernel.  This is grotty old-fashioned Lisp, but in this case it&#39;s pretty much fine, since the natural objects in this part of the language (conses) map very nicely onto the objects in the problem.  Note also that I have not tried to use any fancy data structures at all: everything is just walking down lists.  This would make the thing slow if the kernel was very large.  But it&#39;s not very large.\r\n\r\nHere is the kernel you are given:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(defparameter *kernel*\r\n  &#39;((1 . 1)\r\n    (1 . 2)\r\n    (2 . 1)\r\n    (2 . 2)\r\n    (3 . 1)\r\n    (3 . 4)\r\n    (4 . 1)\r\n    (4 . 2)\r\n    (4 . 4)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis kernel is not reflexive: `(3 . 3)` is missing for instance.  Here is a function which, given a kernel, returns a reflexive version of it.  This function has very poor complexity, but the kernel is small and the function gets called once.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(defun reflexifize-kernel (kernel)\r\n  ;; given the kernel of a map, return a reflexive version of it\r\n  ;; This has pretty grotty complexity but it gets called only once\r\n  (loop for element in (loop with d/r = &#39;()\r\n                             for e in kernel\r\n                             do (pushnew (car e) d/r)\r\n                             do (pushnew (cdr e) d/r)\r\n                             finally (return d/r))\r\n        for ik = (cons element element)\r\n        unless (member ik kernel :test #&#39;equal)\r\n        collect ik into identities\r\n        finally (return (append kernel identities))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we can check this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*)\r\n((1 . 1)\r\n (1 . 2)\r\n (2 . 1)\r\n (2 . 2)\r\n (3 . 1)\r\n (3 . 4)\r\n (4 . 1)\r\n (4 . 2)\r\n (4 . 4)\r\n (3 . 3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see it&#39;s added the appropriate entry at the end (and it would have added more entries if it needed to).\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;ll write a function which, given the left-hand-side of a mapping and a kernel returns two things:\r\n\r\n- the first match for this left-hand-side in the kernel, or `nil` if there is none;\r\n- the remainder of the kernel after this match, or `()` if there is one (note that `nil` and `()` are the same in Common Lisp, but they might not be in other Lisps).\r\n\r\nThe nice thing here is that we can just use the remainder of the kernel to look for more matches, and this function works really nicely with the implementation of the kernel above: this is a case where Lisp&#39;s data structures really work well for us.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(defun next-match (lhs kernel)\r\n  ;; return the next match (as (lhs . rhs)) for lhs in kernel, and the\r\n  ;; remainder of the kernel, or nil and () if there is no match\r\n  (let ((found (member lhs kernel :key #&#39;car)))\r\n    (if found\r\n        (values (first found) (rest found))\r\n      (values nil &#39;()))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, now we can write a function, `Rp` which is true if `R(a, b)` is true:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(defun Rp (lhs rhs kernel)\r\n  ;; is R(lhs, rhs) true\r\n  (multiple-value-bind (entry remaining-kernel) (next-match lhs kernel)\r\n    (cond ((null entry)\r\n           nil)\r\n          ((eql (cdr entry) rhs)\r\n           t)\r\n          (t (Rp lhs rhs remaining-kernel)))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is called `Rp` because it&#39;s a predicate (ending in `p` in the usual Lisp convention), and it tells us if two elements satisfy `R`.  And of course since CL is case-insensitive by default, this is the same function as `rp`.\r\n\r\nAnd this function works fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n &gt; (rp 1 1 (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*))\r\nt\r\n\r\n&gt; (rp 1 3 (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*))\r\nnil\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now we can write `R*p`: it&#39;s clearer, I think and certainly more efficient to write a &#39;unified&#39; version of `R*p` which does not rely on `Rp`, but is very similar code with it: it&#39;s really just got a final step which searches for the transitive closure.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(defun R*p (lhs rhs kernel)\r\n  ;; is lhs related to rhs in kernel? (See note below!)\r\n  (multiple-value-bind (entry remaining-kernel) (next-match lhs kernel)\r\n    (if (null entry)\r\n        nil\r\n      (let ((match-rhs (cdr entry)))\r\n        (if (eql rhs match-rhs)\r\n            t\r\n          (or (R*p lhs rhs remaining-kernel)\r\n              (R*p match-rhs rhs kernel)))))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOK, so this looks obviously correct, right?\r\n\r\n1. first we look for a match for `lhs`;\r\n2. if there&#39;s a match, and its rhs is `rhs` then we&#39;re done;\r\n3. if there isn&#39;t then\r\n\t1. first search for more matches in the kernel and check them\r\n\t2. if that fails look for matches for the rhs we found whose rhs is `rhs`.\r\n\r\nAnd this is just transparently the definition of the transitive closure, right?  So if we feed it a reflexive kernel (which we can create now), it will work.\r\n\r\nWell, no, it won&#39;t work.  It won&#39;t work because there are loops in the kernel you&#39;ve been given.  Let&#39;s say we want to call `(R*p 1 3 (reflexivize-kernel *kernel*))`.  It&#39;s obvious from the kernel that this should be false.\r\n\r\nBut in fact the function fails to terminate.  It fails to terminate because it finds there&#39;s an entry for `R(1, 2)` and so it starts looking for `R*(2, 3)`: it then finds `R(2, 1)`, starts looking for `R*(1, 3)` ... oops.\r\n\r\n(Note that the implementation above does depth-first search. Breadth-first search doesn&#39;t help: it *will* help find a mapping when there *is* one but when there isn&#39;t it will just loop in the same way.)\r\n\r\nThe way to deal with this is to use what&#39;s called an *occurs check*: when searching we keep track of the things we have already looked at up the search tree.  If we find we&#39;re looking at a lhs which we have already looked at we fail immediately, as this is a loop.  Here is an implementation of a version of `R*p` which does that, using a local function so we don&#39;t need to provide the `so-far` list in the interface, whichh would be annoying.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(defun R*p (lhs rhs kernel)\r\n  ;; is lhs related to rhs in kernel, with an occurs check.\r\n  (labels ((R*p-loop (lhs rhs kernel so-far)\r\n             (if (member lhs so-far)\r\n                 ;; we&#39;ve looped, give up\r\n                 nil\r\n               (multiple-value-bind (entry remaining-kernel)\r\n                   (next-match lhs kernel)\r\n                 (if (null entry)\r\n                     nil\r\n                   (let ((match-rhs (cdr entry)))\r\n                     (if (eql rhs match-rhs)\r\n                         t\r\n                       (or (R*p-loop lhs rhs remaining-kernel so-far)\r\n                           (R*p-loop match-rhs rhs kernel\r\n                                          (cons lhs so-far))))))))))\r\n    (R*p-loop lhs rhs kernel &#39;())))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this version works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; (R*p 1 3 (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*))\r\nnil\r\n\r\n&gt; (R*p 1 1 (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*))\r\nt\r\n\r\n&gt; (R*p 1 2 (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*))\r\nt\r\n\r\n&gt; (R*p 2 1 (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*))\r\nt\r\n\r\n&gt; (R*p 2 3 (reflexifize-kernel *kernel*))\r\nnil\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237333/i-am-beginer-in-lisp-how-create-transitive-function-in-lisp-for-r-relation/58270313#58270313","title":"I am beginer in lisp.

I do not want to append it to every single uri in the GUI as I could have many more uri and appending it to every single uri will not be an efficient solution. \r\n\r\nIs there any &quot;clean&quot; and logical way to do it?

However, when I try to parse the body of a POST request using koa-bodyparser, the service just hangs until it eventually times out.\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurs when using other body parsers, such as koa-body, and it seems to persist no matter where I put the parser, unless I put it after the router, in which case the problem goes away, though I still can&#39;t access the data, since it never gets a chance to be parsed(?).\r\n\r\nThe following is a stripped-down version of the code that&#39;s causing the problem:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as functions from &#39;firebase-functions&#39;\r\nimport * as Koa from &#39;koa&#39;\r\nimport * as KoaRouter from &#39;koa-router&#39;\r\nimport * as KoaBodyParser from &#39;koa-bodyparser&#39;\r\n\r\nconst app = new Koa()\r\nconst router = new KoaRouter()\r\n\r\napp.use(KoaBodyParser())\r\n\r\nrouter.post(&#39;/&#39;, (context) =&gt; {\r\n  // do some stuff with the data\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.use(router.routes())\r\n\r\nexport const serve = functions.https.onRequest(app.callback())\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m still pretty new to all of these tools and I might be missing something completely obvious, but I can&#39;t seem to find the solution anywhere. If I&#39;m not mistaken, FCF automatically parses requests, but Koa is unable to access that data unless it does the parsing itself, so I&#39;d assume that something is going wrong between FCF&#39;s automatic parsing and the parser used by Koa.\r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t been able to produce any actual errors or useful error messages, other than a Gateway Timeout (504), so I don&#39;t have much to go on and won&#39;t be able to provide you with much more than I already have.\r\n\r\nHow do I go about getting a hold of the data?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237305/post-request-hangs-timeout-when-trying-to-parse-request-body-running-koa-on-f","title":"POST request hangs (timeout) when trying to parse request body, running Koa on Firebase Cloud Functions"},{"tags":["html","css","asp.net"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":50750,"user_id":6144,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/282eed17fcb9682bb2816697482b64ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"scunliffe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6144/scunliffe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570195505,"post_id":58237303,"comment_id":102847465,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237303/how-to-find-all-the-places-where-a-specific-element-is-used-in-the-website#comment102847465_58237303"},{"owner":{"reputation":24902,"user_id":1139830,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ee9qe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1139830/mason"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570196244,"post_id":58237303,"comment_id":102847856,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237303/how-to-find-all-the-places-where-a-specific-element-is-used-in-the-website#comment102847856_58237303"},{"owner":{"reputation":439,"user_id":7582578,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2581e7c48f948b8c1f24794aaa1227f6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nhrcpt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7582578/nhrcpt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570287447,"post_id":58237303,"comment_id":102869537,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237303/how-to-find-all-the-places-where-a-specific-element-is-used-in-the-website#comment102869537_58237303"}],"owner":{"reputation":439,"user_id":7582578,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2581e7c48f948b8c1f24794aaa1227f6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nhrcpt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7582578/nhrcpt"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570195335,"creation_date":1570195335,"question_id":58237303,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58237303","body_markdown":"I need to find all the places on the website where a particular image is used. as an example, I have an element (image), &quot;src=&quot;/static/img/legends/Icon-Parking.png&quot; and I need to find if this is used in multiple places of the website we are testing.

Cursor data = mDatabaseHelper.getData();\r\n\r\n        //Create an Array list\r\n        final ArrayList&lt;String&gt; listData = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n\r\n        //Declare json array\r\n        final JSONArray datatoperse = new JSONArray();\r\n\r\n\r\n        //Store the result in array using while loop\r\n        while (data.moveToNext()){\r\n            //get the value from the database in column 1\r\n            //than add to array list\r\n            listData.add(data.getString(1));\r\n\r\n            //append data to json array\r\n            datatoperse.put(data.getString(1));\r\n\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.println(datatoperse.toString());\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**THE system.out.print looks like this**\r\n   \r\n\r\n     I/System.out: [&quot;name1&quot;,&quot;name2&quot;,&quot;name3&quot;]\r\n\r\nI then save the data into the JSON array.\r\nNext, I want to send the HTTP request to the server.\r\n\r\n      String url = &quot;server host name&quot;;\r\n    \r\n            JsonArrayRequest request = new JsonArrayRequest(Request.Method.POST, url, null, new Response.Listener&lt;JSONArray&gt;() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onResponse(JSONArray response) {\r\n    \r\n                    final String result = response.toString();\r\n                    Log.d(&quot;Response&quot;,&quot;result :&quot;

to.\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n\r\n     //Receive the RAW post data.\r\n    $content = $_POST[&quot;name&quot;];\r\n    //$json = &#39;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;wewqewq&quot;}&#39;;\r\n    $obj = json_decode($content);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n     $insert_stmt = $mysqli_scs-&gt;prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO xamarinuserregister_ur (name) VALUES (?)&quot;);\r\n     $name =$obj-&gt;{&#39;name&#39;};\r\n

what I am doing wrong. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if my JSON is working ok or not.\r\n\r\nCan someone help me out please.

However, I think I misunderstand something. When I call libxml_disable_external_entities(false); I would think that external entities are now loaded, however, external entities does not seem to load. \r\n\r\nWhen I set the flag LIBXML_NOENT, it does work. But that leaves me with the question, what does libxml_disable_external_entities actually do then? I have set it both to false and true, with the same results.\r\n\r\nSo I went to the internet with the same question and noticed a CVE report on the ubuntu website (I have tested on ubuntu). The CVE stated that libxml is standard vulnerable to XXE. The fix was to stop loading external entities by default. See: https://usn.ubuntu.com/1904-1/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy test setup:\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n  $xml= &#39;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;\r\n  &lt;!DOCTYPE foo [  \r\n  &lt;!ELEMENT foo ANY &gt;\r\n  &lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM &quot;http://www.localhost:8000&quot; &gt;]&gt;&lt;foo&gt;&amp;xxe;&lt;/foo&gt;&#39;;\r\n  \r\n  libxml_disable_entity_loader(false);\r\n  $document = new DOMDocument();\r\n  $document-&gt;loadXML($xml); \r\n?&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected my webserver to receive a call, but it did not. The PHP handler gives me no output. So my question: what does libxml_disable_entity_loader actually do? \r\n\r\nPS: Could not find anything in libxml code either. Could find the fix to stop loading external entities unless otherwise stated, though. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I have found that it only works with the combination if libxml_disable_entitiy_loader(false); and the LIBXML_NOENT flag set in the &#39;loadXML&#39; method.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nThe method does the following (in PHP code):\r\n```\r\nPHP_LIBXML_API zend_bool php_libxml_disable_entity_loader(zend_bool disable) /* {{{ */\r\n{\r\n\tzend_bool old = LIBXML(entity_loader_disabled);\r\n\r\n\tLIBXML(entity_loader_disabled) = disable;\r\n\treturn old;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, searching for entity_loader_disabled yields no results in libxml

I wasn&#39;t aware that navigation works like this.\r\n\r\n    ControlButtonWidget(\r\n            icon: Icons.settings,\r\n            iconSize: 72.0,\r\n            onPressedHandler: () async {\r\n              Map results = await Navigator.of(context).push(\r\n                  new MaterialPageRoute(\r\n                      builder: (context) =&gt; SettingsWidget(model)));\r\n              \r\n              if (results != null &amp;&amp; results.containsKey(&quot;newSetting&quot;)){\r\n                SettingsModel model = results[&quot;newSetting&quot;];\r\n                ScopedModel.of&lt;TimeService&gt;(context).setTime(model.minutes, model.seconds);\r\n              }\r\n            })\r\n\r\nMake sure to wrap your page in a [WillPopScope Widget][2].\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n    Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return new WillPopScope(\r\n        onWillPop: _backRequestedHandler,\r\n        child: LayoutBuilder(builder:\r\n            (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints viewportConstraints) {\r\n          return Scaffold(\r\n              appBar: new AppBar(title: Text(&quot;Settings&quot;)),\r\n              body: ...\r\n                      \r\n        }));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Future&lt;bool&gt; _backRequestedHandler() {\r\n      Navigator.of(context).pop({&#39;newSetting&#39;: _settingsModel});\r\n      return new Future.value(true);\r\n    } \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cogitas.net/know-user-tapped-back-button-back-navigation-arrow-flutter/\r\n  [2]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WillPopScope-class.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237261/updated-values-get-overridden-on-widget-redraw/58244062#58244062","title":"Updated values get overridden on Widget redraw"}],"owner":{"reputation":1196,"user_id":1085665,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e788d49389d9650902505c56b2c2495?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"xmashallax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1085665/xmashallax"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1196,"user_id":1085665,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e788d49389d9650902505c56b2c2495?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"xmashallax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1085665/xmashallax"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58244062,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570231565,"creation_date":1570195180,"last_edit_date":1570230875,"question_id":58237261,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58237261","body_markdown":"I am playing around with a simple flutter countdown app. It consists of 2 pages, the clock and a settings page to set minutes and seconds to be counted down.\r\n\r\nOn the clock page (HomeWidget) the user clicks a button to navigate to the settings page.

But in the code sample the time service is updated every time the clock gets redrawn (every second). The countdown doesn&#39;t work, the value remains the same. Instead of displaying &quot;10:29&quot;, it sticks with &quot;10:30&quot;. I don&#39;t know how to handle the dependency between my TimeService class and my SettingsModel class.\r\n\r\nHow can I handle the assignment of the settings values in the time service class properly when the user navigates back? The `build` method is obviously the wrong place. Can anyone give me a hint?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237261/updated-values-get-overridden-on-widget-redraw","title":"Updated values get overridden on Widget

The best way to figure out what iteration limit is used is to look at the source code [here](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/blob/master/svm.cpp).

there seems no relation between the RAIL channel and the Flash channel, you will need a table that you can index by RAIL channel.\r\n\r\nYou have updated your question woth the requirement for the reverse lookup too. This could be done using a secondary table to map flash to raid, then (if needed) lookup the details such as frequency and word in the Raid table:\r\n\r\n\tstruct {\r\n\t\tint Flash;\r\n\t\tdouble freq;\r\n\t\tDWORD ChannelID;\r\n\t\t//...\r\n\t} myTable[] = {\t\t// table indexed by RAIL channel number\r\n\t\t{0, 0.0, 0},\r\n\t\t{20, 340.04, 0x0CCC0CCC},\r\n\t\t{25, 340.40, 0x07C707C7}\r\n\t\t//...\r\n\t};\r\n\tint getFlashFromRAIL(int RAIL)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn myTable[RAIL].Flash;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// table of RAIL channel numbers, indexed by Flash channel number\r\n\tint myTableInv[] = { 0, 16, 18 /*...*/ };\r\n\r\n\tdouble getFreqFromFlash(int Flash) // return frequency for Flash channel number\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn myTable[myTableInv[Flash]].freq;\r\n\t}\r\n\tint getRAILFromFlash(int Flash) // return RAIL channel number for Flash channel number\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn myTableInv[Flash];\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nNote: As both RAIL and Flash channel numbers start at 1, but C indexes are from `0..n-1`, a first entry in each table is added so the channel numbers can be used to index the arrays.\r\n\r\n__EDIT__\r\n\r\nGiven our discussion in the comments, the following is the simplified solution:\r\n\r\n\tint RAIL2Flash_table[] = {0, 20, 25, 19 /*...*/};\r\n\tint Flash2RAIL_table[] = {0, 16, 18, 20 /*...*/};\r\n\t\r\n\tint RAIL2Flash(int RAIL)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn RAIL2Flash_table[RAIL];\r\n\t}\r\n\tint Flash2RAIL(int Flash)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn Flash2RAIL_table[Flash];\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSo each entry `x` of the `RAIL2Flash_table` has a `RAIL` channel number corresponding to the index `x`. So `RAIL` channel 1 is in the array entry 1 and has `Flash` channel number 20, etceter. The same for the other table.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237240/need-a-help-in-what-algorithmic-way-to-approach-this-problem/58237358#58237358","title":"need a help in what algorithmic way to approach this problem"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":11176533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94d32bd7d245621b83d29b2f59c04bfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Embedded","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11176533/embedded"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64909,"user_id":168986,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqorX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clifford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/168986/clifford"},"comment_count":18,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58237358,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570264522,"creation_date":1570195083,"last_edit_date":1570264522,"question_id":58237240,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58237240","body_markdown":"I am working on SUB-GHZ frequency range for transmitting and receiving through a radio board.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nfrom the table above if I select Flash Channel- 1 as input, it should map me to the Rail Channel 16.\r\n\r\nIf I select Flash Channel 20, it should automatically map me to Rail Channel 1.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me here on how to approach it, like some sample coding?\r\n\r\nLanguage used is C.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/x3T6K.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237240/need-a-help-in-what-algorithmic-way-to-approach-this-problem","title":"need a help in what algorithmic way to approach this problem"},{"tags":["php","email"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12164619,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/235bbe71cf4ebe5cead484286430346f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fedexdev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12164619/fedexdev"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570195177,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570195081,"creation_date":1570195081,"question_id":58237239,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58237239","body_markdown":"I&#39;m not interested in using a thirdparty application to send emails (Apart sendmail as that is necessary to run mail() ).

Basically, you are controlling the flow of the program. If you define these functions, you can then call them from your game. \r\n\r\nMy advise:\r\n\r\n1. Think about what you want your code to do.\r\n2. Map it out as a diagram or psuedo-code.\r\n3. Code it.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you copy-pasted the code, without knowing what it does, or knowing what you want it to do.

To elaborate..\r\n\r\n- The top level is Projects\r\n\r\n- Each Project can have an infinite number of Tasks\r\n\r\n- Each Task can have an infinite number of SubTasks\r\n\r\n- Depending on there access, each employee can be assigned on any level of this system, and have complete access to all sub-levels there-in. To elaborate, an employee can be assigned a task, they then have access to that task and all work orders attached to that task.\r\n\r\n- Each employee can record hours worked to any level they have access to, but not to any sub-level items. Relating that to our previous example, the employee could charge hours worked against the Task they are assigned to, but not to any of the SubTasks (unless assigned to them as well)\r\n\r\n- This is an old system and I assume that the locking of hours recorded to &#39;only assigned items&#39; was done to prevent user-error and will likely change in the future to reflect access level display\r\n\r\n- My question deals with correctly displaying the data in the front-end for the user (back-end programmer, pulling the data just fine, its just the display that&#39;s giving me issue)\r\n\r\nSo, my managers idea (and please let me know if you have any other suggestions on this) is to have dropdowns that display the items and check boxes to select one of them, for example..\r\n\r\n^ Projects\r\n\r\n       ^ Tasks\r\n\r\n        [] Task 1\r\n\r\n            ^ SubTasks\r\n\r\n             [] SubTask A\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, my issue is.. \r\n\r\n1.)

The problem\r\n\r\nThe output you want is an array of numbers while the selection will return `true` or `false` since it is a checkbox. In situations like this where the form contains different values from what you desire, you can use `valueChanges` to detect the changes in a particular `FormControl` and extract the desired result from the `FormControl` or `FormArray`.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nSince you want an array, the first thing you need to do is create a `FormArray` for `selectedContactInfo`.\r\n```js\r\ncontactInfo = {\r\n    privateMobile: 1800124152,\r\n    workMobile: 1800124124\r\n};\r\n\r\nthis.checkoutForm = this.formBuilder.group({\r\n    selectedAccount: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    selectedContactInfo: this.formBuilder.array(Object.keys(this.contactInfo).map(key =&gt; false))\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we are initializing the `FormArray` using `contactInfo`. This will basically get the keys from the object and create an array of the same length with `false` values (since initially the checkbox values are `false`). Of course, if you need it to be checked by default, you will need to map the selection to the checkboxes but for the sake of this example, we will start with all `false` values.\r\n\r\n**Registering the FormArray in the template**\r\n\r\nSet the [`FormArrayName`][1] in the template so we access the `true`/`false` values from the checkbox. Use the [KeyValuePipe][2] since we are iterating over `contactInfo` which is an object.\r\n```html\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;item-container&quot; formArrayName=&quot;selectedContactInfo&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;ng-container *ngFor=&quot;let contactNumber of contactInfo | keyvalue; let i = index&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;mat-checkbox [formControlName]=&quot;i&quot;&gt;{{contactNumber.value}}&lt;/mat-checkbox&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ng-container&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Map the FormArray in valueChanges**\r\n\r\nNow, `selectContactInfo` will be an array of `true`/`false` values according to the selection of the checkboxes. This is not what we desire though, so we will subscribe to `valueChanges` and map the data to `contactInfo` and store it in a variable called `selectedContactInfo` (Note that this is different from the `FormArray`).\r\n```js\r\nconst control = this.checkoutForm.controls.selectedContactInfo;\r\nthis.subscription = control.valueChanges.subscribe(value =&gt; {\r\n    this.selectedContactInfo = Object.keys(this.contactInfo).map((contactNo, index) =&gt; \r\n        control.value[index] ? this.contactInfo[contactNo] : null\r\n    )\r\n    .filter(contactNo =&gt; !!contactNo);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat we are doing here is basically getting the `true`/`false` array from the `FormArray` and then mapping it to `contactInfo`. If the checkbox value is `true`, return the number, else return `null`. Then use a `filter` to filter out the `null` values.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget to unsubscribe from the `valueChanges` subscription.\r\n```js\r\nngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [StackBlitz example][3]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://angular.io/api/forms/FormArrayName\r\n  [2]: https://angular.io/api/common/KeyValuePipe\r\n  [3]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-checkbox-form-array","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237205/retrieve-data-from-checkboxes-in-form/58242090#58242090","title":"Retrieve data from checkboxes in form"}],"owner":{"reputation":169,"user_id":7867996,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2132a521f8ecad66732476b7b6fdcd9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thesystem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7867996/thesystem"},"last_editor":{"reputation":169,"user_id":7867996,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2132a521f8ecad66732476b7b6fdcd9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thesystem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7867996/thesystem"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570405482,"creation_date":1570194931,"last_edit_date":1570196347,"question_id":58237205,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58237205","body_markdown":"My problem is that I have a form, and when a user submits the form, I want to receive the data which the user has submitted. This data should be wrapped in a single object. I use the formBuilder in Angular, but it seems as if it is mostly possible to retrieve data with formBuilder from `&lt;input&gt;` tags (quote from the top answer in [this post:][1] *&quot;formControlName only works on input, select and textarea. anything that has &quot;value&quot; property.&quot;*\r\n\r\nI have defined a form within my constructor and initialized fields, making use of the formBuilder;\r\n\r\n*component.ts*\r\n\r\n    constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder,\r\n    ) {\r\n      this.checkoutForm = this.formBuilder.group({\r\n        selectedAccount: &#39;&#39;,\r\n        selectedContactInfo: &#39;&#39;,\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my html, I have two places where a user should choose something from; a dropdown-menu and a selection of checkboxes. `selectedAccount` from my constructor is applied to `&lt;mat-select&gt;`, which works fine; on submission of form, I can see which account I chose. However, it seems that I can&#39;t apply `formControlName=&quot;selectedContactInfo&quot;` to the `div` in checkboxes area; it returns empty string.\r\n\r\n*component.html*\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- DROPDOWN - WORKS PERFECT --&gt;\r\n    &lt;mat-form-field&gt;\r\n      &lt;mat-label&gt;CHOOSE ACCOUNT&lt;/mat-label&gt;\r\n      &lt;mat-select formControlName=&quot;selectedAccount&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;mat-option *ngFor=&quot;let account of accounts&quot; [value]=&quot;account.name&quot;&gt;{{account.name}}&lt;/mat-option&gt;\r\n      &lt;/mat-select&gt;\r\n    &lt;/mat-form-field&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- CHECKBOXES - DOESN&#39;T RETRIEVE DATA WHEN FORM IS SUBMITTED --&gt;\r\n    h2 class=&quot;mat-h2&quot;&gt;CHOOSE TELEPHONE NUMBERS WE CAN CONTACT YOU ON&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n    &lt;div formControlName=&quot;selectedContactInfo&quot; class=&quot;item-container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;mat-checkbox&gt;{{contactInfo.privateMobile}}&lt;/mat-checkbox&gt;\r\n      &lt;mat-checkbox&gt;{{contactInfo.workMobile}}&lt;/mat-checkbox&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom the checkboxes, I want to retrieve the actual data. So if the first checkbox has been checked, I want to receive whatever data that `contactInfo.privateMobile` contains, probably a string or int of 8 digits, and assign it to `selectedContactInfo` in the constructor, in the very same manner I did for `selectedAccount` and the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\nI want `selectedContactInfo` to contain the data for the checkboxes; if both are checked, it returns the mobile numbers for both. If one is checked, it returns that number etc. I also tried with `selectedContactInfo: []` in constructor since it needs to return data for all checkboxes, but that just returns null right now.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n*Edit*: For reference (if anyone wants to know this), this is how I check the data when I submit my form to see if it contains right info. Dont know if its relevant:\r\n\r\n    onSubmit(userData) {\r\n      console.log(userData);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41705987/use-formcontrolname-with-something-like-span","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237205/retrieve-data-from-checkboxes-in-form","title":"Retrieve data from checkboxes in form"},{"tags":["publish-subscribe","google-cloud-pubsub"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4760,"user_id":1738915,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YXjto.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kolban","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1738915/kolban"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570195973,"post_id":58237199,"comment_id":102847734,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237199/restrict-the-subscribers-of-certain-whitelist-ips-to-connect-to-topic-in-google#comment102847734_58237199"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6181278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20118426d530a5be4e0761ca3332e8d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tirumalarao Katabathuni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6181278/tirumalarao-katabathuni"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571432500,"post_id":58240146,"comment_id":103253194,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237199/restrict-the-subscribers-of-certain-whitelist-ips-to-connect-to-topic-in-google/58240146#comment103253194_58240146"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3199,"user_id":11372593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FQBr5NRaPHA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABb0/XuGqOq18jyg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"guillaume blaquiere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11372593/guillaume-blaquiere"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570206572,"creation_date":1570206572,"answer_id":58240146,"question_id":58237199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58240146","body_markdown":"One of Google recommendation is &quot;don&#39;t trust the network&quot;.

Using the browser debugger, we can see that the structure is in the DOM, but they don&#39;t get drawn.\r\nWe were using the No-op animator module originally.  When I switched it to the BrowserAnimations module, the dialog would appear for the animation, but once the animation was complete, it disappeared visually.  It&#39;s still there and you can partially interact with it -- if you click where the Close button should be rendered, the dialog will close.  (You can tell this because the &quot;glass&quot;/grey screen cover goes away.)\r\nWe&#39;ve fixed all of the unit tests (2500+) and they run 100% clean and most of the application works as expected.  It&#39;s just that the dialogs disappear visually.\r\n\r\nThings I&#39;ve tried already:\r\n\r\n1. setting the z-index of various items to ridiculous values (25000) via the Chrome debugging tools\r\n2. setting CSS display properties explicitly to &quot;block&quot; on a variety of elements through the debugger\r\n3. setting CSS visibility explicitly to &quot;visible&quot;\r\n4. setting CSS opacity explicitly to &quot;1&quot;\r\n5. verified that the dialog components are all listed in the EntryComponents of the module that they are in (and that this module is imported into the main app module)\r\n\r\nEverything worked fine with Angular 5 -- it&#39;s definitely a side-effect of the upgrade.  I suspect that this may be an interaction of Material with some other module we&#39;re using that used to play nice together, but no longer do.  However, I&#39;m not sure what that might be or how to figure it out.  To that end, here&#39;s what we&#39;re using (package.json extact):\r\n```\r\n  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/cdk&quot;: &quot;^8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/common&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/compiler&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/core&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/flex-layout&quot;: &quot;^8.0.0-beta.27&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/forms&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/material&quot;: &quot;^8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/material-moment-adapter&quot;: &quot;^8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/platform-browser&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/platform-browser-dynamic&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/router&quot;: &quot;^8.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@ngx-translate/core&quot;: &quot;^11.0.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@ngx-translate/http-loader&quot;: &quot;^4.0.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;bootstrap&quot;: &quot;^4.3.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;classlist.js&quot;: &quot;^1.1.20150312&quot;,\r\n    &quot;core-js&quot;: &quot;^3.2.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;hammerjs&quot;: &quot;^2.0.8&quot;,\r\n    &quot;jwt-decode&quot;: &quot;^2.2.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;moment&quot;: &quot;^2.24.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;ngx-bootstrap&quot;: &quot;^5.1.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;pdfjs-dist&quot;: &quot;^2.1.266&quot;,\r\n    &quot;rxjs&quot;: &quot;^6.5.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;ts-helpers&quot;: &quot;^1.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;tslib&quot;: &quot;^1.10.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;velocity-animate&quot;: &quot;^1.5.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;web-animations-js&quot;: &quot;^2.3.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;zone.js&quot;: &quot;~0.9.1&quot;\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my app.module.ts I have the following:\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    imports: [\r\n        &lt;&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;&gt; ModalTemplatesModule, \r\n        BrowserAnimationsModule, &lt;&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;&gt;    ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then the ModalTemplatesModule is defined as:\r\n```\r\nconst modalTemplates: any[] = [\r\n    ModalTimeoutComponent,\r\n    ConfirmActionModalComponent,\r\n    // etc...\r\n];\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    imports: [\r\n        SharedModule,\r\n        ReactiveFormsModule,\r\n        FormsModule,\r\n        CommonComponentsModule,\r\n        CommonNonComponentsModule\r\n    ],\r\n    declarations: modalTemplates,\r\n    exports: modalTemplates,\r\n    providers: [\r\n        ConfigService,\r\n        TransactionService\r\n    ],\r\n    entryComponents: modalTemplates\r\n})\r\nexport class ModalTemplatesModule {}\r\n```\r\nWe did create a wrapper for all of our modals that we then &lt;ng-content&gt; the specific dialog contents into.  So if something is wrong with the code, it&#39;s likely in this class.  But it&#39;s pretty simple...\r\nModalWrapper template:\r\n```\r\n&lt;div fxLayoutAlign=&quot;center center&quot; fxLayout=&quot;column&quot; fxFlexFill&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;modal-wrapper full-width&quot; fxLayout=&quot;column&quot; fxLayoutAlign=&quot;center center&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;showCloseButton&quot; class=&quot;full-width&quot; fxLayoutAlign=&quot;end end&quot; fxLayout=&quot;column&quot; fxFlex=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;button id=&quot;closeButton&quot; class=&quot;close-button-outside&quot; (click)=&quot;close()&quot; #closeButton&gt;\r\n            &lt;span fxLayout=&quot;row&quot; fxLayoutAlign=&quot;start center&quot; fxLayoutGap=&quot;0.5rem&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;i class=&quot;icon-close-hover&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                &lt;span&gt;{{&quot;common.buttons.close&quot; | translate}}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n            &lt;/span&gt;\r\n            &lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;ng-content&gt;&lt;/ng-content&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual &lt;mat-dialog-content&gt; tag is within the templates of the component that is placed in the wrapper via &lt;ng-content&gt;.\r\n\r\nModalWrapperComponent\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector : &#39;modal-wrapper&#39;,\r\n    templateUrl: &#39;./modal-wrapper.component.html&#39;,\r\n    styleUrls: [&#39;./modal-wrapper.component.scss&#39;]\r\n})\r\nexport class ModalWrapperComponent {\r\n    @Output() onClose: EventEmitter&lt;void&gt; = new EventEmitter&lt;void&gt;();\r\n    @Input() showCloseButton: boolean = true;\r\n\r\n    constructor() {}\r\n\r\n    close(): void {\r\n        this.onClose.emit();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, I&#39;m running out of ideas for why it disappears and how to fix it.  Hoping that somebody else encountered this and recognizes the problem and knows how to fix it!\r\n\r\n**Update:** If I use the WAVE accessibility plug-in for Chrome and &quot;disable all CSS&quot;, the dialog elements do appear at the bottom of the screen.  So that would suggest that it&#39;s a style-related issue.  Is there any other way to &quot;hide&quot; something??","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237156/after-angular-5-8-upgrade-material-dialogs-show-up-in-dom-but-do-not-render-o","title":"After Angular 5-&gt;8 upgrade, Material

But the project object seems to be of type Microsoft.VisualStudio.Data.Tools.Package.Project.IDatabaseProjectNode Which is marked internal and thus cannot be used by me.\r\n\r\nIs there any official way to add database references (and do other sql database project specific things) or do I have to resort to editing the project files directly?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237145/need-help-adding-database-references-to-database-projects-using-code","title":"Need help adding database references to database projects using code"},{"tags":["ios","xamarin","material-components-ios"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7145,"user_id":7462031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/APfLb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FreakyAli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7462031/freakyali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570194808,"post_id":58237136,"comment_id":102847106,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237136/how-to-set-width-of-material-components-tab-bar-on-ios-with-xamarin#comment102847106_58237136"},{"owner":{"reputation":435,"user_id":6055532,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ME1onGFpdk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADtw/vdo2DE7ius8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dominik Roszkowski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6055532/dominik-roszkowski"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7145,"user_id":7462031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/APfLb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FreakyAli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7462031/freakyali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570195715,"post_id":58237136,"comment_id":102847583,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237136/how-to-set-width-of-material-components-tab-bar-on-ios-with-xamarin#comment102847583_58237136"},{"owner":{"reputation":435,"user_id":6055532,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ME1onGFpdk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADtw/vdo2DE7ius8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dominik Roszkowski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6055532/dominik-roszkowski"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7145,"user_id":7462031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/APfLb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FreakyAli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7462031/freakyali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570197091,"post_id":58237136,"comment_id":102848294,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58237136/how-to-set-width-of-material-components-tab-bar-on-ios-with-xamarin#comment102848294_58237136"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":435,"user_id":6055532,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ME1onGFpdk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADtw/vdo2DE7ius8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dominik Roszkowski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6055532/dominik-roszkowski"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570196411,"creation_date":1570196411,"answer_id":58237573,"question_id":58237136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58237573","body_markdown":"The solution was to call base constructor `base(NSObjectFlag.Empty)`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate class CustomTabBarIndicatorTemplate : TabBarIndicatorTemplate\r\n{\r\n    public CustomTabBarIndicatorTemplate() : base(NSObjectFlag.Empty)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Constructor&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override TabBarIndicatorAttributes IndicatorAttributesForContext(ITabBarIndicatorContext context)\r\n    {\r\n        var bounds = context.Bounds;\r\n        var attr = new TabBarIndicatorAttributes();\r\n        var frame = new CGRect(bounds.GetMinX(), bounds.GetMaxY() -
