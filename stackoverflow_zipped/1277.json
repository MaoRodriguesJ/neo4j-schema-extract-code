There&#39;s a logical flaw in your code: you look for the first time `ce_charttime` &gt; `ne_charttime` and then take the previous row. If there&#39;s no such time, you&#39;ll never have the chance to take the previous row, hence the `NaN`s in your result table starting from row 8.\r\n\r\n**PPS**: This includes `ce_charttime` in the final dataframe. You can replace it by a column of how old the information is and/or remove it:\r\n\r\n    final_df[&#39;info_age&#39;] = final_df.ne_charttime - final_df.ce_charttime\r\n    final_df = final_df.drop(columns=&#39;ce_charttime&#39;)\r\n\r\n**UPDATE for EDIT-2**: As I wrote at the very beginning, repeated in the comments and as the docs clearly states: both `ce_charttime` and `ne_charttime` must be sorted (`hadm_id` need not be sorted). If this condition is not met, you&#39;ll have to (temporarily) sort your dataframes as required. See the following example:\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd, string\r\n    \r\n    df_str = pd.DataFrame( {&#39;hadm_id&#39;: pd.np.tile([111111, 222222],10), &#39;ce_charttime&#39;: pd.date_range(&#39;2019-10-01 00:30&#39;, periods=20, freq=&#39;30T&#39;), &#39;hr&#39;: pd.np.random.randint(80,120,20)})\r\n    df_notes = pd.DataFrame( {&#39;hadm_id&#39;: pd.np.tile([111111, 222222],3), &#39;ne_charttime&#39;: pd.date_range(&#39;2019-10-01 00:45&#39;, periods=6, freq=&#39;40T&#39;), &#39;note&#39;: [&#39;&#39;.join(pd.np.random.choice(list(string.ascii_letters), 10)) for _ in range(6)]}).sort_values(&#39;hadm_id&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    final_df = pd.merge_asof(df_notes.sort_values(&#39;ne_charttime&#39;), df_str, left_on=&#39;ne_charttime&#39;, right_on=&#39;ce_charttime&#39;, by=&#39;hadm_id&#39;).sort_values([&#39;hadm_id&#39;, &#39;ne_charttime&#39;])\r\n    \r\n    print(df_str); print(df_notes); print(final_df)\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n        hadm_id        ce_charttime   hr\r\n    0    111111 2019-10-01 00:30:00  118\r\n    1    222222 2019-10-01 01:00:00   93\r\n    2    111111 2019-10-01 01:30:00   92\r\n    3    222222 2019-10-01 02:00:00   86\r\n    4    111111 2019-10-01 02:30:00   88\r\n    5    222222 2019-10-01 03:00:00   86\r\n    6    111111 2019-10-01 03:30:00  106\r\n    7    222222 2019-10-01 04:00:00   91\r\n    8    111111 2019-10-01 04:30:00  109\r\n    9    222222 2019-10-01 05:00:00   95\r\n    10   111111 2019-10-01 05:30:00  113\r\n    11   222222 2019-10-01 06:00:00   92\r\n    12   111111 2019-10-01 06:30:00  104\r\n    13   222222 2019-10-01 07:00:00   83\r\n    14   111111 2019-10-01 07:30:00  114\r\n    15   222222 2019-10-01 08:00:00   98\r\n    16   111111 2019-10-01 08:30:00  110\r\n    17   222222 2019-10-01 09:00:00   89\r\n    18   111111 2019-10-01 09:30:00   98\r\n    19   222222 2019-10-01 10:00:00  109\r\n       hadm_id        ne_charttime        note\r\n    0   111111 2019-10-01 00:45:00  jOcRWVdPDF\r\n    2   111111 2019-10-01 02:05:00  mvScJNrwra\r\n    4   111111 2019-10-01 03:25:00  FBAFbJYflE\r\n    1   222222 2019-10-01 01:25:00  ilNuInOsYZ\r\n    3   222222 2019-10-01 02:45:00  ysyolaNmkV\r\n    5   222222 2019-10-01 04:05:00  wvowGGETaP\r\n       hadm_id        ne_charttime        note        ce_charttime   hr\r\n    0   111111 2019-10-01 00:45:00  jOcRWVdPDF 2019-10-01 00:30:00  118\r\n    2   111111 2019-10-01 02:05:00  mvScJNrwra 2019-10-01 01:30:00   92\r\n    4   111111 2019-10-01 03:25:00  FBAFbJYflE 2019-10-01 02:30:00   88\r\n    1   222222 2019-10-01 01:25:00  ilNuInOsYZ 2019-10-01 01:00:00   93\r\n    3   222222 2019-10-01 02:45:00  ysyolaNmkV 2019-10-01 02:00:00   86\r\n    5   222222 2019-10-01 04:05:00  wvowGGETaP 2019-10-01 04:00:00   91","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238564/pandas-combine-two-dataframes-based-on-time-difference/58289812#58289812","title":"Pandas combine two dataframes based on time difference"}],"owner":{"reputation":121,"user_id":1338584,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/58264bf7ce5ad8f1768197c573d1f43e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"shaun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1338584/shaun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":121,"user_id":1338584,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/58264bf7ce5ad8f1768197c573d1f43e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"shaun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1338584/shaun"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58289812,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570704266,"creation_date":1570200077,"last_edit_date":1570635206,"question_id":58238564,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238564","body_markdown":"I have two data frames that stores different types of medical information of patients.

So in my resulting data frame, for `ne_charttime = 2108-03-05 16:54:00`, I will have `hr = 85.0, resp = 11.0, magnesium = 1.8, hr_24hr_mean = 88.33`. \r\n\r\nEssentially, in this example the resulting data frame will look like this:\r\n```\r\n\thadm_id\tne_charttime\tnote\thr\tresp\tmagnesium\thr_24hr_mean\r\n0\t196673\t2108-03-05 16:54:00\tNursing\\nNursing Progress Note\\nPt is a 43 yo ...\t85.0\t11.0\t1.8\t88.333333\r\n1\t196673\t2108-03-05 17:54:00\tPhysician \\nPhysician Resident Admission Note\\...\t109.0\t12.0\t1.8\t93.500000\r\n2\t196673\t2108-03-05 18:09:00\tPhysician \\nPhysician Resident Admission Note\\...\t97.0\t12.0\t1.8\t94.200000\r\n3\t196673\t2108-03-06 06:11:00\tNursing\\nNursing Progress Note\\nPain control (...\t103.0\t17.0\t2.0\t95.000000\r\n4\t196673\t2108-03-06 08:06:00\tPhysician \\nPhysician Resident Progress Note\\n...\t103.0\t20.0\t2.0\t95.700000\r\n5\t196673\t2108-03-06 12:40:00\tNursing\\nNursing Progress Note\\nChief Complain...\t85.0\t10.0\t2.0\t94.291667\r\n6\t196673\t2108-03-06 13:01:00\tNursing\\nNursing Progress Note\\nPain control (...\t98.0\t14.0\t2.0\t94.440000\r\n7\t196673\t2108-03-06 17:09:00\tNursing\\nNursing Transfer Note\\nChief Complain...\t106.0\t21.0\t2.0\t95.360000\r\n8\t196673\t2108-03-06 17:12:00\tNursing\\nNursing Transfer Note\\nPain control (...\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\r\n9\t196673\t2108-03-07 15:25:00\tRadiology\\nCHEST (PA &amp; LAT)\\n[**2108-3-7**] 3:...\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\r\n10\t196673\t2108-03-07 18:34:00\tRadiology\\nCTA CHEST W&amp;W/O C&amp;RECONS, NON-CORON...\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\r\n11\t196673\t2108-03-09 09:10:00\tRadiology\\nABDOMEN (SUPINE &amp; ERECT)\\n[**2108-3...\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\r\n12\t196673\t2108-03-09 12:22:00\tRadiology\\nCT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST\\n[**2108-3-9*...\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\r\n13\t196673\t2108-03-10 05:26:00\tRadiology\\nABDOMEN (SUPINE &amp; ERECT)\\n[**2108-3...\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\r\n14\t196673\t2108-03-10 05:27:00\tRadiology\\nCHEST (PA &amp; LAT)\\n[**2108-3-10**] 5...\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\tNaN\r\n``` \r\nThe resulting data frame will be of the same length as `df_notes`. I have been able to come with a very inefficient piece of code using `for` loops and explicit indexing to get this result:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncols = list(df_str.columns[2:])\r\n\r\nfinal_df = df_notes.copy()\r\nfor col in cols:\r\n  final_df[col] = np.nan\r\n\r\nidx = 0\r\nfor i, note_row in final_df.iterrows():\r\n  ne = note_row[&#39;ne_charttime&#39;]\r\n  for j, str_row in df_str.iterrows():\r\n    ce = str_row[&#39;ce_charttime&#39;]\r\n    if ne &lt; ce:\r\n      idx += 1\r\n      for col in cols:\r\n        final_df.iloc[i, final_df.columns.get_loc(col)] = df_str.iloc[j-1][col]\r\n      break\r\n\r\nfor col in cols:\r\n  final_df.iloc[idx, final_df.columns.get_loc(col)] = df_str.iloc[-1][col]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis piece of code is bad because it is very inefficient and while it may work for this example, in my example dataset, I have over 30 different columns of structured variables, and over 10,000 encounters.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT-2:**\r\n@Stef has provided an excellent answer which seems to work and replace my elaborate loopy code with a single line (amazing). However, while that works for this particular example, I am running into problems when I apply it to a bigger subset which includes multiple encounters. For example, consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf_str.shape, df_notes.shape\r\n((217, 386), (35, 4))\r\n\r\ndf_notes[[&#39;hadm_id&#39;, &#39;ne_charttime&#39;]]\r\n\thadm_id\tne_charttime\r\n0\t100104\t2201-06-21 20:00:00\r\n1\t100104\t2201-06-21 22:51:00\r\n2\t100104\t2201-06-22 05:00:00\r\n3\t100104\t2201-06-23 04:33:00\r\n4\t100104\t2201-06-23 12:59:00\r\n5\t100104\t2201-06-24 05:15:00\r\n6\t100372\t2115-12-20 02:29:00\r\n7\t100372\t2115-12-21 10:15:00\r\n8\t100372\t2115-12-22 13:05:00\r\n9\t100372\t2115-12-25 17:16:00\r\n10\t100372\t2115-12-30 10:58:00\r\n11\t100372\t2115-12-30 13:07:00\r\n12\t100372\t2115-12-30 14:16:00\r\n13\t100372\t2115-12-30 22:34:00\r\n14\t100372\t2116-01-03 09:10:00\r\n15\t100372\t2116-01-07 11:08:00\r\n16\t100975\t2126-03-02 06:06:00\r\n17\t100975\t2126-03-02 17:44:00\r\n18\t100975\t2126-03-03 05:36:00\r\n19\t100975\t2126-03-03 18:27:00\r\n20\t100975\t2126-03-04 05:29:00\r\n21\t100975\t2126-03-04 10:48:00\r\n22\t100975\t2126-03-04 16:42:00\r\n23\t100975\t2126-03-05 22:12:00\r\n24\t100975\t2126-03-05 23:01:00\r\n25\t100975\t2126-03-06 11:02:00\r\n26\t100975\t2126-03-06 13:38:00\r\n27\t100975\t2126-03-08 13:39:00\r\n28\t100975\t2126-03-11 10:41:00\r\n29\t101511\t2199-04-30 09:29:00\r\n30\t101511\t2199-04-30 09:53:00\r\n31\t101511\t2199-04-30 18:06:00\r\n32\t101511\t2199-05-01 08:28:00\r\n33\t111073\t2195-05-01 01:56:00\r\n34\t111073\t2195-05-01 21:49:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has 5 encounters. The dataframe is sorted by `hadm_id` and within each `hadm_id`, `ne_charttime` is sorted. However, the column `ne_charttime` by itself is NOT sorted as seen from row 0 `ce_charttime=2201-06-21 20:00:00` and row 6 `ne_charttime=2115-12-20 02:29:00`. When I try to do a `merge_asof`, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n`ValueError: left keys must be sorted`. Is this because of the fact that `ne_charttime` column is not sorted? If so, how do I rectify this while maintaining the integrity of the encounter ID group? \r\n\r\n**EDIT-1:**\r\nI was able to loop over the encounters as well:\r\n```\r\ncols = list(dev_str.columns[1:]) # get the cols to merge (everything except hadm_id)\r\nfinal_dfs = [] \r\n\r\ngrouped = dev_notes.groupby(&#39;hadm_id&#39;) # get groups of encounter ids\r\nfor name, group in grouped:\r\n  final_df = group.copy().reset_index(drop=True) # make a copy of notes for that encounter\r\n  for col in cols:\r\n    final_df[col] = np.nan # set the values to nan\r\n\r\n  idx = 0 # index to track the final row in the given encounter\r\n  for i, note_row in final_df.iterrows():\r\n    ne = note_row[&#39;ne_charttime&#39;]\r\n    sub = dev_str.loc[(dev_str[&#39;hadm_id&#39;] == name)].reset_index(drop=True) # get the df corresponding to the ecounter\r\n    for j, str_row in sub.iterrows():\r\n      ce = str_row[&#39;ce_charttime&#39;]\r\n      if ne &lt; ce: # if the variable charttime &lt; note charttime\r\n        idx += 1\r\n        \r\n        # grab the previous values for the variables and break\r\n        for col in cols:\r\n          final_df.iloc[i, final_df.columns.get_loc(col)] = sub.iloc[j-1][col]          \r\n        break               \r\n\r\n  # get the last value in the df for the variables\r\n  for col in cols:\r\n    final_df.iloc[idx, final_df.columns.get_loc(col)] = sub.iloc[-1][col]\r\n  \r\n  final_dfs.append(final_df) # append the df to the list\r\n\r\n# cat the list to get final df and reset index\r\nfinal_df = pd.concat(final_dfs)\r\nfinal_df.reset_index(inplace=True, drop=True)\r\n```\r\nAgain this very inefficient but does the job.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to achieve what I want? Any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238564/pandas-combine-two-dataframes-based-on-time-difference","title":"Pandas combine two dataframes based on time difference"},{"tags":["python","json","apache-spark","pyspark"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22550,"user_id":5858851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXFCX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/pault"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570200916,"post_id":58238563,"comment_id":102850225,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238563/write-spark-dataframe-as-array-of-json-pyspark#comment102850225_58238563"},{"owner":{"reputation":494,"user_id":3211950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lw6mr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"enneppi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211950/enneppi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22550,"user_id":5858851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXFCX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/pault"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570201707,"post_id":58238563,"comment_id":102850608,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238563/write-spark-dataframe-as-array-of-json-pyspark#comment102850608_58238563"},{"owner":{"reputation":22550,"user_id":5858851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXFCX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/pault"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570202115,"post_id":58238563,"comment_id":102850803,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238563/write-spark-dataframe-as-array-of-json-pyspark#comment102850803_58238563"},{"owner":{"reputation":494,"user_id":3211950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lw6mr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"enneppi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211950/enneppi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22550,"user_id":5858851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXFCX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/pault"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570202585,"post_id":58238563,"comment_id":102851024,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238563/write-spark-dataframe-as-array-of-json-pyspark#comment102851024_58238563"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":494,"user_id":3211950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lw6mr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"enneppi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211950/enneppi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570634906,"post_id":58239748,"comment_id":102976758,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238563/write-spark-dataframe-as-array-of-json-pyspark/58239748#comment102976758_58239748"},{"owner":{"reputation":22550,"user_id":5858851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXFCX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/pault"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":494,"user_id":3211950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lw6mr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"enneppi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211950/enneppi"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570636981,"post_id":58239748,"comment_id":102977870,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238563/write-spark-dataframe-as-array-of-json-pyspark/58239748#comment102977870_58239748"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":22550,"user_id":5858851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXFCX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/pault"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22550,"user_id":5858851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXFCX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/pault"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570636957,"last_edit_date":1570636957,"creation_date":1570204548,"answer_id":58239748,"question_id":58238563,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58239748","body_markdown":"It is not currently possible to have spark &quot;natively&quot; write a single file in your desired format because spark works in a distributed (parallel) fashion, with each executor writing its part of the data independently.\r\n\r\nHowever, since you are [okay with having each file be an array of json not only [one] file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238563/write-spark-dataframe-as-array-of-json-pyspark#comment102851024_58238563), here is one workaround that you can use to achieve your desired output:\r\n\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import to_json, spark_partition_id, collect_list, col, struct\r\n    \r\n    df.select(to_json(struct(*df.columns)).alias(&quot;json&quot;))\\\r\n        .groupBy(spark_partition_id())\\\r\n        .agg(collect_list(&quot;json&quot;).alias(&quot;json_list&quot;))\\\r\n        .select(col(&quot;json_list&quot;).cast(&quot;string&quot;))\\\r\n        .write.text(&quot;s3://path/to/json&quot;)\r\n\r\nFirst you create a `json` from all of the columns in `df`. Then group by the spark partition ID and aggregate using `collect_list`. This will put all the `json`s on that partition into a list. Since you&#39;re aggregating within the partition, there should be no shuffling of data required.\r\n\r\nNow select the list column, convert to a string, and write it as a text file.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example of how one file looks:\r\n\r\n    [{&quot;x&quot;:0.1420523746714616,&quot;y&quot;:0.30876114874052263}, ... ]\r\n\r\nNote you may get some empty files.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPresumably you can force spark to write the data in ONE file if you specified an empty `groupBy`, but this would result in forcing all of the data into a single partition which could result in an out of memory

to pass variables between Apps Script and Javascript.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGoogle Apps Script features the method [google.script.run][1] that can be called from the JS part of a [Web App][2]. The methods allows to pass parameters to an Apps Script function and to assign the return value of the GAS function back to a JS function.\r\n\r\n**Sample:**\r\n\r\n&gt; .gs file\r\n\r\n```lang:js\r\nfunction doGet() {\r\nvar template = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile(&#39;index&#39;);\r\n\r\nreturn template.evaluate().setSandboxMode(HtmlService.SandboxMode.IFRAME);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction myContent(input) {\r\n  var myContent=&quot;foo&quot;+input;\r\n  return myContent;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; HTML/js file\r\n\r\n```lang:js\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;base target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body onload=&quot;getData()&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n      function getData() {\r\n        google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(proceedData).myContent(&quot;bar&quot;);\r\n       ...\r\n     }\r\n      function proccedData(returnValue) {\r\n        var data  = returnValue;\r\n      }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n  &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use scriptlets\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe [documentation specifies][3]:\r\n\r\n+ Remember, however, that because template code executes before the page is served to the user, these techniques can only feed initial content to a page. To access Apps Script data from a page interactively, use the google.script.run API instead.\r\n\r\n+ Because scriptlet code executes before the page is served, it can only run once per page; unlike client-side JavaScript or Apps Script functions that you call through google.script.run, scriptlets can&#39;t execute again after the page loads.^\r\n+ scriptlets can call functions defined in other code files, reference **global variables**, or use any of the Apps Script APIs.\r\n\r\nIn your case, if you want to use scriptlets, you either have to call a function or make your variable `data`global, e.g.:\r\n```lang:js\r\n\r\n//global variable\r\nvar data=myContent;\r\n\r\nfunction doGet() {\r\n  var temp=HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile(&quot;index.html&quot;);\r\n  return temp.evaluate().setSandboxMode(HtmlService.SandboxMode.IFRAME);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; Also keep in mind:\r\n\r\n+ Templates can be challenging to debug because the code you write is not executed directly; instead, the server transforms your template into code, then executes that resulting code.\r\n[1]:https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/reference/run\r\n[2]:https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web\r\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/templates\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238551/gas-htmlservice-pushing-variables-with-createtemplatefromfile-in-file-included/58238939#58238939","title":"GAS HTMLService: Pushing variables with createTemplateFromFile in file included in template"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":2463770,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b796e1a8d60d49e86a72181aa9648d54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Fabrice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2463770/fabrice"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58238939,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570355204,"creation_date":1570200043,"question_id":58238551,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238551","body_markdown":"I use CreateTemplateFromFile and push a variable inside my template.

In other cases—including specifically the case where *all* of your existing commits just came from that other Git in the first place, and you never make any of your own commits, and the person managing the other Git behaves well—they do exactly the same thing so that it won&#39;t matter which one you do (unless the second command fails; see below).\r\n\r\nMy own process is generally: run `git fetch`, inspect what happened, then choose which of `git merge` or `git rebase` I want to do, if I want to do any of them yet.  Then, I do the second command that I&#39;d like to do based on the results of this inspection, or I hold off entirely based on the results of this inspection.\r\n\r\nIf you are sure about which second command you&#39;d like to use, you can use `git pull`, which runs `git fetch`, then runs one of these other two Git commands.  You choose in advance, before seeing what `git fetch` brings, *which* other Git command to run.  The default second command is `git merge`, so if you&#39;re absolutely sure, in advance, that you want to `git fetch` and then `git merge`, you can run `git pull`.  If you&#39;re absolutely sure, in advance, that you want to run `git rebase` second, you can run `git pull --rebase`.\r\n\r\nNote that both `git merge` and `git rebase` can *fail*, and leave you with a mess to clean up.  If you run `git pull` and its second command fails, you&#39;re still in the middle of whichever second command you chose to have `git pull` run.  You&#39;ll still need to clean up the mess.  You can wait until this actually happens to learn *how* to clean it up, but remember that the *way* to clean it up depends on *which* second command you chose!

The following is a pretty common pattern where you have the following in gatsby-browser and gatsby-ssr\r\n\r\n    export { default as wrapRootElement } from &#39;src/store/ReduxWrapper&#39;;\r\n\r\nWhich ReduxWrapper would contain the following:\r\n\r\n    export default ({ element }) =&gt; (\r\n      &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;\r\n        &lt;PersistGate loading={&lt;h2&gt;Loading...&lt;/h2&gt;} persistor={persistor}&gt;\r\n          {element}\r\n        &lt;/PersistGate&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Provider&gt;\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThis unfortunately breaks SSR which can be resolved by creating a different ReduxWrapper that does not depend on &lt;PersistGate&gt;. Assuming this is called ReduxSSRWrapper then gatsby-ssr will be changed to:\r\n\r\n    export { default as wrapRootElement } from &#39;src/store/ReduxSSRWrapper&#39;;\r\n\r\nand ReduxSSRWrapper will contain the following which is basically a removal of PersistGate:\r\n\r\n    export default ({ element }) =&gt; (\r\n      &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;\r\n        {element}\r\n      &lt;/Provider&gt;\r\n    );\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238525/gatsby-not-generating-correct-static-html-files/58324260#58324260","title":"Gatsby not generating correct static HTML files"}],"owner":{"reputation":562,"user_id":1232376,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f81afc95bf0eebd53f3f76394ce50804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew Rutter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1232376/andrew-rutter"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58324260,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570714518,"creation_date":1570199960,"question_id":58238525,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238525","body_markdown":"I am working on a Gatsby based website which is so far going well in development.

It would be much better either to use an eagerly-initialized field:\r\n\r\n    public class DB {\r\n    \r\n      private static final Client client = new Client();\r\n    \r\n      public insert(Object data) {\r\n        client.insert(data);  // Guaranteed to be initialized once class loading is complete.\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nor, if you must do it lazily, use a lazy holder:\r\n\r\n    public class DB {\r\n      private static class Holder {\r\n        private static final Client client = new Client();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public insert(Object data) {\r\n        Holder.client.insert(data);  // Holder.client is initialized on first access.\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr, of course, chuck in a call to `init()` inside the `insert` method:\r\n\r\n      public insert(Object data) {\r\n        init();\r\n        client.insert(data);\r\n      }\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of the latter approach is that all threads must synchronize.

making the assumption that by &quot;Padding an IP&quot; you are wanting to lpad 0&#39;s to the front of each ip part. \r\n\r\nUsing regexp_replace you can do the following:\r\n\r\n    SELECT regexp_replace(regexp_replace(&#39;19.2.2.2&#39;, &#39;([0-9]{1,3})&#39;, &#39;00\\1&#39;, &#39;g&#39;), &#39;(0*)([0-9]{3})&#39;, &#39;\\2&#39;, &#39;g&#39;);\r\n\r\nOptionally if you are on 9.4 or newer you could get crafty with `UNNEST()` or `REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE()` and the new `WITH ORDINALITY` keyword to split each ip part (and the key from the table) out to its own row. Then you can `lpad()` with 0&#39;s and `string_agg()` it back together using the ordinal that was preserved in the `unnest` or `regexp_split_to_table()`:\r\n\r\n    user=# SELECT * FROM test;\r\n     id |      ip\r\n    ----+--------------\r\n      1 | 19.16.2.2\r\n      2 | 20.321.123.1\r\n    (2 rows)\r\n    \r\n    user=# SELECT id, string_agg(lpad(ip_part, 3, &#39;0&#39;),&#39;.&#39; ORDER BY rn) FROM test t, regexp_split_to_table(t.ip, &#39;\\.&#39;) WITH ORDINALITY s(ip_part, rn) GROUP BY id;\r\n     id |   string_agg\r\n    ----+-----------------\r\n      1 | 019.016.002.002\r\n      2 | 020.321.123.001\r\n    (2 rows)\r\n\r\nTheoretically this would work in older versions since it seems like ordinals are preserved during `unnest()`, but it feels more like luck and I wouldn&#39;t productionize any code that depends on that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238488/add-padding-to-ip-addresses-in-postgresql-select-query/58239581#58239581","title":"Add padding to IP addresses in PostgreSQL SELECT Query?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10420384,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091820686699220184c28551b57a1d21?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10420384/matt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10420384,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091820686699220184c28551b57a1d21?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10420384/matt"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570204852,"creation_date":1570199817,"last_edit_date":1570200685,"question_id":58238488,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238488","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve already got a method for excel, but I want the padding to be done via the query to reduce my effort later in the process\r\n\r\n### Excel Example\r\n```\r\n=TEXT(LEFT(A2,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)-1),&quot;000&quot;) &amp; &quot;.&quot; &amp; TEXT(MID(A2,FIND(\r\n&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)+1,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)+1)-FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)-1),&quot;000&quot;)\r\n&amp; &quot;.&quot; &amp; TEXT(MID(A2,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)+1)+1,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,\r\nFIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)+1)+1)-FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)+1)-1),\r\n&quot;000&quot;) &amp; &quot;.&quot; &amp; TEXT(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,FIND(&quot;.&quot;,A2,FIND(\r\n&quot;.&quot;,A2,1)+1)+1)),&quot;000&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried searching the PostgreSQL documentation but nothing was obvious on converting to padded\r\n\r\nI also investigated potentially doing a CAST as I have done for hostnames utilizing regex\r\n\r\n### Hostname CAST Example for PostgreSQL\r\n```\r\nUPPER(regexp_replace(da.host_name, &#39;([\\.][\\w\\.]+)&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;g&#39;)) AS hostname\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, I am hitting a roadblock here.

can use the **`-ConfigurationName` parameter** of remoting cmdlets such as `Invoke-Command`, `New-PSSession`, and `Enter-PSSession` to specify a session configuration explicitly.\r\n\r\n* _Persistently_, via configuration, you can **set the _default_ session configuration** via the [**`$PSSessionConfigurationName`** preference variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables#pssessionconfigurationname) (the linked help topic also dicusses other remote-session-related preference variables, namely `$PSSessionApplicationName` and `$PSSessionOption`)\r\n\r\n**On the _target machine_ of a remoting operation**, **`Get-PSSessionConfiguration`** cmdlet lists all registered session configurations that clients can use to connect to, and which you can manage with `Register-PSSessionConfiguration` and `Unregister-PSSessionConfiguration`:\r\n\r\n  * **Caveat**: `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` must be run in an _elevated_ session (as administrator), and, due to a _bug_ in Windows PowerShell 5.1, you may have to run the following dummy command first: `$null = Get-Command Test-WSMan`, so as to ensure that the `wsman:` drive is defined).\r\n\r\n  * Session configurations whose names are prefixed with **`&#39;microsoft.powershell`&#39;**

`&#39;http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell&#39;` in _both_ editions, which means that **_Windows PowerShell_ is by default targeted on remote machines _even if you&#39;re

if you&#39;re using the [official installer](), you&#39;re given the option of enabling remoting during the installation. \r\n\r\nIn any event, you can **use [`Enable-PSRemoting`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enable-psremoting?view=powershell-6) to (re-)enable PowerShell remoting on demand**, which:\r\n\r\n* must be run _from the respective edition_.\r\n\r\n* must be run _with administrative privileges_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[1] That is, the question focuses on [WinRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Remote_Management)-based remoting (WinRM is a Windows-specific implementation of the DTMF [WSMan (WS-Management) standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Management)).\r\n\r\nAs for ***cross-platform* remoting with PowerShell Core**:\r\n\r\n* You can already use **[SSH-based remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core)**, on all platforms:\r\n\r\n  * Using SSH-based remoting involves mostly the same cmdlets as WinRM-based remoting, though the parameters involved differ; most notably, you specify the target computer(s) via the `-HostName` parameter rather than \r\nthe `-ComputerName` parameter.\r\n\r\n  * **Limitations (as of v7)**: &quot;SSH-based remoting doesn&#39;t currently support remote endpoint configuration and Just Enough Administration (JEA).&quot;\r\n\r\n* For ***Unix-to-Windows* remoting** (_Unix_ referring to Unix-like platforms such as macOS and Linux) - that is, remoting into a Windows machine from a Unix-like machine - you can alternatively use WinRM-based remoting with additional configuration:\r\n\r\n  * On the Windows machine:\r\n     * SSL connections must be enabled by configuring WinRM for HTTPS.\r\n     * The user accounts to be used from the Unix-like machines must be defined as _local_ user accounts in the _local_ Administrators group - domain accounts won&#39;t work.\r\n \r\n * The Unix-like machines must use the remoting cmdlets with the `-Authentication Basic -UseSsl` parameters.\r\n\r\n  * See [about_Remote_Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote_requirements#basic-authentication-limitations-on-linux-and-macos)\r\n\r\n* **A Unix WSMan-based implementation is being worked on in the [psl-omi-provider repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-omi-provider)**, which already enables *Linux* machines to act as remoting targets (that is, the *server* component is already usable - it&#39;s not clear to me whether it can also be installed on _macOS_); the client component, however, is not yet production-ready as of this writing.  \r\nOnce the client client component is available, uniform WSMan-based cross-platform remoting will be possible, both between Unix-like machines (Linux, macOS) and between Unix-like machines and Windows machines. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238481/powershell-remoting-controlling-what-edition-is-being-targeted-powershell-core","title":"PowerShell remoting: Controlling what edition is being targeted (PowerShell Core or Windows PowerShell);

Properties are immutable in Ant, so if you set a value via command line or earlier in the script, subsequent `&lt;property&gt;` tasks won&#39;t change it. This won&#39;t account for the property being set to a blank value (i.e. &quot;&quot;), but as a general good practice, try to avoid setting properties to blank.\r\n\r\nEven though I don&#39;t think you need a `&lt;condition&gt;` task for your goals here, I feel I should clear some things up in your example. The `&lt;condition&gt;` task doesn&#39;t affect the `&lt;target&gt;` that it&#39;s nested in; it simply sets a property, specified by the `property` attribute. Additionally, the `isset` condition&#39;s `property` attribute is used to point to the *name* of the property you&#39;re checking, not the value.\r\n\r\n\t&lt;condition property=&quot;noReportDSUpgrade&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;or&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;equals arg1=&quot;${noReportDSUpgrade}&quot; arg2=&quot;&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;not&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;isset property=&quot;noReportDSUpgrade&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/not&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/or&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/condition&gt;\r\n\r\nBut like I said above, don&#39;t use that unless you really need to check for a blank value for some reason. Just use `&lt;property&gt;`.\r\n\r\nAs for running targets conditionally, the `&lt;target&gt;` block supports `if` and `unless` attributes that control whether or not the entire thing runs. This can be a bit confusing because there are two modes in which this operates.\r\n\r\n\t&lt;target name=&quot;myTarget&quot; if=&quot;myCondition&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;echo message=&quot;Running myTarget&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/target&gt;\r\n\r\nThe above target will run if `myCondition` *is set* (not if its value is true). So if it evaluates to &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;asdf&quot;, or just blank, the target will still run. Conversely, if we used the `unless` attribute, it wouldn&#39;t run if `myCondition` is set to anything. This is usually convenient for when you&#39;re using the `&lt;condition&gt;` task to set your properties (since `&lt;condition&gt;` does not set a value if the boolean evaluates to false).\r\n\r\n\r\n\t&lt;target name=&quot;myTarget&quot; if=&quot;${myCondition}&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;echo message=&quot;Running myTarget&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/target&gt;\r\n\r\nNotice the `${}` around myCondition. When you expand the property like this, Ant will only run the target if the property&#39;s value is &quot;true&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;yes&quot;.\r\n\r\nLastly, you typically don&#39;t need to make a separate target just for setting conditions. In relatively simple scripts, you can just use the implicite root target (i.e. put the tasks at root level outside of all other targets).\r\n\r\nIn short, here&#39;s the simplest way to write your script.\r\n\r\n\t&lt;project name=&quot;myProject&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;property name=&quot;noReportDSUpgrade&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;target name=&quot;myTarget&quot; if=&quot;${noReportDSUpgrade}&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;echo message=&quot;Running myTarget&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/target&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/project&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you really need an initialization target (note the `depends` attribute):\r\n\r\n\t&lt;project name=&quot;myProject&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;target name=&quot;init&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;property name=&quot;noReportDSUpgrade&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/target&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;target name=&quot;myTarget&quot; if=&quot;${noReportDSUpgrade}&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;echo message=&quot;Running myTarget&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/target&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/project&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238464/how-to-check-a-property-or-variable-is-empty-and-set-a-value-then-test-for-that/58241585#58241585","title":"How to check a property or variable is empty and set a value then test for that value"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10240887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d44c3044610c7d3fa23bfe68c20ce88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JeffM23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10240887/jeffm23"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58241585,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570213994,"creation_date":1570199742,"question_id":58238464,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238464","body_markdown":"We are using Ant 1.8.

In other words, would it be better to simply store all the amenities and their sub_properties in a big JSON blob column on the listings table?\r\n\r\nThe reason for creating a recursive table is to make querying better so that eventually we can easily query for property listings that have ADSL internet, for example, and sort this by location so that we could possibly target specific areas for marketing purposes to upgrade to fibre. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238462/recursive-relationship-mysql-table-with-many-to-many-relationship","title":"Recursive relationship MySQL table with many-to-many relationship"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8642,"user_id":6356278,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cb6527e3af8a89177b809385400437b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wimpel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6356278/wimpel"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570200133,"post_id":58238459,"comment_id":102849804,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238459/separating-dates-from-variables-within-a-column#comment102849804_58238459"},{"owner":{"reputation":5281,"user_id":4184556,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cb596152383866ced1be19b78a07fc4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"iod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4184556/iod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570200790,"post_id":58238459,"comment_id":102850158,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238459/separating-dates-from-variables-within-a-column#comment102850158_58238459"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11863393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b31a7988543c7f71aa930ead1cb08a9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rw_r2019","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11863393/rw-r2019"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11863393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b31a7988543c7f71aa930ead1cb08a9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rw_r2019","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11863393/rw-r2019"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570201640,"creation_date":1570199730,"last_edit_date":1570201640,"question_id":58238459,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238459","body_markdown":"I have a dataframe with dates and variable values mixed in the first column: e.g. \r\n**2021-01-06, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2022-01-06, 5,2023-01-06,7,8**. \r\n\r\nIn this example, 1, 2, 3 and 4 are associated with 2021-01-06; 5 with 2022-01-06; and 7, 8 with 2023-01-06.

having troubles using `StringWriter` on our application.\r\nI do a rest call over a  `nosql db` and it returns a list of `dynamics`.\r\nI use `StringWriter` to write a `csv` file that contains a header and records from my list.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tried to extend the StringWriter with a `sealed class` with `constructor method` which allows you to enter the type of encoding as a parameter. But trying all the encodings available it still generates wrong charachters.\r\n\r\nThis is our extension of StringWriter:\r\n```C#\r\npublic sealed class StringWriterWithEncoding : StringWriter\r\n{\r\n    private readonly Encoding encoding;\r\n\r\n    public StringWriterWithEncoding() : this(Encoding.UTF8) { }\r\n\r\n    public StringWriterWithEncoding(Encoding encoding)\r\n

csv file:\r\n```C#\r\nStringWriterWithEncoding sw = new StringWriterWithEncoding();\r\n\r\n// Header\r\nsw.WriteLine(string.Format(&quot;{0};{1};{2};{3};{4};{5};{6};{7};{8};{9};&quot;,

&quot;Id Sessione&quot;, &quot;Testo Ricerca&quot;));\r\n\r\nforeach (var item in result.modelListDyn)\r\n{\r\n   sw.WriteLine(string.Format(&quot;{0};{1};{2};{3};{4};{5};{6};{7};{8};{9};&quot;, item.Satisfaction, item.Date, item.Cluster, item.UserId, item.Username, item.Category, item.DocumentId, HttpUtility.HtmlDecode(item.DocumentTitle.ToString()), item.SessionId, \r\n

System.Net.Http.Headers.MediaTypeHeaderValue(&quot;text/plain&quot;);\r\n\r\nreturn response;\r\n```\r\nWhen the file is generated on in a column with some text, it display strange chars:\r\n`L&#226;€™indennit&#195;&#160; di licenziamento del Jobs Act &#195;&#168; incostituzionale`\r\n\r\nThis is italian, and the wrong chars are seems to be `&#224; &#232; &#242; &#39; &#249;` etc.\r\n\r\nAnyone can suggest a solution?\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nAs user suggested, i started using CsvHelper\r\nI created a Class and a ClassMap but it still returns corrupted chars.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nStringWriter sw = new StringWriter();\r\nCsvWriter cw = new CsvWriter(sw);\r\nusing (CsvWriter csv = new CsvWriter(sw))\r\n{\r\n  csv.Configuration.RegisterClassMap&lt;HistorySearchModelCsvHelperMap&gt;();\r\n  csv.Configuration.CultureInfo = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;\r\n  csv.WriteRecords(csvModelHelperList);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgP8i.png\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2**\r\n\r\nThe problem is `client-side`, my action returns the correct text, without broken chars.\r\nAction is triggered when i call it with an `axios` get instance.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naxios.get(url, {\r\n   headers: {\r\n      &#39;Accept&#39;: &#39;application/vnd.ms-excel&#39;,\r\n      &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/vnd.ms-excel&#39;\r\n   }\r\n})\r\n.then(({ data }) =&gt; {\r\n   const blob = new Blob([data], {\r\n      type: &#39;application/vnd.ms-excel&#39;,\r\n   });\r\n   // &quot;fileDownload&quot; is &#39;js-file-download&#39; module.\r\n   fileDownload(blob,

exportLoading: false });\r\n});\r\n```\r\nI read to set `responseType` to `blob` but even passing the type: &#39;application/vnd.ms-excel&#39; the chars over my csv file are still corrupted.\r\nIn my `action` when i return the `Response`:\r\n```C#\r\n// ... some code\r\n\r\nStringWriterWithEncoding sw = new StringWriterWithEncoding();\r\nCsvWriter cw = new CsvWriter(sw);\r\nusing (CsvWriter csv = new CsvWriter(sw))\r\n{\r\n\tcsv.Configuration.RegisterClassMap&lt;HistorySearchModelCsvHelperMap&gt;();\r\n\tcsv.Configuration.CultureInfo =

For example, I&#39;m using Xunit, and a simple test looks like this:\r\n\r\n    using Xunit;                   // Testing framework.  NuGet package\r\n    using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox; // Driver for Firefox\r\n    using Xunit.Priority;          // NuGet add-on to Xunit that allows you to order the tests\r\n    using OpenQA.Selenium;         // NuGet package \r\n    using System.Diagnostics;      // Can Debug.Print when running tests in debug mode\r\n\r\n    namespace Test_MyWebPage\r\n    {\r\n        [TestCaseOrderer(PriorityOrderer.Name, PriorityOrderer.Assembly)] // Set up ordering\r\n        public class Test_BasicLogin : IDisposable\r\n        {\r\n           public static IWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(@&quot;path\\to\\geckodriver&quot;);\r\n\r\n           // Here be the tests...\r\n           [Fact, Priority(0)]\r\n           public void Test_LaunchWebsite()\r\n           {\r\n               // Arrange\r\n               var url = &quot;https://yourserver.yourdomain/yourvirtualdir&quot;;\r\n\r\n               // Act\r\n\r\n               // Sets browser to maximized, allows 1 minute for the page to\r\n               // intially load, and an implicit time out of 1 minute for elements\r\n               // on the page to render.\r\n               driver.Manage().Window.Maximize();\r\n               driver.Manage().Timeouts().PageLoad = new TimeSpan(0, 1, 0);\r\n               driver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitWait = new TimeSpan(0, 1, 0);\r\n        \r\n               driver.url = url;  // Launches the browser and opens the page\r\n\r\n               /* Assuming your page has a login prompt \r\n               /* we&#39;ll try to locate this element \r\n               /* and perform an assertion to test that the page comes up\r\n               /* and displays a login prompt */\r\n\r\n               var UserNamePrompt = driver.FindElement(By.Id(&quot;userLogin_txtUserName&quot;));   \r\n\r\n               // Assert\r\n               Assert.NotNull(UserNamePrompt); // Bombs if the prompt wasn&#39;t found.\r\n               Debug.Print(&quot;Found User Name Prompt successfully.&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public void Dispose()\r\n            {\r\n               // Properly close the browser when the tests are done\r\n                try\r\n                {\r\n                    driver.Quit();\r\n                }\r\n                catch (Exception ex)\r\n                {\r\n                    Debug.WriteLine($&quot;Error disposing driver: {ex.Message}&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is considerably more work in setting up tests for the Selenium WebDriver than in setting up simple smoke tests with the SeleniumIDE.  I haven&#39;t addressed how you should store your configs properly (hardcoding as in the example is bad) and you will have to tailor your driver.find() statements to fit your precise situation.  I am using the Xunit.Priority package so I can make sure the tests don&#39;t all run in parallel; I need to test one thing at a time in a progression.  Your needs might be met by putting all of the steps into a single Test_* method.  Each method appears as a separate test in the Visual Studio Test Explorer window.  Right-clicking a test in the Test Explorer and selecting &#39;Debug selected tests&#39; will allow you to set breakpoints and also enable your Debug.Print (or Debug.Write/Writeline) methods to display in the Tests section of the VS output window.\r\n\r\nAnother gotcha is in setting up the IWebDriver: don&#39;t put the *complete* path including the executable in the path, just the path to the folder that contains it.\r\n\r\nGood luck and happy testing!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238428/how-to-assert-in-selenium-webdriver-in-c/58289960#58289960","title":"How to assert in selenium webdriver in C#?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11066850,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f931372a43f66a238c057be1a9653a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Orgest Likaj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11066850/orgest-likaj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":409,"user_id":2377469,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":23,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bXhBW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"stacktome","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2377469/stacktome"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570550073,"creation_date":1570199637,"last_edit_date":1570212529,"question_id":58238428,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238428","body_markdown":"I am working with Selenium WebDriver in C# and I have to create a service for an applicant.

It looks like pretty good predictions for me. What I don&#39;t understand is why the count on line 14 isn&#39;t marked as a spike. Counts are going between 0 and 13 up until the 14. number. Then suddenly jumps to 61. When looking at the data in a graph, the jump definitely looks like a spike to me.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help to make me understand what is going on there","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238406/understanding-spikes-with-microsoft-ml-and-detectiidspike","title":"Understanding spikes with Microsoft.ML and DetectIidSpike"},{"tags":["xamarin","xamarin.forms"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":472,"user_id":6534215,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kSf1u.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mouse On Mars","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6534215/mouse-on-mars"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570221522,"post_id":58238405,"comment_id":102858060,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238405/xamarin-forms-update-viewmodel-field-from-a-bindable-property#comment102858060_58238405"},{"owner":{"reputation":284,"user_id":482270,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z8x6U.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"akseli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/482270/akseli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570420534,"post_id":58238405,"comment_id":102894785,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238405/xamarin-forms-update-viewmodel-field-from-a-bindable-property#comment102894785_58238405"},{"owner":{"reputation":74,"user_id":5057713,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edb36efb802ed1730983611bf5dcb5a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wolfman1001","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5057713/wolfman1001"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570439522,"post_id":58238405,"comment_id":102900442,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238405/xamarin-forms-update-viewmodel-field-from-a-bindable-property#comment102900442_58238405"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":437,"user_id":11850033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8DeL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"WendyZang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11850033/wendyzang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571108433,"post_id":58315034,"comment_id":103120529,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238405/xamarin-forms-update-viewmodel-field-from-a-bindable-property/58315034#comment103120529_58315034"},{"owner":{"reputation":437,"user_id":11850033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8DeL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"WendyZang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11850033/wendyzang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571303371,"post_id":58315034,"comment_id":103198753,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238405/xamarin-forms-update-viewmodel-field-from-a-bindable-property/58315034#comment103198753_58315034"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":437,"user_id":11850033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8DeL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"WendyZang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11850033/wendyzang"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570678073,"creation_date":1570678073,"answer_id":58315034,"question_id":58238405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58315034","body_markdown":"I make a custom control with bindable property.

I have a custom control that has a view model with a bunch of fields inside it but the important one for this example is a text value.

Which as far as I am aware requires the use of a bindable property\r\n\r\n    public static readonly BindableProperty TextProperty = BindableProperty.Create(propertyName: nameof(Text)\r\n                                                                   , returnType: typeof(string)\r\n                                                                   , declaringType: typeof(CustomControl));\r\n    public string Text\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            return GetValue(TextProperty).ToString();\r\n        }\r\n        set\r\n        {\r\n            SetValue(TextProperty, value);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich works. The problem is I don&#39;t want to be binding to something in the views code behind when I already have a viewmodel for the view but can see no way of going from a bindable property to a viewmodel field.\r\n\r\nI at first tried using the property changed event of the bindable property however this has to be static so it can not access the controls view model/binding context. I tried using the set on the Text field but these do not seem to actually get called. Neither of these worked and it seems inefficient to have a text field in the code behind purely to update a field in the view model\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit**: just to try and explain further,\r\nI have a page with a viewmodel \r\n\r\nI have a custom control which has xaml bound to a view model\r\n\r\nthe custom control is used on the page likes so\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;ctrl:CustomControl Text=&quot;{Binding ControlText}&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nCurrently that will set the Text dependency property and backing field in the custom controls code behind correctly to whatever the Pages viewmodel ControlText is.\r\n\r\nInstead I want this to set the Text field on the Custom controls viewmodel and fire the viewmodels property changed event. \r\n\r\nso basically it will go PageVM.ControlText --&gt; CustomControlVM.Text","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238405/xamarin-forms-update-viewmodel-field-from-a-bindable-property","title":"Xamarin forms update viewmodel field from a bindable property"},{"tags":["angular","intellij-idea","npm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59579,"user_id":2274212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f05f19aded7e6cfc60f184796e8e02a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2274212/lena"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570200169,"post_id":58238403,"comment_id":102849826,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238403/how-do-i-specify-in-package-json-to-use-the-version-that-was-flat-installed-by#comment102849826_58238403"},{"owner":{"reputation":59579,"user_id":2274212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f05f19aded7e6cfc60f184796e8e02a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2274212/lena"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570200230,"post_id":58238403,"comment_id":102849860,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238403/how-do-i-specify-in-package-json-to-use-the-version-that-was-flat-installed-by#comment102849860_58238403"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":3890569,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d083ed4d1b5630d25347a562feaad24?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"prototorpedo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3890569/prototorpedo"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570199545,"creation_date":1570199545,"question_id":58238403,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238403","body_markdown":"I am having the problem where we are using some piece of work in-house library that lists the dependencies like angular, material, rxjs and so forth internally, which we install --flat with yarn so we have them available in node_modules.

As Vlad Mihalcea explained quite detailed in [this article][1], `FetchType.EAGER` is not a good choice. It results in lots of unnecessary database requests. \r\n\r\n### NO CascadeType.REMOVE\r\nFurthermore, cascading all changes could result in serious issues. Removing a specific object could be cascaded automatically to removing lots of other objects. As [described in this article][2] (scroll down a little bit), `CascadeType.REMOVE` should be avoided for `@ManyToMany` relationships. `CascadeType.ALL` includes `REMOVE`. Instead, you should use `@ManyToMany(cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE})`\r\n\r\nAnother example of a `@ManyToMany` relationship could be found in [this Stackoverflow answer][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n# Initialise Lazy Relationships\r\n\r\nLazy relationships (like the &#39;good&#39; `@ManyToMany` mentioned) are not initialised by Hibernate (the ORM used by Spring Data automatically). Only a proxy with the relevant primary key could be found in the respective variable. The complete object gets loaded automatically from the database when someone tries to access the variable. This results in an additional database request.\r\n\r\nIf you already know beforehand that the object would be needed (the variable accessed), you should initialise the relationship when requesting the parent from the database (when you request a `ToolSet` from the database, its `idPhoto` should be loaded as well.\r\n\r\nIn SQL, this means a join between those different tables. In JPA, a join does not automatically mean that the data is loaded. Therefore, you should use a fetch join or a entity graph to initiliase the lazy annotations. [This article][4] gives a good overview how to use these different ways of initialising.\r\n\r\n### Example with Criteria API\r\n\r\nIn JPA there are different ways of implementing database requests: JPQL as a query language and the Criteria API (easier to refactor, less error prone). As I am a fan of the Criteria API, I will show you an example how the relationships could be initialised with it and the usage of an entity graph.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Optional&lt;ToolSet&gt; findById(long id) {\r\n\r\n    EntityGraph&lt;ToolSet&gt; graph = entityManager.createEntityGraph(ToolSet.class);\r\n    graph.addAttributeNodes(&quot;assignedTo&quot;);\r\n\r\n    Subgraph&lt;Contractor&gt; subgraph = graph.addSubgraph(&quot;assignedTo&quot;);\r\n    subgraph.addAttributeNodes(&quot;idPhoto&quot;);\r\n\r\n    CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();\r\n    CriteriaQuery&lt;ToolSet&gt; cq = cb.createQuery(ToolSet.class);\r\n    Root&lt;ToolSet&gt; root = cq.from(ToolSet.class);\r\n\r\n    cq.where(cb.equal(root.get(&quot;id&quot;), id));    // Assumption of id as PK\r\n    TypedQuery&lt;ToolSet&gt; typedQuery = entityManager.createQuery(cq);\r\n    typedQuery.setHint(&quot;javax.persistence.fetchgraph&quot;, graph);\r\n\r\n    ToolSet response = null;\r\n    try {\r\n        response = typedQuery.getSingleResult();\r\n    }\r\n    catch(NoResultException nre) {}\r\n    return Optional.ofNullable(response);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, I assume that your primary key for `ToolSet` is called `id`. To see mistakes even better at compile time, have a look at hibernate-jpamodelgen. Then, you could write things like `cq.where(cb.equal(root.get(ToolSet_.ID), id))`.\r\n\r\nAbove, I use `Optional`. It does not have to be used. Anyway, you could reasearch the advantages of using it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://vladmihalcea.com/eager-fetching-is-a-code-smell/\r\n  [2]:

It saves a map of entities in its first level cache avoiding going to look for more than one time to the database for the duration of the session and the unit of work.\r\n\r\nAs the hibernate documentation says ([read me][1]):\r\n\r\n&gt; The most common pattern in a multi-user client / server application is\r\n&gt; session-per-request. In this model, a request from the client is sent\r\n&gt; to the server, where the Hibernate persistence layer runs. A new\r\n&gt; Hibernate Session is opened, and all database operations are executed\r\n&gt; in this unit of work. On completion of the work, and once the response\r\n&gt; for the client has been prepared, the session is flushed and closed.\r\n&gt; Use a single database transaction to serve the clients request,\r\n&gt; starting and committing it when you open and close the Session. The\r\n&gt; relationship between the two is one-to-one and this model is a perfect\r\n&gt; fit for many applications.\r\n\r\nSo, the scope of your IdentityMap should be tied to your business transaction and therefore to the status of your UnitOfWork that will track all changes during your business transaction.\r\n\r\nIf your application handles short transactions (eg. per request) this will be quite simple. If you have a long-term unit of work that spans multiple requests, your unitOfWork must live in the session scope and your identity map attached to it.\r\n\r\nIt will be key to manage a good lock policy with your database in such cases to avoid problems with concurrent changes (the entity read in a request could have been modified when the time of committing arrived more easily in such cases).\r\n\r\nA basic example of implementing the pattern in java is (without going deep into the scope issue): https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master/unit-of-work\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/transactions.html#transactions-basics-uow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238361/how-to-use-unitofwork-pattern-together-with-identitymap-pattern/58305918#58305918","title":"How to use UnitOfWork pattern together with IdentityMap pattern?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571311642,"post_id":58417293,"comment_id":103203610,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238361/how-to-use-unitofwork-pattern-together-with-identitymap-pattern/58417293#comment103203610_58417293"},{"owner":{"reputation":59326,"user_id":697630,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40769e88c0dc93d387a9e368c332fdf9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Edwin Dalorzo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/697630/edwin-dalorzo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571331898,"post_id":58417293,"comment_id":103215069,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238361/how-to-use-unitofwork-pattern-together-with-identitymap-pattern/58417293#comment103215069_58417293"},{"owner":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571394333,"post_id":58417293,"comment_id":103235663,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238361/how-to-use-unitofwork-pattern-together-with-identitymap-pattern/58417293#comment103235663_58417293"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":59326,"user_id":697630,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40769e88c0dc93d387a9e368c332fdf9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Edwin Dalorzo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/697630/edwin-dalorzo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":59326,"user_id":697630,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40769e88c0dc93d387a9e368c332fdf9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Edwin Dalorzo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/697630/edwin-dalorzo"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571405589,"last_edit_date":1571405589,"creation_date":1571241172,"answer_id":58417293,"question_id":58238361,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58417293","body_markdown":"&gt; **Q: Is the `UnitOfWork` instance bounded by session?**\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 11 of Martin&#39;s book in question you read:\r\n\r\n&gt; “A Unit of Work keeps track of everything you do during a business transaction that can affect the database. When you’re done, it figures out everything that needs to be done to alter the database as a result of your work. [...]\r\n\r\n&gt; “As soon as you start doing something that may affect a database, you create a Unit of Work to keep track of the changes. Every time you create, change, or delete an object you tell the Unit of Work. You can also let it know about objects you’ve read so that it can check for inconsistent reads by verifying that none of the objects changed on the database during the business transaction.”\r\n\r\nSo, the `UnitOfWork` does not need to be bound to the session. The extent of the existence of the `UnitOfWork` instance depends on your design. In Martin&#39;s example in that same book, we can see that the UnitOfOWork instance is created per HTTP request (which I believe is the most classical use).\r\n\r\n    class UnitOfWorkServlet...\r\n    \r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;final protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;try {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;UnitOfWork.newCurrent();\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;handleGet(request, response);\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;UnitOfWork.getCurrent().commit();\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;} finally {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;UnitOfWork.setCurrent(null);\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    \r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;abstract void handleGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;throws ServletException, IOException; \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the JPA specification, the unit of work can be of two different natures: transaction-scoped persistence context, an extended-persistence context, but one can also handle it manually and get an application-managed unit of work ([see this other answer][1]). Which one you use depends on the use case. \r\n\r\n&gt; **Q: How many IdentityMap instances do we need?**\r\n\r\nMartin Fowler also answers that question in the book. In his section on `IdentityMap` there&#39;s an entire section about it.\r\n\r\nThe book read:\r\n\r\n&gt; “Here the decision varies between one map per class and one map for the whole session.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhere you could understand the session as the `UnitOfWork` in this case. Later in the book he explains:\r\n\r\n&gt; “If you have multiple maps, the obvious route is one map per class or per table, which works well if your database schema and object models are the same. ”\r\n\r\nA few paragraphs later Martin explains where to put the `IdentityMap`:\r\n\r\n&gt; “Identity Maps need to be somewhere where they’re easy to find. They’re also tied to the process context you’re working in. You need to ensure that each session gets its own instance that’s isolated from any other session’s instance. Thus, you need to put the Identity Map on a session-specific object. If you’re using Unit of Work that’s by far the best place for the Identity Maps since the Unit of Work is the main place for keeping track of data coming in or out of the database. If you don’t have a Unit of Work, the best bet is a Registry that’s tied to the session.”\r\n\r\nSo, there you have it, if your `UnitOfWork` is bound to a request, then you will have one or more `IdentityMaps` in that instance of your `UnitOfWork`.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; **So, is the Unit of Work bounded by business transaction?**\r\n\r\nYes, it is. \r\n\r\nNow the extent of the &quot;business transaction&quot; could be short-lived, e.g. bound to the life of the HTTP request as in Martin Fowler&#39;s example above where the UnitOfWork seems to be bound to a thread-local variable per request. \r\n\r\nOr the &quot;business transaction&quot; could encompass multiple requests, e.g. in JPA there&#39;s a concept of an extended persistence context, where the persistent context in JPA corresponds to a `UnitOfWork` pattern. In an extended persistence context, the business transaction extends for a longer period of time. A classical example of this is a shopping cart: when the user starts putting items in her shopping cart a context/unit of work is created, and the context won&#39;t get cleared until the user checks out her shopping cart (committing the changes) or her session expires (discarding everything in the unit of work). \r\n\r\nNow, there is also the idea of application-managed context, which basically means, start your unit of work when you think it&#39;s appropriate and close it when you no longer need it. For example, suppose you have a desktop application and a small database with isolated concurrency (i.e. every user only manages his own data and never conflict with other user&#39;s data). Suppose that the user&#39;s data could perfectly fit in the computer&#39;s memory. In a case like that, you could start your `UnitOfWork` at the start of the application and use it as a sort of cache for your database. When appropriate, you can flush the UnitOfWork to disk, e.g. when the user clicks a save button, but still keep it alive. When the user closes the application, the UnitOfWork is discarded.\r\n\r\nSo, you can see there is a lot of nuances on what a &quot;business transaction&quot; actually means, or for how long the `UnitOfWork` should exist.\r\n\r\n**Multiple Units of Work**\r\n\r\nBased on the explanation so far, you can have multiple units of work for, among others, the following reasons:\r\n\r\n - One `UnitWork` per request, and if your application handles concurrent requests, then you would have multiple units of work instances at the same time.\r\n - One `UnitOfWork` per extended transaction, and so, tied to the user&#39;s session. If you have multiple users, you can have multiple units of work.\r\n\r\nHowever, besides these, I have found other reasons why you may want to spawn a new unit of work during the same &quot;business transaction&quot;.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual that while you&#39;re executing a business transaction you may want to execute another totally independent one. For example, suppose that in order to place an order for the customer, the customer record must exist in the database, but if the customer record fails to be created (e.g. perhaps because another customer has same conflicting email), you still want to place the order in pending review status.\r\n\r\nSo, the problem you face here is that if you attempt to create the customer during the business transaction of placing an order and creating the customer fails, that contaminates your order transaction and your unit of work is forced to roll back everything. In a situation like this you may want to spawn a new unit of work and therefore a new, separate database transaction, to create the customer and if that separate unit of work fails to create the customer, this does not contaminate your order creation unit of work, allowing you to take measures to still persist your order without a customer in a pending review status.\r\n\r\nI believe JPA&#39;s concept of a &quot;context&quot; is a very good example of how to define a unit of work. I would suggest that you study [their specification](https://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/persistence-2.0-fr-oth-JSpec/) particularly their section about the `EntityManager`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10763047/697630","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238361/how-to-use-unitofwork-pattern-together-with-identitymap-pattern/58417293#58417293","title":"How to use UnitOfWork pattern together with IdentityMap pattern?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":174,"favorite_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58417293,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571405589,"creation_date":1570199376,"last_edit_date":1570203945,"question_id":58238361,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238361","body_markdown":"In Martin Fowler&#39;s book I read about `UnitOfWork` and `IdentityMap`  patterns.\r\n\r\nAuthor mentioned that it is a good idea to put identityMap inside the UnitOfWork.
