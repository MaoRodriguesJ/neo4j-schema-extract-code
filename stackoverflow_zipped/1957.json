There are no Production-env specific gems in my Gemfile.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076284/heroku-rails-server-wont-bind-to-port","title":"Heroku Rails Server Won&#39;t Bind to Port"},{"tags":["containers","minikube","minishift"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2125,"user_id":3156333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76e6084bd9e856704d12ac4afe7b45a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Crou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3156333/crou"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569494827,"creation_date":1569494827,"answer_id":58115113,"question_id":58076279,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58115113","body_markdown":"Theoretically, yes this might be possible.

What seems to happen is that some Python libraries with threading support (NumPy, OpenCV), when trying to release and reacquire the GIL, end up deadlocked. In this example we force a division by zero in NumPy, which executes some NumPy-specific exception handling code which involves the GIL, and which causes a deadlock. Changing this to\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;Python.h&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n#include &lt;string&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                          \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]){                                                                                                                                                                          \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n    Py_Initialize();                                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n    int result;                                                                                                                                                                                              \r\n    std::string command = \r\n        &quot;import numpy as np; a=np.array([2,3]); b=np.array([2,0]); print(a/b)&quot;;                                                                                                            \r\n    result = PyRun_SimpleString (command.c_str());                                                                                                                                                           \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n    return result;                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit seemingly executes without any problem.\r\n       \r\nThe real C++ program is multithreaded, and the Python executed from it is a very large program. The actual alternative program (i.e. the second example) would, rather than acquiring the GIL before executing Python (as in the first example), acquire a generic lock (mutex, semaphore) to avoid concurrent access.\r\n       \r\nI am not sure what was the reason to embed the interpreter in this way. Might this change in how the Python interpreter is called be unsafe or break things, like allowing multiple threads to concurrently access resources that should be protected, or can this change be safely made? \r\n       \r\nThe person that implemented this is not around anymore, so I cannot ask him.\r\n       \r\nThe version of Python we&#39;re using is 2.7.15, and versions of NumPy in which this happens are 1.8.2, 1.15.2, 1.16.5, and the g++ version is 7.4.0.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076260/embedding-python-in-a-c-program-how-to-deal-with-the-gil","title":"Embedding Python in a C++ program, how to deal with the

Hdf5GUI inherits from class GUi and perfecly works. The class `ExportGUI` inherits from `Hdf5GUI` and is called by the function `export`. \r\n\r\n    # Parent class\r\n\r\n    from Tkinter import *\r\n\r\n    class GUI:\r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            pass\r\n\r\n    class Hdf5:\r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            self.datatsetsfilter = &quot;Something&quot;\r\n\r\n    class Hdf5GUI(GUI):\r\n        def exportDatasetPath(self):\r\n            self.ohdf5 = Hdf5()\r\n            \r\nSo until now my code perfectly works but I had to complete my program with some other functions that I call in `ExportGUI`. For example `export_filter`, the thing is I am trying to access the parent variable `datasetsfilter` through a child function but it doesnt work :\r\n      \r\n\r\n    #==============================================================================\r\n    # Child class   \r\n    #==============================================================================\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n    class ExportGUI(Hdf5GUI): \r\n\r\n        def __init__(self,hdf5w, master):\r\n             \r\n            self.master = master\r\n            self.master.title(&quot;Export&quot;)\r\n            self.master.geometry(&#39;200x200&#39;)\r\n            \r\n            label = Label(self.master, text=&quot;Choose the kind of export&quot;)\r\n            label.place(x=20, y=0)\r\n       \r\n            export_selected = Button(self.master, text = &#39;Export filters&#39;,command=self.export_filter)\r\n            export_selected.place(x=20, y=50)\r\n                   \r\n            self.master.mainloop()   \r\n\r\n        def export_filter(self):    \r\n            print(self.ohdf5.datatsetsfilter)\r\n \r\nBut I got the following error :\r\n\r\n    Exception in Tkinter callback\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda2\\lib\\lib-tk\\Tkinter.py&quot;, line 1542, in __call__\r\n        return self.func(*args)\r\n      File &quot;GUI\\GUI.py&quot;, line 397, in export_filter\r\n        print(self.ohdf5.datatsetsfilter)\r\n    AttributeError: &#39;ExportGUI&#39; object has no attribute &#39;ohdf5&#39;\r\n\r\nNeither `ohdf5` or `datatsetsfilter` is known by `ExportGUI`(I had the same error with `self.datatsetsfilter`). \r\n**Considering this code didnt work** I tried to use the `super` function. I created a function `get_datasetsfilter` in `Hdf5GUI` :\r\n\r\n     def get_datasetsfilter(self):\r\n            return self.datasetsfilter\r\n\r\nand then called it in `ExportGUI` (I added `__metaclass__ = type` to fix type prblm in 2.7) : \r\n\r\n    def export_filter(self):    \r\n            super(ExportGUI, self).get_datasetsfilter\r\nI admit I saw many other exemple with `Super` but they all seems to be used in `__init__` method. However, it still doesnt work. I am now wondering if the error results from my bad comprehension of inheritance or `tkinter`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076238/issue-passing-parent-variable-through-tkinter","title":"Issue passing parent variable through tkinter"},{"tags":["javascript","angular"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1292,"user_id":2010955,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87922d37974fbb6418e0c9593339a7ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2010955","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2010955/user2010955"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569315877,"post_id":58076234,"comment_id":102548063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076234/bundle-js-files-in-source-html-page-how-to-works-in-angular#comment102548063_58076234"},{"owner":{"reputation":623,"user_id":10116812,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLdFH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mojtaba Nava","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10116812/mojtaba-nava"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1292,"user_id":2010955,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87922d37974fbb6418e0c9593339a7ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2010955","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2010955/user2010955"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569315979,"post_id":58076234,"comment_id":102548119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076234/bundle-js-files-in-source-html-page-how-to-works-in-angular#comment102548119_58076234"}],"owner":{"reputation":623,"user_id":10116812,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLdFH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mojtaba Nava","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10116812/mojtaba-nava"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569314235,"creation_date":1569314235,"question_id":58076234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076234","body_markdown":"In my angular projects, I see `style.bundle.js`,`polifily.bundle.js`,... files in source page in my browser.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will change these files name.

However, there are many people who want to query both XML and JSON in the same program, for example to convert one to the other. This is why there are extensions (both ways). Rather than forbidden, I would say that they are optional (and actually encouraged).\r\n\r\nIf the data is a mix of JSON and XML, then you can use either the &quot;JSONiq extension to XQuery&quot; or the &quot;XQuery extension to JSONiq.&quot; The differences are minor and revolve around convenience. Feature-wise, both are equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe exact differences are comprehensively documented [here](http://www.zorba.io/documentation/latest/zorba/xml_json)\r\n\r\nA complete grammar with JSONiq, the XQuery extension and even updates and scripting is available [here](http://www.jsoniq.org/grammars/jq++.xhtml).\r\n\r\nIf there is a lot of JSON and a bit of XML, then &quot;the &quot;XQuery extension to JSONiq&quot; is more adequate: you can query JSON with dots and escaping in strings is done with backslashes, and literals like `null`, `true` and `false` are recognized, but any XPath name queries on XML Names must be prefixed by ./ (`./foo` instead of just `foo`), etc.\r\n\r\nIf there is a lot of XML and a bit of JSON, the &quot;JSONiq extension to XQuery&quot; is more adequate. It is the opposite: the exact, W3C-compliant XPath syntax is supported and string escaping with ampersands, but for example booleans and nulls must be written as `true()`, `false()`, `null()` to not interfere with XPath.\r\n\r\nThe [Zorba](http://www.zorba.io) engine supports both of the variants, and you can switch using `xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;` or `jsoniq version &quot;1.0&quot;` in the header of the query, with no further configuration: if you use JSONiq, the XQuery extension is always available as well, and if you use XQuery, the JSONiq extension is always available.\r\n\r\nIf no header is present, then the extension `.xq` or `.jq` is used to infer the language used.\r\n\r\nWhether or not a JSONiq processor supports the XQuery extension is a decision of the software provider. In general, we encourage implementors of a JSONiq engine to support the XQuery extension if they have the resources. Providers who want to keep a very lightweight engine will stick to core JSONiq.\r\n\r\nThe other way round, extending an existing XQuery engine with the JSONiq extension is very easy: when we did so in Zorba when we started supporting JSON, it only took us a few days because the JSON data model is so simple. There is a talk by Jonathan Robie sharing experience on this topic on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzgB-eZEopE).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076226/does-jsoniq-support-processing-xml/58081645#58081645","title":"Does JSONiq support processing XML?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2551,"user_id":373710,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9827ddb7c8cb132375cf55bf7e624250?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jakob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/373710/jakob"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58081645,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569333966,"creation_date":1569314196,"question_id":58076226,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076226","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve seen statements that JSONiq query language also supports processing XM, but the only example I found is in the JSONiq Wikipedia article.

I just didn&#39;t fully understand the Apollo Client and how to use all of the required packages.\r\n\r\n**SOLUTION**\r\n\r\nI used `setContext` from the `apollo-link-context` library. It&#39;s part of the `link` set of libraries that Apollo Client offers to customise the network request after a graphql operation has started. I set the header in the `setContext` function. Like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) =&gt; {\r\n  // It is also possible to use the local storage method in here.\r\n  const data = cache.readQuery({\r\n    query: ACCESS_TOKEN\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      ...headers,\r\n      authorization: accessToken ? `Bearer ${data.accessToken}` : &quot;&quot;,\r\n      &#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39;: &#39;http://localhost:3000/&#39;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe following is outside the `withApollo` function.\r\n```\r\nconst httpLink = new HttpLink({\r\n  uri: &#39;&lt;server uri&gt;&#39;,\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe following is inside the `withApollo` function.\r\n```\r\nreturn new ApolloClient({\r\n    cache,\r\n    link: authLink.concat(httpLink),\r\n    typeDefs,\r\n    resolvers\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe docs for how `setContext` are [here][1] and the docs for the `apollo-link-context&#39; are [here][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/networking/authentication/#header\r\n  [2]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/context/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076206/apollo-client-next-js-adding-authorization-token-to-client-request/58091062#58091062","title":"Apollo client + Next.js - Adding Authorization token to client request"}],"owner":{"reputation":529,"user_id":7171619,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0Lab.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codeinaire","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7171619/codeinaire"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58091062,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569384851,"creation_date":1569314137,"question_id":58076206,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076206","body_markdown":"**GOAL**\r\n\r\nI want to populate my `Authorization` header with an access token. I want to store that access token in the Apollo cache as [Auth0][1] explicitly state not to store access tokens in local storage (I don&#39;t know why the [Apollo Client docs][2] seem to think it&#39;s okay).\r\n\r\nFailing that, I want to store my access token securely and be able to add it to each Apollo Client request to the Apollo Server.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst apolloClient = withApollo(({ctx, headers, initialState}) =&gt; {\r\n  const cache = new InMemoryCache();\r\n  \r\n  // Code here to access local cache.\r\n\r\n  return new ApolloClient({\r\n\r\n    cache,\r\n    link: new HttpLink({\r\n      uri: &lt;apollo server endpoint&gt;,\r\n      headers: {\r\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,\r\n        &#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39;: &#39;http://localhost:3000/&#39;,\r\n        ...headers\r\n      },\r\n      credentials: &#39;include&#39;\r\n    }),\r\n    typeDefs,\r\n    resolvers\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n\r\nclass MyApp extends App {\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { Component, pageProps, apollo } = this.props;\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;ApolloProvider client={apollo}&gt;\r\n        &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default apolloClient(MyApp);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TRIED**\r\n\r\n - I&#39;ve tried to access `localStorage` from within the `withApollo` function but it is SSR&#39;d so I&#39;m unable to access that. I was going to use the `localStorage` to set a boolean to check in the `withApollo` function so it&#39;ll know the access token has been added to the apollo cache after the redirect.\r\n - I&#39;ve tried just using the cache with a key storing a boolean to check if the user has signed in which is set in the same function where the access token. If that is true I&#39;d access the access token key and add that to the `Authorization` header. But I was getting issues with setting the initial state overriding the cache set in sign in function.\r\n\r\n**OTHER IDEAS**\r\n\r\n - I thought I could pass the access token through in the `ctx` argument, but I&#39;m not familiar enough with Next.js to figure out if that&#39;s valid way to do it.\r\n\r\n - I thought I could pass in a props to the `withApollo` function from a component, but that doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d be possible.\r\n\r\n**QUESTIONS**\r\n\r\n - What is the best way to store the access key so as to add it to the Apollo Client with each request?\r\n - I noticed some people are using a `fetch` polyfill, would that be appropriate for this situation? If so, how would that work?\r\n - How does the `withApollo` HOC work and why is it needed to work with Next.js? I&#39;ve read some of the code behind this, but I don&#39;t fundamentally understand why it is needed.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://auth0.com/docs/security/store-tokens\r\n  [2]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/recipes/authentication/#header","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076206/apollo-client-next-js-adding-authorization-token-to-client-request","title":"Apollo client + Next.js - Adding Authorization token to client request"},{"tags":["overriding","varchar","typo3-9.x","flexform"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":922,"user_id":2310852,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4igZY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user2310852","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310852/user2310852"},"last_editor":{"reputation":922,"user_id":2310852,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4igZY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user2310852","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310852/user2310852"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570540595,"last_edit_date":1570540595,"creation_date":1569314635,"answer_id":58076348,"question_id":58076201,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58076348","body_markdown":"Solution: Everything like initial post ... additional insert into your own `ext_tables.sql`:\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE fe_users (\r\n        title varchar(255) DEFAULT &#39;&#39; NOT NULL\r\n    );\r\n\r\nNow, the title has varchar(255).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076201/typo3-how-can-i-change-the-value-length-of-fe-users-fields/58076348#58076348","title":"TYPO3 How can I change the value length of fe_users fields"}],"owner":{"reputation":922,"user_id":2310852,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4igZY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user2310852","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310852/user2310852"},"last_editor":{"reputation":922,"user_id":2310852,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4igZY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user2310852","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310852/user2310852"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569314668,"accepted_answer_id":58076348,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570540595,"creation_date":1569314127,"last_edit_date":1569328935,"question_id":58076201,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076201","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using `TYPO3 9.5.

How to secure my linux C program against piracy\r\n\r\n##You probably can&#39;t. \r\n\r\nIf I am expert enough and motivated enough, I could [decompile][1] your binary executable (or study it with [binsec][2]), study its dynamic behavior (with e.g. `strace`  or `gdb`, etc...), or detect your tricks and patch then build and install my Linux [kernel][3] source code (it is free software) to circumvent your protections.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if your adversary is as powerful as the [NSA][4], you have lost that game.\r\n\r\nConceptually the &quot;protection&quot; of a C program can be related to the [halting problem][5] and to [Rice&#39;s theorem][6]. Gory and difficult details are left as an exercise to the reader. And you&#39;ll find tons of academic papers about [software obfuscation][7] techniques (a quite effective one being in practice compiling and linking [with][8] `gcc -flto -O3` then [strip][9]ping the resulting executable). \r\n\r\n&gt; How to make this program to run only in this computer\r\n\r\nRead more about [DMZ][10] and [iptables][11]. Protect that computer by legal means and by physical means (including even 24h/24 machine guns armed guards to avoid it being stealen or damaged; they would cost you much more than the computer itself). Invest years of your time to learn more about [cybersecurity][12] (you could make a PhD on that at my workplace).\r\n\r\n The socially and economically effective protection is a good license ([EULA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement)) written by some costly and expert lawyer. If your clients are corporations, they won&#39;t risk breaking that license, even if technically they could. (think of what could happen if they did). Observe that proprietary programs on Linux have in 2019 less protections against piracy than those in 1999 (and that even [Oracle][13] or [SAP][14] are not making most of their profit, while selling Linux proprietary software, on software licenses but on related [services][15]). Study the business model of [RedHat][16] and its profits. Read papers or books on economics of open source (e.g. [this one][17], the most cited one).\r\n\r\nAccording to rumors Oracle costly binaries don&#39;t have protections. But I use free software RDBMS.\r\n\r\nAnd if you add too complex to deploy protections into your software, you just are losing potential clients.\r\n\r\n**The most difficult step is to find *actual* clients for your software**, not to invent or deploy difficult technical tricks to avoid piracy. You could use some *existing*, but imperfect, [license manager][18]. My guess is that you won&#39;t find many clients (and you could give your source code to each of them, with a suitable license -perhaps a restricted license written by your lawyer- without harming your business; most persons on Earth don&#39;t even have the necessary skills to compile your source code, and those who do won&#39;t risk to go against the laws and the contracts, written by your lawyer, signed by you and them, without a very strong incentive; and I won&#39;t accept or trust your binary without having glanced into your source code before).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Don&#39;t spend a lot of efforts on protecting your software.** Do spend months of efforts on documenting it properly, debugging it, and commercializing it (and, once you have a client who paid you, on training and helping your client to use your software).\r\n\r\nPS. My personal feeling is that even if you gave me your binary Linux executable for free -as in beer- I won&#39;t even bother trying it (because I probably don&#39;t need it, and certainly because I don&#39;t trust you enough)\r\n\r\nPPS. For me, the most important aspect of a Linux distribution is to be made of [free software][19] (a.k.a. libre software) or [open source][20]. It is certainly not the &quot;gratis&quot; (or free as in beer) aspect of Linux. I value freedom above the fact of not paying Debian. I am professionally [writing][21] free software, and I am paid for that.\r\n\r\nNB. Look also into [this draft report][22] and its bibliography. It is border-line relevant to your question. And consider subcontracting the protection work at my workplace (send me an email at `basile.starynkevitch@cea.fr` if you are really serious). The [lab I][23] am working at is collectively capable of adding good protection to your code. Allocate then a budget of several hundred thousands € for that service, and at least 100k€ (for a few person-months of work). My boss would be delighted if such a contract becomes reality (but I would find such a task very boring).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompiler\r\n  [2]: http://binsec.gforge.inria.fr/about.html\r\n  [3]: https://kernel.org/\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem\r\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem\r\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)\r\n  [8]: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html\r\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_(Unix)\r\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)\r\n  [11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables\r\n  [12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security\r\n  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation\r\n  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_SE\r\n  [15]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service\r\n  [16]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat\r\n  [17]: http:///http://www.nber.org/papers/w7600\r\n  [18]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_manager\r\n  [19]: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html\r\n  [20]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\r\n  [21]: https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/\r\n  [22]: http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/bismon-chariot-doc.pdf\r\n  [23]: http://www-list.cea.fr/en/technological-research/research-programmes/embedded-systems/validation-and-verification","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076200/how-to-secure-my-linux-c-program-against-piracy/58077566#58077566","title":"How to secure my linux C program against piracy"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10653713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83736665299084b4d7dce298aac7c155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vkkindia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10653713/vkkindia"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":101,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1569319019,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569350968,"creation_date":1569314121,"question_id":58076200,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076200","body_markdown":"I have written a program in C which I need to prevent from illegal use by copying.

To use struct type parameters, the following constraints have to be added to the interface and the types:\r\n\r\n    where TResult : struct\r\n    where TError  : struct\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen I think about the Either pattern, I think about F#, pattern matching and discriminated unions, not nulls. In fact, `Either` is a way to *avoid* nulls. In fact, the question&#39;s code looks like an attempt to create a [Result type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/results), not just an Either. Scott Wlaschin&#39;s [Railway Oriented Programming](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/recipe-part2.html) shows how such a type can be used to implement error handling in a functional language.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn F#, the [Result](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/results) type is defined as:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Result&lt;&#39;T,&#39;TError&gt; = \r\n    | Ok of ResultValue:&#39;T \r\n    | Error of ErrorValue:&#39;TError\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t do that in C# 8 yet, because there are no discriminated unions. Those are planned for C# 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pattern Matching**\r\n\r\nWhat we *can* do, is use pattern matching to get the same behavior eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface IResult&lt;TResult,TError&gt;{} //No need for an actual implementation\r\n\r\npublic class Success&lt;TResult,TError&gt;:IResult&lt;TResult,TError&gt;\r\n\r\n{\r\n    public TResult Result {get;}\r\n\r\n    public Success(TResult result) { Result=result;}\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Error&lt;TResult,TError&gt;:IResult&lt;TResult,TError&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public TError ErrorValue {get;}\r\n\r\n    public Error(TError error) { ErrorValue=error;}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way there&#39;s no way to create an `IResult&lt;&gt;` that is both a success and error. This can be used with pattern matching, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIResult&lt;int,string&gt; someResult=.....;\r\n\r\nif(someResult is Success&lt;int,string&gt; s)\r\n{\r\n    //Use s.Result here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Simplifying the expressions**\r\n\r\nGiven C# 8&#39;s [property patterns](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/do-more-with-patterns-in-c-8-0/), this could be rewritten as :\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(someResult is Success&lt;int,string&gt; {Result: var result} )\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, using switch expressions, a typical railway-style call :\r\n\r\n```\r\nIResult&lt;int,string&gt; DoubleIt(IResult&lt;int,string&gt; data)\r\n{\r\n    return data switch {    Error&lt;int,string&gt; e=&gt;e,\r\n                            Success&lt;int,string&gt; {Result: var result}=&gt;\r\n                                       new Success&lt;int,string&gt;(result*2),\r\n                            _ =&gt; throw new Exception(&quot;Unexpected type!&quot;)\r\n                            };\r\n}    \r\n```\r\n\r\nF# wouldn&#39;t need that `throw` as there&#39;s no way that an `Result&lt;&#39;T,&#39;TError&gt;` would be something other than `Ok` or `Error`. In C#, we don&#39;t have that feature *yet*. \r\n\r\nThe switch expression allows exhaustive matching. I think the compiler will generate a warning if the default clause is missing too.\r\n\r\n**With deconstructors**\r\n\r\nThe expressions can be simplified a bit more if the types have deconstructors, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Success&lt;TResult,TError&gt;:IResult&lt;TResult,TError&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public TResult Result {get;}\r\n\r\n    public Success(TResult result) { Result=result;}\r\n    \r\n    public void Deconstruct(out TResult result) { result=Result;}\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Error&lt;TResult,TError&gt;:IResult&lt;TResult,TError&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public TError ErrorValue {get;}\r\n\r\n    public Error(TError error) { ErrorValue=error;}\r\n    \r\n    public void Deconstruct(out TError error) { error=ErrorValue;}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case the expression can be written as :\r\n\r\n\r\n    return data switch {    \r\n                    Error&lt;int,string&gt; e =&gt; e,\r\n                    Success&lt;int,string&gt; (var result) =&gt; new Success&lt;int,string&gt;(result*3),\r\n                    _ =&gt; throw new Exception(&quot;Unexpected type!&quot;)\r\n    };\r\n\r\n**Nullability**\r\n\r\nThe question started with nullable reference types, so what about nullability? Will we get a warning in C# 8 if we try to pass a nulll?\r\n\r\nYes, as long as NRTs are enabled. This code :\r\n\r\n```\r\n#nullable enable\r\n\r\nvoid Main()\r\n{\r\n     IResult&lt;string,string&gt; data=new Success&lt;string,string&gt;(null);\r\n     var it=Append1(data);\r\n     Console.WriteLine(it);\r\n}\r\n\r\nIResult&lt;string,string&gt; Append1(IResult&lt;string,string&gt; data)\r\n{\r\n    return data switch {    Error&lt;string,string&gt; e=&gt;e,\r\n                            Success&lt;string,string&gt; (var result)=&gt;\r\n                                new Success&lt;string,string&gt;(result+&quot;1&quot;),\r\n                            _ =&gt; throw new Exception(&quot;Unexpected type!&quot;)\r\n                            };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenereates `CS8625: Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type`\r\n\r\nTrying \r\n\r\n```\r\nstring? s=null;\r\nIResult&lt;string,string&gt; data=new Success&lt;string,string&gt;(s);\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerates `CS8604: Possible null reference argument ....`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076171/nullable-reference-types-and-either-pattern/58076589#58076589","title":"Nullable Reference Types and Either Pattern"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8045,"user_id":621316,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5203b24e171961e916d054b73d8b5b59?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave Cousineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/621316/dave-cousineau"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8045,"user_id":621316,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5203b24e171961e916d054b73d8b5b59?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave Cousineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/621316/dave-cousineau"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569369512,"last_edit_date":1569369512,"creation_date":1569349261,"answer_id":58086152,"question_id":58076171,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58086152","body_markdown":"You can do something like this with Resharper `ContractAnnotation`. It&#39;s not C# 8 specific, (but... I don&#39;t think your example is really using nullable reference types anyway, is it? You are using nullable structs.)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ContractAnnotation(\r\n   &quot;=&gt; pError: null, pResponse: notnull; =&gt; pError: notnull, pResponse: null&quot;\r\n)]\r\npublic void Get(out TError? pError, out TReturn? pResponse) {\r\n   pError = Error;\r\n   pResponse = Response;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(The meaning of the string is that left of the `=&gt;` is input conditions, and right of the `=&gt;` is output conditions, with `;` separating different cases, and an unlabled value referring to the method return value. So in this case: regardless of input, the output condition is ether of null/notnull or notnull/null.)\r\n\r\nThen use C# 7 feature `out var`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGetAnEitherFromSomewhere()\r\n.Get(out var error, out var response);\r\nif (error != null) {\r\n   // handle error\r\n   return;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// response is now known to be not null, because we can only get here if error was null\r\n```\r\n\r\nHonestly I&#39;m finding JetBrains&#39;s annotations `[NotNull]`, `[CanBeNull]`, and `[ContractAnnotation]` to be a lot more flexible (though more verbose) than nullable reference types. Basically they allow for the intermediate case, where there are situations where the value can be `null`, but also situations where the value cannot be `null`, and those situations are distinguishable at run-time. With nullable reference types, I can&#39;t specify the in-between case, I have to choose either definitely nullable or definitely not nullable.\r\n\r\nEven something common like `TryParse`:\r\n\r\n    // should the result be nullable with nullable reference types on?\r\n    // you have to either lie with ! or else use ? and assume it can always be null\r\n    public bool TryParse(string pString, out SomeClass pResult) {\r\n       if (&lt;cant parse&gt;) {\r\n          pResult = null;\r\n          return false;\r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       pResult = value;\r\n       return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // works great with JetBrains annotations and nullable reference types off\r\n    // now you can know that the result is null or notnull\r\n    // based on testing the bool return value\r\n    [ContractAnnotation(&quot;=&gt; true, pResult: notnull; =&gt; false, pResult: null&quot;)]\r\n    public bool TryParse(string pString, out SomeClass pResult) {\r\n       ...\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076171/nullable-reference-types-and-either-pattern/58086152#58086152","title":"Nullable Reference Types and Either Pattern"}],"owner":{"reputation":681,"user_id":1851318,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13f593a227714311faea393efd0ba5f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Romain Vergnory","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1851318/romain-vergnory"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":158,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58076589,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569397295,"creation_date":1569314015,"question_id":58076171,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076171","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying out the new [Nullable Reference Types in C# 8.0][1], and I&#39;m facing this issue.

Since there are no landmarks as to hierarchy absolute or relative position (as in the NAME and MKPRT) there is no 100% confident way to place them in the hierarchy and that can also affect the placement of items read-in from subsequent data lines.\r\n\r\nDepending on the true complexity and adherence to rules in the real world you may or may not &#39;miss out&#39; the reading of some values.\r\n\r\nSuppose there is the simpler goal of just getting the meter readings.\r\n\r\n    data want;\r\n    \r\n    length tier level1-level6 $8 path $64 meterReadingString $8 dummy $1;\r\n    retain level1-level5 path;\r\n    attrib readingdate informat=yymmdd10. format=yymmdd10.;\r\n    \r\n    infile cards dsd missover;\r\n    \r\n    input @1 tier @; * held input - dont advance read line yet;\r\n    \r\n    if tier=&quot;TRANS&quot; then do;\r\n      level1 = tier;\r\n      call missing (of level2-level6);\r\n      path = catx(&quot;/&quot;, of level:);\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    if tier=&quot;MTPNT&quot; and path=&quot;TRANS&quot; then do;\r\n      level2 = tier;\r\n      call missing (of level3-level6);\r\n      path = catx(&quot;/&quot;, of level:);\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    if tier=&quot;ASSET&quot; and path=&quot;TRANS/MTPNT&quot; then do;\r\n      level3 = tier;\r\n      call missing (of level4-level6);\r\n      path = catx(&quot;/&quot;, of level:);\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    if tier=&quot;METER&quot; and path=&quot;TRANS/MTPNT/ASSET&quot; then do;\r\n      level4 = tier;\r\n      call missing (of level5-level6);\r\n      path = catx(&quot;/&quot;, of level:);\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    if tier=&quot;REGST&quot; and path=&quot;TRANS/MTPNT/ASSET/METER&quot; then do;\r\n      level5 = tier;\r\n      call missing (of level6-level6);\r\n      path = catx(&quot;/&quot;, of level:);\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    if tier=&quot;READG&quot; and path=&quot;TRANS/MTPNT/ASSET/METER/REGST&quot; then do;\r\n      level6 = tier;\r\n      path = catx(&quot;/&quot;, of level:);\r\n      input @1 tier readingdate dummy meterReadingString @; * reread line according to tier;\r\n    \r\n      meterReading = input(meterReadingString, best12.);\r\n\r\n      if path = &quot;TRANS/MTPNT/ASSET/METER/REGST/READG&quot; then OUTPUT;\r\n    end;    \r\n    \r\n    datalines;\r\n    &quot;TRANS&quot;,&quot;23115168&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;OTVST&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;23115168&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;COMLT&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,20180216,&quot;OAMI&quot;,&quot;501928&quot;,,\r\n    &quot;MTPNT&quot;,&quot;UPDTE&quot;,2415799999,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;17&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,,20180216,\r\n    &quot;ASSET&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;REPRT&quot;,&quot;METER&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;CR&quot;,&quot;E6VG470&quot;,&quot;LPG&quot;,2017,&quot;E6S05633099999&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;LI&quot;\r\n    &quot;METER&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;U&quot;,&quot;S1&quot;,6.0000,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,20171108,&quot;S&quot;,,\r\n    &quot;REGST&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;METER&quot;,5,&quot;SCMH&quot;,1.000\r\n    &quot;READG&quot;,20180216,,&quot;00990&quot;\r\n    &quot;ASSET&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;REMVE&quot;,&quot;METER&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;CR&quot;,&quot;E6VG470&quot;,&quot;LPG&quot;,2017,&quot;E6S05633099999&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;LI&quot;\r\n    &quot;METER&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;U&quot;,&quot;S1&quot;,6.0000,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,20171108,&quot;S&quot;,,\r\n    &quot;REGST&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;METER&quot;,5,&quot;SCMH&quot;,1.000\r\n    &quot;READG&quot;,20180216,,&quot;00990&quot;\r\n    &quot;ASSET&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;INSTL&quot;,&quot;METER&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;CR&quot;,&quot;E6VG470&quot;,&quot;LPG&quot;,2017,&quot;E6S06769699999&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;LI&quot;\r\n    &quot;METER&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;U&quot;,&quot;S1&quot;,6.0000,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,20180216,&quot;S&quot;,,\r\n    &quot;REGST&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;METER&quot;,5,&quot;SCMH&quot;,1.000\r\n    &quot;READG&quot;,20180216,,&quot;00000&quot;\r\n    &quot;APPNT&quot;,&quot;&quot;,20180216,,&quot;&quot;,&quot;123900&quot;,&quot;&quot;\r\n    run;\r\n\r\nYou can use this as the basis of a more complicated reader that has a different `output &lt;tier&gt;` data set for each tier or path to tier encountered.  You would need a different `input` statement per tier, similar to how `READG` is read.

Knowing the actual name is important if you want to look up information about the scheme.\r\n\r\nSo lets assume that key pair 1 is from the sender of the ciphertext and key pair 2 is then from the receiver of the ciphertext. In that case key pair 1 should be ephemeral (created on the spot, tied to one encrypted message) and key pair 2 is static (created beforehand and kept). Furthermore, public key 2 is trusted to be from the receiving party. This is all not clear from your simplified code, and in your code you could still switch around the sender and receiver.\r\n\r\nSo with the public key (2) of the receiver the sender can use their private key to create a shared secret, called `shared1` in your code. You can now use `shared1` to perform symmetric encryption of the data. Then you just have to send the ephemeral public key of the sender and the ciphertext to the receiver. The receiver uses the public key of the sender (1) and their static private key (2) to create `shared2`. This is identical to `shared1` and can thus be used as a key to decrypt the data.\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s it, other than to note that since the private key (1) of the sender is tied to the data, it isn&#39;t needed anymore once `shared1` is calculated, and may be discarded even before the message is encrypted.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you read above then you can see that having all of this in one method is not a good idea:\r\n\r\n 1. create the static key pair of the receiver;\r\n 2. send the public key of the receiver to the sender and make sure that the sender can trust the public key to be from the receiver (e.g. using certificate infrastructure);\r\n\r\nNow for the encryption and sending:\r\n\r\n 3. create the key pair of the sender;\r\n 4. derive the symmetric key;\r\n 5. throw away the private key;\r\n 6. encrypt the data;\r\n 7. send the public key and the data;\r\n\r\nand for the receiving:\r\n\r\n 8. use the private key to derive the symmetric key;\r\n 9. decrypt the data.\r\n\r\nAnd that&#39;s it. You probably want to have these steps made *explicit* in your code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076132/encryption-in-swift-using-diffie-hellman-key-exchange-and-an-elliptic-curve-encr/58089797#58089797","title":"Encryption in swift using Diffie Hellman key exchange and an elliptic curve encryption"}],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":7413163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edba89a8f8ac28089a4d357a6b9ba690?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user7413163","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7413163/user7413163"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39,"user_id":7413163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edba89a8f8ac28089a4d357a6b9ba690?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user7413163","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7413163/user7413163"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58089797,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569389704,"creation_date":1569313851,"last_edit_date":1569389704,"question_id":58076132,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076132","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been trying to encrypt and decrypt a string in swift using a Diffie Hellman key exchange and an elliptic curve encryption. \r\n\r\nFollowing is the code that i followed,\r\n\r\nSWIFT Code :\r\n\r\n     let attributes: [String: Any] = [kSecAttrKeySizeInBits as String: 256,\r\n                                         kSecAttrKeyType as String: kSecAttrKeyTypeEC,\r\n                                         kSecPrivateKeyAttrs as String: [kSecAttrIsPermanent as String: false]]\r\n     var error: Unmanaged&lt;CFError&gt;?\r\n     if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {\r\n     **// Step 1:  Generating the Public &amp;

was to change your table&#39;s design.

Against this XML we can use XQuery&#39;s FLWOR. The given xquery will run through the nodes and find those, where the name&#39;s length is 6 and which start with &quot;Code&quot; and where the `text()` (= the content) is equal to the value you are looking for.\r\n\r\nKnowing the fitting code nodes, we can return the fitting value nodes by conactenating the column name with the word &quot;int&quot;.\r\n\r\nWith this we can build a sum, voila! \r\n\r\nThe intermediate XML looks like this (one per row)\r\n\r\n\t&lt;row&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Comment&gt;One is a&lt;/Comment&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Code01&gt;a&lt;/Code01&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Code01int&gt;1&lt;/Code01int&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Code02&gt;b&lt;/Code02&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Code02int&gt;1&lt;/Code02int&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Code03&gt;c&lt;/Code03&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Code03int&gt;1&lt;/Code03int&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/row&gt;\r\n\r\n##UPDATE: How to update a table&#39;s column\r\n\r\nYou might use a joined query like here\r\n\r\n\tDECLARE @MockTable TABLE(ID INT IDENTITY\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,Comment VARCHAR(100)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,Code01 VARCHAR(100),Code01int INT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,Code02 VARCHAR(100),Code02int INT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,Code03 VARCHAR(100),Code03int INT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,STRUint INT);\r\n\tINSERT INTO @MockTable(Comment,Code01,Code01int,Code02,Code02int,Code03,Code03int) \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   VALUES(&#39;One is a&#39; ,&#39;a&#39;,1,&#39;b&#39;,1,&#39;c&#39;,1)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,(&#39;All are a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,1,&#39;a&#39;,1,&#39;a&#39;,1)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,(&#39;Two are a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,1,&#39;a&#39;,1,&#39;a&#39;,1);\r\n\r\n\tDECLARE @SearchCode VARCHAR(100)=&#39;a&#39;;\r\n\r\n\tUPDATE t1 SET STRUint=t2.SumOfValuesForTheCode\r\n\tFROM\r\n\t@MockTable t1\r\n\tINNER JOIN\r\n\t(\r\n\t\tSELECT t.ID\r\n\t\t\t  ,t.Comment\r\n\t\t\t  ,SUM(A.Val) AS SumOfValuesForTheCode\r\n\t\tFROM @MockTable t\r\n\t\tCROSS APPLY (VALUES(1,Code01,Code01int)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  ,(2,Code02,Code02int)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  ,(3,Code03,Code03int))A(Indx,Code,Val)\r\n\t\tWHERE A.Code=@SearchCode\r\n\t\tGROUP BY t.ID,t.Comment\r\n\t) t2 ON t1.ID=t2.ID;\r\n\r\n--Check the result \r\n\r\n\tSELECT * FROM @MockTable\r\n\r\nAnother approach uses an *updateable CTE*\r\n\r\n\tWITH FindValue AS\r\n\t(\r\n\t\tSELECT t.ID\r\n\t\t\t  ,SUM(A.Val) AS SumOfValuesForTheCode\r\n\t\tFROM @MockTable t\r\n\t\tCROSS APPLY (VALUES(1,Code01,Code01int)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  ,(2,Code02,Code02int)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  ,(3,Code03,Code03int))A(Indx,Code,Val)\r\n\t\tWHERE A.Code=@SearchCode\r\n\t\tGROUP BY t.ID,t.Comment\r\n\t)\r\n\t,TargetTable AS\r\n\t(\r\n\t\tSELECT t1.STRUint\r\n              ,t2.SumOfValuesForTheCode \r\n        FROM @MockTable t1 \r\n        INNER JOIN FindValue t2 ON t1.ID=t2.ID\r\n\t)\r\n\tUPDATE TargetTable SET STRUint=SumOfValuesForTheCode;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076095/how-do-i-do-a-boolean-string-comparison-in-sql-server-2008/58079844#58079844","title":"How do I do a boolean string comparison in SQL Server 2008"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":7778110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2df46d11616abc0e41941b2ed6ee1371?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lawrence","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7778110/lawrence"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58077178,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569593524,"creation_date":1569313719,"last_edit_date":1569315298,"question_id":58076095,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076095","body_markdown":"In simple terms I want to add the contents of some columns together but only if the associated columns contain a specific value. To do this in MS Access I use the following:\r\n```\r\nSTRUint:(Abs(1*([Code01]=&#39;0192&#39;))*[Code01int])+(Abs(1*([Code02]=&#39;0192&#39;))*[Code02int])...\r\n```\r\nBreaking this down, if Code01=&#39;0192&#39; I get the result TRUE which I multiply by 1 to get -1 and use Abs to convert to 1. This is then multiplied by Code01int, so I&#39;d have an integer equal to Code01int only when Code01 was &#39;0192&#39; otherwise I&#39;d have zero. The result of that calculation is added to the next calculation in the sequence and so on.\r\n\r\nThe sequence is repeated 15 times adding together the integers in Code01int through Code15int where the content of Code01 through Code15 is &#39;0192&#39;\r\n\r\nThe only way I personally can think how to do this in SQL is with\r\n```\r\nUPDATE Table1 \r\nSET STRUint = 0\r\n\r\nUPDATE Table1 \r\nSET STRUint = CASE \r\n                 WHEN Code01=&#39;0192&#39; THEN STRUint + Code01int \r\n              END\r\n\r\nUPDATE Table1 \r\nSET STRUint = CASE \r\n                 WHEN Code02=&#39;0192&#39; THEN STRUint + Code02int \r\n              END\r\netc\r\n```\r\nIs this the only way to achieve my goal, by doing many UPDATEs? I do this for 15 sets of columns and repeat for different string content 5 times, so 80 updates (including the initial set to zero). \r\n\r\nI&#39;m hoping there&#39;s a way to do this without so many updates on the assumption that it&#39;s better to not do so many.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076095/how-do-i-do-a-boolean-string-comparison-in-sql-server-2008","title":"How do I do a boolean string comparison in SQL Server 2008"},{"tags":["javascript","vuejs2","vuex","quasar-framework"],"owner":{"reputation":364,"user_id":7494877,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10206453312011045/picture?type=large","display_name":"Irfandy Jip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7494877/irfandy-jip"},"last_editor":{"reputation":364,"user_id":7494877,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10206453312011045/picture?type=large","display_name":"Irfandy Jip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7494877/irfandy-jip"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569314100,"creation_date":1569313714,"last_edit_date":1569314100,"question_id":58076094,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58076094","body_markdown":"**Little Background Story**  \r\nI know this is some common error, I have looked over StackOverflow and I can&#39;t seem to find a similiar problem to mine. *I mean technically there is with the same title, BUT IT DOESN&#39;T SOLVE MY PROBLEM.*\r\n\r\nThe following issue **is not the same** as my problem, [vuex do not mutate vuex store state outside mutation handlers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57139270/vuex-do-not-mutate-vuex-store-state-outside-mutation-handlers)\r\n\r\nI have read Vuex documentation how it&#39;s related to [vue&#39;s reactivity](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#mutations-follow-vue-s-reactivity-rules), but it seems it&#39;s not working.
