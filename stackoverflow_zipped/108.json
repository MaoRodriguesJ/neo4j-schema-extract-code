However, you can convert this to a `list` of `tuple`s, put those back in a `list`, and then get the `len` of that list to find out how many unique value sets there are.\r\n\r\n    grid = [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\r\n            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\r\n            [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\r\n            [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]\r\n    \r\n    unique = [list(x) for x in set(tuple(x) for x in grid)]\r\n    \r\n    unique_count = len(unique)  # this will return 3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508513/count-number-of-occurence-in-2d-array/58508758#58508758","title":"Count Number Of Occurence in 2D Array"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5178,"user_id":2790047,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5a7631a67903295da25dabb94e1f51b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jodag","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2790047/jodag"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5178,"user_id":2790047,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5a7631a67903295da25dabb94e1f51b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jodag","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2790047/jodag"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571764677,"last_edit_date":1571764677,"creation_date":1571764326,"answer_id":58509281,"question_id":58508513,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58509281","body_markdown":"Relatively straightforward depth first search based implementation of [connected component labeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling).\r\n\r\n    def get_components(grid, indicator=1):\r\n        def label(g, row, col, group):\r\n            if row &gt;= 0 and col &gt;= 0 and row &lt; len(g) and col &lt; len(g[row]) and g[row][col] == -1:\r\n                # only label if currently unlabeled\r\n                g[row][col] = group\r\n                # attempt to label neighbors with same label\r\n                label(g, row + 1, col, group)\r\n                label(g, row, col + 1, group)\r\n                label(g, row - 1, col, group)\r\n                label(g, row, col - 1, group)\r\n                return True\r\n            else:\r\n                return False\r\n    \r\n        # initialize label grid as -1 for entries that need labeled\r\n        label_grid = [[-1 if gc == indicator else 0 for gc in gr] for gr in grid]\r\n        group_count = 0\r\n        for row, grid_row in enumerate(grid):\r\n            for col in range(len(grid_row)):\r\n                if label(label_grid, row, col, group_count + 1):\r\n                    group_count += 1\r\n        return label_grid, group_count\r\n\r\nThe results of `label_grid, group_count = get_components(grid)` for your example inputs are\r\n\r\n    label_grid = [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\r\n                  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\r\n                  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\r\n                  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]]\r\n    group_count = 3\r\n\r\nAnd for cases like the following\r\n\r\n    grid = [[1 0 1],\r\n            [1 1 1]]\r\n\r\nwe get `group_count = 1`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508513/count-number-of-occurence-in-2d-array/58509281#58509281","title":"Count Number Of Occurence in 2D Array"}],"owner":{"reputation":670,"user_id":7399312,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KEtrj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Samuel M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7399312/samuel-m"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58508758,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571764677,"creation_date":1571761291,"question_id":58508513,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508513","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s say I have an array like this\r\n\r\n    grid: \r\n        [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\r\n        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\r\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\r\n        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]\r\n\r\nI want to isolate the group of &quot;items&quot; in this case 1&#39;s which are three groups the rule being the 0&#39;s are used to separate them like intersections.

This class extends from the `AbstractSequentialList` class as shown in the javadoc page as well:\r\n\r\n&gt;     public class LinkedList&lt;E&gt;\r\n&gt;     extends AbstractSequentialList&lt;E&gt;\r\n&gt;     implements List&lt;E&gt;, Deque&lt;E&gt;, Cloneable, Serializable\r\n\r\nWhen you click on the link for the class `AbstractSequentialList` you will see the following class definition:\r\n\r\n&gt;     public abstract class AbstractSequentialList&lt;E&gt;\r\n&gt;     extends AbstractList&lt;E&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd when you look at the inheritance tree of *that* class you will see:\r\n\r\n&gt;     java.lang.Object\r\n&gt;         java.util.AbstractCollection&lt;E&gt;\r\n&gt;             java.util.AbstractList&lt;E&gt;\r\n&gt;                 java.util.AbstractSequentialList&lt;E&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you see there is one entry less because you went &quot;up once&quot; to the base class of `LinkedList`, which is the `AbstractSequentialList` class.\r\n\r\nThis inheritance tree can be used to get an overview which class the class is extending from you are looking at and the class *that* class is extending from. This goes up until you reached the `Object` class, every class extends from (directly or indirectly). You can easily see which class the `LinkedList` class also &quot;is&quot; as well without clicking on each &quot;extend&quot; entry individual. This allows you to easily see, if you can write code like:\r\n\r\n    AbstractList&lt;Integer&gt; x = new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    Object y = new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n\r\nOn the same note, on the javadoc page you sometimes see a list like:\r\n\r\n&gt; Direct Known Subclasses:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     (list of classes here)\r\n\r\nThis allows you to browse in the opposite direction to see which extends from that class you are looking at.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might want to look at the javadoc page at the top labeled &quot;Tree&quot; which shows the whole class hierarchy like the [Hierarchy For Package java.util](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/package-tree.html).

My instantiations of `Student` and `Teacher` in main.cpp aren&#39;t correct. I think because they are inheriting from Person(?). How do I create a constructor within these derived classes? I googled this but the solutions didn&#39;t seem to work.\r\n\r\n2. The `Course` Class requires an array of Students. Do I *have* to specify a size of the array in the header file? It seems silly that I&#39;ve specified 30 in both the header file and the cpp file, but VSstudio complains if I don&#39;t.\r\n\r\n3. I&#39;m using strings here. I have previously learned from a different course about char* and memory regarding strings. How many chars are assigned to all of these string class variables? If I instantiate a Students with name &quot;Joe&quot; and then want to later change his name to &quot;Joseph&quot; using `student1.SetFirstName`, is that going to cause segmentation faults?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508473/need-help-understanding-the-syntax-of-c-classes","title":"Need help understanding the syntax of C++ Classes"},{"tags":["assembly","arm","cortex-m","atomicity"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3511,"user_id":471129,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cec5a6cce700294c7c564becb11fa3c1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Erik Eidt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/471129/erik-eidt"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571767423,"post_id":58508470,"comment_id":103347665,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508470/cortex-m-atomicity-of-irq-disabling#comment103347665_58508470"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1746948,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa9b954fff1a8ac0347196d4764f3628?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Petr Kalandra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1746948/petr-kalandra"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571829623,"post_id":58518251,"comment_id":103368522,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508470/cortex-m-atomicity-of-irq-disabling/58518251#comment103368522_58518251"},{"owner":{"reputation":3382,"user_id":193887,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54a2fc2a8cb81440a442aa45fc0f41a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeremy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/193887/jeremy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571838182,"post_id":58518251,"comment_id":103373463,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508470/cortex-m-atomicity-of-irq-disabling/58518251#comment103373463_58518251"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6730,"user_id":410847,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a354e99dd64adf823aa72c4ee22a1fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Turbo J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/410847/turbo-j"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571817876,"creation_date":1571817876,"answer_id":58518251,"question_id":58508470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58518251","body_markdown":"&gt;  What happens when the IRQ comes in between the execution of this two instructions and the IRQ handler changes the state of PRIMASK?\r\n\r\nThe program will randomly lock up, as this would also break most other &quot;wait for interrupt&quot; methods (like `volatile` variables). \r\n\r\nRemember that an interrupt can only occur if it is *not* masked, so the interrupt handler could only ever *disable* interrupts.

Problem is that share must be scheduled to happen for some time in the future like two days, or a week because of marketing purposes. The only way i implemented share functionality is with share button, which is only javascript based. Now we need to postpone this event for some time, i believe i will need to use sidekiq to make it but not sure if share can happen like that. Does anybody have some idea how this can be done?

I am unsure what SQL tools are available to me to efficiently solve query for the boxes required.\r\n\r\nAn table of order items looks like the following, if I had order 1 be for a fork and spoon:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql&gt; select * from order_items;\r\n+----+-------+----------+\r\n| id | name  | order_id |\r\n+----+-------+----------+\r\n|  1 | fork  |        1 |\r\n|  2 | spoon |        1 |\r\n+----+-------+----------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the boxes are arranged as \r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql&gt; select * from boxes;\r\n+----+------+\r\n| id | name |\r\n+----+------+\r\n|  1 | box1 |\r\n|  2 | box2 |\r\n|  3 | box3 |\r\n+----+------+\r\n3 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nmysql&gt; select * from items;\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n| id | name  | box_id |\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n|  1 | spoon |      1 |\r\n|  2 | knife |      1 |\r\n|  3 | fork  |      1 |\r\n|  4 | knife |      2 |\r\n|  5 | fork  |      2 |\r\n|  6 | spoon |      3 |\r\n|  7 | knife |      3 |\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n7 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is a problem. It could be that boxes may contain an individual fork and another an individual spoon, or both in one box. However,  in this case I have boxes with all three utensils, or a mixture of each. It is expected that, in general, a single box will not cover all the requirements for the order but it is acceptable to send a box with extra items if needbe. In this case, a single box would work OR the combination of the other two available boxes. In either case one or two extra knives would be sent. Ideally, we would like to send the minimal number of extra utensils but we do not care about the number of boxes.\r\n\r\nWhat is the appropriate query to efficiently determine what combination of boxes will work? I do not know of a single query, but I think that a series of queries that try and find a match for all N items, then N-1, then N-2 until a match is found and then repeat for the remaining items. This seems fairly inefficient, though.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nThe problem is to find a subset of all boxes `B_S` such  `m_i` is a member of `B_S` for all items  `m_i` in order `M`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508449/sql-query-for-best-intersection-of-items","title":"SQL Query for Best Intersection of Items"},{"tags":["retrofit2"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1315,"user_id":1494902,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y088H.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Piotr Aleksander Chmielowski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1494902/piotr-aleksander-chmielowski"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571761787,"creation_date":1571761787,"answer_id":58508642,"question_id":58508441,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58508642","body_markdown":"The solution I&#39;ve found is to register converter factory in the Retrofit `Builder`:\r\n\r\n    class EventIdConverterFactory : Converter.Factory() {\r\n        override fun stringConverter(type: Type, annotations: Array&lt;Annotation&gt;, retrofit: Retrofit) =\r\n            if (type == EventId::class.java) {\r\n                Converter&lt;Any, String&gt;

To match perfectly, I need them to stretch themselves to the height of the leftmost Container (with the Text lable).

Setting a fixed height is not feasible because the text may change; I do can set a maximum height.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to achieve this effect?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508379/stretch-children-of-a-flutter-row-to-the-maximum-natural-height","title":"Stretch children of a Flutter Row to the maximum *natural*

want to count some certain values until a specific event occurred in SQL. This is very similar question to this question:\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48810682/count-number-of-events-before-and-after-a-event-a-till-another-event-a-is-en?rq=1&quot; title=&quot;Count number of events before and after a event “A” till another event “A” is encountered in Big query?&quot;&gt;Count number of events before and after a event “A” till another event “A” is encountered in Big query?&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question didn&#39;t solve my problem which I am confused with RANGE BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING too. Differently from that question I don&#39;t look for strings but I want to count other events.\r\n\r\nMy table would be like \r\n\r\n```\r\n   User       Event   Day\r\n    1          C     2019-01-10\r\n    1\t       B     2019-01-11\r\n    1\t       D     2019-01-12\r\n    1          A     2019-01-13\r\n    2          D     2019-01-10\r\n    2          B     2019-01-11\r\n    2          C     2019-01-12\r\n    2          D     2019-01-13\r\n    2\t       A     2019-01-14\r\n    2          E     2019-01-15  \r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to count C or D until event A or B occured. \r\n\r\nI try \r\n```COUNTIF(Event = &#39;C&#39; OR Event = &#39;D&#39;) OVER(PARTITION BY User ORDER BY Day ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS count_events```\r\nBut this doesn&#39;t stop counting until event A or B. It counts all C or D events in partition.\r\n\r\nMy result table would look like this and the counting would stop if one of the event is occurred and restart counting again when the expected event occurs.\r\n```\r\n   User       Event   Day           count_events\r\n    1          C     2019-01-10           0\r\n    1\t       B     2019-01-11           1 \r\n    1\t       D     2019-01-12           0 \r\n    1          A     2019-01-13           1\r\n    2          D     2019-01-10           0\r\n    2          B     2019-01-11           1 \r\n    2          C     2019-01-12           0\r\n    2          D     2019-01-13           1 \r\n    2\t       A     2019-01-14           2\r\n    2          E     2019-01-15           0\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508374/count-number-of-events-before-certain-events-until-another-event-is-encountered","title":"Count number of events before certain events until another event is encountered in the same group in Big query?"},{"tags":["python-3.x","sockets","networking","pygame"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12258384,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5-wnEGyR63s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdokRBmZLFctcLaMOxHyaEEkMloiA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"shantanu wagh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12258384/shantanu-wagh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571812312,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571760715,"creation_date":1571760715,"question_id":58508372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508372","body_markdown":"So I am trying to write a multiplayer game in Python using pygame and sockets. \r\n1) When I try to run the code on a single machine (1 server process + 6 client processes), it works fine. \r\n2) I tried putting the code to test in a lab with computers connected in a LAN while the server was running on my laptop connected to the college wifi.

The data on the flag series is reasonably sparse, but very bursty. As a result when I am showing a large amount of data, ~10 flags tend to line up up next to each other all pointing to basically the same point on the graph. \r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;d like is for those flags to get downsampled (in a sense) so I only show 1 flag indicator that points to the general area where all the flag points are, then when the user zooms in, all the flag points are displayed since it&#39;s now possible to actually distinguish what they are pointing at. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a job for data grouping and when I am zoomed out and showing large data ranges, all my other series end up getting downsampled by data grouping. However, this isn&#39;t being applied to the flag series, I suspect because the series doesn&#39;t qualify since it has relatively few points across the range being shown.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there&#39;s anything built in that will help me achieve this? Or do I have to write my own downsampling that&#39;s tied into the setExtremes event somehow?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508364/how-to-downsample-a-highstock-flag-series","title":"How to downsample a Highstock Flag Series"},{"tags":["javascript","datetime","zapier"],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":8592659,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56a7d41da2cafa14caa529f240af5f41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"leonardmaguin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8592659/leonardmaguin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571760686,"creation_date":1571760686,"question_id":58508362,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508362","body_markdown":"In Zapier - javascript&#39;s code step; when I do : \r\n```\r\nlet date = new Date(&quot;2019-10-28T15:00:00+01:00&quot;);\r\nlet options = {  \r\n    weekday: &quot;long&quot;, month: &quot;long&quot;,  \r\n    day: &quot;numeric&quot;, hour: &quot;2-digit&quot;, minute: &quot;2-digit&quot;, timeZone:&quot;Europe/Paris&quot;  \r\n};  \r\n```\r\n\r\n    let pretty = date.toLocaleString(&quot;en&quot;, options);\r\n\r\nReturns : Monday, October 28, 3:00 PM\r\n\r\nHowever when I do any other language (I tried fr, nl, de) I get a wrong output : \r\n\r\n    let pretty = date.toLocaleString(&quot;fr&quot;, options);\r\n\r\nReturns : M10 28, Mon 15:00 \r\n(Instead of: lundi 28 octobre &#224; 15:00)\r\n\r\nAnyone knows how I can fix it ?\r\nI would need a correct formatting in 4 languages : en, fr, nl, de\r\n\r\nNB : I also tried with the same wrong result\r\n```let prettybis = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(&#39;fr-FR&#39;, options).format(date);```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508362/zapier-javascript-time-formatting-with-tolocalestring-only-works-in-english","title":"Zapier Javascript Time Formatting with toLocaleString only works in English"},{"tags":["linux","azure","vps"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30673,"user_id":620097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/820980fd43f2607a815c1f3dbfe152cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"shellter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/620097/shellter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571777901,"post_id":58508358,"comment_id":103351842,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508358/azure-vps-network-upload-speed-is-limited-to-4-17mbit-s#comment103351842_58508358"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7049656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11ab85a61e813f268e4095ed7181383b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MGamer333","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7049656/mgamer333"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571760672,"creation_date":1571760672,"question_id":58508358,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508358","body_markdown":"I created a Microsoft Azure VPS, and downloaded the speedtest-cli with apt.

There are some polynomial operations in the thing with high powers, and some divisions, i.e. things that take small errors and turn them into big ones.  In my model, for 99% of points, everything works out just fine.  However, 1% of the time, a small error turns into a big error, and my gradient for those few points, about midway through the graph, become `inf`.  Further up the graph, various operations on those `inf`s easily turn into `nan`s.  By the time the gradient gets up to my variables, it has fallen apart, and clipping is moot.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, what I would like to do is to clip my gradient, or to do something else to mitigate the damage *before* it gets out of hand.  Since my gradient gets evaluated point-wise in the graph, I could even set the gradient for those problematic points to be 0 and things would move along without too much trouble.  I know the approximate location where I would need to deal with my exploding gradients.\r\n\r\n[This solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36501922/2886575), unfortunately, only seems to apply to gradients once they&#39;ve made it all the way back to my variables.

I want it to hide once the page has been scrolled a bit and then reappear when the user scrolls back up.  \r\n\r\nI made a directive to attach to the bar itself that references the offsetParent to capture the scrollTop of the container that actually scrolls.  All of that code works, but I&#39;m not sure how to trigger the HostListener to actually run the code.\r\n\r\nI am going to preface this question with the fact that I really don&#39;t want to have to attach a directive to each container that scrolls as that will make the component less flexible.  How can I capture any scroll event on a page? Code snippet below is the HTML Template and the Directive.  I&#39;d rather not use a bunch of mouse events either.

on what you want your strings/collection of strings to look like you can do one of the below options.\r\n\r\n**[JSON.Stringify][1]** will convert a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string. \r\n\r\n    printDataWithStringify = (x) =&gt; {\r\n      console.log(JSON.stringify(data[x]))\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    &gt; {&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;1&#186;&quot;:[&quot;Semestre 1&quot;]},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;1&#186;&quot;:[&quot;Semestre 1&quot;]}}\r\n\r\nIf you want to go even further, you can try the below code.\r\n\r\n    var printedStrings = []\r\n\r\n    checkNestedData = (x, y) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n      if (typeof(x[y]) === &#39;object&#39; &amp;&amp; !Array.isArray(x[y][property1])) {\r\n        printedStrings.push(y)\r\n        for (var property1 in x[y]) {\r\n          checkNestedData(x[y], property1)\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        printedStrings.push(x[y]);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    printDataWithKeysAndValues = (x) =&gt; {\r\n      var part = data[x]\r\n      for (var property1 in part) {\r\n        checkNestedData(part, property1)\r\n      }\r\n      console.log(printedStrings)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    &gt; 1,1&#186;,Semestre 1,2,1&#186;,Semestre 1\r\n\r\nThe above code utilizes a [`for...in`][2] loop which is used to loop through JavaScript objects. `part` is the object you get when you retrieve information from `data` at the key of `x` (in this case, `&quot;A&quot;`). `property1` represents the key for the current object (`part`) and is the iterator for the `for...in` loop as we loop through `part`.\r\n \r\nTo take it even further, `checkNestedData` checks to see if there is another object nested in the current object. If it&#39;s an object (that doesn&#39;t have a array for a child), you push `y` (remember this is the key (`property1`) from the original loop) into the intialized `printedStrings` array. Then perform another loop and you run `checkNestedData` recursively on the current iterative in the new loop. \r\n\r\nThis recursive callback will run until the last child is not a populated object. \r\n\r\nOnce we&#39;ve looped through the entire object, storing the keys and values we&#39;ve extracted from the object (including nested objects) we simply `console.log` the final array which contains all of our keys and value from that portion (`&quot;A&quot;`) of data. \r\n\r\nDepending on how you want the string to be formatted, you can append/remove things from the strings via interpolation or concatenation. But this solution should get you every key and value and store them as a string in an array.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var data = {\r\n      &quot;A&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;1&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;2&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;B&quot;: [\r\n\r\n      ],\r\n      &quot;c&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;2&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;3&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;44&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;G6&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;GP98&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;654&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;5556&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;7654&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;1\\u00ba&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;Semestre 1&quot;\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    printDataWithStringify = (x) =&gt; {\r\n      console.log(&#39;STRINGIFY: &#39; + JSON.stringify(data[x]))\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var printedStrings = []\r\n\r\n    checkNestedData = (x, y) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n      if (typeof(x[y]) === &#39;object&#39; &amp;&amp; !Array.isArray(x[y][property1])) {\r\n        printedStrings.push(y)\r\n        for (var property1 in x[y]) {\r\n          checkNestedData(x[y], property1)\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        printedStrings.push(x[y]);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    printDataWithKeysAndValues = (x) =&gt; {\r\n      var part = data[x]\r\n      for (var property1 in part) {\r\n        checkNestedData(part, property1)\r\n      }\r\n      console.log(&#39;ALL KEYS AND VALUES: &#39; + printedStrings)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    printDataWithStringify(&quot;A&quot;)\r\n    printDataWithKeysAndValues(&quot;A&quot;)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#targetText=The%20JSON.stringify()%20method,a%20replacer%20array%20is%20specified.\r\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508323/how-can-i-print-a-specific-part-of-a-json-object-with-javascript/58510236#58510236","title":"How can I print a specific part of a JSON object with JavaScript?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12258506,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Weme2Lv31zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdo7bCYm79_rpijnpoc5P_N0uP73A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SE AA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12258506/se-aa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":320,"user_id":7927036,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j8HJn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matt Croak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7927036/matt-croak"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58510236,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571775761,"creation_date":1571760557,"last_edit_date":1571775761,"question_id":58508323,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508323","body_markdown":"I would like to know what to use to transform the document from `JSON` to an array and the print the part of the array the user wants.

I have split the entity basically threefold: EF Model in data layer, service model in business layer, and ViewModel in web layer. \r\n\r\nThe file is saved in a folder on the web layer like I said, and I have already successfully created a method with the intent to upload and extract a zipped folder, and it feeds the extracted files to a sanitized folder structure in the wwwroot folder. What I have tried is to build the ViewModel and manually map them to the EF model. The VM holds 3 specifically called EF models: MediaModel, FolderUpload and Test. \r\n\r\nIn the method that uploads/extracts the folder, it immediately attaches a new Guid to the folder itself in the database, and lists where the folder is saved. That is it for that method.\r\n\r\nIn the current method I am having issues with, I am trying to do the same with the media files, set a boolean &#39;select&#39; option on it, immediately attached a new guid to it, and to save the folder/file location to the database. I am getting a null reference of it when I place a break point on it.

I would like keep the size as it is or  least somewhat near to original file size by keeping the same resolution.   \r\n\r\n2&gt;`Resolution` class also takes `int valueX` and `int valueY` parameters. And `JpegDevice` class takes `int width` and `int height` parameters. However it does not specify `unit`, weathers its in points, pixels, inches etc?  \r\n\r\nAs per Aspose.Pdf documentation   \r\n\r\n&gt; The conversion from point to pixel depends on an image&#39;s DPI (dots per\r\n&gt; inch) property. For example, if an image&#39;s DPI is 96 (96 pixels for\r\n&gt; each inch), and it is 100 points high, its height in pixels is (100 /\r\n&gt; 72) * 96 = 133.3. The general formula is: pixels = ( points / 72 ) *\r\n&gt; DPI.\r\n\r\nHowever that does not answer the question what unit the API is asking?   \r\n\r\n**Original Issue**   \r\nWe get PDF from our clients. Some of the PDF we receive has rotation of 90 or 270 degree. However when you open them in Adobe or any other PDF viewer, the page&#39;s orientation is correct (it is not landscape or horizontal). All this mess i have to do becuase Aspose.Pdf cannot keep the same orientation when change the rotation to None. So suggested approach is convert PDF to Image and latter convert Image back to Pdf   \r\n\r\nhttps://forum.aspose.com/t/cannot-set-cropbox-on-rotated-page/201659/3  \r\nhttps://forum.aspose.com/t/remove-rotation-from-a-document-and-set-it-upright/29170\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508315/how-to-convert-pdf-to-image-with-same-resolution-as-original-pdf","title":"How to convert PDF to image with same resolution as original PDF"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","macos","pyqt5"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3490,"user_id":625350,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qzA9A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"titusjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/625350/titusjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571817551,"post_id":58508314,"comment_id":103362302,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508314/pyqt5-window-wont-show-on-mac-but-works-fine-on-windows#comment103362302_58508314"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":11956484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4639a1db9ab445316f6194434a152973?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gingerhaze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11956484/gingerhaze"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571760515,"creation_date":1571760515,"question_id":58508314,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508314","body_markdown":"I wrote this gui in spyder using anaconda python 3.7.
