Bytecode is a the machine code (native instructions) for a theoretical CPU based on the Java Virtual Machine specification.\r\n\r\nThis virtual CPU specification is sort of an average of types of CPUs that were common at the time the specification was written. Because of this it is close to lots of different types of CPU making it easier to run the same Java .class files on multiple CPU types.\r\n\r\nWhen Java was first launched the `java` command would read the .class file and interpret the bytecode instructions one at a time and then map them to the equivalent native instruction for what ever CPU it was actually running on. This worked but wasn&#39;t particularly fast. To improve this Just in Time (JIT) compilation was added to the Java Runtime.\r\n\r\nWith JIT the `java` command takes the bytecode and compiles it again to the native instructions for the CPU it is running on. Modern Java runtimes tend to start out interpreting the bytecode while JIT compiling in the background and switch to the compiled native instructions when it&#39;s ready and will also profile the running application and then recompile the bytecode again with different optimisation to get the best possible performance.\r\n\r\nEDIT (to appease the down voters):\r\n\r\nSo in your specific case (as you are running a JRE newer than v11) the code is compiled (at least) twice\r\n\r\n 1. As a single .java file to bytecode\r\n 2.

I think you need to have two RFC-enabled function modules. One to validate the maintained operations (do the validations as far as possible), but that should not save anything to the database, and another one called after the user clicks the SAVE button, to save the whole &quot;WorkOrder&quot;, including the maintained operations (at this time, there will be the complete validation also).\r\n\r\n2.

Unfortunately I have to use RFCs due to technical constraints, so no OData and no REST. It&#39;s quite a long question I hope it&#39;s OK to ask this in Stackoverflow.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I have an entity class WorkOrder with a list of Operation objects.\r\n\r\nI have a WorkOrderRepository class with a SAVE method that only receives a WorkOrder object and is able to save everything (header data, address, etc) in one go. No matter if it&#39;s creation, update or deleted. The repository hides the BAPI calls from the rest.\r\n\r\nNow I want to implement the logic to add/update/remove Operations to the work order object and I&#39;m not sure even if the names I give to the methods are correct. Maybe they should be insert/edit/delete... I&#39;m quite confused with this since in every place I look they use different names.\r\n\r\nBut the most important are my 2 specific doubts:\r\n\r\n1. Should I have only 1 RFC that receives all the updates to a WorkOrder entity including header, operations? Or should I create 1 RFC per operation that only handles one operation at a time? Bear in mind that the UI mockup expects that the user can add/delete multiple operations before clicking a SAVE button and RFC has implicit commit, and that to my knowledge a DDD entity should be updated always in one call.\r\n\r\nOption 1:\r\n\r\n    FUNCTION ZWORKORDER_HDR_UPD\r\n      IMPORTING\r\n        VALUE(I_WORKORDER_ID) TYPE AUFNR\r\n        VALUE(I_WORKORDER_HDR_CHG) TYPE ZWORKORDER_HDR_CHG\r\n        VALUE(I_WORKORDER_HDR_UPD) TYPE ZWORKORDER_HDR_UPD &quot;X structure for the BAPI\r\n        VALUE(I_OPERATIONS_CHG) TYPE ZOPERATIONS_CHG\r\n        VALUE(I_OPERATIONS_UPD) TYPE ZOPERATIONS_UPD\r\n        VALUE(I_OPERATIONS_DEL) TYPE ZOPERATIONS_DEL\r\n      EXPORTING\r\n        VALUE(E_ERRORS) TYPE BAPIRET2_T.\r\n\r\nOption 2\r\n\r\n    FUNCTION ZWORKORDER_OPERATION_CRT\r\n      IMPORTING\r\n        VALUE(I_WORKORDER_ID) TYPE AUFNR\r\n        VALUE(I_OPERATION) TYPE ZOPERATION_CHG\r\n      EXPORTING\r\n        VALUE(E_ERRORS) TYPE BAPIRET2_T.\r\n    \r\n    FUNCTION ZWORKORDER_OPERATION_UPD\r\n      IMPORTING\r\n        VALUE(I_WORKORDER_ID) TYPE AUFNR\r\n        VALUE(I_OPERATION_CHG) TYPE ZOPERATION_CHG\r\n        VALUE(I_OPERATION_UPD) TYPE ZOPERATION_UPD\r\n      EXPORTING\r\n        VALUE(E_ERRORS) TYPE BAPIRET2_T.\r\n\r\n      FUNCTION ZWORKORDER_OPERATION_DEL\r\n          IMPORTING\r\n            VALUE(I_WORKORDER_ID) TYPE AUFNR\r\n            VALUE(I_OPERATION_ID) TYPE ZOPERATION_ID\r\n          EXPORTING\r\n            VALUE(E_ERRORS) TYPE BAPIRET2_T.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n2.

The webapp was entered, and no url-pattern matched, so the *default url-pattern* (of `&quot;/&quot;`) is used.\r\n2. The default url-pattern is mapped to what&#39;s known as &quot;The Default Servlet&quot;\r\n3. The Default Servlet is responsible for looking in the webapp&#39;s base resource for a matching resource and returning that content as a static resource request.\r\n4. If the static resource doesn&#39;t exist, and the request was for a directory (eg: `/js/` then use the list of welcome files to look up a welcome file. (this list is configured in the `WEB-INF/web.xml`)\r\n``` xml\r\n&lt;welcome-file-list&gt;\r\n    &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.html&lt;/welcome-file&gt;\r\n    &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.htm&lt;/welcome-file&gt;\r\n    &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.jsp&lt;/welcome-file&gt;\r\n&lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;\r\n```\r\n5. If the static resource still doesn&#39;t exist, process it as a 404 response.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the error page handling routines of the servlet spec kick in.\r\nThis will result in a lookup for a path declared for 404 in your `WEB-INF/web.xml`.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n&lt;servlet&gt;\r\n  &lt;servletname&gt;404Handler&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n  &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.acme.My404Servlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\r\n&lt;/servlet&gt;\r\n&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n  &lt;servlet-name&gt;404Handler&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/404status&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\r\n&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- ... then later ... --&gt;\r\n&lt;error-page&gt;\r\n    &lt;error-code&gt;404&lt;/error-code&gt;\r\n    &lt;location&gt;/404status&lt;/location&gt;\r\n&lt;/error-page&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat path can be a servlet, a static resource, a jsp, etc.  Pretty much anything that you can reference with a path.\r\n\r\nIf it&#39;s a servlet (or jsp) you can interrogate the original request via the request attributes to know why you are handling this error.\r\n\r\nSee: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32910916/775715\r\n\r\nAn example of this in embedded-jetty would be ...\r\n\r\n``` java\r\npackage jetty.errors;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\r\nimport javax.servlet.DispatcherType;\r\nimport javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher;\r\nimport javax.servlet.ServletException;\r\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\r\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\r\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\r\n\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.DefaultHandler;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.HandlerList;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.DefaultServlet;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ErrorPageErrorHandler;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.util.resource.PathResource;\r\n\r\npublic class EmbeddedWelcomeErrorDemo\r\n{\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception\r\n    {\r\n        Server server = new Server(8080);\r\n\r\n        String baseDir = System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;);\r\n        if (args.length &gt;

Using the rewirte rule (commented out) I get `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTIONS` also lazy-loaded resources / modules are not found. Any suggestions on how to use Jetty rewrite for an Angular application as I have no glue on how to continue here or does Jetty not support something like the apache rewrite that is suggested by [angular deployment](https://angular.io/guide/deployment)\r\n```\r\nRewriteEngine On\r\n# If an existing asset or directory is requested go to it as it is\r\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]\r\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d\r\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\r\n\r\n# If the requested resource doesn&#39;t exist, use index.html\r\nRewriteRule ^

(Now, it&#39;s folder, then all the files in that folder, etc.)\r\n\r\nBut before, it would automatically remove empty folders. And now it&#39;s not.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, is this behavior that&#39;s changed on S3 within the last two years?

The variable &quot;filtered&quot; holds the json object that is (product id, name, type, color, shape, size) a big table of data. \r\n\r\n    var renderer = {\r\n        text: function(data) {\r\n            return data;\r\n        },\r\n        link: function(data) {\r\n            return &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39; + data + &#39;&quot;&gt;View&lt;/a&gt;&#39;;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    var config = [\r\n        {attr: &quot;Carat&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;Color&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;Shape&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;Cut&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;Symmetry&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;Report&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;Clarity&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;Polish&quot;, renderer: renderer.text},\r\n        {attr: &quot;link_view&quot;, renderer: renderer.link}\r\n    ];\r\n    \r\n    filtered.forEach(function(data) {\r\n    \r\n        var row = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;);\r\n    \r\n        config.forEach(function(entry) {\r\n            var cell = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;),\r\n                value = data[entry.attr];\r\n            cell.innerHTML = entry.renderer(value);\r\n            row.appendChild(cell);\r\n        });\r\n      table.appendChild(row);    \r\n    \r\n    });\r\n\r\nNow I have this eventListener to capture selected shape by id and apply the filter to it so list rows that are only this shape. All rows of table has class .showMyRow that I want to swap with .hideMyRows which sets display to none. but I am not able to make it work: Although I think even if I make this code work it will apply it to all of the classes but I need to only apply to the selected classes, the one that has the condition:         if(filtered[i].Shape = &quot;Princess&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\n    shapePrincess.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(r) { \r\n      for (var i  =0; i&lt;filtered.length;i++){\r\n        if(filtered[i].Shape = &quot;Princess&quot;){\r\n          var allrows = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.showMyRow&quot;);\r\n          allrows.classList.toggle(&quot;hideMyRow&quot;);\r\n        // console.log(filtered[i]);\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    // end of shapePrincess.addEventListener function\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    // end of event listener \r\n    }, false); \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086370/filter-json-object-in-html-table","title":"filter JSON object in HTML table"},{"tags":["javascript","typescript","function","react-native","dry"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1984,"user_id":8690857,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-47_HcdolAr0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB30/lD6xAXOWlu4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Drew Reese","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8690857/drew-reese"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569568276,"post_id":58086369,"comment_id":102646242,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086369/making-a-reusable-function-for-two-redux-actions#comment102646242_58086369"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":2215925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7039b7787a18e709fe1790dc513baa01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"VMM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2215925/vmm"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43,"user_id":2215925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7039b7787a18e709fe1790dc513baa01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"VMM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2215925/vmm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569568022,"last_edit_date":1569568022,"creation_date":1569525859,"answer_id":58123477,"question_id":58086369,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58123477","body_markdown":"Maybe I&#39;m missing some context, but I can&#39;t understand quite the idea behind the code. \r\nCan you share a [minimal-reproducible-example][1]?\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see in the second block of code, the &#39;source&#39; variable doesn&#39;t look defined.

That will make it much easier to treat each &quot;box&quot; as an object, and each object will have a namespace for keeping its own metadata. This is precisely the type of problem classes are designed to solve. \r\n\r\nIn the following example, each arc in the &quot;box&quot; gets two tags. One is `&quot;arc&quot;` in case you want to be able to change all arcs of all boxes at once, and one is a tag unique to each box, for configuring all of the arcs at once for a single box. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the canvas ids of each individual arc are saved in an array. With that, you can configure any single arc of any single &quot;box&quot;.\r\n\r\n    class Box():\r\n        def __init__(self, canvas, coords):\r\n            self.canvas = canvas\r\n            self.tag = &quot;box-{}&quot;.format(id(self))\r\n            tags = (&quot;arc&quot;, self.tag)\r\n            self.arcs = [\r\n                canvas.create_arc(coords, start=0, extent=90, style=&quot;arc&quot;, tags=tags),\r\n                canvas.create_arc(coords, start=90, extent=90, style=&quot;arc&quot;, tags=tags),\r\n                canvas.create_arc(coords, start=180, extent=90, style=&quot;arc&quot;, tags=tags),\r\n                canvas.create_arc(coords, start=270, extent=90, style=&quot;arc&quot;, tags=tags),\r\n        ]\r\n\r\nExample of use:\r\n\r\n    box1 = Box(canvas, (100, 50, 200, 150))\r\n    box2 = Box(canvas, (100 + 100, 50, 200 + 100, 150))\r\n\r\nTo modify all arcs globally, you can configure the &quot;arc&quot; tag:\r\n\r\n    canvas.itemconfigure(&quot;arc&quot;, width=5, fill=&quot;yellow&quot;)\r\n\r\nTo modify a single box, use the tag for that box:\r\n\r\n    canvas.itemconfigure(box1.tag, outline=&#39;red&#39;)\r\n\r\nTo modify a single arc for a single box, use the index of that arc for that box\r\n\r\n    canvas.itemconfigure(box2.arcs[0], outline=&quot;green&quot;)\r\n\r\nIf you were to execute all of the above, the end result will look like the following image, where:\r\n\r\n* yellow represents the changes we made to all arcs,\r\n* red represents the changes we made to `box1`, and\r\n* green represents the changes we made to a single arc in `box2`\r\n\r\n[![window screenshot][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIf you want to be able to click on any single arc, you only have to have a single bind statement on the `&quot;arc&quot;` tag:\r\n\r\n    canvas.tag_bind(&quot;arc&quot;, &quot;&lt;Button-1&gt;&quot;, bold)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dh0wL.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086348/making-many-shapes-on-tkinter-canvas-that-can-be-modified-later/58087755#58087755","title":"Making many shapes on tkinter canvas that can be modified later"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":11685024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a5651fd1574b0bfb7fcde5f229c8d43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christina Zhou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11685024/christina-zhou"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58087755,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569357255,"creation_date":1569350196,"question_id":58086348,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086348","body_markdown":"I want to make some geometric units and repeat them like 100 times on my canvas.

is in regards to the query related to the SAP UI5 application programming model. I have been following “Woulter” posts for quite a long time as his posts and other great developers blogs have helped me a lot to achieve a better UI5 design in the past. So here is my question.\r\n\r\nPre-requisite: Please read the blog [UI5 Classes and Objects – Putting it all together](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/12/28/ui5-classes-and-objects-putting-it-all-together) first before reading through my questions.\r\n\r\nI have two questions\r\n\r\n 1. Every time user press “ADD SKILL” button, it will generate a new object. Let’s say, the first time it creates an object A, the second time it creates an object B for instance and `this.s` keeps referring to a new object when a button is pressed. What happens to the previous object that was created before. This is more related to Browser memory management system. My understanding is garbage collector “automatically” frees up old objects that were created but would like to know your views on this. Please focus on a new skill in below code.\r\n\r\n    ``addSkill: function() {\r\n        this.p.addSkill(this.s);\r\n        this.s = new Skill({name:&quot;name&quot;,value:&quot;value&quot;}); //NOTE\r\n        this.getView().setModel(this.s.getModel(),&quot;skill&quot;);\r\n     }``\r\n\r\n 2. JSON Model is a two-way binding then why we use a refresh. Should model not be able to change or rebind the values on the control by itself?  Please throw some light on it?\r\n\r\n      `addSkill:function(skill){\r\n        this.skills.push(skill);\r\n        this.model.refresh(); //NOTE\r\n      }`\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086329/sap-ui5-application-programming-model","title":"SAP UI5 application programming model"},{"tags":["google-chrome"],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":8280135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6f9313bed47dd3a8fb0387de25999dcf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nilesh Godhani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8280135/nilesh-godhani"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1037,"user_id":1500851,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GO4Dc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Slartibartfast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1500851/slartibartfast"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":79,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569409109,"creation_date":1569350103,"last_edit_date":1569409109,"question_id":58086327,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086327","body_markdown":"In Chrome, quite often the request for a particular image or font file(.ttf, .woff2) fails with `Error: status (failed) net::ERR_TOO_MANY_RETIRES`. \r\n\r\nThis happens roughly one out of 5-7 tries(or reloads).

Yes, that often relates with the notion of &quot;[permalinks][2]&quot;, which describes the fact that a given URL is intended to remain permanently valid; however &quot;permalinks&quot; do not actually forbid having query args or keeping file extensions.\r\n\r\n**How it works**\r\n\r\nNow, implementation of friendly URL in PHP always starts by adding some form of location handler at the web server&#39;s level. Essentially, you need the web server to understand that a request of the form `/mysite/project/&lt;id&gt;` actually need to be delegated to some specific PHP script (more on this later).\r\n\r\nThen, you also need some form of routing mechanism that will decode the original URL, decide what action is being requested and what arguments are to be provided; for example, that routing mechanism would decode the URL `/mysite/project/2` and determine that it has to return the project page template, filled with project id 2.\r\n\r\nIn complex PHP applications, these two concerns are usually dealt separately. In such case, a single rule will be added in the web server&#39;s configuration file, which redirect every request  (with the exception of requests on static assets) to a unique PHP entry point, traditionally named &quot;index.php&quot;. Then, some algorithm in that file will inspect the `$_SERVER[&#39;REQUEST_URI&#39;]` variable, decode it, and determine what PHP function to invoke, and with which arguments. Such an algorithm is typically named a &quot;router&quot;. This is for example how applications such as WordPress, Magento or Prestashop works.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it is also possible to handle both concerns, at the web server&#39;s level, and doing so is generally easier on very small projects (note that there&#39;s pros and cons to that approach, which I won&#39;t discuss in details at this point). In that case, you would add to your web server&#39;s configuration one rewrite rule per URL pattern, substituting the friendly URL by its internal equivalent. For example, `/mysite/project/&lt;id&gt;` could be internally rewritten to `/mysite/project.php?id=&lt;id&gt;`.\r\n\r\n**How to do it**\r\n\r\nDeveloping a PHP based router from scratch is not really that hard, but I would not recommend you to do so. If you think your project&#39;s might grow to the point where having a PHP based router might be pertinent, then it might also be pertinent to consider using a development framework that already support routing. Most every PHP frameworks do include some form of routing. I personally won&#39;t recommend any, just search for &quot;PHP frameworks&quot; in Google.\r\n\r\nAs for implementing friendly URLs by the mean of rewrite rules at the web server&#39;s level, the syntax obviously depend on which web server you are using. Most servers support some form of regex based syntax for that purpose.\r\n\r\nFor example, using nginx (see [nginx rewrite documentation][3]), you could have something like this:\r\n```\r\nserver {\r\n    # ...\r\n\r\n    rewrite &quot;^/mysite/project/([0-9]+)$&quot; /mysite/project.php?id=$1;\r\n\r\n    # ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing Apache httpd (see [Apache&#39;s mod_rewrite documentation][4]), you could obtain the equivalent by adding this to the .htaccess file, inside the root directory of your site:\r\n```\r\nRewriteEngine On\r\nRewriteRule &quot;^/mysite/project/([0-9]+)$&quot; &quot;/mysite/project.php?id=$1&quot; [L]\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink\r\n  [3]: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html#rewrite\r\n  [4]: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_rewrite.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086321/how-to-change-existing-permalink-php-html-css/58087591#58087591","title":"How to change existing permalink (PHP, HTML, CSS)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12114954,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eMUskCzTrhM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3redBEfA6vEYeHFwNixck_Rpxp7_fA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mrP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12114954/mrp"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569356470,"creation_date":1569350061,"question_id":58086321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086321","body_markdown":"I have a problem with permalink (I think those are called permalink).\r\nI am developing WEB site using PHP, HTML and CSS.

Have found a lot but not much I can use; have set the required padding for the left and right edges of the bar and used an extension on UIImage to get the yellow for the selectionIndicatorImage property of the bar, the current code is below. Thats as far as I came. \r\nI need to put a radius on that yellow background.\r\nI need to have the icon in the item of that size. I&#39;m sure this implies I cannot just set the image property of the item itself, as I understand that needs to be a certain size (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49492229/tab-bar-icon-size) \r\nInside the first 2 tab items I also need to position a second smaller icon to the upper left edge of the main one. \r\nWhat I realised is that I need to use image views for everything to get what I said above, but i struggle to find examples that I can use, what to use to create them, how to add them to the tab item and how to position them. \r\nJust to be as clear as possible: i don&#39;t want to use tabBarItem.image = some image. I want to not use this property and just display a image view with an icon the correct size occupying the same position that is allocated to the tabBarItem.image property. I want to circumvent the properties on the tab items given to me and use image views instead.\r\nAny help will be very much appreciated. \r\n\r\n    // From the tab bar controller. \r\n    override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {\r\n            super.viewWillLayoutSubviews()\r\n            self.tabBar.frame = self.tabBar.frame.insetBy(dx: 7, dy: 0) \r\n            \r\n            let numberOfTabs = CGFloat(tabBar.items!.count)\r\n            let tabItemSize = CGSize(width: tabBar.frame.width / numberOfTabs, height: tabBar.frame.height )\r\n            tabBar.selectionIndicatorImage = UIImage.imageWithColor(color: UIColor.customColoursForAllElements(colourName: &quot;menu yellow&quot;), size: tabItemSize)\r\n        }\r\n        override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {\r\n            super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()\r\n            tabBar.invalidateIntrinsicContentSize()\r\n        }\r\n    extension UIImage {\r\n        class func imageWithColor(color: UIColor, size: CGSize) -&gt;

**1.** A qubit can be measured and encoded in parallel by a quantum-device(quantum-circuits/gates) to give rise to multiple states because it&#39;s wave-function(in terms of phase and amplitude) can be represented by complex numbers on a [bloch-sphere][2].(quantum-particles are described by wave-functions)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[![qubit-sphere][1]][1]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;hence a superimposed qubit could arguably represent a complex number whose equivalent binary value is way larger than a pair of bits.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt; **2.** A qubit can have multiple [states][5]. hence the limit of a qubit would be the amount of states the bloch-sphere for a single qubit can represent at a time\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt; **3.** the number base would be `the-max-amount-of-states` the qubit can maximize depending on what it is made of(photons,ions,electrons).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt; **4.** First of quantum computers still operate simultaneously on parallel instances of binary inputs to produce faster results and not with a higher number-base as in [**1234** x **12**]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; instead of [**10011010010** x **1100**]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also if a classical computer could operate/transmit information faster than light speed it would outperform a quantum computer in the sense that qubit-entanglement as of today only transmits information and not physical qubits(since qubits can neither be copied or moved) which is slower(i.e. coordination between entangled qubits may be faster than light since it(entanglement) doesn&#39;t depend on distance but communication between them doesn&#39;t happen that fast). To quote directly from [Quantum Teleportation][3]: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&quot;Quantum teleportation provides a mechanism of moving a qubit from one location to another, \r\nwithout having to physically transport the underlying particle to which that qubit is normally attached.&quot;*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&quot;The movement of qubits does not require the movement of &quot;things&quot; any more than communication&quot;*.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In [essence][4] to transmit qubit `C` from point **`1`** to point **`2`** two entangled qubits `A` and `B` at **`1`** and **`2`** are present, `A` compares itself to `C` at **`1`** and applies the result on itself so that it affects `B` at **`2`** in order to re-create `D`(the identical copy of `C`).   \r\n \r\n&gt; [see][6] [this][7] too\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9GPgj.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation\r\n  [4]: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/282833/speed-of-quantum-teleportation\r\n  [5]: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/intro-to-quantum-computing/0/steps/31556\r\n  [6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM\r\n  [7]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/05/40655.compressed.pdf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086285/what-is-a-quantum-computers-qubit-state-like-and-how-fast-can-it-be-modified/58154180#58154180","title":"What is a Quantum-computer:&#39;s qubit state like and How fast can it be modified?"}],"owner":{"reputation":322,"user_id":10138416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OdY1A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LiNKeR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10138416/linker"},"last_editor":{"reputation":322,"user_id":10138416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OdY1A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LiNKeR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10138416/linker"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":5,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569776132,"creation_date":1569349909,"last_edit_date":1569357200,"question_id":58086285,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086285","body_markdown":"&gt;  This question was asked for the sole purpose of simplification\r\nand in an attempt to get straight to the point and not for us\r\nto demonstrate how smarter/ignorant we are than each other, as it is \r\ncommon practise on stackoverflow. I highly implore us to answer\r\nto the best of our knowledge without any mathematical jargon \r\nand with the view that it would be:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. friendly to any one just\r\ntrying to understand what quantum computing is basically all about\r\nand how it works. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. help clear misconceptions and provide better understanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nI may have made a few errors or may not have given\r\nthe best explanations which is why I have painted some illustrations by putting\r\nsome examples in parenthesis flying all over to convey fully what I mean. \r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Classical Recap:**\r\n\r\nFor a classical computer two states are used(**`1`** s and **`0`** s) for a bit\r\nwhich implies that the processor of a classical computer \r\noperates arithmetically and logically in a binary number\r\nsystem i.e. it adds,subtracts and makes decisions in *base-2*. This is all\r\ndone with transistors via the exchange of electrons across bus lines\r\nor nano-circuits(thus *read/write* occurs with voltage and current modulations or manipulations)\r\n\r\n**Quantum Recap:**\r\n\r\nFor a quantum computer I have seen a lot of articles \r\nand videos emphasising how faster it is compared to\r\nthe latter by employing qubits. Since a qubit can \r\neither be a **`1`** or a **`0`** or both(with superposition) i.e. A \r\nquantum computer uses sub-atomic/quantum particles in a vacuum\r\nenvironment to represent a qubit which can be measured with\r\nthe integration of technologies such as laser and optical systems, radio frequency (RF), microwave technology\r\ne.t.c to manipulate these particles(qubits) and according to wikipedia &quot;when qubits are measured the result is always either a **`0`** or a **`1`** &quot;, [Quantum Computing][1](*4th paragraph*)\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n**`My Questions:`**\r\n\r\n*Nature(What is a qubit State like?)*\r\n\r\n1. Firstly if only a value(**`0`** or **`1`**) can be measured for a qubit does that mean a superimposed qubit gets measured once or twice to produce either **10** or **01** (or even **11** or **00** ) \r\n   (so that superimposed-qubits are different from one another) ?\r\n2. Mathematically how many possible states can a qubit have(from **1** or **0** or **10** or **01** (or even **00** or **11**) ) ?   \r\n3. Thirdly what number system can we say a quantum computer is operating in(obviously the second question addresses this e.g. a classical computer uses two states for a bit thus operates in a binary(*base-2*) number system) ?\r\n\r\n*Speed(How fast can it be modified?)*\r\n\r\n4. My take on why a quantum computer is any faster than the classical isn&#39;t basically due to quantum properties such as superposition, entanglements etc. but on the notion that *read/write* \r\n   speeds in terms of classical bits(if we agree that a qubit has x states then classical bits can be converted to *base-x* inorder to have equivalent qubits) occur at speeds with which\r\n   subatomic particles move/interact e.g. to put simply I think if a quantum processor were to perform a basic logic operation such as to **AND** the bits of two video-files(do have in mind \r\n   that a quantum computer will be needing the classical hardrive if it becomes a PC  hence the analogy since a classical video-file would have no qubits) after the bits are \r\n   loaded(as qubits in a quantum Cache or quantum RAM) it would be faster because qubit manipulating devices (e.g. quantum Gate) operate nearly at a fraction of the speed of photons and electrons \r\n   which is way faster than performing classical bit manipulations(*read/write*) with electricity as in a classical processor with nano-transistors. (I am aware that multiplying a binary equivalent of a *base-x* number \r\n   would be less faster too because it would require more digits e.g. [**10011010010** x **1100**]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is slower compared to its equivalent [**1234** x **12**]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ). Is this wrong because from my research there\r\n   were arguments that a quantum computer might not be any faster than a classical computer in some cases?\r\n    \r\n**`My Guesses:`**\r\n\r\n1. not sure, maybe twice(since superimposed qubits can represent different additional states)?\r\n2. If a qubit has 3 states then possible values are [**0, 1, 01=10**]; if 4 states then its [**0, 1, 01, 10**]; if 6 states then its [**0, 1, 01, 10, 00, 11**]\r\n3. *base 3?, 4?, 6?* depending on the selected guess from above.\r\n4. If a classical computer capable of perfoming computations by manipulating classical bits at (e.g. 20% of) light speed existed\r\n   it would nearly out perform a quantum computer as qubit states only represent a quantum computer&#39;s ability to compute directly\r\n   in a number system higher than binary thus a quantum processor would only require less physical storage to perform \r\n   computations as opposed to long streams of binary digits(just as the multiplication example in question 4 shows).\r\n\r\n\r\n**ASSUMPTIONS**[*Question 4*]\r\n\r\n1. possibility of a quantum PC\r\n\r\n2. that quantum computing only implies computing with a quantum processor(and possible peripherals e.g. quantum RAM, quantum Cache    etc.) hence a quantum PC would have a normal    secondary-storage(hard-drive) \r\n\r\n3. *base-x* refers to a number base which represents all possible states a qubit can be in, so definitely *x* should be greater than 2\r\n\r\n4. that light speed refers specifically to speed of photons/electrons/subatomic-particles in a vacuum in relation to how fast computing could be if harnessed \r\n\r\n5. that in order for a quantum processor to manipulate data from a secondary storage(hard-drive,flash-drive,cloud etc.), the data has    to be converted into qubits equivalent of *base-x*(denoting qubit states)\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Say the product is &quot;**Custom Product1**&quot; and he wants that to be in a separate cart page not in the default one (Will be using a separate add to cart button for this). Also correspondingly he wants a **separate mini cart** to display these products like the normal mini cart does. \r\n\r\n**Basically what he needs is to have 2 separate cart pages and mini carts at the same time on the same site.**\r\n\r\nAnyway both carts (Default one and Custom one) are going to the same checkout. If this isn&#39;t possible I would be able to convince him to use a separate checkout page for this also.\r\n\r\nIs this possible? I didn&#39;t find any solutions for this so I came up with some custom idea before trying that I decided to ask from experts to see if there is a way to achieve this without custom coding another solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n*Edit* :\r\nI haven&#39;t coded anything yet but here is the work flow I am thinking of coding.\r\n\r\n1. There is already a button created by WP sample plugin and I will be creating a click event for that button to once clicked then the product info to be saved on a session variable.\r\n\r\n2. Then I will create another mini cart with custom HTML and CSS then loop through all the session variables created before and display them as products.\r\n\r\n3. Will do the same for the cart page too. Will create a custom page for this.\r\n\r\n4. Once clicked checkout of both of these then I will add the session saved products to WC default cart and checkout with them. If there are already products on the WC default cart then I will save them and empty the cart.\r\n\r\n5. Once the user is back to the site with custom products checked out then I will check for session variables for products if there aren&#39;t anything left then I will restore the previous saved WC products back to the WC default cart.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know if these make sense or even possible.

(It&#39;s not a good idea to embed `{}` inside the script. We&#39;d have issues with special characters like spaces and quotes.)\r\n\r\nSo how do we set `$1`? The answer by appending arguments to the shell command: `sh -c &#39;&lt;script&gt;&#39; arg0 arg1 arg2...` sets the positional arguments `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc., to the strings `arg0`, `arg1`, `arg2`, and so on. Let&#39;s do that. We can set `$0` to `sh`, the name of the shell; and `$1` to `{}`, the file name from `find`.\r\n\r\nThis whole `-exec` action can be treated as a test that passes or fails, no different from a simpler test like `-type f`. We can chain other conditional actions such as a call to `dcmdump`.\r\n\r\nAll together we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c &#39;file &quot;$1&quot; | grep -q DICOM&#39; sh {} \\; -exec dcmdump {} +\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086242/how-to-use-file-grep-string-in-a-find-command/58089948#58089948","title":"How to use `file | grep &lt;string&gt;` in a find command?"}],"owner":{"reputation":152,"user_id":9343043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ced251a523e5346aa3aed9005f13f30f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"florence-y","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9343043/florence-y"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264257,"user_id":68587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d9fd158e03cbde94f7e0b33b78222af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Kugelman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/68587/john-kugelman"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569374961,"creation_date":1569349651,"last_edit_date":1569374713,"question_id":58086242,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086242","body_markdown":"As simple and na&#239;ve as it sounds, I&#39;m struggling with the `find` and `file` command.

It might seem like it&#39;s not a big deal, but in reality, the mutable collection acting as immutable won&#39;t be very efficient and performant. For example, appending the new element to the list would require copying the whole list.\r\n\r\nI would suggest you check out [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io/vavr-docs/). It has its own implementation of functional, immutable [linked list](https://www.vavr.io/vavr-docs/#_linked_list), which allows you to do appends on constant time (which doesn&#39;t require copying whole list, because common elements are shared). For example:\r\n\r\n    var l1 = List.of(1, 2, 3); //List(1, 2, 3)\r\n    var l2 = l1.append(4);     //List(1, 2, 3, 4)\r\n\r\nIn this example both list would share 1,2,3.\r\n\r\nYou can also convert from and to Java List easily:\r\n\r\n    java.util.List&lt;String&gt; javaList = Arrays.asList(&quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Haskell&quot;, &quot;Scala&quot;);\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; vavrList = List.ofAll(javaList);\r\n\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; vavrStringList = List.of(&quot;JAVA&quot;, &quot;Javascript&quot;, &quot;Scala&quot;);\r\n    java.util.List&lt;String&gt; javaStringList = vavrStringList.toJavaList();","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086240/java-functional-programming-paradigm-how-do-i-make-my-arrays-immutable/58092738#58092738","title":"Java &amp; Functional Programming Paradigm - How do i make my arrays immutable"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12109303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/943dd34a2ab36434dcd8b09785a5811b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thezi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12109303/thezi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":37888,"user_id":4922375,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f70cb2cc341b8ceda0e1f801316d85f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew Tobilko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4922375/andrew-tobilko"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":108,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58086408,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569484675,"creation_date":1569349649,"last_edit_date":1569350419,"question_id":58086240,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086240","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to make code that follows the functional programming paradigm, which follows immutability very religiously, but the only way I know how to make my array even close to being immutable is by using \r\n\r\n```List&lt;Integer&gt; items = Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(0,1,2,3));``` \r\n\r\nI am unsure whether this makes the array immutable or just unmodifiable.

Since you mentioned application logs I&#39;m going to assume you have a process running on a server somewhere.  \r\n\r\nMy first thought was your application server started having performance issue and wasn&#39;t able process each SQS message before the timeout.  This would cause SQS to put the message back into the queue.\r\n\r\nThe question is how can you confirm this?  If you go into the SQS dashboard and select your SQS and then click on the Monitoring tab. Make sure to update you Time Range as it defaults to an hour.  Since this is over a week ago you might want to use CloudWatch-&gt;Metrics as you can create a absolute time range to limit the data to when your problem occured.\r\n\r\nFirst lets confirm that the SQS metrics match your application metrics for the time window in question:\r\nNumberOfMessagesSent: This should equal 400k. \r\nNumberOfMessagesReceived: This should equal 5 million.\r\nNumberOfMessagesDeleted: This should equal about 500k.\r\nApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage:  This number should increase over the 3 days as the messages waited to be processed.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t get these numbers then post your metrics as it will provide better insight.\r\n\r\nA few more questions for you need to consider.\r\n- How man receivers do you have?\r\n- If you are not deleting messages until after they are processed then the  ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisable metric should be close to the # of receivers.  If it is &gt; then you application is not deleting the messages.   If it is &lt; then it can indicate you application is not processing the messages before the timeout. \r\n\r\nPretty hard to tell you exactly what is going on, but hopefully this will help. \r\n \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086231/how-can-5-million-message-count-come-for-400k-file-upload-in-s3/58089983#58089983","title":"How can 5 million message count come for 400k file upload in s3"}],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":4620187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kPK5l.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Swarnim Raj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4620187/swarnim-raj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11415,"user_id":4420967,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6pYX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4420967/james-z"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569374773,"creation_date":1569349610,"last_edit_date":1569351409,"question_id":58086231,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086231","body_markdown":"I have configured an AWS pipeline so that an object create event in my S3 creates an SQS message.

1\tt-shirt\tacme\t9\r\n\r\nHowever, the output I want is:\r\n\r\n    id\tname\tbrand\tcolor\t\t\tsize\r\n    1\tt-shirt\tacme\tblack, white\t9\r\n\r\nOf course the query has to be &quot;dynamic&quot;, so any other options added to the product in the future should be returned as well, for example:\r\n\r\n    id\tname\tbrand\tcolor\t\t\tsize\tcondition\r\n    1\tt-shirt\tacme\tblack, white\t9\t\tnew, used\r\n\r\nAny ideas how I can achieve this? I know I can simply create two endpoints, one to retrieve the product list, and the other to return its options, but having all in one document seems like a nicer solution.\r\n\r\nAny help will be much appreciated, thanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086221/how-to-prepare-json-objects-and-arrays-from-related-database-tables","title":"How to prepare JSON objects and arrays from related database tables?"},{"tags":["python-3.x","methods"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":385,"user_id":10359850,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/314f9e3843a501691b71bcea4d44e4b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"R.

Does that make sense?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086203/regex-solution-to-first-name-and-first-name-last-name-pattern","title":"Regex solution to {First_name and First_name

In XPath, quotes have to be altered between `&quot;` and `&#39;`, respectively `&amp;quot;` and `&amp;apos;`, alternately. Because you use `&amp;quot;` in your `%s` parameter, the surrounding brackets have to be `&#39;` or, respectively, `&amp;apos;`. So your XPath expression could look like this...\r\n\r\n    //*[local-name()=&#39;scriptTask&#39;][@name=&#39;set variables app_from_user &amp;amp; applist to &amp;quot;ticketingsystem&amp;quot;&#39;]/*[local-name()=&#39;script&#39;]/text()\r\n\r\nand therefore your whole expression could look like the following:\r\n\r\n    getLines = xml.xpath(&quot;//*[local-name()=&#39;scriptTask&#39;][@name=&#39;%s&#39;]/*[local-name()=&#39;script&#39;]/text()&quot; % script_name)\r\n\r\nNow the `&amp;quot;` entities should be properly encapsulated in the `&amp;apos;` entities of the `[@name=&#39;%s&#39;]`.\r\n\r\nThere is a reference about [entities in XML at W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/xml/prohibited-character-literals.php) which says:\r\n\r\n&gt; The apostrophe (&#39;) and quote characters (&quot;) may also need to be encoded as entities when used in attribute values. If the delimiter for the attribute value is the apostrophe, then the quote character is legal but the apostrophe character is not, because it would signal the end of the attribute value. If an apostrophe is needed, the character entity &amp;apos; must be used. Similarly, if a quote character is needed in an attribute value that is delimited by quotes, then the character entity &amp;quot; must be used. \r\n\r\nHope this helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086198/how-to-write-xpath-query-that-contains-html-entities/58086437#58086437","title":"How to write XPath query that contains HTML entities?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zmuWV7gxuv8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reh-_pvT8uMC8eFo8lHVAyIdMejfA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"magsul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099422/magsul"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569352008,"creation_date":1569349466,"question_id":58086198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58086198","body_markdown":"I have this block of XML: \r\n```\r\n&lt;bpmn:scriptTask id=&quot;UserTask_0qtrxsq&quot; name=&quot;set variables app_from_user &amp;amp; applist to &amp;quot;ticketingsystem&amp;quot;&quot; scriptFormat=&quot;groovy&quot;&gt;\r\n... &lt;bpmn:script&gt; What should be matched is here ... &lt;/bpmn:script&gt;\r\n&lt;/bpmn:scriptTask&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nin an XML file I&#39;m trying to parse using Python and XPath.
