I would recommend storing them in the database as fixed-point numbers.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961395/best-variable-types-to-use-for-floating-point-value/57961430#57961430","title":"Best variable types to use for floating-point value"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568653806,"post_id":57961486,"comment_id":102334527,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961395/best-variable-types-to-use-for-floating-point-value/57961486#comment102334527_57961486"},{"owner":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568660598,"post_id":57961486,"comment_id":102337102,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961395/best-variable-types-to-use-for-floating-point-value/57961486#comment102337102_57961486"},{"owner":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568660613,"post_id":57961486,"comment_id":102337105,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961395/best-variable-types-to-use-for-floating-point-value/57961486#comment102337105_57961486"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568653746,"creation_date":1568653746,"answer_id":57961486,"question_id":57961395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961486","body_markdown":"In alternative to the fixed comma decimals [proposed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961430/1312382) already, just use ordinary integers!\r\n\r\nInstead of storing 18.001 *seconds*, you&#39;d store 18001 *milliseconds*, you wouldn&#39;t store Euro, Pound, Dollar, but tenth of a cent or penny, ...\r\n\r\nType in C++ would be an integer as well, large enough to hold maximum numbers you need, e. g. `uint32_t`, `int64_t`, ...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961395/best-variable-types-to-use-for-floating-point-value/57961486#57961486","title":"Best variable types to use for floating-point value"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":49929,"user_id":5245033,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6dbfd37ccb940fd2afcd49e966ad97e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SergeyA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5245033/sergeya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":49929,"user_id":5245033,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6dbfd37ccb940fd2afcd49e966ad97e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SergeyA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5245033/sergeya"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568655781,"last_edit_date":1568655781,"creation_date":1568653987,"answer_id":57961530,"question_id":57961395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961530","body_markdown":"Answering the question on it&#39;s face value, assuming floating point should be used and fixed point is not applicable.\r\n\r\nUnless you are really tight on memory, there is really no reason to use anything for floating numbers in C++ but `double`.

There was a few examples where `permissions` had urls and I&#39;ve tried that to no result.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://naver.com/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961360/chrome-extensions-content-script-is-bound-to-only-a-local-web-page","title":"Chrome Extension&#39;s content script is bound to only a local web page"},{"tags":["tensorflow","tensorflow2.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36490,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568653424,"post_id":57961355,"comment_id":102334372,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961355/attributeerror-tensorslicedataset-object-has-no-attribute-element-spec#comment102334372_57961355"},{"owner":{"reputation":478,"user_id":8029329,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f4y8V.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Devashish Prasad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8029329/devashish-prasad"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":36490,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568653671,"post_id":57961355,"comment_id":102334473,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961355/attributeerror-tensorslicedataset-object-has-no-attribute-element-spec#comment102334473_57961355"}],"owner":{"reputation":478,"user_id":8029329,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f4y8V.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Devashish Prasad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8029329/devashish-prasad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36490,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568653461,"creation_date":1568653072,"last_edit_date":1568653461,"question_id":57961355,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961355","body_markdown":"I am very new to tensorflow.

Let me reformulate this just a bit: You need to create a function that returns *something* so that you can write `f(n)(v)` in `main()`. \r\n\r\nThis *something* must not necessarily be a function (or function pointer). If we stick to this syntax `f(n)(v)`, then it definitely has to be a callable. Note that &quot;callable&quot; can be many things. All that we need for some object `F` to be callable is that `F(v)` is valid for certain types of `v`.\r\n\r\nA rather traditional type of callables are functors. A functor is an object of a class that has an `operator()`. I don&#39;t wont to give away the full free lunch, so for the sake of the example I will restrict myself to linear functions (extension to polynomials should be straight-forward). \r\n\r\nWe start by defining the functor class:\r\n\r\n    struct linear_fun {\r\n        double a;\r\n        double b;\r\n        double operator()(double x) { return a + b*x; }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nOnce we have this, passing around a function object is as simple as it can get:\r\n\r\n    // returns a linear_fun that crosses the origin and the given point\r\n    linear_fun fun_crossing_point(double x,double y) {\r\n        return { 0.0 , y / x };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLastly we want to test it\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; fun_crossing_point( 1.1 , 5.0 )(1.1);    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nPrints:\r\n\r\n    5\r\n\r\nNote that there are also lambdas which are basically syntactic sugar for functor classes. They come in handy when you want to define the functor only in a narrow scope. The downside is that every lambda is of different type, so when you want one specific type then it is worth to consider writing the functor class yourself.\r\n\r\nAlso C++ has `std::function`, which is the catch-it-all solution for callables. It comes with great flexibility, because a single `std::function` object can be assigned almost any kind of callable. However, this flexibility comes at some cost and usually one does not need it. I presume you just need to define one type that defines your polynomial and you do not need to mix eg free functions, member functions and others.

do it in parts!\r\n\r\nYou need a Rails query that will get me the last created rating for every movie made by the current user.\r\n\r\nOk, with this information, let`s start with the current_user reference!\r\n\r\nYour relation for `User` is like this:\r\n\r\n&gt; A `user` has many `movies`\r\n\r\n&gt; A `user` has many `ratings`\r\n\r\nWith these definitions, you can take advantage of ActiveRecord to run the following methods:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncurrent_user.movies # All movies of a current_user\r\ncurrent_user.movies # All ratings of a current_user\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, now we can access all movies and ratings from a user instance, but how we can access the ratings grouped by movies?\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see the `Rating` relations:\r\n\r\n&gt; A `rating` belongs to a `user` # this means the rating instance has the user_id\r\n\r\n&gt; A `rating` belongs to a `movie` # this means the rating instance has the movie_id\r\n\r\nNice! Now we can **get the user ratings grouped by `movie`**:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncurrent_user.ratings.group_by { |rating| rating.movie_id }\r\n# or the sugar sintax\r\ngrouped_ratings = current_user.ratings.group_by(&amp;:movie_id)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will group all user ratings based on the `movie_id`, and will produce to us a hash like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{\r\n  1: [#&lt;Rating id: 115...#&gt;, #&lt;Rating id: 116...#&gt;], # The &quot;1&quot; means the movie_id of the group_by\r\n  2: [#&lt;Rating id: 117...#&gt;] # The &quot;2&quot; means the movie_id of the group_by\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOk, now we have a hash of ratings from a User, grouped by the `movie_id`.\r\n\r\nBut we need the last rating created by a user for each Movie correctly? \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nlast_ratings_for_each_movie = grouped_ratings.map do |movie_id, ratings|\r\n  movie = Movie.find(movie_id)\r\n  last_rating = ratings.sort_by{ |rating| rating.created_at }.last\r\n  \r\n  puts &quot;The last Rating created by the current user for Movie #{movie.title} is the rating #{last_rating.id}&quot; # Assuming movie has a title\r\n  \r\n  last_rating\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the last moment, you will have an array of the last rating created for a movie (to access the movie you can execute a `rating.movie` for example)\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t understand if you must do it with SQL, if yes, let me know pls :)\r\n\r\nHope it helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961340/ruby-on-rails-group-by-for-relation-and-created-at/57963431#57963431","title":"Ruby on Rails - group_by for relation and created_at"}],"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":6939256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e25b477a55a8048071d22e032ecf22f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Benjamints","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6939256/benjamints"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1070,"user_id":10430642,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5jzL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dimitrius Lachi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10430642/dimitrius-lachi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57963431,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568666760,"creation_date":1568652968,"last_edit_date":1568666760,"question_id":57961340,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961340","body_markdown":"I&#39;m looking for a Rails query that will get me the last created rating for every movie made by the current user.\r\n\r\nFor example, let&#39;s say I have this active record collection:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n#&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation [\r\n  #&lt;Rating id: 115, score: 5, movie_id: 7, user_id: 5, created_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:47:55&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:47:55&quot;&gt;,\r\n  #&lt;Rating id: 116, score: 3, movie_id: 7, user_id: 5, created_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:47:57&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:47:57&quot;&gt;,\r\n  #&lt;Rating id: 117, score: 5, movie_id: 7, user_id: 5, created_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:50:37&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:50:37&quot;&gt;,\r\n  #&lt;Rating id: 118, score: 3, movie_id: 8, user_id: 5, created_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:50:42&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2019-09-16 16:50:42&quot;&gt;\r\n]&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see there are three objects with `movie_id`: `7`, one with `movie_id`: `6`.

short answer is: to change an object you must have a reference to that object. That&#39;s not unique to tkinter, it&#39;s a fundamental aspect of programming. You&#39;re using local variables which by definition means you can&#39;t access the widgets outside of that function. The solution, then, is to not use local variables. \r\n\r\nA proper solution requires you to save a reference that the other function can access, or provide a function that can return a reference. Have the function return a reference, use a global variable, or use a class variable.\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution for your specific example is to use a global variable. For example:\r\n\r\n    import tkinter\r\n    \r\n    def loadEvent():\r\n        ...\r\n        summaryEventLabel.configure(text=&#39;Updated&#39;)\r\n        ...\r\n    \r\n    def createWindow():\r\n        global  summaryEventLabel\r\n        ...\r\n        summaryEventLabel = tkinter.Label(window, text=&#39;Event:&#39;)\r\n        summaryEventLabel.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=&#39;e&#39;)\r\n        ...\r\n    \r\n    createWindow()\r\n    loadEvent()\r\n\r\n**However**, your specific example won&#39;t work because `window.mainloop()` will not return until the window is destroyed or you call its `quit` method. This means that `createWindow` won&#39;t return, so `loadEvent` will not be called. \r\n\r\nIf you were to structure your program to avoid this problem -- for example, calling `loadEvent` in response to a button click or some other event -- this solution would work.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a working example that updates the label after 5 seconds:\r\n\r\n    import tkinter\r\n    \r\n    def loadEvent():\r\n        summaryEventLabel.configure(text=&#39;Updated&#39;)\r\n        print(&#39;Updated&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    def createWindow():\r\n        global  summaryEventLabel\r\n        window = tkinter.Tk()\r\n        summaryEventText = tkinter.StringVar()\r\n        summaryEventText.set(&#39;Init&#39;)\r\n        summaryEventLabel = tkinter.Label(window, text=&#39;Event:&#39;)\r\n        summaryEventLabel.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=&#39;e&#39;)\r\n        summaryEvent = tkinter.Label(window, textvariable=summaryEventText).grid(row=0, column=1, sticky=&#39;w&#39;)\r\n        window.after(5000, loadEvent)\r\n        window.mainloop()\r\n    \r\n    createWindow()\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961305/i-need-to-update-some-label-text-from-outside-of-the-function-that-created-it/57982721#57982721","title":"I need to

have a tkinter.Label created inside a function and from a totally seperate part of my code I need to update the text.\r\n\r\nI have tried just about every solution google provides over the last hour and I can&#39;t get any of them to work, some error, some show blanks, some just fail to do anything.\r\n\r\nI am creating the labels as follows\r\n```\r\ndef createWindow():\r\n    window = tkinter.Tk()\r\n    container = tkinter.Frame(window, padx=5, pady=5)\r\n    summaryFrame = tkinter.Frame(container, bd=2, relief=&#39;groove&#39;)\r\n    summaryFrame.pack(side=&#39;top&#39;, fill=&#39;x&#39;)\r\n    summaryUser = tkinter.Label(summaryFrame, text=&#39;Some text&#39;).grid(row=1, column=1, sticky=&#39;w&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMuch later I need to change the text of this label but because I&#39;m no longer in this createWindow() function I don&#39;t have access to the summaryUser variable that contains the text.\r\n\r\nI have tried summaryEvent[&quot;text&quot;] (errors because it&#39;s not available), I have tried using a global variable and using textvariable=AGlobalVariable instead of text=&#39;Some text&#39; (leaves the label text blank) and many other google results all with no success.\r\n\r\nThis seems like the sort of functionality that should be easier than this...\r\n\r\n**EDIT 1**\r\n\r\nI have tried the following...\r\n\r\n```\r\nsummaryUserText = &#39;Some text&#39;\r\n\r\ndef createWindow():\r\n    global summaryUserText\r\n    window = tkinter.Tk()\r\n    container = tkinter.Frame(window, padx=5, pady=5)\r\n    summaryFrame = tkinter.Frame(container, bd=2, relief=&#39;groove&#39;)\r\n    summaryFrame.pack(side=&#39;top&#39;, fill=&#39;x&#39;)\r\n    summaryUser = tkinter.Label(summaryFrame, textvariable=summaryUserText)\r\n    summaryUser.grid(row=1, column=1, sticky=&#39;w&#39;)\r\n```\r\nWhen I try this the label just starts blank, not with the content of the variable.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2**\r\n\r\nI have also tried the following...\r\n```\r\nsummaryUserText= tkinter.StringVar()\r\nsummaryUserText.set(&#39;Some text&#39;)\r\n\r\ndef createWindow():\r\n    ...\r\n    summaryUser= tkinter.Label(summaryFrame, textvariable=summaryUserText)\r\n```\r\nBut as soon as python sees the first line it errors with the following...\r\n```\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python37\\lib\\tkinter\\__init__.py&quot;, line 480, in __init__\r\n    Variable.__init__(self, master, value, name)\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python37\\lib\\tkinter\\__init__.py&quot;, line 317, in __init__\r\n    self._root = master._root()\r\nAttributeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;_root&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Edit 3**\r\n\r\nThe simplest code that simulates the issue in one complete file\r\n```\r\nimport tkinter\r\n\r\ndef loadEvent():\r\n    global summaryEventText\r\n    summaryEventText.set(&#39;Updated&#39;)\r\n    print(&#39;Updated&#39;)\r\n\r\ndef createWindow():\r\n    global  summaryEventText\r\n    window = tkinter.Tk()\r\n    summaryEventText = tkinter.StringVar()\r\n    summaryEventText.set(&#39;Init&#39;)\r\n    summaryEventLabel = tkinter.Label(window, text=&#39;Event:&#39;).grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=&#39;e&#39;)\r\n    summaryEvent = tkinter.Label(window, textvariable=summaryEventText).grid(row=0, column=1, sticky=&#39;w&#39;)\r\n    window.mainloop()\r\n\r\ncreateWindow()\r\nloadEvent()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo errors, the print(&#39;Updated&#39;) works but the summaryEventText.set(&#39;Updated&#39;) does

Adding brackets does not solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961287/linux-shell-use-disown-on-serial-calculations","title":"Linux shell use disown on serial calculations"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":161240,"user_id":14104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/otetW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"epascarello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14104/epascarello"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568653205,"post_id":57961284,"comment_id":102334277,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961284/problems-with-space-and-line-break-when-merging-javascript-objects#comment102334277_57961284"},{"owner":{"reputation":1256,"user_id":5480147,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7a4c467c7c34e0e9162535a801ae21a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5480147/tom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568655734,"post_id":57961284,"comment_id":102335304,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961284/problems-with-space-and-line-break-when-merging-javascript-objects#comment102335304_57961284"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":9548702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ff50fd01a870037f33a36ad2928e647?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alice_inwonderland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9548702/alice-inwonderland"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568655288,"post_id":57961420,"comment_id":102335135,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961284/problems-with-space-and-line-break-when-merging-javascript-objects/57961420#comment102335135_57961420"},{"owner":{"reputation":28141,"user_id":9624435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h44B4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Code Maniac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9624435/code-maniac"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":80,"user_id":9548702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ff50fd01a870037f33a36ad2928e647?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alice_inwonderland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9548702/alice-inwonderland"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568655394,"post_id":57961420,"comment_id":102335183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961284/problems-with-space-and-line-break-when-merging-javascript-objects/57961420#comment102335183_57961420"},{"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":9548702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ff50fd01a870037f33a36ad2928e647?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alice_inwonderland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9548702/alice-inwonderland"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568667786,"post_id":57961420,"comment_id":102339748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961284/problems-with-space-and-line-break-when-merging-javascript-objects/57961420#comment102339748_57961420"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28141,"user_id":9624435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h44B4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Code Maniac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9624435/code-maniac"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568653366,"creation_date":1568653366,"answer_id":57961420,"question_id":57961284,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961420","body_markdown":"You can do something like this, Takes entries from one object which is defected and replace space characters by space, and then merge keys and values accordingly\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let obj1 = {&quot;\\n  key1\\n  &quot;:[&quot;\\n   a\\n  &quot;], &quot;\\n  key2\\n&quot;:[&quot;\\n  f\\n  &quot;,&quot;\\n   e\\n&quot;], &quot;\\n   key3\\n    &quot;:[&quot;\\n  fda\\n&quot;, &quot;\\n    das\\n&quot;]}\r\n    let obj2 = {&quot;key2&quot;:[&quot;h&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;z&quot;], &quot;key3&quot;:[&quot;zzz&quot;]}\r\n\r\n\r\n    let merger = (obj1,obj2)=&gt;{\r\n      Object.entries(obj1).forEach(([key,value])=&gt;{\r\n        let newKey = key.replace(/\\s+/g,&#39;&#39;)\r\n        if(obj2[newKey]){\r\n          value.forEach(v=&gt;{\r\n            obj2[newKey].push(v.replace(/\\s+/g,&#39;&#39;))\r\n          })\r\n        } else {\r\n          obj2[newKey] = value.map(v=&gt;

I tried another way below but it throws an error &quot;object.map() is not a function&quot;. I debugged and found out the problem was because &quot;key1&quot; has only one value &quot;a&quot;. If I add another value to its list of values, the code works perfectly. However, I need it to work when a key has only one value also. I&#39;ve stuck on this for way too long. Please help!\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst result = Object.keys(obj1)\r\n  .reduce((acc, key) =&gt; ({...acc,\r\n    [key.trim()]: obj1[key]\r\n      .map(val =&gt; val.trim())\r\n      .concat(obj2[key.trim()] || [])\r\n  }), {});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(result)\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961284/problems-with-space-and-line-break-when-merging-javascript-objects","title":"Problems

),\r\n    OrdersInContext\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is actually a lot more general than what you&#39;ve asked for. Hopefully the definition of [Sales] is self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n[Sales of orders containing selected product] first grabs a list of all &#39;Sales&#39;[SaleID] values in the current context, which includes context from all dims, including &#39;Product&#39;. In the sample case (screenshot below, from your question), the context is &#39;Product&#39;[Product]=&quot;Apples&quot;, so our variable contains &#39;Sales&#39;[SaleID] IN {&quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;}.\r\n\r\nNext we use `CALCULATE` to manipulate the context within which to evaluate [Sales]. We clear all context on &#39;Product&#39;, but apply the context of &#39;Sales&#39;[SaleID] stored in our variable, OrdersInContext.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that, and also understanding that the args to `CALCULATE` are evaluated independently, then intersected, we can shorten the definition to this:\r\n\r\n```dax\r\nSales of orders containing selected product =\r\nCALCULATE ( \r\n  [Sales],\r\n  ALL ( &#39;Product&#39; ),\r\n  VALUES ( &#39;Sales&#39;[SaleID] )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI show this second, just because I&#39;ve found that most people find the style with the variable to be easier to understand.

In the two examples you provided, it would be:\r\n\r\n - `ACED00057400095245434F4D4D454E44` to `&#172;&#237;t\tRECOMMEND`\r\n - `ACED000574000566616C7365` to `&#172;&#237;tfalse`.\r\n\r\nNote: the text will not be an accurate conversion of the string because it contains bytes that are not displayed well. For instance `00` in hex is `null` in ASCII.  You can truncate `ACED00057400` and it&#39;s a string, then the conversion will be okay.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes a java program will serialize an object and it may look like gibberish.

don&#39;t know what exactly I need to do with what is being returned to me from those functions.\r\n\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;label for=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Select file:&lt;/label&gt;\r\n

now...&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\r\n      &lt;label&gt;Token value:&lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&#39;token_value_from_upload&#39; style=&quot;width: 220px;&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n     function uploadfile() {\r\n          //retrieve the uploaded file\r\n          var file = data.files[0];\r\n    \t  \r\n    \t  console.log(file.type);\r\n     \r\n          $.ajax({\r\n            url: &quot;https://instance.zendesk.com/api/v2/uploads.json?filename=&quot; + file.name,\r\n            type: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n            data: file,\r\n            dataType: &#39;json&#39;,\r\n            processData: false,\r\n            contentType: &#39;application/binary&#39;,\r\n            headers: {\r\n              &quot;Authorization&quot;: TOKEN\r\n            },\r\n            success: function(response) {\r\n              console.log(response);\r\n              document.getElementById(&#39;token_value_from_upload&#39;).value = response.upload.token;\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n\r\nThe uploadfile function should take a web URL for a file, upload the file to Zendesk, and put the token that is returned in the &quot;token_value_from_upload&quot; box.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961235/how-do-i-replace-a-html-file-input-with-a-web-url","title":"How do I replace a HTML file input with a web

and the setup from the vendor, they often do something very non-standard so reverse engineering their solution fully or slightly is usually neccessary.\r\n\r\n***Itninja.com***: Maybe have a look if you can find the software here in the itninja.com &quot;software tips&quot; section: https://www.itninja.com/software-library/company/ibm - this is a collection of comments people have made who have

If I train it on more examples and higher iterations, the network, which produces two outcomes (`p` and `v`) always predicts exactly `0` for `v` and I would like to change that.\r\n\r\nI think that the main problem is the behaviour of my NN on regular data, I included the overfitting part thought since I read it as one approach to debugging, and I wanted to provide as much info as possible\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following post I will provide all code necessary to reproduce the problem.   \r\nThe first part is on its overfitting behaviour (training on one input results to exploding loss), the second part is on its behaviour on regular data (one of the prediction always stays at 0)  \r\n\r\nI am training a neural network on the same input. The wanted outcome for a value &quot;`v`&quot; is `1`. If I create the network and train it, sometimes the predicted outcome will be `1`, sometimes it will be `-`1.  \r\n Also, the `loss` seems to flip between `0` and `4` during training epochs.   \r\n Additionally, the loss blows up immensly, even though both losses for the outcome layers are close to zero.  \r\n I do not understand where this behaviour comes from. I used `Leaky-ReLU` to make sure it can handle negative input, I used a high `learning rate` to make sure the data in this example is sufficient on the training, and the input is the same all the time.\r\n\r\nMy Neural network looks like this:\r\n\r\n    input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(6,7),)    \r\n    formatted_input_layer = keras.layers.Reshape((6,7, 1))(input_layer)       \r\n

So, I&#39;ve set GetClaimsFromUserIndoEndpoint to false and looked for another way to get the claims we need on request.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve written a custom owin middleware that queries the user info endpoint to add claims at the beginning of the request, with basic caching, but it seems quite a bit sloppier than it should.

Not sure from where you are getting `date`.*\r\n\r\nFirst of all, here is the pattern for your question.\r\n\r\n - Every array inside `studies` has a `Study_ID` and a set of questions `Questions` and user predications `User_Predictions` from many users.\r\n - Each prediction has a user `User_ID` and answers to questions from the previous step.\r\n - The `index of question  = index of answer + 1`\r\n\r\n**Your Question**: You want each user prediction as a separate array, but it should include all list of questions with their answers if present in that particular study.\r\n\r\n**Solution**:\r\n\r\nFor prediction, it is common that there would be a `Study_ID` and a user who responds to it `User_ID`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This array will contain all indexes should be present in final array.\r\n$arrIndex   =   [&#39;Study_ID&#39;, &#39;User_ID&#39;];      // Assume these two would always be present, so added in advance.\r\n\r\n// This will be temporary array holds data for each user prediction with relevant information i.e. it would not have data for questions which are not in this study.\r\n$arrUserStudy    =   [];\r\n\r\nforeach($arr[&#39;studies&#39;] as $arrStudy){\r\n    \r\n    foreach($arrStudy[&#39;Questions&#39;] as $strQuestion){\r\n        // To add a new question to the index.\r\n        if(!in_array($strQuestion,  $arrIndex)){\r\n            $arrIndex[] =   $strQuestion;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    foreach($arrStudy[&#39;User_Predictions&#39;] as $userStudy){\r\n        $arrTemp  =   [\r\n            &#39;Study_ID&#39;  =&gt;  $arrStudy[&#39;Study_ID&#39;],\r\n            &#39;User_ID&#39;   =&gt;  $userStudy[&#39;User_ID&#39;],\r\n        ];\r\n        \r\n        foreach($userStudy[&#39;Answers&#39;] as $intKey =&gt; $strAnswer){\r\n            $arrTemp[$arrStudy[&#39;Questions&#39;][$intKey + 1]]   =   $strAnswer;\r\n        }\r\n        $arrUserStudy[]     =    $arrTemp;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nprint_r($arrIndex);\r\n\r\nArray\r\n(\r\n    [0] =&gt; Study_ID\r\n    [1] =&gt; User_ID\r\n    [2] =&gt; S563 Q1\r\n    [3] =&gt; S563 Q2\r\n    [4] =&gt; S510

       [Study_ID] =&gt; 510\r\n            [User_ID] =&gt; 76\r\n            [S510 Q1] =&gt; 1\r\n            [S510 Q2] =&gt; 1\r\n            [S510 Q3] =&gt; Negative\r\n            [S510 Q4] =&gt; 10\r\n            [S510 Q5] =&gt; 2,2\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    [2] =&gt; Array\r\n        (\r\n            [Study_ID] =&gt; 510\r\n            [User_ID] =&gt; 58\r\n            [S510 Q1] =&gt; 25\r\n

with your output, there are only the following differences:\r\n\r\n - Each user predication has `key` as question/Study_Id/User_ID but in your output, it is an integer.\r\n - It is missing questions from other studies.\r\n\r\nWe can easily include missing questions, as we do have all of them in `$arrIndex` and corresponding values would be `null`.\r\n\r\n**Changing string keys to integer keys**: I would prefer to go with string keys as even if they are not ordered, you can easily identify and access them with their key_name.\r\n\r\n**Final conversion to desired output**:\r\n\r\n**Keep string keys and add missing**(preferred):\r\n```\r\nforeach($arrUserStudy as $intKey =&gt;  $userStudy){\r\n    foreach($arrIndex as $strIndex){\r\n        if(!array_key_exists($strIndex, $userStudy)){\r\n            $arrUserStudy[$intKey][$strIndex] = null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprint_r($arrUserStudy);\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\nArray\r\n(\r\n    [0] =&gt; Array\r\n        (\r\n            [Study_ID]

`$arrUserStudy[&lt;loop_variable&gt;][&lt;index_name&gt;]`.\r\n\r\n**Convert to integer keys and add missing**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$arrReindexed   =   [];\r\nforeach($arrUserStudy as $intKey =&gt;

clarifications*:\r\n\r\n - [array_values][1] returns all the values from the array and indexes the array numerically.\r\n\r\n - [unset][2] after the foreach: as the documentation says:\r\n\r\n&gt; Reference of a $value and the last array element remain even after the\r\n&gt; foreach loop.

Plus, it’s pretty straightforward to setup!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://alligator.io/angular/lazy-loading/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961173/how-to-make-my-angular-application-lightweight/57961256#57961256","title":"How to make my angular application lightweight"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1034,"user_id":7275319,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rhr5z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael Sorensen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7275319/michael-sorensen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568654657,"creation_date":1568654657,"answer_id":57961683,"question_id":57961173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961683","body_markdown":"There are a ton of ways to increase the overall performance of your angular application. In your specific case you can simply `ng serve --aot=true --prod` and that should speed up the performance of your development client but, will make the hot refresh feature extremely slow. Would not recommend for development. \r\n\r\nHowever, since I spend a ton of time on this I thought I might list my favorite ways to improve performance: \r\n\r\n# \\#1. LAZY LOADING MODULES\r\n\r\n(in my experience) Most people pick Angular for large projects due to it&#39;s opinionated and organized design. However, performance for large projects tends to suffer especially if everything is in one place like an Angular app. However, because of Angular&#39;s modular design we can decide when chunks of our app will load. \r\n\r\nFor the most clear instructions on how to implement this in your app i suggest reading the docs https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules but, I will give a short example here: \r\n\r\n 1. Add routing to your project (on a new project just use `ng new App` and add routing from the cli)\r\n 2. Create a sub module with routing `ng generate module mySubModule --routing`\r\n 3. Update the routing module in your `app-routing.module.ts` file to look somewhat like this\r\n ```\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    loadComponent: HomeComponent\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: &#39;mysubroute&#39;,\r\n    loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&#39;./mySubModule/mySubModule.module&#39;).then(mod =&gt; mod.MySubModuleModule)\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```\r\nthen everything in your sub module wont load unless you&#39;re on /mysubroute or after everything else has loaded. Easy right?\r\n\r\n#\\#2. Server Side Rendering\r\n\\*NOTE\\* The new way to lazy load feature modules does *not* work with Angular Universal. You need to use the old string method. You can find an example for that [here][1]\r\n\r\nServer side rendering can improve web performance significantly especially if your page does not change very much. But, this is a much more advanced topic and requires some understanding of how servers, server-cacheing works especially if you decide not to use express.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to add angular universal to your project though `ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject angular.io-example`\r\n\r\n#\\#3. Don&#39;t use a &#39;shared module&#39; when using feature modules.\r\nA lot of tutorials suggest using a shared-module when developing because it does make your life a lot easier. You have to worry a lot less about missing imports and confusing bugs in your templates.\r\n\r\nHowever, that does come with some cost. If you import every single component into every single one of your modules then you will be loading those components up-front every time. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, for the best performance you only want to load what you need at any given time. I find the best way to do this is to make a module for each component and import them when necessary. This may slow runtime performance a small bit, it speeds up initial load times.\r\n\r\n#\\#4. Oldschool web performance tricks still work.\r\n\r\n - Lazy loading your images\r\n - Optimizing huge images\r\n - Limiting the amount of additional fonts\r\n - Adding compression to your server\r\n - Deferring unused css\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular does a lot for us but, huge resources are really the source of bad load times. Loading a 3.4mb background image does no one any favors except my mobile data company.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.freakyjolly.com/angular-6-lazy-loading-example/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961173/how-to-make-my-angular-application-lightweight/57961683#57961683","title":"How to make my angular application lightweight"}],"owner":{"reputation":326,"user_id":6306846,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6e70920c02ac572596f869da7941921?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Santhosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6306846/santhosh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11415,"user_id":4420967,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6pYX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4420967/james-z"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57961683,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568666355,"creation_date":1568652212,"last_edit_date":1568652768,"question_id":57961173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961173","body_markdown":"I am using angular 7 in my application.\r\n\r\nWhen I have started the application using localhost:4200 in developers tools network tab too many CSS, scss, js...... are loading.\r\nBut I don&#39;t need to load all of them.

First thing first I would suggest you to check maybe you clear your dataset somewhere or your screen is getting recreated. \r\n\r\nSecondly I would recommend you to move from Volley since it is quite outdated from modern techniques library that requires a lot of attention to details. Use [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - it is modern, powerful and community approved library. Using it you will be sure that all the requests you want to be async are async and all the responses are handled well. \r\n\r\nAlso I would suggest you not to create adapter each time you load data but use one adapter and add data to it and them use ```notifyDataSetChanged()``` to reload list with relevant data.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961172/how-to-make-concurrent-get-calls-using-volley/58215631#58215631","title":"How to make concurrent GET calls using Volley?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":329,"user_id":8964498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rSBcCMRbhpk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/rSSYeZjhMtg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alireza aslami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8964498/alireza-aslami"},"last_editor":{"reputation":329,"user_id":8964498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rSBcCMRbhpk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/rSSYeZjhMtg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alireza aslami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8964498/alireza-aslami"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570305462,"last_edit_date":1570305462,"creation_date":1570305107,"answer_id":58251818,"question_id":57961172,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58251818","body_markdown":"The best way is to register your LiveData in the StaggeredSearchActivity in onCreate method and listen for db changes like you did.
