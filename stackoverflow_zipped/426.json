The `scriptPath` attribute on the user&#39;s AD account. If this was set, you would see a `ScriptPath` property from `Get-ADUser -Identity $User -Properties *`. If you don&#39;t, that means it is not set.\r\n2. Group Policy applied to the user (via the domain or OU).\r\n3. Group Policy applied to the computer they have logged into (via the domain or OU).\r\n\r\nGetting this info from group policy isn&#39;t easy. Multiple group policies can apply, so you have to mix them all together to see what the actual policies are that would be applied. You can use [`Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicy`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/get-gpresultantsetofpolicy?view=win10-ps) to do this. You give it a user and/or a computer and it will show you all the policies that would be applied.\r\n\r\nHowever, it only supports outputting the results to a file in XML or HTML format. It cannot give you an object that you can examine in-memory. So if you wanted to, you would have to read the file back and parse the information (XML might be easier for that). And it is also very slow.\r\n\r\nIf you are running this on the computer where the user in question is logged in, you can use [`gpresult`][1], which seems to run faster (but still not fast). You can save XML or HTML to file, or output to the console, but the console/HTML output is meant to be human readable, not machine readable, so it would be hard to parse.

I&#39;ve seen some examples but when implementing them in they seem to never work for me. Here&#39;s my code so far (I just cut out some noted text because it isn&#39;t needed) : \r\n```\r\nfrom PyQt5 import QtWidgets, uic,QtCore\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore import Qt,QObject,QThread,pyqtSignal,QCoreApplication,QPoint\r\nimport PyQt5.QtCore\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication,QPushButton,QVBoxLayout,QWidget,QFormLayout,QGridLayout,QLabel,QDialog,QHBoxLayout,QDesktopWidget\r\n\r\nclass LoginWindow(QWidget):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.App = QtWidgets.QApplication([])\r\n        self.LoadedApp = uic.loadUi(&quot;LoginWindow2.ui&quot;)\r\n\r\n        self.LoadedApp.setWindowFlags(Qt.FramelessWindowHint)\r\n\r\n        self.pressing = False\r\n        self.start = QPoint(0, 0)\r\n        self.center()\r\n        self.oldPos = self.LoadedApp.pos()\r\n        self.LoadedApp.show()\r\n        self.App.exec()\r\n\r\n    def mouseReleaseEvent(self, QMouseEvent):\r\n        self.pressing = False\r\n\r\n    def mousePressEvent(self, event):\r\n        self.oldPos = event.globalPos()\r\n\r\n    def mouseMoveEvent(self, event):\r\n        print(&quot;1&quot;)\r\n        delta = QPoint (event.globalPos() - self.oldPos)\r\n        #print(delta)\r\n        self.move(self.x() + delta.x(), self.y() + delta.y())\r\n        self.oldPos = event.globalPos()\r\n\r\n    def center(self):\r\n        qr = self.LoadedApp.frameGeometry()\r\n        cp = QDesktopWidget().availableGeometry().center()\r\n        qr.moveCenter(cp)\r\n        self.LoadedApp.move(qr.topLeft())\r\n\r\nLoginWindow = LoginWindow()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the mouse move event seems to not be connecting to the pyqt5 mouse event. I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s supposed to connect when the function within the class has a specific function name or something like that? It&#39;s quite confusing and my login window seems to not budge. This mouse event thing is very confusing and I tried like two other methods but I ended up deleting the implementation since it made no sense to me.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the download link for the UI : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516367579598684184/634439342940487680/LoginWindow2.ui\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s what the UI looks like (With the hierarchy on the left focused on the bar QLabel widget) : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516367579598684184/634439663557541918/unknown.png\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to get the top bar to be drag-able, not the whole window just the top bar only. Any help?\r\nIf you need additional information, or have questions to what I&#39;m trying to do please ask me and I&#39;ll reply to them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437830/pyqt5-mouse-event-not-working-for-my-custom-tab-bar","title":"Pyqt5 mouse event not working for my custom tab

The token contains several claims, but when I try to access them through `User.Claims` the resulting list is always empty.\r\n\r\nIn my `Startup.cs` I have the authentication setup like so:\r\n\r\n    public class Startup\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t// Code removed for clarity //\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tservices.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n                .AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\toptions.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters\r\n    \t\t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateIssuer = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateAudience = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateLifetime = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidIssuer = JwtManager.Issuer,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidAudience = &quot;MyAudience&quot;,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tIssuerSigningKey = &quot;MySigningKey&quot;\r\n    \t\t\t\t};\r\n    \t\t\t});\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn Core 2.2 I was able to access my claims using code similar to the following: \r\n\r\n    [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]\r\n    public class MyController : Controller\r\n    {\r\n    \t[HttpGet(&quot;MyController/Action&quot;)]\r\n    \tpublic ActionResult&lt;Aggregate[]&gt; GetAction()\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tvar username = User.FindFirstValue(&quot;MyUsernameClaim&quot;);\r\n    \t\tif (username == null)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\treturn Forbid();\r\n    \t\t}\t\t\r\n    \t\t// Do Stuff //\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, when I migrate the same code to Core 3.0, I authenticate properly, but I get no claims for the `User` object. \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nDid I miss a step in converting this to 3.0?

How does it decide if it should run on integrated, discrete or CPU? Can one *reliably* &#39;force&#39; one path? How does this change for systems like the new Mac Pro with multiple discrete GPUs as well as multiple eGPU? \r\n\r\nMy testing on my rMBP indicates the answer is no - and that temperature, battery, being plugged in to power, automatic graphics settings and app support and perhaps even some MLModel  architecture heuristic all play a role in device placement.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d love some answers!\r\n\r\n***Longer with context:***\r\n\r\nIm curious if there is any public documentation on CoreML&#39;s device selection heuristic. With the addition of 10.15&#39;s CoreML `preferredMetalDevice` API for `MLModelConfig`, I imagined it would be possible to force the `MTLDevice` an `MLModel` / Vision request runs on.\r\n\r\nIn my testing with integrated, discrete and eGPU on my 2018 rMBP with Vega 20, it appears only the eGPU consistently runs the CoreML model when requested.\r\n\r\nMy CoreML Model is a pipeline model consisting of a MobileNet classifier with multiple outputs (multi head classifiers attached to a custom feature extractor).\r\n\r\nIm curious to understand device selection preference for a few reasons:\r\n\r\na) I&#39;d like to ensure my `MLModel` is fed images `CIImages` backed by `MTLTextures` local to the device inference will be run on, to limit PCI transfers and keep processing on a single GPU device\r\n\r\nb) My model is actually fed frames of video, and WWDC &#39;19 / 10.15 introduces VideoToolbox and AVFoundation API&#39;s to help force particular video encoders and decoders on specific GPUs.\r\n\r\nIn theory, if all works well, I should be able to specify the same `MTLDevice` for video decode, preprocessing, CoreML/Vision inference, and subsequent encoding - keeping all `IOSurface` backed `CVPixelBuffers`, `CVMetalTextureRefs`, `MPSImages` and friends resident on the same GPU.\r\n\r\nApple has a Pro Apps WWDC video suggesting this is the path forward to fast path Multi GPU support / Afterburner decoder support moving forward.\r\n\r\nDoes `CoreML` ***ACTUALLY*** allow suggested device placement to work?\r\n\r\nI am running a retina MacBook Pro 2018 with Vega 20 GPU, and trying various methods to get the Vega 20 to light up.\r\n\r\n* Disabling automatic graphics switching\r\n* Disabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to False\r\n* Disabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to True\r\n* Enabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to False\r\n* Enabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to True\r\n\r\n* having a full battery and plugged into my Apple power adaptor\r\n* having full battery and plugged into my eGPU \r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\n* I can reliably get the eGPU to run inference on my `MLModel` if I use `MLModelConfig` with `preferredMetalDevice` - every time.\r\n\r\n* I can fairly reliably get the integrated GPU to run inference if I request it - but on occasion with some configurations of battery power, being plugged in, or automatic graphics switching options it doesn&#39;t run.\r\n\r\n* I cannot reliably get the discrete GPU to run consistently on any above combination of configurations - but do see that all of my resources are resident on the GPU (textures etc), and see that CoreML is configured to run there. It just doesn&#39;t report any activity.\r\n\r\nI have configured my info.plist to have the proper eGPU support, and can hot plug / detect device changes and dispatch work to eGPUs, and also support detecting device removal requests. That all works.

(In contrast, your first code block is a function **declaration**, not an expression, so no semicolon after it.) It&#39;s the same situation as with a traditional function expression:\r\n\r\n    const add = function(a, b) {\r\n      const sum = a + b;\r\n      return sum;\r\n    }; // &lt;== Note\r\n\r\nNaturally, ASI applies as it does in JavaScript generally, so you&#39;ll *usually* be okay leaving it off and letting ASI supply it. (I prefer to be explicit and put them in.) I say *usually* because if the next line starts with a `(` or a `[` or a backtick, ASI won&#39;t add the semi for you, because it thinks that&#39;s still part of the expression. (That&#39;s why people who rely on ASI put a `;` at the beginning of lines that would otherwise start with one of those characters.)\r\n\r\nFor what it&#39;s worth, [my answer discussing the various forms of functions in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22173438/157247) has all required semicolons *(I hope!)*, and no extra ones *(I hope!)*, so if you want examples...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437769/es6-fat-arrow-functions-should-semicolons-be-used-at-the-end/58437787#58437787","title":"ES6 Fat-Arrow Functions: Should semicolons be used at the end?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":9598207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOUJ9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Death Waltz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9598207/death-waltz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571333007,"creation_date":1571333007,"answer_id":58437814,"question_id":58437769,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58437814","body_markdown":"Yes, you should.

Which is fine in this example since your client is sending a null terminator, but that is not a good idea for your server to rely on in general.

to python. I have a directory with &gt;1000 text files. Each file has anywhere between 1 and 1000 lines in it. I want to write a simple python script that opens and reads each file in the directory, counts the number of lines, and only copies the file if it is less than or equal to 500 lines. I would like the copy to preserve the original file name, but add an _c before the extension (ie foo.txt is copied to foo_c.txt only if foo.txt had &lt;= 500 lines in it). Searching around it seems I&#39;ll need to use glob and shutil, but can&#39;t seem to get it name my output properly:\r\n\r\n    import os\r\n    import sys\r\n    import glob\r\n    import shutil\r\n    \r\n    list_of_files = glob.glob(&#39;./path/to/directory/*.txt&#39;) \r\n    \r\n    for fileName in list_of_files:\r\n           with open(fileName) as i:\r\n                   count = sum(1 for _ in i)\r\n                   if count &lt;= 500:\r\n                           shutil.copyfile(fileName, fileName + &quot;_c&quot;)\r\n                           print(&quot;copying &quot; + fileName)\r\n                   else:\r\n                           pass\r\n\r\nIt runs on a test set of data, however it names the output *.txt_c instead of *_c.txt.

Prolog is parsing your input as a literal; if that fails due to a syntax issue, nothing else is going to happen. Also, to engage the DCG system, you have to use `phrase/2`, and you aren&#39;t, so even when you pass things to `isFloat/2` it&#39;s going to just hand them directly to `float/1`.\r\n\r\nAlso, be aware that DCGs don&#39;t magically return what they&#39;ve parsed. If your DCG rule has nothing before the arrow, nothing is going to come back from `phrase/2` for you to use. So the code you have here is _accepting_ floats (or does with the changes below) but it does not really _parse_ the floats from a string into an actual float representation.\r\n\r\nTo actually invoke your code would look something like this:\r\n\r\n    phrase(float, `+12.234`).\r\n\r\nThis won&#39;t succeed for a few reasons, the plainest being that your `digit//0` rule does not do what you think it does. It actually expects _exactly_ the list of digits from 0 to 9. What you want to do there is probably something more like this:\r\n\r\n    digit --&gt; &quot;0&quot; | &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; | &quot;4&quot; | &quot;5&quot; | &quot;6&quot; | &quot;7&quot; | &quot;8&quot; | &quot;9&quot;.\r\n    \r\nOnce you have that, you may be able to parse &quot;number&quot;. But you make a similar mistake in `sign//0`, because comma in Prolog means **and**, not **or**. The fixed code looks like this:\r\n\r\n    sign --&gt; &quot;&quot; | &quot;+&quot; | &quot;-&quot;.\r\n    float --&gt; sign, number, &quot;.&quot;, number.\r\n    number --&gt; digit.\r\n    number --&gt; digit, number.\r\n    \r\n    digit --&gt; &quot;0&quot; | &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; | &quot;4&quot; | &quot;5&quot; | &quot;6&quot; | &quot;7&quot; | &quot;8&quot; | &quot;9&quot;.\r\n    \r\nAnd using it looks like this:\r\n\r\n    ?- phrase(float, `-923.23`).\r\n    true\r\n\r\nNote that now you get the parse failures you&#39;re expecting:\r\n\r\n    ?- phrase(float, `-923..23`).\r\n    false.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not give you back the float. You&#39;ll have to do more work to achieve that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437719/prolog-dcg-sytnax-error-operator-expected/58457147#58457147","title":"Prolog DCG Sytnax Error: Operator Expected"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10659157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-B_Z0zjUbTmA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB9U/vch1ABqRa0Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jesse Sainz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10659157/jesse-sainz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10659157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-B_Z0zjUbTmA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB9U/vch1ABqRa0Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jesse Sainz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10659157/jesse-sainz"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571427274,"creation_date":1571332541,"last_edit_date":1571332873,"question_id":58437719,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58437719","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to learn prolog DCGs by creating a program that will recognize a valid floating point number.

1;\r\n                sum += helper(map, currString);\r\n                map[character] = map[character] + 1;\r\n                console.log(&#39;completed string: &#39;, currString);\r\n                currString = &#39;&#39;;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return sum;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have found other solutions that I have edited to print out out all the sequences, and it prints correct, for example this c# solution:\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nBut can&#39;t determine the difference between the solutions that is causing the sequences to print correctly.\r\n\r\nHow can I print out every string sequence for this problem?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-tile-possibilities/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vR0vH.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxaVH.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmAXD.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437869/display-all-letter-tile-possibilities","title":"display all Letter Tile Possibilities"},{"tags":["swift"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1571334291,"post_id":58438013,"comment_id":103216120,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437867/how-do-i-access-a-value-which-is-inside-a-nested-dictionary-which-is-inside-a-js/58438013#comment103216120_58438013"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":7625199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wFbfHSC6b5A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACNs/_ZYHL3xS2_k/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jalp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7625199/jalp"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571333831,"creation_date":1571333831,"answer_id":58438013,"question_id":58437867,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58438013","body_markdown":"Fixed it by having two structs \r\n\r\nResponse and Product ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437867/how-do-i-access-a-value-which-is-inside-a-nested-dictionary-which-is-inside-a-js/58438013#58438013","title":"How do I access a value which is inside a nested dictionary which is inside a JSON object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":7625199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wFbfHSC6b5A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACNs/_ZYHL3xS2_k/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jalp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7625199/jalp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7,"user_id":7625199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wFbfHSC6b5A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACNs/_ZYHL3xS2_k/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jalp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7625199/jalp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571333831,"creation_date":1571333256,"last_edit_date":1571333721,"question_id":58437867,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58437867","body_markdown":"So I am using JSONSerialization to get data from here : https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/737628064502.json\r\n\r\nIt returns a JSON object which has key:value pairs\r\n\r\nSee this :(https://i.imgur.com/cZC99fK.png)\r\n\r\nThe value I want to access belongs to the key product_name which belongs inside product \r\n\r\nSee this : (https://i.imgur.com/1IEcVAO.png)\r\n\r\nHere is my code : \r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct Item : Decodable {\r\n    let product_name : String\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NetworkManager : ObservableObject {\r\n    var didChange = PassthroughSubject&lt;NetworkManager, Never&gt;()\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    var items = [Item]() {\r\n        didSet {\r\n            didChange.send(self)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    init() {\r\n        guard let url = URL(string : &quot;https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/737628064502.json&quot;) else { return }\r\n        \r\n        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in\r\n           \r\n            guard let data = data else { return }\r\n            //print(&quot;Data is : \\(data) &quot;)\r\n            \r\n            let json = try!

The `scriptPath` attribute on the user&#39;s AD account. If this was set, you would see a `ScriptPath` property from `Get-ADUser -Identity $User -Properties *`. If you don&#39;t, that means it is not set.\r\n2. Group Policy applied to the user (via the domain or OU).\r\n3. Group Policy applied to the computer they have logged into (via the domain or OU).\r\n\r\nGetting this info from group policy isn&#39;t easy. Multiple group policies can apply, so you have to mix them all together to see what the actual policies are that would be applied. You can use [`Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicy`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/get-gpresultantsetofpolicy?view=win10-ps) to do this. You give it a user and/or a computer and it will show you all the policies that would be applied.\r\n\r\nHowever, it only supports outputting the results to a file in XML or HTML format. It cannot give you an object that you can examine in-memory. So if you wanted to, you would have to read the file back and parse the information (XML might be easier for that). And it is also very slow.\r\n\r\nIf you are running this on the computer where the user in question is logged in, you can use [`gpresult`][1], which seems to run faster (but still not fast). You can save XML or HTML to file, or output to the console, but the console/HTML output is meant to be human readable, not machine readable, so it would be hard to parse.

I&#39;ve seen some examples but when implementing them in they seem to never work for me. Here&#39;s my code so far (I just cut out some noted text because it isn&#39;t needed) : \r\n```\r\nfrom PyQt5 import QtWidgets, uic,QtCore\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore import Qt,QObject,QThread,pyqtSignal,QCoreApplication,QPoint\r\nimport PyQt5.QtCore\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication,QPushButton,QVBoxLayout,QWidget,QFormLayout,QGridLayout,QLabel,QDialog,QHBoxLayout,QDesktopWidget\r\n\r\nclass LoginWindow(QWidget):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.App = QtWidgets.QApplication([])\r\n        self.LoadedApp = uic.loadUi(&quot;LoginWindow2.ui&quot;)\r\n\r\n        self.LoadedApp.setWindowFlags(Qt.FramelessWindowHint)\r\n\r\n        self.pressing = False\r\n        self.start = QPoint(0, 0)\r\n        self.center()\r\n        self.oldPos = self.LoadedApp.pos()\r\n        self.LoadedApp.show()\r\n        self.App.exec()\r\n\r\n    def mouseReleaseEvent(self, QMouseEvent):\r\n        self.pressing = False\r\n\r\n    def mousePressEvent(self, event):\r\n        self.oldPos = event.globalPos()\r\n\r\n    def mouseMoveEvent(self, event):\r\n        print(&quot;1&quot;)\r\n        delta = QPoint (event.globalPos() - self.oldPos)\r\n        #print(delta)\r\n        self.move(self.x() + delta.x(), self.y() + delta.y())\r\n        self.oldPos = event.globalPos()\r\n\r\n    def center(self):\r\n        qr = self.LoadedApp.frameGeometry()\r\n        cp = QDesktopWidget().availableGeometry().center()\r\n        qr.moveCenter(cp)\r\n        self.LoadedApp.move(qr.topLeft())\r\n\r\nLoginWindow = LoginWindow()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the mouse move event seems to not be connecting to the pyqt5 mouse event. I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s supposed to connect when the function within the class has a specific function name or something like that? It&#39;s quite confusing and my login window seems to not budge. This mouse event thing is very confusing and I tried like two other methods but I ended up deleting the implementation since it made no sense to me.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the download link for the UI : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516367579598684184/634439342940487680/LoginWindow2.ui\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s what the UI looks like (With the hierarchy on the left focused on the bar QLabel widget) : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516367579598684184/634439663557541918/unknown.png\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to get the top bar to be drag-able, not the whole window just the top bar only. Any help?\r\nIf you need additional information, or have questions to what I&#39;m trying to do please ask me and I&#39;ll reply to them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437830/pyqt5-mouse-event-not-working-for-my-custom-tab-bar","title":"Pyqt5 mouse event not working for my custom tab

The token contains several claims, but when I try to access them through `User.Claims` the resulting list is always empty.\r\n\r\nIn my `Startup.cs` I have the authentication setup like so:\r\n\r\n    public class Startup\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t// Code removed for clarity //\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tservices.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n                .AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\toptions.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters\r\n    \t\t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateIssuer = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateAudience = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateLifetime = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidIssuer = JwtManager.Issuer,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tValidAudience = &quot;MyAudience&quot;,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tIssuerSigningKey = &quot;MySigningKey&quot;\r\n    \t\t\t\t};\r\n    \t\t\t});\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn Core 2.2 I was able to access my claims using code similar to the following: \r\n\r\n    [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]\r\n    public class MyController : Controller\r\n    {\r\n    \t[HttpGet(&quot;MyController/Action&quot;)]\r\n    \tpublic ActionResult&lt;Aggregate[]&gt; GetAction()\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tvar username = User.FindFirstValue(&quot;MyUsernameClaim&quot;);\r\n    \t\tif (username == null)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\treturn Forbid();\r\n    \t\t}\t\t\r\n    \t\t// Do Stuff //\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, when I migrate the same code to Core 3.0, I authenticate properly, but I get no claims for the `User` object. \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nDid I miss a step in converting this to 3.0?

How does it decide if it should run on integrated, discrete or CPU? Can one *reliably* &#39;force&#39; one path? How does this change for systems like the new Mac Pro with multiple discrete GPUs as well as multiple eGPU? \r\n\r\nMy testing on my rMBP indicates the answer is no - and that temperature, battery, being plugged in to power, automatic graphics settings and app support and perhaps even some MLModel  architecture heuristic all play a role in device placement.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d love some answers!\r\n\r\n***Longer with context:***\r\n\r\nIm curious if there is any public documentation on CoreML&#39;s device selection heuristic. With the addition of 10.15&#39;s CoreML `preferredMetalDevice` API for `MLModelConfig`, I imagined it would be possible to force the `MTLDevice` an `MLModel` / Vision request runs on.\r\n\r\nIn my testing with integrated, discrete and eGPU on my 2018 rMBP with Vega 20, it appears only the eGPU consistently runs the CoreML model when requested.\r\n\r\nMy CoreML Model is a pipeline model consisting of a MobileNet classifier with multiple outputs (multi head classifiers attached to a custom feature extractor).\r\n\r\nIm curious to understand device selection preference for a few reasons:\r\n\r\na) I&#39;d like to ensure my `MLModel` is fed images `CIImages` backed by `MTLTextures` local to the device inference will be run on, to limit PCI transfers and keep processing on a single GPU device\r\n\r\nb) My model is actually fed frames of video, and WWDC &#39;19 / 10.15 introduces VideoToolbox and AVFoundation API&#39;s to help force particular video encoders and decoders on specific GPUs.\r\n\r\nIn theory, if all works well, I should be able to specify the same `MTLDevice` for video decode, preprocessing, CoreML/Vision inference, and subsequent encoding - keeping all `IOSurface` backed `CVPixelBuffers`, `CVMetalTextureRefs`, `MPSImages` and friends resident on the same GPU.\r\n\r\nApple has a Pro Apps WWDC video suggesting this is the path forward to fast path Multi GPU support / Afterburner decoder support moving forward.\r\n\r\nDoes `CoreML` ***ACTUALLY*** allow suggested device placement to work?\r\n\r\nI am running a retina MacBook Pro 2018 with Vega 20 GPU, and trying various methods to get the Vega 20 to light up.\r\n\r\n* Disabling automatic graphics switching\r\n* Disabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to False\r\n* Disabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to True\r\n* Enabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to False\r\n* Enabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to True\r\n\r\n* having a full battery and plugged into my Apple power adaptor\r\n* having full battery and plugged into my eGPU \r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\n* I can reliably get the eGPU to run inference on my `MLModel` if I use `MLModelConfig` with `preferredMetalDevice` - every time.\r\n\r\n* I can fairly reliably get the integrated GPU to run inference if I request it - but on occasion with some configurations of battery power, being plugged in, or automatic graphics switching options it doesn&#39;t run.\r\n\r\n* I cannot reliably get the discrete GPU to run consistently on any above combination of configurations - but do see that all of my resources are resident on the GPU (textures etc), and see that CoreML is configured to run there. It just doesn&#39;t report any activity.\r\n\r\nI have configured my info.plist to have the proper eGPU support, and can hot plug / detect device changes and dispatch work to eGPUs, and also support detecting device removal requests. That all works.

(In contrast, your first code block is a function **declaration**, not an expression, so no semicolon after it.) It&#39;s the same situation as with a traditional function expression:\r\n\r\n    const add = function(a, b) {\r\n      const sum = a + b;\r\n      return sum;\r\n    }; // &lt;== Note\r\n\r\nNaturally, ASI applies as it does in JavaScript generally, so you&#39;ll *usually* be okay leaving it off and letting ASI supply it. (I prefer to be explicit and put them in.) I say *usually* because if the next line starts with a `(` or a `[` or a backtick, ASI won&#39;t add the semi for you, because it thinks that&#39;s still part of the expression. (That&#39;s why people who rely on ASI put a `;` at the beginning of lines that would otherwise start with one of those characters.)\r\n\r\nFor what it&#39;s worth, [my answer discussing the various forms of functions in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22173438/157247) has all required semicolons *(I hope!)*, and no extra ones *(I hope!)*, so if you want examples...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437769/es6-fat-arrow-functions-should-semicolons-be-used-at-the-end/58437787#58437787","title":"ES6 Fat-Arrow Functions: Should semicolons be used at the end?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":9598207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOUJ9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Death Waltz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9598207/death-waltz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571333007,"creation_date":1571333007,"answer_id":58437814,"question_id":58437769,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58437814","body_markdown":"Yes, you should.

Which is fine in this example since your client is sending a null terminator, but that is not a good idea for your server to rely on in general.

to python. I have a directory with &gt;1000 text files. Each file has anywhere between 1 and 1000 lines in it. I want to write a simple python script that opens and reads each file in the directory, counts the number of lines, and only copies the file if it is less than or equal to 500 lines. I would like the copy to preserve the original file name, but add an _c before the extension (ie foo.txt is copied to foo_c.txt only if foo.txt had &lt;= 500 lines in it). Searching around it seems I&#39;ll need to use glob and shutil, but can&#39;t seem to get it name my output properly:\r\n\r\n    import os\r\n    import sys\r\n    import glob\r\n    import shutil\r\n    \r\n    list_of_files = glob.glob(&#39;./path/to/directory/*.txt&#39;) \r\n    \r\n    for fileName in list_of_files:\r\n           with open(fileName) as i:\r\n                   count = sum(1 for _ in i)\r\n                   if count &lt;= 500:\r\n                           shutil.copyfile(fileName, fileName + &quot;_c&quot;)\r\n                           print(&quot;copying &quot; + fileName)\r\n                   else:\r\n                           pass\r\n\r\nIt runs on a test set of data, however it names the output *.txt_c instead of *_c.txt.

Prolog is parsing your input as a literal; if that fails due to a syntax issue, nothing else is going to happen. Also, to engage the DCG system, you have to use `phrase/2`, and you aren&#39;t, so even when you pass things to `isFloat/2` it&#39;s going to just hand them directly to `float/1`.\r\n\r\nAlso, be aware that DCGs don&#39;t magically return what they&#39;ve parsed. If your DCG rule has nothing before the arrow, nothing is going to come back from `phrase/2` for you to use. So the code you have here is _accepting_ floats (or does with the changes below) but it does not really _parse_ the floats from a string into an actual float representation.\r\n\r\nTo actually invoke your code would look something like this:\r\n\r\n    phrase(float, `+12.234`).\r\n\r\nThis won&#39;t succeed for a few reasons, the plainest being that your `digit//0` rule does not do what you think it does. It actually expects _exactly_ the list of digits from 0 to 9. What you want to do there is probably something more like this:\r\n\r\n    digit --&gt; &quot;0&quot; | &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; | &quot;4&quot; | &quot;5&quot; | &quot;6&quot; | &quot;7&quot; | &quot;8&quot; | &quot;9&quot;.\r\n    \r\nOnce you have that, you may be able to parse &quot;number&quot;. But you make a similar mistake in `sign//0`, because comma in Prolog means **and**, not **or**. The fixed code looks like this:\r\n\r\n    sign --&gt; &quot;&quot; | &quot;+&quot; | &quot;-&quot;.\r\n    float --&gt; sign, number, &quot;.&quot;, number.\r\n    number --&gt; digit.\r\n    number --&gt; digit, number.\r\n    \r\n    digit --&gt; &quot;0&quot; | &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; | &quot;4&quot; | &quot;5&quot; | &quot;6&quot; | &quot;7&quot; | &quot;8&quot; | &quot;9&quot;.\r\n    \r\nAnd using it looks like this:\r\n\r\n    ?- phrase(float, `-923.23`).\r\n    true\r\n\r\nNote that now you get the parse failures you&#39;re expecting:\r\n\r\n    ?- phrase(float, `-923..23`).\r\n    false.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not give you back the float. You&#39;ll have to do more work to achieve that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58437719/prolog-dcg-sytnax-error-operator-expected/58457147#58457147","title":"Prolog DCG Sytnax Error: Operator Expected"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10659157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-B_Z0zjUbTmA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB9U/vch1ABqRa0Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jesse Sainz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10659157/jesse-sainz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10659157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-B_Z0zjUbTmA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB9U/vch1ABqRa0Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jesse Sainz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10659157/jesse-sainz"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571427274,"creation_date":1571332541,"last_edit_date":1571332873,"question_id":58437719,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58437719","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to learn prolog DCGs by creating a program that will recognize a valid floating point number.
