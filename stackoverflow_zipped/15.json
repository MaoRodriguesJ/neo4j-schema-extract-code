But before send datas to server it&#39;s need to be check datas are valid or not.\r\n\r\nIf data isn&#39;t valid, the communication to the server will not happen.\r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  save(data: T): Observable&lt;boolean&gt; {\r\n    const preparedData = JSON.stringify(data.prepareToSave());\r\n\r\n    if (!data.isValid) {\r\n      // if data is invalid we should return before send datas to server\r\n      return new Observable&lt;T&gt;().pipe(map(() =&gt; false));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (!data.id) {\r\n      // create\r\n      return this.http.post(this.url, preparedData, this.options)\r\n        .pipe(map(() =&gt; true));\r\n    } else {\r\n      // update\r\n      return this.http.put(this.url + &#39;/&#39; + data.id, preparedData, this.options)\r\n        .pipe(map(() =&gt; true));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nNow if the `data` isn&#39;t valid I need to return an `Observable&lt;boolean&gt;` with `false`.\r\n\r\nIn the component I have this code:\r\n```typescript\r\n  saveDatas() {\r\n    this.dataService.save(this.customer).subscribe( (resolve: boolean) =&gt; {\r\n      if (resolve) {\r\n        // save OK\r\n      } else {\r\n        // save failed (1)\r\n      }\r\n    }, (error: any) =&gt; {\r\n      // save failed (2)\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIf the save fails because of `this.customer.isValid` is `false` then I expect `subscribe` will get `false` from dataService.

The logs of the grandchild are buffered until the command ends.\r\n\r\nMy code looks something like the following\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst command = spawn(COMMAND, [...ARGS, &#39;--&#39;, ...restFlags], {\r\n  stdio: &#39;inherit&#39;,\r\n});\r\n\r\ncommand.on(&#39;exit&#39;, code =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(&#39;Process exited with code &#39; + code.toString());\r\n});\r\n\r\ncommand.on(&#39;message&#39;, data =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(data);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`COMMAND` ends up calling an npm script with the `restFlags` argument (hence the &#39;--&#39; flag to separate the arguments to forward to the npm script). It&#39;s the output of this npm script which is getting buffered.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529028/node-js-stream-data-from-grandchild-process","title":"Node.js - Stream data from

two lists, say A = [1, 3, 2, 7] and B = [2, 3, 6, 3]\r\n\r\nFind set of all products that can be formed by multiplying a number in A with a number in B. (By set, I mean I do not want duplicates). I looking for the fastest running time possible. **Hash functions are not allowed**.\r\n\r\nFirst approach would be brute force, where the we multiple every number from A with every number in B and if we find a product that is not already in the list, then add it to the list. Finding all possible products will cost ```O(n^2)``` and to verify if the product is already present in the list, it will cost me ```O(n^2)```. So the total comes to ```O(n^4)```.\r\n\r\nI am looking to optimize this solution. First thing that comes to my mind is to remove duplicates in list B. In my example, I have 3 as a duplicate. I do not need to compute the product of all elements from A with the duplicate 3 again. But this doesn&#39;t still help reducing the overall runtime though.\r\n\r\nI am guessing the fastest possible run time can be ```O(n^2)``` if all the numbers in A and B combined are unique AND prime. That way it is guaranteed that there will be no duplicates and I do not need to verify if my product is already present in the list. So I am thinking if we can pre-process our input list such that it will guarantee unique product values (One way to pre-process is to remove duplicates in list B like I mentioned above).\r\n\r\nIs this possible in ```O(n^2)``` time and will it make a difference if I only care about the number of unique possible products instead of the actual products?\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor i = 1 to A.length:\r\n    for j = 1 to B.length:\r\n        if (A[i] * B[j]) not already present in list: \\\\ takes O(n^2) time to verify this\r\n            Add (A[i] * B[j]) to list\r\n        end if\r\n    end for\r\nend for\r\n\r\nprint list\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected result for the above input: 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 4, 12, 14, 21, 42\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n====\r\nI can think of a ```O(n^2 log n)``` solution:\r\n\r\n1) I generate all possible product values without worrying about duplicates \\\\ This is ```O(n^2)```\r\n\r\n2) Sort these product values \\\\ this will be ```O(n^2 log n)``` because we have n^2 numbers to sort\r\n\r\n3) Remove the duplicates in linear time since the elements are now sorted","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529026/finding-set-of-products-formed-by-two-lists","title":"Finding set of products formed by two lists"},{"tags":["r","date","replace","tidyr","na"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":478520,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571855464,"post_id":58529024,"comment_id":103382076,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529024/tidyr-replace-na-doesnt-seem-to-work-on-date-vectors#comment103382076_58529024"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478520,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571855542,"creation_date":1571855542,"answer_id":58529062,"question_id":58529024,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58529062","body_markdown":"The `&quot;Not applicable&quot;` is `character` and we are trying to change the `NA` in the `Date` class with a `character`.

Right now, control doesn&#39;t return back to me until all 100 processes have completed execution, even if a match was found very early on. Is there a way I could signal from one of the child processes that it has succeeded so that the parent process can terminate all spawned processes and remove any pending processes in the queue?\r\n\r\n2. If that is possible, I would like to ensure that if that parent process was itself spawned, a child process experiencing success would not kill the parent&#39;s sibling process&#39;s child processes as well. In this example, I have kept `a` and `feature` constant. I would like to expand this solution so I can have both `a` and `b` as lists. In that case, for each `a`, I would spawn a child process to process a single `a` against all possible `b`s, which in turn should spawn grand-children that would process a single `a` against a single `b`. Every time I find a match between an `a` and a `b`, I would like to terminate all grand-children for the child process that was processing a single `a` against all possible `b`s.\r\n\r\nIf someone can guide me in the right direction, or even a library that gets this done for me, I would be really grateful. =)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nAsim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529014/python-multiprocessing-spawning-children-and-killing-all-children-when-exit-c","title":"Python Multiprocessing :: Spawning children and killing all children when exit criteria met"},{"tags":["python","numpy","counter"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8225766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2985b1a75732aab584e3020ae653c2e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DIB98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8225766/dib98"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571863573,"post_id":58529822,"comment_id":103385375,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529013/how-can-i-fix-this-counter-i-wrote-used-to-find-the-number-of-blocked-calls/58529822#comment103385375_58529822"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8225766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2985b1a75732aab584e3020ae653c2e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DIB98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8225766/dib98"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571866241,"post_id":58529822,"comment_id":103386266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529013/how-can-i-fix-this-counter-i-wrote-used-to-find-the-number-of-blocked-calls/58529822#comment103386266_58529822"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2049,"user_id":11610186,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HKHsybo6y0o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdY2OjHwdlmaUkMBZsmKiCkkybzQw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Grzegorz Skibinski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11610186/grzegorz-skibinski"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571859089,"creation_date":1571859089,"answer_id":58529822,"question_id":58529013,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58529822","body_markdown":"Ok, so your problem here is, that you take ANY ```endTime``` value, which happens on given minute as a sign of freeing a channel.

=&gt; {\r\n            // Starts process in background which executes startMaster function\r\n        }\r\n        _ =&gt; println!(&quot;Not valid argument&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Ends program but now there is an active daemon \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529008/is-there-a-way-to-execute-a-rust-function-in-an-independent-process","title":"Is there a way to execute a Rust function in an independent process?"},{"tags":["javascript","json","filter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1267,"user_id":1836461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHYf4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"computercarguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836461/computercarguy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571855694,"post_id":58529007,"comment_id":103382160,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529007/filter-json-object-to-string-array-by-key-value#comment103382160_58529007"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":620,"user_id":2132230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/247c0ea21dcbf6fd84c5e21a34cb0b18?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sanya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2132230/sanya"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571855662,"post_id":58529081,"comment_id":103382144,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529007/filter-json-object-to-string-array-by-key-value/58529081#comment103382144_58529081"},{"owner":{"reputation":2608,"user_id":2666042,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1374514750/picture?type=large","display_name":"Arnold Gandarillas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2666042/arnold-gandarillas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":620,"user_id":2132230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/247c0ea21dcbf6fd84c5e21a34cb0b18?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sanya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2132230/sanya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571855779,"post_id":58529081,"comment_id":103382197,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529007/filter-json-object-to-string-array-by-key-value/58529081#comment103382197_58529081"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2608,"user_id":2666042,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1374514750/picture?type=large","display_name":"Arnold Gandarillas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2666042/arnold-gandarillas"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571855602,"creation_date":1571855602,"answer_id":58529081,"question_id":58529007,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58529081","body_markdown":"You can use `map` instead of `filter`\r\n\r\n    const items = [\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Fruits&quot;,\r\n        &quot;objects&quot;: \r\n        [\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Apples&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:35},\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bananas&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:48},\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Oranges&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:12}\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Vegetables&quot;,\r\n        &quot;objects&quot;: \r\n        [\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Celery&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:255},\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Potatos&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:105},\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Carrots&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:483},\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Peas&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:350}\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Meats&quot;,\r\n        &quot;objects&quot;: \r\n        [\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Lamb&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:255},\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Chicken&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:545},\r\n          {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Beef&quot;, &quot;qty&quot;:13}\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    const types = items.map(item =&gt;

Trying to wrap my head around the various types of aggregation, as well as the best ways to store the data.\r\n\r\nWhen the query runs, I have some variable attributes that I would like to aggregate and then return as filters to the user. For example, one character may have attributes for &quot;size&quot;, &quot;shape&quot; and &quot;colour&quot;, while another only has &quot;shape&quot; and &quot;colour&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe full list of attributes is unknown so I don&#39;t think I would be able to construct the query that way.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy data is currently structured like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    id : 1,\r\n    title : &#39;New Character 1&#39;,\r\n    group : 1,\r\n    region : 1,\r\n    attrs : [\r\n        moves : 2,\r\n\r\n        # These would be dynamic, would only apply to some rows, not others.\r\n        var_colours : [&#39;Blue&#39;, Green&#39;, &#39;Red&#39;],\r\n        var_shapes : [&#39;Round&#39;, &#39;Square&#39;, &#39;Etc&#39;],\r\n        \r\n        effects : [\r\n            { id : 1, value: 20},\r\n            { id : 2, value: 60},\r\n            { id : 3, value: 10},\r\n        ]\r\n        \r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI currently have an aggregation of groups and regions that looks like this. It seems to be working wonderfully and I would like to add something similar for the attributes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    &#39;aggs&#39; =&gt; [\r\n        &#39;group_ids&#39; =&gt; [\r\n            &#39;terms&#39; =&gt; [\r\n                &#39;field&#39; =&gt; &#39;group&#39;,\r\n                &#39;order&#39; =&gt; [ &#39;_count&#39; =&gt; &#39;desc&#39; ]\r\n            ]\r\n        ],\r\n        &#39;region_ids&#39; =&gt; [\r\n            &#39;terms&#39; =&gt; [\r\n                &#39;field&#39; =&gt; &#39;region&#39;,\r\n                &#39;order&#39; =&gt; [ &#39;_count&#39; =&gt; &#39;desc&#39; ]\r\n            ]\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m hoping to get a result that looks like the below.

of the situation, building an assembler with a pre-made assembly language.

Using functions in structs, I insert, update, delete records in these three tables across many view controllers. I inserted records in the first table (employee table). I get console print confirmation messages and the data populates in other table views confirming insertion of employee data (For View Controller display, I move these table records to an array of dictionaries). As I work through QA testing of other areas of application, I find that the employee table view shows blank for employee records. I did breakpoints to debug the issue. The while loop I use in query function comes out without data which I just created a few hours ago. \r\n\r\nMy SQLLite database gets created with a message \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Successfully opened connection to database at\r\n&gt; /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/BB0FB403-7D26-4837-8BCF-97C23D195717/Documents/MyDatabaseNameHere.sqlite&quot;\r\n\r\nSince I lost data, I end up creating database again. Every time I do this, I noticed the location changes, like \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Successfully opened new database at\r\n&gt; /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/CE3F0D84-ED0C-40A2-823A-39E2B8C972BE/Documents/MyDatabaseNameHere.sqlite&quot;\r\n\r\nSo I used `FileManager` classes to trap the location and use it. In spite of this, I still loose data.\r\n\r\nI did lot of research on this. The Database seems to be in documents directory in iPhone which is what I think is expected (and not in bundle).

For example:\r\n\r\n    $ read foo\r\n    ! &quot; # $ % &amp; &#39; ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ [  ] ^ _ `                  { | }    ~  \r\n    $ echo &quot;$foo&quot; | cat -A\r\n    ! &quot; # $ % &amp; &#39; ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ [  ] ^ _ `^I^I^I{ | }    ~$\r\n    $ \r\n\r\nWhy does it work like this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528908/why-does-variable-expansion-in-bash-keep-the-literal-values-of-special-character","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"Why does variable expansion in Bash keep the literal values of special characters when variable is quoted?"},{"tags":["c","pointers"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":150,"user_id":8842262,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1baccf9211f521d4bd0cf02bef8ce31?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Miradil Zeynalli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8842262/miradil-zeynalli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571855121,"post_id":58528906,"comment_id":103381949,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528906/comparing-pointers-and-its-only-comparing-the-first-part#comment103381949_58528906"},{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":9500206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Enrique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9500206/enrique"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":150,"user_id":8842262,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1baccf9211f521d4bd0cf02bef8ce31?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Miradil Zeynalli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8842262/miradil-zeynalli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571855439,"post_id":58528906,"comment_id":103382065,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528906/comparing-pointers-and-its-only-comparing-the-first-part#comment103382065_58528906"},{"owner":{"reputation":150,"user_id":8842262,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1baccf9211f521d4bd0cf02bef8ce31?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Miradil Zeynalli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8842262/miradil-zeynalli"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571855553,"post_id":58528906,"comment_id":103382105,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528906/comparing-pointers-and-its-only-comparing-the-first-part#comment103382105_58528906"},{"owner":{"reputation":183,"user_id":3926793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c312ad7229c8846527e9b0523f5f8545?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Larry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3926793/larry"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571855586,"post_id":58528906,"comment_id":103382121,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528906/comparing-pointers-and-its-only-comparing-the-first-part#comment103382121_58528906"},{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":9500206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Enrique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9500206/enrique"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571862946,"post_id":58528906,"comment_id":103385096,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528906/comparing-pointers-and-its-only-comparing-the-first-part#comment103385096_58528906"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":9500206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Enrique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9500206/enrique"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571865428,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571854931,"creation_date":1571854931,"question_id":58528906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528906","body_markdown":"I&#39;m having an issue with pointer comparison it is only comparing the first set of bytes in my pointers. \r\n\r\nlength = Length of the pattern of bytes. \r\n&lt;br&gt;pattern = a pointer to the byte pattern being searched for.&lt;/br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;address = a pointer pointed to the a table of bytes&lt;/br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;i = is being iterated&lt;/br&gt;\r\n\r\nFor example if pattern = 2C 3B its counting all 2C options within address.

Anyway, it says:  `Invalid syntax for integer : &#171;  &#187;`\r\nAt the line 2743 we found:\r\n\r\n    ...000205&quot;|&quot;&quot;|&quot;XY...\r\n\r\nWhich is a `NULL` value, but I cannot found how to properly setup `COPY` command switch to make postgresql ingest those files.\r\n\r\nThe documentation says:\r\n\r\n&gt; `NULL`\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt; Specifies the string that represents a null value. The default is \\N (backslash-N) in text format, and an unquoted empty string in\r\n&gt; CSV format. You might prefer an empty string even in text format for\r\n&gt; cases where you don&#39;t want to distinguish nulls from empty strings.\r\n&gt; This option is not allowed when using binary format.\r\n\r\nI am aware that I can clean the file by changing `...|&quot;&quot;|...` to `...||...` using `sed` or some regexp/replace operations. This will solve my problem, I have checked it.\r\n\r\nWhat I am wondering: is it possible to bear it with postgresql, after all this is perfectly valid CSV format. \r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nReading the [following post][2] as suggested, I wrote: \r\n\r\n    COPY test.large\r\n    FROM &#39;/path/to/big.file&#39;\r\n    WITH (\r\n            FORMAT CSV,\r\n            HEADER,\r\n            DELIMITER &#39;|&#39;,\r\n            QUOTE &#39;&quot;&#39;,\r\n            NULL &#39;&#39;,\r\n            FORCE_NULL appid\r\n        );\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\n    ERREUR:  l&#39;argument de l&#39;option &#171; force_null &#187; doit &#234;tre une liste de noms de colonnes\r\n\r\nWhich translates to `force_null must be a list of column names`.
