This would serve as a type of robustness check for my research design, which uses a difference-in-regression discontinuity design (diff-in-diff with regression discontinuity).

I&#39;m quite new to econometrics and so I&#39;m not sure about the steps needed to implement this, especially in R.\r\n\r\nThe outcome variable is `y` (deforestation rate), the running variable is `dist` (relative distance to a border of interest), the treatment variable is `SFP` (dummy, 1 if treated, 0 if not treated) and the timing of treatment variable is `Period` (dummy, 1 if observation is after year of treatment, 0 if observation is before year of treatment). I am clustering my standard errors on a variable called `cluster`. \r\n\r\nThe main estimation equation that I used in R (using the estimatr package) is \r\n```\r\nlm_robust(y ~ dist*SFP*Period, data=panel, cluster=cluster, se_type=&quot;stata&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then created an event variable (`event`) that equals 0 in the year of treatment, and -1 in the year before the treatment, -2 two years before the treatment, and so on. \r\n\r\nHow do I get a chart that looks something like this in R? : https://twitter.com/CdeChaisemartin/status/1125827070267838464\r\n\r\nIn theory, it seems I should run a regression with the `event` variable but how do I collect the coefficients for each event value?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971437/event-study-in-r-as-robustness-check-for-difference-in-regression-discontinuity","title":"Event study in R as robustness check for difference-in-regression discontinuity design"},{"tags":["javascript","google-chrome-extension","google-api","inboxsdk"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12078500,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kaU6Ns63b9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rerwePfnii8OVpm0qlY0PZDVHvzZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ivan Vukman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078500/ivan-vukman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568714652,"post_id":57971714,"comment_id":102353849,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971435/where-and-how-can-i-get-account-id-to-be-used-with-chrome-identity-getauthtoken/57971714#comment102353849_57971714"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11760250,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ENrR96GhB2o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIo/PHlfEIzmjJw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ben Klingeler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11760250/ben-klingeler"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12078500,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kaU6Ns63b9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rerwePfnii8OVpm0qlY0PZDVHvzZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ivan Vukman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078500/ivan-vukman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568719054,"post_id":57971714,"comment_id":102356058,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971435/where-and-how-can-i-get-account-id-to-be-used-with-chrome-identity-getauthtoken/57971714#comment102356058_57971714"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11760250,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ENrR96GhB2o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIo/PHlfEIzmjJw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ben Klingeler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11760250/ben-klingeler"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568713887,"creation_date":1568713887,"answer_id":57971714,"question_id":57971435,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57971714","body_markdown":"If I saw it right, you dont have to enter an account-id.

And it&#39;s easy to make a mess, as you say.\r\n\r\n- You can think of modules as a very similar concept to classes, in that they are _namespaces_. There is no real OO vs non-OO dichotomy here.\r\n\r\n- It&#39;s also possible to put the module in a package, do whatever makes the module the most readable (forget underscores), maybe split the module into several, and then import only the functions that should be used from the outside into the package&#39;s `__init__.py` file. Then they can be imported directly from there, and nothing else can.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the distinction between &quot;main&quot; and &quot;aux&quot; functions: only those meant to be used from outside the module are &quot;main&quot;.\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971433/good-style-for-self-commenting-code-without-oop/57971657#57971657","title":"Good style for self commenting code without OOP"}],"owner":{"reputation":1505,"user_id":3475946,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/364b5e22e11170570a92e067d6f9098f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3475946/michael"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1568743536,"accepted_answer_id":57971657,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568713724,"creation_date":1568712959,"question_id":57971433,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971433","body_markdown":"On the one hand, a framework bumps me to use functions rather than classes. It doesn&#39;t matter which framework it is.\r\nOn the other hand a self commenting code should be subdivided into a short subprograms with descriptive names.\r\n\r\nThis means that for a single function that can be reused we have to write several functions just for our code to be readable.\r\n\r\nIn case of using OOP it is not a problem at all. We organise a class and create private method in it (marked _ in front in case of Python).\r\n\r\nBut if we don&#39;t use OOP, these auxiliary functions are spread all over the module. They are much more numerous than functions that can be reused. And one can even get lost in them and forget that a function for this particular purpose already exists\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    def combine(str1, str2):\r\n        return &quot;{}_{}&quot;.format(str1, str2)\r\n    \r\n    def get_salted_str(str):\r\n        SALT = &quot;slkdjghslkdjfghsldfghaaasd&quot;\r\n        return combine(str, SALT)\r\n    \r\n\r\n    def get_salted_string(str):    \r\n        return combine(str, get_salted_str(str))\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def get_salted_peppered_string(str):\r\n        salted_str = get_salted_str(str)\r\n        PEPPER = &quot;1234128712908369735619346&quot;\r\n    \r\n        return &quot;{}_{}&quot;.format(PEPPER, salted_str)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the example there are two main functions: get_salted_string and get_salted_peppered_string.  They can be imported and reused. Everything else is just auxiliary functions. This is a fake example, don&#39;t be overenthusiastic about criticizing it.\r\n\r\nAs for the style: how can one distinguish between main and aux functions? If there are a lot of aux functions, everything becomes a mess. \r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n1) Is it better to use underline symbol to mark unimported functions? Like this: _get_salted_str. Or how can we mark aux functions?\r\n2). Is there any style guide mentioning solutions to this problem?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971433/good-style-for-self-commenting-code-without-oop","closed_reason":"primarily

are two main performance problems with your query:\r\n\r\n 1. The use of `LIKE &#39;%%&#39;`, which will be slow, as it will require a table / index scan for each table referenced.\r\n 2. The use of `OR` in the `WHERE` clause.\r\n\r\nSolutions:\r\n\r\nFor `LIKE &#39;%%&#39;` type of searches I would recommend that you setup a [`FULLTEXT INDEX`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/search/full-text-search?view=sql-server-2017).\r\nIt is not hard to setup, especially for only a few tables and it will practically eliminate performance problems with `LIKE` searches.\r\n\r\nThe `OR` condition is a little trickier as I believe you may have a subtle bug in your current query, depending on the relationships between CTable and others.

**of both blocks at all time**.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I can not set `isTriggerA` and `isTriggerB` to false at the beginning my code, I need to return true if nothing is selected too.\r\n\r\nHow can I fix this?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971385/why-does-my-javascript-constructor-return-default-property-value-instead-of-the","title":"Why does my JavaScript constructor return default property value instead of the modified one?"},{"tags":["flutter","dart","flutter-layout"],"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":11999529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5bb2de6d0a6d2f2c6313d31576d14cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Developer ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11999529/developer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568712779,"creation_date":1568712779,"question_id":57971383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971383","body_markdown":"I am implementing chewie video player with ads on back button of the player. by implementing Material App widget to MyApp class video player works perfectly but ads disappears, on the other hand when i remove Material App from a MyApp screen ads works perfectly but video player do not dispose on back button.\r\n\r\n    //import &#39;package:chewie_tutorial/chewie_list_item.dart&#39;;\r\n    import &#39;package:flutter/material.dart&#39;;\r\n    import &#39;package:flutter/services.dart&#39;;\r\n    import &#39;chewie_list_item.dart&#39;;\r\n    import &#39;package:firebase_admob/firebase_admob.dart&#39;;\r\n    import &#39;package:video_player/video_player.dart&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\r\n          @override\r\n          Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n            Orientatoin();\r\n            return MaterialApp(\r\n              home: MYHomePage(),\r\n            );\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        int counter=0;\r\n        class MYHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\r\n        \r\n          static final MobileAdTargetingInfo targetingInfo = MobileAdTargetingInfo(\r\n            keywords: [&#39;Games&#39;, &#39;Puzzles&#39;],\r\n          );\r\n        \r\n          BannerAd bannerAd;\r\n          InterstitialAd interstitialAd;\r\n          RewardedVideoAd rewardedVideoAd;\r\n        \r\n          BannerAd buildBanner() {\r\n            return BannerAd(\r\n                adUnitId: BannerAd.testAdUnitId,\r\n                size: AdSize.banner,\r\n                listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {\r\n                  print(event);\r\n                });\r\n          }\r\n        \r\n          InterstitialAd buildInterstitial() {\r\n            return InterstitialAd(\r\n                adUnitId: InterstitialAd.testAdUnitId,\r\n                targetingInfo: targetingInfo,\r\n                listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {\r\n                  if (event == MobileAdEvent.failedToLoad) {\r\n                    interstitialAd..load();\r\n                  } else if (event == MobileAdEvent.closed) {\r\n                    interstitialAd = buildInterstitial()..load();\r\n                  }\r\n                  print(event);\r\n                });\r\n          }\r\n        \r\n          @override\r\n          Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n            FirebaseAdMob.instance.initialize(appId: FirebaseAdMob.testAppId);\r\n            bannerAd = buildBanner()..load();\r\n            interstitialAd = buildInterstitial()..load();\r\n        \r\n            Future&lt;bool&gt;

This program communicates with the already windows service.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous examples, also here on stackoverflow that will help you how to create and start a windows service and how to communicate with a running service.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971382/how-to-start-the-service-at-backgroundwhen-application-is-not-running/57971566#57971566","title":"How to start the service at background(when application is not running)?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11935061,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/013ab0fe50724513ded34b96af73e6d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mohsen Rezaii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11935061/mohsen-rezaii"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11935061,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/013ab0fe50724513ded34b96af73e6d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mohsen Rezaii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11935061/mohsen-rezaii"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568720232,"answer_count":3,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568713420,"creation_date":1568712773,"last_edit_date":1568713420,"question_id":57971382,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971382","body_markdown":"Hello i have an application working with window service and i want to start its **service** at background, i mean even when the application is not running the service should run at a specific time for example: start(9am) and then stop the service at (6pm). \r\nDo you have any idea ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance !","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971382/how-to-start-the-service-at-backgroundwhen-application-is-not-running","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"How to start the service at background(when application is not running)?"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":90996,"user_id":3962914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGgv6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ronak Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3962914/ronak-shah"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568713879,"post_id":57971381,"comment_id":102353424,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971381/creating-intervals-of-5-seconds-for-data-and-grouping-them#comment102353424_57971381"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":90996,"user_id":3962914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGgv6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ronak Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3962914/ronak-shah"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568713712,"creation_date":1568713712,"answer_id":57971651,"question_id":57971381,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57971651","body_markdown":"We can convert the `Time` column to `POSIXct` format and `cut` it into intervals of &quot;5 secs&quot;

This is the meaning of `bare`, you have a bare repository without working tree.\r\n\r\n---\r\n&gt; I can push all my changes\r\n\r\nThe bare repository contains all your branches, tags, notes, etc. The &quot;data&quot; is stored in the Objects folder along with the pack&#39;s file.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NOdLj.png\r\n\r\n---\r\n&gt; `git checkout master` fails on the remote machine with the message `fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree`.\r\n\r\nAs explained above - in a brea repository you don&#39;t have worktree so you cant checkout content.\r\n\r\n---\r\n###What can you do?\r\n\r\nGit support several transfers protocol for connecting between repositories.

avoid the error you can test first whether the `deferredPrompt` variable is initialised and skip the code logic if undefined:\r\n\r\n    if (deferredPrompt) {\r\n    \r\n      deferredPrompt.prompt();\r\n    \r\n     // ... \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen, is the `beforeinstallprompt` event triggered? &lt;br&gt;\r\nIf so, you have to proof if the `event` object is defined, as you use it to initialise your variable:\r\n\r\n    deferredPrompt = e;\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that you need a running `service worker` in order to let the `beforeinstallprompt` event being triggered. And the service worker needs a secure connection (https) or running localhost and served via web server.\r\n\r\nYou can open Chrome Dev Tools (F12) and access the &quot;Application&quot; tab to verify that a web manifest is correctly set and a service worker is installed.\r\n\r\nI wrote some articles about [service workers, caching strategies and PWAs][1] if you are interested in deepening the topic.\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n**UPDATE**&lt;br&gt;\r\nIf you want to serve content offline, you have to implement caching strategies for your service worker (eg. Stale while revalidate). Following the link above you can learn about different strategies and how you can implement them.\r\n\r\nWhen you implement caching strategies, all the static assets (like css or js files) or data requests will be intercept by the service worker and if there is a match with the given rules, it will cache them or provide them from the cache. Since the cache is on the client side, those resources are available also offline.\r\n\r\nAs example, to cache static assets:\r\n\r\n    self.addEventListener(&#39;install&#39;, function(event) {\r\n      event.waitUntil(\r\n        caches.open(cacheName).then(function(cache) {\r\n          return cache.addAll(\r\n            [\r\n              &#39;/css/bootstrap.css&#39;,\r\n              &#39;/css/main.css&#39;,\r\n              &#39;/js/bootstrap.min.js&#39;,\r\n              &#39;/js/jquery.min.js&#39;,\r\n              &#39;/offline.html&#39;\r\n              // Add anything else you need to be cached during the SW install\r\n            ]\r\n          );\r\n        })\r\n      );\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dev.to/paco_ita/service-workers-and-caching-strategies-explained-step-3-m4f","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971322/pwa-prompt-add-to-home-screen-dosent-show/57972371#57972371","title":"pwa - prompt add to home screen dosen&#39;t show"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11798046,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0adb5dbc2f3657bdedbf9c443588dd1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dev2019","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11798046/dev2019"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3698,"user_id":706293,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45cce6f7e7eb45177e8018bd7aa9bee7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Francesco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/706293/francesco"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":84,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57972371,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569235613,"creation_date":1568712582,"last_edit_date":1568715822,"question_id":57971322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971322","body_markdown":"I develop a web application with symfony 4.3, then I add pwa features to it.

But later, `${{ }}` can give you the value of the variable `EnvironmentCode`. \r\n\r\nIn fact, while you change to use `${{ }}`, it just accessing the variable you predefined in the YAML files instead of the one you defined with UI. Just see this doc: [Variable templates][1].\r\n\r\nFor the variable you defined with UI, it can be get and used with the format `$()`(Note: `${{ }}` is the format of get the variables which defined in YAML file). But also, there some things you need to pay attention is for the variables you defined in UI, it can only be get/accessed after the build begin to run, because the variable which defined with UI exists in environment only after the build compiled begin. In one word, they are the **agent-scope variable**. That&#39;s why the value it used is still the one that&#39;s on the pipeline definition instead of on the UI.\r\n\r\n&gt; If you remove from the pipeline definition the default value or the\r\n&gt; variable entirely the expression ${{variables.EnvironmentCode}} will\r\n&gt; return an empty string assuming the filename to be vars..yml which\r\n&gt; doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nAs the document defined and I mentioned before, `${{}}` is format which used to get the value of variable which defined in YAML files rather than the one which defined using UI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the steps of job, the variable that defined in the UI or defined in the YAML file can all be get/accessed with the format `$()`. Still, for the variable which defined in the YAML file can also get with `${{variables.xxxx}}`. But at this time, if the variable name which defined in YAML file is **same** with the one defined with UI, the server can only get the one defined in YAML file. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=example#variable-templates","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971311/using-variables-expansion-to-load-a-template-variables-file-per-environment/57988538#57988538","title":"Using variables expansion to load a template variables file per environment"}],"owner":{"reputation":348,"user_id":4162418,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yHgtC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lusocoding","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4162418/lusocoding"},"last_editor":{"reputation":348,"user_id":4162418,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yHgtC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lusocoding","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4162418/lusocoding"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568796075,"creation_date":1568712538,"last_edit_date":1568715744,"question_id":57971311,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971311","body_markdown":"I&#39;m attempting to create multiple pipelines in Azure DevOps but I would like to reuse the same pipeline YAML file with the differences per environment being loaded from a separate template variables file. \r\n\r\nFor that purpose I&#39;ve created two variable files, which are located in the same folder as the pipeline definition:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# vars.dev.yml\r\nvariables:\r\n  - name: EnvironmentName\r\n    value: Development\r\n\r\n# vars.prd.yml\r\nvariables:\r\n  - name: EnvironmentName\r\n    value: Production\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the definition of the pipeline is the following:\r\n```yaml\r\ntrigger: none\r\npr: none\r\n\r\nvariables:\r\n  - name: EnvironmentCode\r\n    value: dev\r\n  - name: EnvironmentFileName\r\n    value: vars.$(&#39;EnvironmentCode&#39;).yml\r\n\r\nstages:\r\n  - stage: LoadVariablesPerEnvironment\r\n    displayName: Load Variables Per Environment\r\n    variables:\r\n      - template: $(EnvironmentFileName)\r\n    jobs:\r\n      - job: ShowcaseLoadedVariables\r\n        steps:\r\n          - pwsh: Write-Host &quot;Variables have been loaded for the &#39;$ENV:ENVIRONMENTNAME&#39; environment&quot;\r\n            displayName: Output Environment Variables\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter importing the pipelines using the Azure DevOps UI, I can go to settings of each and set the Environment Code variable to whatever desired environment code:\r\n\r\n[![azure pipeline variables settings][1]][1]\r\n\r\nHowever I&#39;m always getting the same error when I try to run the pipeline, regardless of the code I fill in the variable value:\r\n\r\n[![azure pipeline run error][2]][2]\r\n\r\nSo the question here is: Is this kind of variable expansion not supported or is there a different way that I should use to accomplish this?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ji1dg.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/R95c2.png\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nI was able to expand the variables using another method. The new version of the pipeline is as such:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nvariables:\r\n  - name: EnvironmentCode\r\n    value: dev\r\n  - name: EnvironmentFileName\r\n    value: vars.${{ variables.EnvironmentCode }}.yml\r\n\r\nstages:\r\n  - stage: LoadVariablesPerEnvironment\r\n    displayName: Load Variables Per Environment\r\n    variables:\r\n      - template: ${{ variables.EnvironmentFileName }}\r\n    jobs:\r\n      - job: ShowcaseLoadedVariables\r\n        steps:\r\n          - pwsh: Write-Host &quot;Variables have been loaded for the &#39;$ENV:ENVIRONMENTNAME&#39; environment&quot;\r\n            displayName: Output Environment Variables\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever there is yet the issue of loading different files. I made different attempts and verified the following:\r\n\r\n - If you give a different environment code using the UI, when running\r\n   the pipeline, the value it assumes is still the one that&#39;s on the\r\n   pipeline definition; \r\n\r\n - If you remove from the pipeline definition the\r\n   default value or the variable entirely the expression\r\n   ```${{variables.EnvironmentCode}}``` will return an empty string\r\n   assuming the filename to be ```vars..yml``` which doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971311/using-variables-expansion-to-load-a-template-variables-file-per-environment","title":"Using variables expansion to load a template

Instead of applying the second animation, wrap your `start = true` in a `withAnimation()` call, like so:\r\n\r\n    struct WelcomeView: View {\r\n\r\n        @State var start: Bool = false\r\n\r\n        var body: some View {\r\n            VStack {\r\n                // This is just here to toggle start variable\r\n                Button(&quot;Toggle&quot;, action: {\r\n                    withAnimation(Animation.easeOut(duration: 0.5).delay(0.4)) {\r\n                        self.start.toggle()\r\n                    }\r\n                })\r\n\r\n                GeometryReader { g in\r\n                    Button(action: {}) {\r\n                        Text(&quot;New Account&quot;)\r\n                    }\r\n                    .buttonStyle(fillCircular(width: g.size.width - (24 * 2)))\r\n                    .offset(y: self.start ?

//with or without this, the same.\r\ndropArea.dispatchEvent(evtDrop);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe goal is to put some files in the dropArea and let the host page process it with someMethod().\r\nBut I was given an error:\r\n**&quot;Cannot read property &#39;files&#39; of undefined&quot;**\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t figure out why this isn&#39;t work, please give me your advice.\r\nThanks in

Replacing one of those functions with `main()` is even worse, because `main()` is a special function that you really are not allowed to call yourself.\r\n\r\nInstead do something like this:\r\n````\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tchar choice;\r\n\tbool running = true;\r\n\r\n\twhile (running)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;a = add a student, p = print the student list, e = exit function&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; choice;\r\n\r\n\t\tswitch (choice) {\r\n\t\tcase &#39;a&#39;:\r\n\t\t\tadding();\r\n\t\t\tbreak;\r\n\t\tcase &#39;p&#39;:\r\n\t\t\tprint();\r\n\t\t\tbreak;\r\n\t\tcase &#39;e&#39;:\r\n\t\t\t// end(); Dunno what this does. Is it just an empty function that will finally end the infinite stack of calls?\r\n\t\t\t// I am replacing it with setting the loop variable to false, which will stop the loop\r\n\t\t\trunning = false;\r\n\t\t\tbreak;\r\n\t\tdefault:\r\n\t\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;That is not a valid option.&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tbreak;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n````\r\nThen remove all calls to `main()` from the rest of your code.\r\n\r\nAs for your `print()` function, again your problem is the lack of loops. Your current code opens the file, reads the first line, prints the line, then closes the file and calls main. Then the next time `print()` is called it again opens the file, reads the first line, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat you need is a loop that reads all the lines before closing the file again. Something like this should do the trick:\r\n````\r\nvoid print()\r\n{\r\n\tifstream inFS;\r\n\tinFS.open(&quot;myoutfile.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\n\tstring name;\r\n\tint amount;\r\n\tint grades;\r\n\twhile (inFS &gt;&gt; name &gt;&gt; amount &gt;&gt; grades)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; amount &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; grades &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tinFS.close();\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nHowever, all of this is pretty basic C++ that should have been covered in whatever book you are using to learn C++. And if you do not have a C++ book to learn from, then I strongly recommend that you get one - it will be only get harder to learn if you constantly get stuck on basic stuff.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971233/ifstream-only-printing-first-line-in-array/57971753#57971753","title":"ifstream only printing first line in array"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12078603,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1cf8b56c96b179797edc01f6e71a0334?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jaakko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078603/jaakko"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568716042,"creation_date":1568712239,"question_id":57971233,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971233","body_markdown":"```\r\n\r\n\r\nvoid adding();\r\nvoid print();\r\nvoid end();\r\n\r\nint counter = 0;\r\n\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tchar choice;\r\n\r\n\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;a = add a student, p = print the student list, e = exit function&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\tcin &gt;&gt; choice;\r\n\r\n\tswitch (choice) {\r\n\tcase &#39;a&#39;:\r\n\t\tadding();\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\tcase &#39;p&#39;:\r\n\t\tprint();\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\tcase &#39;e&#39;:\r\n\t\tend();\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\tdefault:\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;That is not a valid option.&quot;;\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid adding()\r\n{\r\n\tofstream outFS;\r\n\toutFS.open(&quot;myoutfile.txt&quot;, fstream::app);\r\n\tint i = 0;\r\n\tstring name[100]; string amount[100]; string grades[100];\r\n\tfor (i = 0; i &lt; 1; i++) {\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;What is the name of the student?&quot;;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; name[i];\r\n\r\n\t\toutFS &lt;&lt; name[0] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39;;\r\n\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;How many exercises has the student completed?&quot;;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; amount[i];\r\n\r\n\t\toutFS &lt;&lt; amount[0] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39;;\r\n\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;What grade did the student get?&quot;;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; grades[i];\r\n\r\n\t\toutFS &lt;&lt; grades[0] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39;;\r\n\t\tcounter++;\r\n\t}\r\n\toutFS.close();\r\n\r\n\tmain();\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid print()\r\n{\r\n\r\n\t\tifstream inFS;\r\n\t\tinFS.open(&quot;myoutfile.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tstring name;\r\n\t\t\tinFS &gt;&gt; name;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tint amount;\r\n\t\t\tinFS &gt;&gt; amount;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tint grades;\r\n\t\t\tinFS &gt;&gt; grades;\r\n\t\t\tinFS.close();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tcout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; amount &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; grades &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\r\n\tmain();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when I use the &quot;adding&quot; function it works fine and adds it to the file.

Again the above code includes the username/password which initially gets me the token.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971201/how-to-ensure-token-is-valid-using-httpwebrequest-or-get-current-token","title":"How to ensure token is valid using HttpWebRequest or get current token"},{"tags":["ada"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12793,"user_id":347964,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d1f429c039a3850e5680a2e249147e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flyx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/347964/flyx"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568713501,"post_id":57971198,"comment_id":102353218,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971198/why-dont-prefixed-calls-work-on-access-types#comment102353218_57971198"},{"owner":{"reputation":799,"user_id":4589618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/27ce43bdffa815840636cc5142c701ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeffrey R.

You would probably want a [reentrant scanner][2], as well, although I suppose you could kludge something together with a default scanner, using flex&#39;s buffer stack. Indeed, it&#39;s worth learning how to build reentrant parsers and scanners on the general principle of avoiding unnecessary globals, whether or not you need them for this particular purpose.\r\n\r\nBut you don&#39;t really need to reparse anything; you can do the entire parse in one pass. You just need enough smarts in your scanner so that it knows about nested interpolations.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to let the scanner split the string literal with interpolations into a series of tokens, which can easily be assembled into an appropriate AST by the parser. Since the scanner may return more than one token out of a single string literal, we&#39;ll need to introduce a [start condition][3] to keep track of whether the scan is currently inside a string literal or not. And since interpolations can, presumably, be nested we&#39;ll use flex&#39;s optional [start condition stack][4], enabled with `%option stack`, to keep track of the nested contexts.\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s a rough sketch.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the scanner has extra start conditions: `SC_PROGRAM`, the default, which is in effect while the scanner is scanning regular program text, and `SC_STRING`, in effect while the scanner is scanning a string. `SC_PROGRAM` is only needed because flex does not provide an official interface to check whether the start condition stack is empty; aside from nesting, it is identical to the `INITIAL` top-level start condition. The start condition stack is used to keep track of interpolation markers (`[` and `]` in this example), and it is needed because an interpolated expression might use brackets (as array subscripts, for example) or might even include a nested interpolated string. Since `SC_PROGRAM` is, with one exception, identical to `INITIAL`, we&#39;ll make it an inclusive rule.\r\n\r\n    %option stack\r\n    %s SC_PROGRAM\r\n    %x SC_STRING\r\n    %%\r\n\r\nSince we&#39;re using a separate start condition to analyse string literals, we can also normalise escape sequences as we parse. Not all applications will want to do this, but it&#39;s pretty common. But since that&#39;s not really the point of this answer, I&#39;ve left out most of the details. More interesting is the way that embedded interpolation expressions are handled, particularly deeply nested ones.\r\n\r\nThe end result will be to turn string literals into a series of tokens, possibly representing a nested structure. In order to avoid actually parsing in the scanner, we don&#39;t make any attempt to create AST nodes or otherwise rewrite the string literal; instead, we just pass the quote characters themselves through to the parser, delimiting the sequence of string literal pieces:\r\n\r\n    [&quot;]                 { yy_push_state(SC_STRING);    return &#39;&quot;&#39;; }\r\n    &lt;SC_STRING&gt;[&quot;]      { yy_pop_state();              return &#39;&quot;&#39;; }\r\n\r\nA very similar set of rules is used for interpolation markers:\r\n\r\n    &lt;*&gt;&quot;[&quot;              { yy_push_state(SC_PROGRAM);   return &#39;[&#39;; }\r\n    &lt;INITIAL&gt;&quot;]&quot;        {                              return &#39;]&#39;; }\r\n    &lt;*&gt;&quot;]&quot;              { yy_pop_state();              return &#39;]&#39;; } \r\n\r\nThe second rule above avoids popping the start condition stack if it is empty (as it will be in the `INITIAL` state). It&#39;s not necessary to issue an error message in the scanner; we can just pass the unmatched close bracket through to the parser, which will then do whatever error recovery seems necessary.\r\n\r\nTo finish off the `SC_STRING` state, we need to return tokens for pieces of the string, possibly including escape sequences:\r\n\r\n    &lt;SC_STRING&gt;{\r\n      [^[\\\\&quot;]+          { yylval.str = strdup(yytext); return T_STRING; }\r\n    \r\n      \\\\n               { yylval.chr = &#39;\\n&#39;;           return T_CHAR; }\r\n      \\\\t               { yylval.chr = &#39;\\t&#39;;           return T_CHAR; }\r\n              /* ... Etc. */\r\n      \\\\x[[:xdigit]]{2} { yylval.chr = strtoul(yytext, NULL, 16);\r\n                                                   return T_CHAR; }\r\n      \\\\.               { yylval.chr = yytext[1];      return T_CHAR; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nReturning escaped characters like that to the parser is probably not the best strategy; normally I would use an internal scanner buffer to accumulate the entire string. But it was simple for illustrative purposes. (Some error handling is omitted here; there are various corner cases, including newline handling and the annoying case where the last character in the program is a backslash inside an unterminated string literal.)\r\n\r\nIn the parser, we just need to insert a concatenation node for interpolated strings. The only complication is that we don&#39;t want to insert such a node for the common case of a string literal without any interpolations, so we use two syntax productions, one for a string with exactly one contained piece, and one for a string with two or more pieces:\r\n\r\n    string : &#39;&quot;&#39; piece &#39;&quot;&#39;                 { $$ = $2; }\r\n           | &#39;&quot;&#39; piece piece_list &#39;&quot;&#39;      { $$ = make_concat_node(\r\n                                                    prepend_to_list($2, $3));\r\n                                           }\r\n    piece  : T_STRING                      { $$ = make_literal_node($1); }  \r\n           | &#39;[&#39; expr &#39;]&#39;                  { $$ = $2; }\r\n    piece_list\r\n           : piece                         { $$ = new_list($1); }\r\n           | piece_list piece              { $$ = append_to_list($1, $2); }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#index-reentrant-parser\r\n  [2]: http://westes.github.io/flex/manual/Reentrant.html\r\n  [3]: http://westes.github.io/flex/manual/Start-Conditions.html\r\n  [4]: http://westes.github.io/flex/manual/Start-Conditions.html#index-start-conditions_002c-use-of-a-stack\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971191/implementing-string-interpolation-in-flex-bison/57987454#57987454","title":"Implementing String Interpolation in Flex/Bison"}],"owner":{"reputation":14649,"user_id":1270812,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmoZ6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dr.Kameleon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1270812/dr-kameleon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14649,"user_id":1270812,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmoZ6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dr.Kameleon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1270812/dr-kameleon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":92,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57987454,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568792329,"creation_date":1568712099,"last_edit_date":1568713952,"question_id":57971191,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971191","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently writing an interpreter for a language I have designed.\r\n\r\nThe lexer/parser (GLR) is written in Flex/Bison and the main interpreter in D - and everything working flawlessly so far.\r\n\r\nThe thing is I want to also add string interpolation, that is identify string literals that contain a specific pattern (e.g. `&quot;[some expression]&quot;`) and convert the included expression.
