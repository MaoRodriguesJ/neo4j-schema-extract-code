So far I have a function that evaluates a board and returns a score. I have a function that returns a rose tree of all possible moves (and moves for those moves) etc... to a given depth. I can find the leaves of that tree and give them a value based of my heuristic and my question is what do I do after that? \r\n\r\nDo I somehow edit the parent of the leaves and assign the parent node a new value based on the children&#39;s value and keep going until I get to the root node?\r\n\r\nAm I meant to create a new tree from the leaves up, picking the min / max value until i get to the root node? If so, how does the new tree remember all the moves needed to get to the leaves?\r\n\r\n\r\nI only want to use imports from the standard library (I don&#39;t want to have to download a package). Any suggestions would be great, been struggling with this for a few days. \r\nThanks\r\n\r\n----\r\nI tried to pick out some parts of my code to give examples but there&#39;s just a lot of functions tangled together. If it helps at all here are the type signatures for the main functions and an explanation of what they do:\r\n\r\nThis function takes in an `Int` (representing `Depth` of tree),  a `Game` (current state of board), list of immediate possible moves and returns a rose tree with each possible move (and moves to those moves) and a score associated with that move. If player is Dark its score is positive, if player is dark its score is negative - each depth in the rose tree is the next players move.\r\n\r\n    roseTreeAtDepthN :: Int-&gt; Game -&gt; [Position] -&gt; [Rose (Position,score)]\r\n\r\nFor example: `treeAtDepthN 2 initialGame [(2,3),(3,2),(4,5),(5,4)]` returns : \r\n\r\n    [Rose ((2,3),4) [Rose ((2,2),-3) [],Rose ((2,4),-3) [],Rose ((4,2),-3) []],\r\n     Rose ((3,2),4) [Rose ((2,2),-3) [],Rose ((2,4),-3) [],Rose ((4,2),-3) []],\r\n     Rose ((4,5),4) [Rose ((3,5),-3) [],Rose ((5,3),-3) [],Rose ((5,5),-3) []],\r\n     Rose ((5,4),4) [Rose ((3,5),-3) [],Rose ((5,3),-3) [],Rose ((5,5),-3) []]]\r\n\r\nI have another function which allows me to get the leaves of a tree. I use the function that evaluates the game state in `treeAtDepthN` for each move  but I realize that probably isn&#39;t necessary and should only be used on the leaves of the tree. I&#39;m not sure if this helps at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*later edit:*\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do next for my minimax algorithm. I have a function that prints all possible moves to a certain depth, I have a heuristic that evaluates those each move, I&#39;m just not sure how I turn it into one function that returns the best move.

This is similar to what the [`compiler explorer`][1] does but I&#39;m still having some trouble with it.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say I want to compile the following code directly to raw assembly, only generating a single function and inlining everything:\r\n\r\n    auto get_address() {\r\n    \tconst auto value = *(int *) 0x1234; // Read the value from address 0x1234\r\n    \treturn reinterpret_cast&lt;int *&gt;(value); // Return it as address\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void perform_write() {\r\n    \tconst auto address = get_address(); // Get the address using the helper function\r\n    \t*address = 1; // Assign a value to the address\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe entry point should be `perform_write()` obviously. My expected output is something like the following:\r\n\r\n    li r9,4660\r\n    li r10,1\r\n    lwz r9,0(r9)\r\n    stw r10,0(r9)\r\n    blr\r\n\r\nNow, if I use the compiler explorer website, [I almost get what I want][2]:\r\n\r\n[![][3]][3]\r\n\r\nThis has the following issues:\r\n\r\n 1. The helper function `get_address()` is generated despite the fact that it is inlined in `perform_write()`. How can I get `GCC` to omit the redundant `get_address()` from the output? Can I mark the `perform_write()` as entry point somehow to accomplish this? I tried using the attribute `__attribute__((always_inline))` but it did nothing (probably since `GCC` already inlines the code by default but does not remove the unused function)\r\n 2. Unimportant: Replacing the `%` signs would be nice even though it does not matter for further compilation to machine code. The `Intel` checkbox is disabled and `%` is usually `AT&amp;T` syntax.\r\n\r\nI want to accomplish these things preferably with compiler flags or by modifying the source code if necessary.

not an issue per se to have `o=COMPANY` as the root entry instead of using a DC.\r\n\r\nYour ldif seems correct, but what is shown here does not contain any user entry (just `id=00000001` and `id=00000002`). \r\n\r\nSo, according to `userDnPatterns(&quot;uid={0},ou=department&quot;)`, user entries should be contained in `ou=department` and thus defined *after* in your ldif file, eg. :\r\n\r\n    # id=00000003\r\n    dn: uid=test,ou=department,o=COMPANY\r\n    objectClass: inetOrgPerson\r\n    objectClass: organizationalPerson\r\n    objectClass: person\r\n    objectClass: top\r\n

I&#39;m using Termux on an Android device, although maybe an answer will apply more generally.\r\n\r\n I&#39;m using python, but any bash would be okay too.\r\n\r\nOn some 2017 devices, the following used to work:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    import subprocess\r\n    result = subprocess.run([&#39;ip&#39;,&#39;link&#39;], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, universal_newlines=True)\r\n    rc,so,

L.startswith(&#39;wlan0&#39;)]\r\n    assert wlanl\r\n    HWadd = re.findall(&#39;link/ether (.*?) &#39;,wlanl[0])[0].lower()\r\n\r\nhowever, this is failing strangely (I cannot get re.split to work as I expect) on a new 2019 device.\r\n\r\nInstead, I now have a nearly equally ungainly alternative that works:\r\n\r\n    import subprocess\r\n    result = subprocess.run([&#39;ip&#39;,&#39;link&#39;], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, universal_newlines=True)\r\n    rc,so, se = result.returncode, result.stdout, result.stderr\r\n    assert not rc\r\n    ipl =  re.findall(&#39;\\n[0-9]+: wlan0:.*?\\n +link/ether ([^\\n]*?) .*?\\n&#39;, so, re.MULTILINE+ re.DOTALL) \r\n    assert ipl\r\n    HWadd = ipl[0].lower()\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a more reliable way to extract this information from the OS somewhere?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, using `termux-wifi-connectioninfo` gives:\r\n\r\n    &quot;mac_address&quot;:

&quot;tv&quot;,\r\n\t\tstyle: { width: 50, fontSize: 40, height: 60, color: &quot;black&quot; }\r\n\t},\r\n]\r\n```\r\nthan in render i added\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;View&gt;\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ta.map(i =&gt; (\r\n\t\t\t&lt;FontAwesome name={i.icon} style={i.style} /&gt;\r\n\t\t))\r\n\t}\r\n\t&lt;View&gt;\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tthis.state.categories.results.map((item, key) =&gt; (\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;View

 if unsure, go with `binary_crossentropy` + `sigmoid`. If most your labels are 0&#39;s or 1&#39;s, or very close to, try `mae` + `hard_sigmoid`.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**EXPLANATION**:\r\n\r\nLoss functions define a model&#39;s priorities; for regression, the goal&#39;s to _minimize deviation_ of predictions from ground truth (labels). With an activation bounded between 0 and 1, MSE will work.\r\n\r\n_However_; it may not be best - in particular, for normalized data. Below is a plot of MSE vs MAE for the [0, 1] interval. Key differences:\r\n\r\n - **MSE** penalizes small differences _much less_ than MAE\r\n - **MSE** penalizes large differences, w.r.t. _its own penalties_ of small values, much more than MAE\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of above:\r\n\r\n - **MSE** --&gt; model is better at not being &#39;very wrong&#39;, but worse at being &#39;very right&#39;\r\n - **MAE** --&gt; model is better at predicting all values on average, but doesn&#39;t mind &#39;very wrong&#39; predictions\r\n\r\nAs far as activations go - _hard sigmoid_ may work better, especially if many of your values are equal to or very close to 0 or 1, as it can equal 0 or 1 (or approach them) a lot quicker than sigmoid can, which should serve as a form of _regularization_, since it _is_ a form of _linearization_ (--&gt; weight decay).\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**Binary crossentropy**: should generally work the best (w/ _sigmoid_)\r\n\r\nIn a sense, it&#39;s the best of both worlds: it&#39;s more &#39;evenly distributed&#39; (over non-asymptotic interval), and strongly penalizes &#39;very wrong&#39; predictions. In fact, BCE is much harsher on such predictions than MSE - so you should rarely if ever see a &quot;0&quot; predicted on a &quot;1&quot; label (except in validation). Just be sure _not_ to use hard sigmoid, for self-evident reasons.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**Autoencoders**: strive to reconstruct their input. Depending on the application, you may:\r\n\r\n1. Need to ensure that _no single prediction bears too much significance_. _Ex_: signal data. A single extremely wrong timestep could outweigh an otherwise excellent overall reconstruction\r\n\r\n2. Have noisy data, and prefer a model more _robust to noise_\r\n\r\nPer both above, especially (1), BCE may be undesirable. By treating all labels more &#39;equally&#39;, MAE may work better for (2).\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n**MSE vs. MAE**: \r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Alxk7.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n**Sigmoid vs. Hard Sigmoid**\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sgb1P.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**Binary crossentropy vs. MSE vs. MAE** (`y == 0` case shown for BCE)\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Onbjx.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463624/which-output-activation-and-loss-should-i-use-if-i-want-to-predict-continuous-ou/58468893#58468893","title":"Which output activation and loss should I use if I want to predict continuous outcome on 0-1 interval?"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":11254837,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/347714ad041decef5f392cef3b50b609?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"pikachu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11254837/pikachu"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58468893,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571531619,"creation_date":1571487632,"question_id":58463624,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58463624","body_markdown":"I want to predict continuous variable (autoencoder).

Now, lets say our db is a MySQL. Going to production we will create a master/slave, cause that is the topology MySQL supports. At some point we will have performance issues, and our bottleneck will turn out to be the master. Why? Because only a master writes and slaves follow. Each change in the db oplog is transmitted to the slaves to be replicated. You can tell the master to only write to it and return success and slaves to update async, but then, your reads will be inconsistent, or you can tell the entire cluster to replicate the write and then return write success response, but that is even more of a performance bottleneck? What did I demonstrate? The trade-offs you must take according to your application needs. It is called the CAP theorem. It states that you can only choose at best 2 of the 3 letters to your advantage in expense of the remaining letters. CAP - Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance.\r\n\r\nNow, going back to SQL/NoSQL.\r\n\r\nSQL databases allow transactions, which is like a contract saying, either commit all of what I gave you or nothing.\r\nA NoSQL database gives you the opportunity to arrange your data in a different way but they do not offer transactions. Instead each of them handles reads/write in a different way. For example, for our chat app, I would choose a really fast write db, like Cassandra (works like an append only log). Cassandra&#39;s nodes are all equal, no master or slave configuration, which means every node accepts reads/writes. That is great, but I still have a problem with the read inconsistency. Well, that problem can be partially addressed with something called a quorum. Basically it means, I prefer more consistent read in my apps DB over availability, which is completely fine and still a heck of a lot faster than MySQL.\r\nCassandras default replication factor, for X nodes, is X. For 3 nodes, replication factor will be 3, which means all of our data will be replicated 3 times and our local quorum (how many nodes must respond to the operation) will be 3/2 + 1 -&gt; 2\r\n```\r\nLOCAL_QUORUM = (replication_factor/2) + 1 \r\n```\r\nSo with 3 nodes, each read/write must pass the coordinator(the node which decides where to send the read/write) + pass 2 nodes defined by the local quorum configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above was just an example attempt with Cassandra, it is a very complicated database, as the subject about databases in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion:\r\n\r\nif you need fast writes + fast reads -&gt; you must make a decision between consistency, high availability and partition tolerance + appropriate db.\r\n\r\nif you dont care about writes and need fast reads -&gt; a db that is fast in reads + consistency\r\n\r\nif you need transactions -&gt; SQL type db\r\n\r\nLast but not least, a lot depends on how you model your data and components intercommunication.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463610/the-sql-vs-nosql-database-for-storing-users-data-from-mobile-sensors-gps-accel/58464027#58464027","title":"The SQL vs NoSQL database for storing users data from mobile sensors (GPS ,accelerometer, etc)"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12242975,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yKwqd-j5t_E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdHkPpsYPHRLgIcGvFzy2EZaftXow/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12242975/michal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571505132,"creation_date":1571487496,"question_id":58463610,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58463610","body_markdown":"im working on project where i need to store data from different types of mobile sensors, smart watches and so on, like GPS, accelerometer, ECG, Heart rate sensor, my task is to store users data at first and  work with them later, im not sure what database i should use.

It does what it is supposed to do (according to the javadoc) reliably.\r\n\r\nHowever, the way that you are using the `trylock` results in a non-thread-safe implementation of `increment` and `decrement`.  If you are going to use `trylock` in that situation, you will need to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        while (!lock.tryLock()) { }  // Try to get the lock until you get it\r\n        counter++;\r\n    } finally {\r\n        lock.unlock();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut that is a bad idea because you are effectively busy-waiting on the lock.  A better solution using a `Lock` would be:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        lock.lock();  // Block until the lock is acquired.\r\n        counter++;\r\n    } finally {\r\n        lock.unlock();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut if you are after a lock-free solution, then you should be using an atomic type:\r\n\r\n  - `java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder` ([javadoc][1]) for Java 8 and later,\r\n  - `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong` ([javadoc][2]) all versions of Java since Java 5 inclusive.\r\n\r\nApparently `LongAdder` performs better if there is a lot of contention:\r\n\r\n  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30691083/how-longadder-performs-better-than-atomiclong\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nNote that thread-safety is actually a difficult concept to define precisely.  You need to start from a behavioral specification of the *correct* behavior of an algorithm.  Then you can say that an implementation of the algorithm.\r\n\r\n&gt; Definition: When the algorithm is correct according to the specification when run on system with one processor, then it is *thread-safe* if it is also *always* correct according to the specification when there are multiple processors.\r\n\r\nFrom this, we see that:\r\n\r\n  - thread-safety is moot if the algorithm doesn&#39;t meet its behavioral specification in the single processor case, and\r\n  - thread-safety is moot if the algorithm cannot use multiple processors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/LongAdder.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicLong.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463597/is-lock-trylock-thread-safe/58469881#58469881","title":"Is lock.tryLock() thread Safe?"}],"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":5161634,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6eqWSw3Vh5s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD8/kclIkVVUVM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sriharsha g.r.v","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5161634/sriharsha-g-r-v"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14998,"user_id":4108590,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qDozH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ravindra Ranwala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4108590/ravindra-ranwala"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571556193,"creation_date":1571487447,"last_edit_date":1571538320,"question_id":58463597,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58463597","body_markdown":"I tried the thread race program with Synchronization,lock.lock() and lock.tryLock(),I found that with synchronization and lock.lock() works fine,but lock.tryLock() itself is not thread safe.This method is not able to acquire the lock and hence giving unexpected results\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0;

working on a set of programs that encrypt data and then decrypt it again (as to create a document that has to be revised by an office). \r\n\r\nI&#39;m using DES for the user data and then i encrypt the DES key using the public key of the office, this part does not generate errors, but when I try to decrypt the key and use it the following error appears:  **javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded.**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve searched for this error but since none of the cases I&#39;ve found are similar to mine, I can&#39;t find what&#39;s wrong.\r\n\r\nHere is the code I use to genereta and encrypt the DES key (the encrypt is done by retrieving the public key from a file):\r\n```java\r\n//create DES key\r\n\r\n        KeyGenerator generadorDES = KeyGenerator.getInstance(&quot;DES&quot;);\r\n\t\tgeneradorDES.init(56);\r\n\t\tSecretKey claveDES = generadorDES.generateKey();\r\n\r\n\r\n//encrypt data with DES key\r\n\r\n        Cipher cifradorDES = Cipher.getInstance(&quot;DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding&quot;);\r\n        cifradorDES.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, claveDES);\r\n\r\n        byte[] bufferDatos = datosJson.getBytes();\r\n\t\tbyte[] datosCifrados = cifradorDES.doFinal(bufferDatos);\r\n\r\n\r\n//encrypt DES key\r\n\r\n        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());  \r\n\r\n        KeyFactory keyFactoryRSA = KeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;RSA&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;);\r\n\r\n        File ficheroClavePublica = new File(args[2] + &quot;.publica&quot;); \r\n\t\tint tamanoFicheroClavePublica = (int) ficheroClavePublica.length();\r\n\t\tbyte[] bufferPub = new byte[tamanoFicheroClavePublica];\r\n\t\tFileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(ficheroClavePublica);\r\n\t\tin.read(bufferPub, 0, tamanoFicheroClavePublica);\r\n\t\tin.close();\r\n\r\n\t\tX509EncodedKeySpec clavePublicaSpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(bufferPub);\r\n\t\tPublicKey clavePublicaOficina = keyFactoryRSA.generatePublic(clavePublicaSpec);\r\n\r\n        Cipher cifradorRSAOficina = Cipher.getInstance(&quot;RSA&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;);\r\n        cifradorRSAOficina.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, clavePublicaOficina);  \r\n        \r\n        byte[] claveDESCifrada = cifradorRSAOficina.doFinal(claveDES.getEncoded());\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I store it with the rest of the data and when it&#39;s the office turn to decrypt this is the code (again, the private key is retrieved by a file):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\n//decrypt DES key\r\n\r\n        File ficheroClavePrivada = new File(args[2] + &quot;.privada&quot;); \r\n\t\tint tamanoFicheroClavePrivada = (int) ficheroClavePrivada.length();\r\n\t\tbyte[] bufferPriv = new byte[tamanoFicheroClavePrivada];\r\n\t\tFileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(ficheroClavePrivada);\r\n\t\tin.read(bufferPriv, 0, tamanoFicheroClavePrivada);\r\n\t\tin.close();\r\n\r\n\t\tPKCS8EncodedKeySpec clavePrivadaSpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(bufferPriv);\r\n        PrivateKey clavePrivadaOficina = keyFactoryRSA.generatePrivate(clavePrivadaSpec);\r\n\r\n        \r\n        Cipher cifradorRSA = Cipher.getInstance(&quot;RSA&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;);\r\n        cifradorRSA.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, clavePrivadaOficina);\r\n        \r\n        byte[] claveSecretaB = cifradorRSA.doFinal(claveDESCifrada);\r\n\r\n        SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactoryDES = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;DES&quot;);\r\n\r\n        DESKeySpec DESspec = new DESKeySpec(claveSecretaB);\r\n\t\tSecretKey claveSecreta = secretKeyFactoryDES.generateSecret(DESspec);\r\n\r\n\r\n//decrypt user data\r\n\r\n        byte[] datosPeregrinoCifrados = paqueteCred.getContenidoBloque(&quot;datosPeregrino&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        Cipher cifradorDES = Cipher.getInstance(&quot;DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding&quot;);\r\n        cifradorDES.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, claveSecreta);\r\n\r\n        byte[] datosPeregrinoDES = cifradorDES.doFinal(datosPeregrinoCifrados);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the error, the exception is in the last line. I think that&#39;s all the relevant code for the execption, and again I&#39;m not sure what could be wrong.

i.e. for example, `df` with `count == 1` would be `df.1` without having to assign it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463584/efficient-method-to-split-dataframe-multiple-times-in-python","title":"Efficient method to split dataframe multiple times in Python?"},{"tags":["c","linux","system-calls"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571488978,"post_id":58463583,"comment_id":103262953,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463583/umask-and-chmod-unexpected-behaviour#comment103262953_58463583"},{"owner":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571489117,"post_id":58463583,"comment_id":103262984,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463583/umask-and-chmod-unexpected-behaviour#comment103262984_58463583"},{"owner":{"reputation":2205,"user_id":12098405,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C7IUyuZ5qqE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rehqQyGdh463Xz2DY8S4TYPhnDvzA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"dash-o","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12098405/dash-o"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571511727,"post_id":58463583,"comment_id":103268599,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463583/umask-and-chmod-unexpected-behaviour#comment103268599_58463583"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11380550,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8oXQd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alexein777","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11380550/alexein777"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571487367,"creation_date":1571487367,"question_id":58463583,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58463583","body_markdown":"I am trying to write simple program that changes file privileges using _umask_ and _chmod_ system-calls, but file privileges do not change as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what I&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n+ Set _umask_ to 0;\r\n+ If the file doesn&#39;t exist, it is created by _open_ system-call using O_CREAT flag, and then privileges are set to _mode_ passed by command-line argument;\r\n+ If the file already exists, change its privileges by _chmod_ system-call.\r\n\r\n```C\r\n#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 700\r\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;errno.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n\r\n#define check_error(expr, userMsg) \\\r\n    do { \\\r\n        if (!(expr)) { \\\r\n            perror(userMsg);

`3fe9000000000000`, the first bit (zero) is the sign bit, so we can ignore that (it&#39;s positive).\r\n\r\nThe next 11 bits are `011.1111.1110` (`3fe`), which is `1022` but that is adjusted down by `1023` to handle negative exponents. It is therefore `-1`, which gives you the multiplier of &lt;code&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or `0.5`.\r\n\r\nThe mantissa bits are `1001000..0` (the `9000..0` of your hex number). Those first four bits equate to the values `0.5`, `0.25`, `0.0125` and `0.0625` (halving each time). Since only the first and fourth bit are set, you get `0.5 + 0.0625 = 0.5625`.\r\n\r\nAdding the implicit `1` to that number, as mandated by IEEE754, you get a base value of `1.5625`. When that&#39;s multiplied by the multiplier calculated earlier, you get:\r\n\r\n    1.5625 x 0.5 = 0.78125\r\n\r\nSo *that&#39;s* how you get your value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFurther detail can be found on the [IEEE754-1985 Wikipedia page][1], and you can experiment with [Harald Schmidt&#39;s excellent online converter][2], a tool so damn useful I built my own copy of it to handle double precision as well (not on the web unfortunately, it was a Java app for the desktop). It really *did* help me a lot in understanding.\r\n\r\nYou might also want to look at [some other answers][3] I&#39;ve given on IEEE754, including, [this one][4] in particular.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRegarding the bit pattern you brought up in a comment, `0x4172f58bc0000000` (which you state *should* be `19880124` but calculate something else), this is how you convert it:\r\n\r\n    4---&gt; 1--&gt; 7--&gt;   2--&gt; f--&gt; 5--&gt; 8--&gt; b--&gt; c--&gt; (&lt;- hex digits)\r\n    s eee eeee eeee   mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm\r\n    0 100 0001 0111   0010 1111

         +--------------------------------         8\r\n\r\nThe sign is positive.\r\n\r\nThe exponent is `1,024 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 1,047 - 1,023 bias = 24`, so the multiplier is &lt;code&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or `16,777,216`.\r\n\r\nThe mantissa bits sum, with each bit adding &lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as `n` starts at `1` and increases to the right:\r\n\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4,194,304&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2,078,152&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1,048,576&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;524,288&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;131,072&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8,192&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4,096&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;256&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;128&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and\r\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.\r\n\r\nWhen you add all these up along with the implicit `1`, you get `1.1849477291107177734375`.\r\n\r\nThen, the product of that and the previously calculated multiplier of `16,777,216` is the value you want, `19,880,124‬`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985\r\n  [2]:

have slightly modified the original message with a second question :\r\n\r\nI have been advised by a C++ expert to ckeck that out : \r\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast\r\n\r\nto understand better the representation of `double`, `memcpy`, and `bit_cast (C++20)` .\r\n\r\nHere more specifically, I try to understand why we have that result from the code : \r\n```\r\n    constexpr std::uint64_t u64v2 = 0x3fe9000000000000ull;\r\n    constexpr auto f64v2 = std::bit_cast&lt;double&gt;(u64v2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`&quot;f64::from_bits(0x3fe9000000000000u64) == 0.781250f64&quot;`\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to it, I spent time to study the example which is provided in the example of fast inverse square root.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root#CITEREFGoldberg1991\r\n\r\nI did the calculus manually, and it turns out that I finally realised what happens in this specific case with an exponent of 8 bits and a mantissa of 23 bits.\r\n\r\nBut in the example I mentioned above as an application of `bit_cast`, it seems according to my research that the exponent is 11 bits, the mantissa 52 bits (with double precision) : \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen I did the calculs by hand, I found \r\n```\r\nx = (1+Mx/L)*2^(Ex-B)\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\n L=2^52 and Ex = 2*(2^9- 1) with the notations of \r\n```\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root#CITEREFGoldberg1991\r\n\r\nAnd I don&#39;t find the result of `0.781250 as it is announced.\r\nMaybe the exponent and mantissa I choosed was not correct.\r\nI don&#39;t know, but I really would like to understand what happens.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your explanations to help to be to find `0.781250`\r\n\r\n**2nd question** : please can you check the question i have asked below as reply to the comment because even I have a challenge with the first example. thanks in advance\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463578/how-can-i-justify-that-f64from-bits0x3fe9000000000000-u64-0-781250-f64","title":"How can I justify that

can define a `TreeView` in UWP XAML like this, as detailed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/tree-view):\r\n\r\n```xaml\r\n&lt;TreeView ItemsSource=&quot;{x:Bind ListOfStudents}&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;TreeView.ItemTemplate&gt;\r\n        &lt;DataTemplate x:DataType=&quot;model:Student&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;TreeViewItem ItemsSource=&quot;{x:Bind homeworks}&quot;\r\n                          Content=&quot;{x:Bind Name}&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\r\n    &lt;/TreeView.ItemTemplate&gt;\r\n&lt;/TreeView&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would then need to define a `DataTemplate` for each of class you expect to display. Add this in your `TreeView` XAML:\r\n```xaml\r\n&lt;TreeView.Resources&gt;\r\n\t&lt;DataTemplate x:DataType=&quot;model:ScienceH&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;StackPanel Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding Date}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding Vote}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/StackPanel&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;DataTemplate x:DataType=&quot;model:PhysicsH &quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;StackPanel Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding Date}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding Vote}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding Points}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/StackPanel&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\r\n&lt;/TreeView.Resources&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also read more on the `DataTemplate` class [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.datatemplate).\r\n\r\nNote that, as suggested in the comments, you need to implement change notifications in your classes to ensure correct binding. This is all detailed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/data-binding/data-binding-in-depth).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you seem to have a `TreeView` with a tree structure of known, fixed depth: depth 0 would be the list of `Student` and depth 1 would be the list of `Homework`, so you could also do without `TreeView` and simply nest two `ItemsControl` within one another.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463572/how-to-correctly-bound-to-a-class-with-inheritance/58466128#58466128","title":"How to correctly bound to a class with inheritance"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":1135202,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqSgE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Massimo Savazzi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1135202/massimo-savazzi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58466128,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571505364,"creation_date":1571487285,"question_id":58463572,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58463572","body_markdown":"I have a treeview.

short answer is: **you can&#39;t** recover the original image.  \r\n\r\nProof:  \r\nAssume 2x2 image:  \r\n\r\n    I = [a b]\r\n        [c d]\r\n    \r\n    J = I + rot90(I) = [ a + b, b + d] = [E F\r\n                       [ a + c, c + d]    G H]\r\n\r\nNow lets try to solve the linear equation system:  \r\n\r\n    E = a + b + 0 + 0\r\n    F = 0 + b + 0 + d\r\n    G = a + 0 + c + 0\r\n    H = 0 + 0 + c + d\r\n\r\n    A = [a, b, 0, 0     u = [a   v = [E\r\n         0, b, 0, d          b        F\r\n         a, 0, c, 0          c        G   \r\n         0, 0, c, d]         d]       H]\r\n\r\n    v = A*u\r\n\r\nIn order to extract u, matrix `A` must be invertibale.  \r\nbut `det(A) = 0`, so there are infinite possible solutions.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI tried an iterative approach.  \r\nI implemented it in MATLAB.  \r\n\r\nI played with it a little, and found out that applying bilateral filter, and moderated sharpening, improves the reconstructed result.  \r\nThere are probably better heuristics, that I can&#39;t think off.  \r\n\r\nHere is the MATLAB implementation:  \r\n\r\n    I = im2double(imread(&#39;cameraman.tif&#39;))/2; %Read input sample image and convert to double\r\n    J = I + rot90(I); %Sum of I and rotated I.\r\n    \r\n    %Initial guess.\r\n    I = ones(size(J))*0.5;\r\n    \r\n    h_fig = figure;\r\n    ax = axes(h_fig);\r\n    h = imshow(I/2);\r\n    \r\n    alpha = 0.1;\r\n    beta = 0.01;\r\n    \r\n    %100000 iterations.\r\n    for i = 1:100000\r\n        K = I + rot90(I);\r\n        E = J - K; %E is the error matrix.\r\n        I = I + alpha*E;\r\n        \r\n        if mod(i, 100) == 0\r\n            if (i &lt; 100000*0.9)\r\n                I = imsharpen(imbilatfilt(I), &#39;Amount&#39;, 0.1);\r\n            end\r\n            h.CData = I*2;\r\n            ax.Title.String = num2str(i);\r\n            pause(0.01);\r\n            beta = beta * 0.99;        \r\n        end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nSum of I and rot90(I):

So in your case, the `fail` tasks will never be played as they are after the failing task.\r\n\r\nOne way to go around this problem would be to use [`ignore_error`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_error_handling.html#ignoring-failed-commands) on your task.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, I find that [blocks and their error handling feature](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_blocks.html#blocks-error-handling) are better suited to handle such scenarios.\r\n\r\n* The example below uses a `block`. I faked the sql call with a playbook var (that you can modify to play around) and a `debug` task using the same `when` conditions as yours.\r\n* I also modified the way to call `fail` so that you only have to do it once with the [`ternary` filter](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#id8). \r\n* If you are not familiar with the `&gt;-` notation in yaml, have a look at a definition of [scalar blocks](https://yaml-multiline.info/).

found two problems with this script:\r\n\r\n* The author mixes functions from `tidyr` and variables of class `data.table`. These functions will likely return data frames and using `data.table` syntax on these will cause errors. Unfortunately, some `tidyr` functions may return `data.table` when operating on one, but this seems to vary greatly depending on the version of the `tidyr` package.\r\n\r\n* The `unnest` function from `tidyr` has a new interface. The script won&#39;t work as is with `tidyr` version 1.0.0 or later.\r\n\r\nBelow are the lines I changed to fix the script, using R version 3.6.1 and `tidyr` version 1.0.0:\r\n\r\n* *line 56:* added `trace.df &lt;- as.data.table(trace.df)`\r\n* *line 64:* changed to `trace.df &lt;- unnest(trace.df, cols)`\r\n* *line 65:* added `trace.df &lt;- as.data.table(trace.df)`\r\n\r\n**Original answer**\r\n\r\nI was able to run the script on the data you provided without error.
