.executeFunction(String.class, sqlParamUtils.getMapSqlParamForCreatePhysTable(directory));\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs a result `@Transactional` annotation is ignored and I can see new records persisted in DB.\r\nI&#39;ve got only one DataSource configured via `application.properties`, and here is how `JDBCTemlate` configured\r\n\r\n    @Component\r\n    class MapSQLParamUtils {\r\n    \r\n        private final DataSource dataSource;\r\n    \r\n        @Autowired\r\n        MapSQLParamUtils(DataSource dataSource) {\r\n            this.dataSource = dataSource;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Bean\r\n        public JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate() {\r\n            return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo my questions are: why do `@Transactional` ignored by `SimpleJdbcCall` and how to configure `JPA` and `JDBCTemlate` to use same transaction manager.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**:\r\nThis is how I use this service in controller\r\n\r\n    @RestController\r\n    @RequestMapping(value = &quot;/api/v1/directories&quot;)\r\n    public class DirectoriesRESTControllerV1 {\r\n    \r\n        private final DirectoriesService

[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;]\r\n\r\nNow in my application, I have thousands of these lists, and they vary in length (typically a few hundred long). But what they all have in common is that they have the repeating pattern `(a,b)`. This list, for example, is broken:\r\n\r\n    l_broken = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;]\r\n\r\nAnything which deviates from the `a,b` repeating pattern in `l` must be considered broken. Even if the list is not of even length, then it is broken. So this must be a very strict test. But essentially if the list `l` is of length `N` then it means that `(a,b)` has to repeat itself `N/2` times. The symbols `a` and `b` are the only things that will ever appear in these lists, so checking for that is not required since it is inconceivable in this application, for anything else to be seen.\r\n\r\nI should say that they all _should_ have the *first* pattern. I am looking for an efficient way, a test, that can determine that each list does, in fact, have this repeating pattern. And if not throw an error or something e.g.\r\n\r\n    assert my_fancy_test(l), &#39;the list does not follow the correct pattern&#39;\r\n\r\nI think I am looking for sub-sequence matching, but my google searches are coming up short. \r\n\r\n## EDIT:\r\n\r\nThank you all for your excellent solutions. I had no idea you could do even half of these. Great stuff. I added a short performance overview at the end for you to peruse.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116546/check-that-python-list-follows-a-specific-repeating-pattern","title":"Check that python list follows a specific repeating pattern"},{"tags":["angular","webpack","angular-builder"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1801,"user_id":2202748,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9tSQE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joel Joseph","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2202748/joel-joseph"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569500092,"post_id":58116542,"comment_id":102622242,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116542/angular-differential-loading-and-webpack#comment102622242_58116542"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":7715427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/53e3cb24efca02978cf73927a14cfb7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dark19","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7715427/dark19"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569499837,"creation_date":1569499837,"question_id":58116542,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116542","body_markdown":"We would like to use Angular 8 differential loading with webpack.

Headers**, under [**&amp;lt;signal.h&amp;gt;**](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/signal.h.html)) we see `SIGABRT`, `SIGBUS`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGILL`, `SIGQUIT`, `SIGSEGV`, *`SIGSYS`*, *`SIGTRAP`*, *`SIGXCPU`* and *`SIGXFSZ`* tagged as\r\n\r\n&gt; A -- Abnormal termination of the process *with additional actions*.\r\n\r\nSo from a POSIX perspective you can&#39;t rely on a core file being generated, irrespective of signal dispositions.\r\n\r\nHowever, every signal with a default action of &quot;A&quot; in POSIX is listed with a default disposition of &quot;Core&quot; in the Linux manual ([`signal(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html)). That may be what the following excerpt of the manual about `SIGSYS`, `SIGXCPU` and `SIGXFSZ` refers to:\r\n\r\n&gt; Linux 2.4 conforms to the POSIX.1-2001 requirements for these signals, terminating the process with a core dump.\r\n\r\nAs the POSIX excerpts above tell us, it&#39;s not a hard requirement in POSIX.1-2017.\r\n\r\nNow that still doesn&#39;t answer the question if registering a signal-catching function nullifies the signal action of abnormal termination. I believe that if it does, it results in undefined behavior for at least a few signals, as per the following paragraph from XSH (**2.4.3 Signal Actions**, under [**Pointer to a Function**](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_04_03_03)):\r\n\r\n&gt; The behavior of a process is undefined after it returns normally from a signal-catching function for a `SIGBUS`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGILL`, or `SIGSEGV` signal that was not generated by `kill()`, `sigqueue()`, or `raise()`.\r\n\r\nSo to avoid UB in all cases, I believe you have to reset the signal disposition to `SIG_DFL` and then re-`raise()` the signal from within the signal handler anyway. Also, any handlers catching those signals should probably run on an alternate signal stack but I&#39;m not quite sure if that would make it generally safe to do so and if it is in the first place.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116539/returning-from-signal-handler-of-fatal-by-default-signal/58124543#58124543","title":"Returning from signal handler of fatal-by-default signal"}],"owner":{"reputation":57439,"user_id":201725,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/616f7a1cbb20fe949d883393657c039a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jan Hudec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201725/jan-hudec"},"last_editor":{"reputation":57439,"user_id":201725,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/616f7a1cbb20fe949d883393657c039a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jan Hudec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201725/jan-hudec"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":102,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58124543,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569846259,"creation_date":1569499829,"last_edit_date":1569846259,"question_id":58116539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116539","body_markdown":"I want to have a signal handler on the fatal signals that default to dumping core that will log the ocurrence and then the core will still be dumped (unless disabled with ulimit or core pattern).\r\n\r\n&lt;del&gt;I have tested (on Linux 4.15) that if the signal handler simply returns, this is what happens.

table has few entries so it doesn&#39;t stretch vertically (simulate this by adding `height: 100px` to `table` class)\r\n - the table has many entries (simulate this by adding some huge `height` value to `table` class, e.g. `height: 2500px`) - in this case the vertical scrollbar should appear on the utmost right side of the screen (the &quot;classic&quot; one), which it does, and I want to keep this behavior.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116536/fix-horizontal-scrollbar-of-a-container-to-the-bottom-of-the-screen-while-not-st","title":"Fix horizontal scrollbar of a

For example if we have the following content to be input as a content:\r\n\r\nAssume this is the html output i need.\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;First Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\nSo in editor storage, these will be stored as blocks like these:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,\r\n        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello There&quot;,\r\n        &quot;element&quot;: &quot;h1&quot;\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,\r\n        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;First Paragraph&quot;,\r\n        &quot;element&quot;: &quot;p&quot;\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,\r\n        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Second Paragraph&quot;,\r\n        &quot;element&quot;: &quot;p&quot;\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the editor, I am abstracting these things and allowing the user to edit content visually, like we could do in a text editor, using content-editable attribute on the tags selected by the user. So it is essentially a WYSIWYG type editor.\r\n\r\nNow the issue that I am facing is that like we traverse within the content in any editor, using arrow keys (up and down especially), is not being handled natively by the browser because of the elements being physically different than each other. So how can I, on tap of keyboard buttons (up and down), navigate the cursor programmatically so that user feels like it is not using any new system and just another text editor. \r\nI have tried with the window selection API, and currently I have only reached the extent where I am able to traverse from one block to another (say from paragraph 1 to heading), but the position can either be set to start or the end, I am not able to find how do I set it to the exact position that it was in.\r\n\r\nFor example, say that cursor is after **third** character in the paragraph, and the user clicks up arrow key, it should go to headings the third character and so on.\r\n\r\nSorry for a very long question and description. Thanks in advance for any replies.

In &#39;`for (auto c : str)`&#39; what exactly is c?\r\n\r\nc is a local variable with automatic storage within the scope of the range-for statement. It&#39;s type will be deduced because you used `auto`. In case of `string str=&quot;ARZ&quot;;`, the deduced type will be `char`.\r\n\r\n&gt; Presumably c is just a pointer into the vector\r\n\r\nThere is no vector, and c is not a pointer. It is a `char`.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding what range-for does may help. It is equivalent to doing following (the `__` prefixed variables are not accessible to the programmer; they are conceptual for the behaviour of the loop):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        auto &amp;&amp; __range = range_expression;\r\n        auto __begin = begin_expr;\r\n        auto __end = end_expr;\r\n        for (; __begin != __end; ++__begin) {\r\n            range_declaration = *__begin;\r\n            loop_statement\r\n        }\r\n    } \r\n\r\nOr, in this particular case:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        auto &amp;&amp; __range = str;\r\n        auto __begin = range.begin();\r\n        auto __end = range.end();\r\n        for ( ; __begin != __end; ++__begin) {\r\n            auto c = *__begin;         // note here\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; (void*)&amp;c &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that if you use `auto&amp;`, then c will be deduced to be a reference to char. Applying the addressof operator to a reference will not produce the address of the reference variable, but instead the address of the referred object. In this case the referred object would be the character within the string.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116510/in-for-auto-c-str-what-exactly-is-c/58116580#58116580","title":"In &#39;for (auto c : str)&#39; what exactly is c?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569501178,"last_edit_date":1569501178,"creation_date":1569500056,"answer_id":58116594,"question_id":58116510,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58116594","body_markdown":"In this range-based for loop\r\n\r\n    for (auto c: s) {c=&#39;?&#39;; cout &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; endl;}\r\n\r\nthere are three iterations because the size of the string `s` is equal to `3`.\r\n\r\nWithin the loop the assigned value of the object `c` is ignored and the object is reassigned by the character `&#39;?&#39;`.

I need to compare the `user_id` from `listUser` with `listId` in order to check if I need to add the row to `filteredListUser`.\r\n\r\nI would know how to do this if this were simply two string arrays like so:\r\n\r\n    String[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};\r\n    String[] b = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};\r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; c = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {\r\n            if (Arrays.asList(b).contains(a[i])) {\r\n                c.add(a[i]);\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI think a for-loop would also be appropriate for the List comparisons, but I am unsure as to how I can compare the `user_id` in `listUser` with `listId` in `List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;` and `List&lt;String&gt;`.\r\n\r\nAs an attempt and pseudo-code perspective, what I am trying to accomplish is this:\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; filterMethod() {\r\n\r\n        List&lt;String&gt; listId = this.getUserIds(); //includes only the user id&#39;s\r\n        List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; listUser = this.getUserDetails(); // includes user_id, user_name, and user_email\r\n        List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; filteredListUser = null;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; listUser.length; i++) {\r\n            if (listId.contains(listUser.USER_ID[i])) {\r\n                filteredListUser.add(listUser[i]);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return filteredListUser;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not entirely sure where to go from here however - would appreciate any help!\r\n\r\nApologies if this is a really rudimentary question - I&#39;m very new to programming.

```&lt;@spring.bind &quot;output&quot; /&gt;``` and access it with ```${output}```. When using ```@ModelAttribute(&quot;model&quot;) ModelMap model``` its possible to access the attribute without binding first. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116490/manually-html-render-with-spring-freemarker","title":"Manually html render with spring freemarker"},{"tags":["python","django","api","django-socialauth"],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":3151189,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebddba5ceb9c41a32326ed22e7cf516c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ranchoddas shyamaldas chanchad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3151189/ranchoddas-shyamaldas-chanchad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39,"user_id":3151189,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebddba5ceb9c41a32326ed22e7cf516c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ranchoddas shyamaldas chanchad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3151189/ranchoddas-shyamaldas-chanchad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569500591,"creation_date":1569499609,"last_edit_date":1569500591,"question_id":58116488,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116488","body_markdown":"I am trying to use social auth in Django with Google. and i am getting the following error.\r\n\r\n&gt;

11. There may be mistakes or other issues.**\r\n\r\nIn Xcode right-click on `objc_super` and `objc_msgSendSuper` and select &quot;Jump to Definition&quot; which will open the system files containing the definitions. This will show two things:\r\n\r\n 1. Both field names and types of `objc_super` have changed since your code was written, some of this is documented in the comments.\r\n 2. The prototype for `objc_msgSendSuper` has also changed to just `void objc_msgSendSuper(void)`, the previous prototype is also there `id _Nullable\r\nobjc_msgSendSuper(struct objc_super * _Nonnull super, SEL _Nonnull op, ...)`. Using the previous prototype the call to this function in the code could be made without a cast, with this new prototype a cast is needed.\r\n\r\nMaking the changes indicated to the code gives:\r\n\r\n    // A typedef for objc_msgSendSuper which takes only the required (first two) arguments\r\n    typedef void *(*NoAdditionalArgMsgSendSuper)(struct objc_super *super_class, SEL selector);\r\n    \r\n    void* callSuper0(id self, Class superClass, SEL _cmd)\r\n    {\r\n       struct objc_super super;\r\n       // .receiver is now defined as &quot;__unsafe_unretained _Nonnull id&quot; so no bridge cast required\r\n       super.receiver = self;\r\n       // .super_class is new name for .class\r\n       super.super_class = superClass != NULL ? superClass : class_getSuperclass(object_getClass(self));\r\n       // cast objc_msgSendSuper to the correct type and then call\r\n       return ((NoAdditionalArgMsgSendSuper)objc_msgSendSuper)(&amp;super, preprocessSEL(_cmd));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n**Addendum**\r\n\r\nFollowing on from your comment and code post as another answer.\r\n\r\nIn your code you write:\r\n\r\n    void* (*objc_msgSendSuperTyped)(id self, SEL _cmd) = (void*)objc_msgSendSuper;\r\n    return objc_msgSendSuperTyped((id) &amp;super, preprocessSEL(_cmd));\r\n\r\nMaking a typed copy of the function pointer, rather than just casting on use as our earlier code, is fine. However your code should produce an error from Xcode as you are trying to case a non-retained type (`&amp;super` - a struct pointer) to a retained one (`id`) –&#160;which requires a bridge cast.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to give `objc_msgSendSuperTyped` the correct type, its first argument should be a struct pointer:\r\n\r\n    void* (*objc_msgSendSuperTyped)(struct objc_super *self, SEL _cmd) = (void*)objc_msgSendSuper;\r\n    return objc_msgSendSuperTyped(&amp;super, preprocessSEL(_cmd));\r\n\r\nFrom your comment:\r\n\r\n&gt; I had to change super.super_class to super.class for it to work, it now throws other errors unrelated.\r\n\r\nThis suggests you&#39;ve some unusual settings, in the declaration of `objc_super` we find:\r\n\r\n    #if !defined(__cplusplus)  &amp;&amp;  !__OBJC2__\r\n       /* For compatibility with old objc-runtime.h header */\r\n       __unsafe_unretained _Nonnull Class class;\r\n    #else\r\n       __unsafe_unretained _Nonnull Class super_class;\r\n    #endif\r\n\r\n`__OBJC2__` is defined by default in Xcode 11 (and plenty of earlier versions) for `.m` and `.mm` files, `__cplusplus` is defined for `.mm` files only. So the condition `!defined(__cplusplus)  &amp;&amp;  !__OBJC2__` is `false` and the field is therefore named `super_class`...\r\n\r\nYou might wish to determine why `__OBJC2__` is apparently not defined for the source you are trying to convert...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116456/too-many-arguments-to-function-call-expected-0-have-2/58124443#58124443","title":"Too many arguments to function call, expected 0, have 2"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":47021,"user_id":568283,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/120ceee2dc40d539b9983265a2e0a2f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CRD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/568283/crd"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569624878,"post_id":58132413,"comment_id":102670206,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116456/too-many-arguments-to-function-call-expected-0-have-2/58132413#comment102670206_58132413"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":749472,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29a4bf26f2f1c74b75b3cb1ad849390e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ciTiger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/749472/citiger"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569578882,"creation_date":1569578882,"answer_id":58132413,"question_id":58116456,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58132413","body_markdown":"I found it working by changing to this:\r\n\r\n    void* callSuper0(id self, Class superClass, SEL _cmd)\r\n    {\r\n        struct objc_super super;\r\n        super.receiver = (__bridge void *)self;\r\n        super.class = superClass != NULL ?

I want my results returned of course so I can work with it later.\r\n\r\nThis code keeps failing with the error code: ```RuntimeError: This event loop is already running``` and I don&#39;t know how to fix this. There probably is an issue with how I deal with the loops and how I call my functions.\r\n\r\nCan somebody please help?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116445/how-to-make-asynchronous-mysql-operations-with-modular-queries","title":"How to make asynchronous MySQL operations with modular queries?"},{"tags":["android","android-fragments","android-architecture-components","android-jetpack","android-architecture-navigation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":531,"user_id":7639056,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yx6Ry1jBzOA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB8I/pPIeg_XgGsA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kaushik Burkule","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7639056/kaushik-burkule"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569499991,"post_id":58116444,"comment_id":102622187,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116444/how-to-preserve-properties-value-in-the-fragment-after-switching-tab-in-bottom-n#comment102622187_58116444"},{"owner":{"reputation":55808,"user_id":2413303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLIhq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EpicPandaForce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2413303/epicpandaforce"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569500664,"post_id":58116444,"comment_id":102622549,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116444/how-to-preserve-properties-value-in-the-fragment-after-switching-tab-in-bottom-n#comment102622549_58116444"}],"owner":{"reputation":894,"user_id":9101876,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c370f6d96ccaa54d34b81a5eb712f66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexa289","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9101876/alexa289"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569499438,"creation_date":1569499438,"question_id":58116444,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116444","body_markdown":"I have 4 tabs in the bottom navigation view called :\r\n\r\n 1.

[Address prefixes wiki list][2]:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst addressTypes = {\r\n  0x00: {\r\n    type: &#39;p2pkh&#39;,\r\n    network: &#39;mainnet&#39;\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  0x6f: {\r\n    type: &#39;p2pkh&#39;,\r\n    network: &#39;testnet&#39;\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  0x05: {\r\n    type: &#39;p2sh&#39;,\r\n    network: &#39;mainnet&#39;\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  0xc4: {\r\n    type: &#39;p2sh&#39;,\r\n    network: &#39;testnet&#39;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to match regular addresses to regtest, or are they technically equal to testnet addresses?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

`SingleChildScrollView` to avoid keyboard collisions however the height must be precise to avoid small scrolling when no keyboard is shown on the screen.\r\nEverything works fine and `SingleChildScrollView` allows me to scroll vertically if a keyboard pops up but when there is no keyboard the `BottomAppBar` takes 2 extra pixels of height that I had to workaround as shown but I wonder (since it took me some time to realize that) where that behavior comes from, why the `BottomAppBar` is adding 2 extra pixels to it&#39;s

I removed the error handling to make it easier to read.\r\n\r\n    public static Image loadImage(...) {\r\n            File file = new File(filepath);\r\n            var bufferedImage = ImageIO.read(file);\r\n\r\n            ByteArrayOutputStream bout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n            ImageIO.write(bufferedImage, getFileExtension(filepath), bout);\r\n            \r\n            var bytes = bout.toByteArray();\r\n            StreamResource resource = new StreamResource(defaultNameImage, () -&gt; new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes));\r\n            \r\n            bout.close();\r\n            return new Image(resource, defaultNameImage);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEach row of the grid is created like the following (simplified):\r\n\r\n    private Entry createEntry(...) {\r\n        var image = UtilFile.loadImage(PATH_TO_IMAGE, DEFAULT_NAME);\r\n        return new Entry(image);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe real issue appears if I want to access the image again to show it in the UI.\r\n\r\n        grid.addColumn(new ComponentRenderer&lt;Image, Entry&gt;(entry -&gt; { \r\n            return entry.getImage(); // Here is the trouble\r\n            }\r\n        })).setHeader(&quot;Image&quot;);\r\n\r\nOnly one Image is shown instead 1 for every row. Is this because the stream can only be used once? I would have guessed that the new instance of Image would have the image. I am a bit confused, sorry.\r\n\r\nNow the concrete questions:\r\n\r\n1. Why does my way not work? Is the stream used only once and the other instances of Image don&#39;t get the loaded image?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Is it possible to avoid using the streams so much? I would like to simply keep the Image in memory and reuse it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116405/how-to-reuse-images-in-java-and-avoid-using-streams-so-much","title":"How to reuse Images in Java and avoid using streams so much?"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2","graph","line","points"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11208804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wKPXy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lucas_Guerra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11208804/lucas-guerra"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569501742,"post_id":58116754,"comment_id":102623123,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116404/multiple-lines-graph-but-i-want-to-show-the-texts-and-the-points-in-only-one-spe/58116754#comment102623123_58116754"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6174,"user_id":2835261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04db1181f617a28a5325b5b35650e179?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H 1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2835261/h-1"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6174,"user_id":2835261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04db1181f617a28a5325b5b35650e179?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H 1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2835261/h-1"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569501254,"last_edit_date":1569501254,"creation_date":1569500662,"answer_id":58116754,"question_id":58116404,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58116754","body_markdown":"You can make the labels and points conditional with the following:\r\n\r\n    ggplot(df, aes(x = V1, y = V3)) + \r\n      geom_line(aes(color = V2), size = 1) +\r\n      scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;#D2691E&quot;,&quot;#00FFFF&quot;,&quot;#228B22&quot;))   +\r\n      scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$V1), max(df$V1))) +\r\n      geom_point(aes(size = V2 == &quot;CNPq&quot;), show.legend = FALSE)  +\r\n      geom_text(aes(label=ifelse(V2 == &quot;CNPq&quot;, V3, &quot;&quot;)), nudge_y = 1000) +\r\n      scale_size_manual(values=c(-1,1))\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RrWQ1.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116404/multiple-lines-graph-but-i-want-to-show-the-texts-and-the-points-in-only-one-spe/58116754#58116754","title":"Multiple lines graph but I want to show the texts and the points in only one specific line"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11208804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wKPXy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lucas_Guerra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11208804/lucas-guerra"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58116754,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569501254,"creation_date":1569499286,"question_id":58116404,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116404","body_markdown":"So I have this code that plots this following mutiple line graph \r\n```\r\ngrafico1 &lt;- ggplot(dataset1, aes(x = V1, y = V3)) + \r\n  geom_line(aes(color = V2), size = 1) +\r\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;#D2691E&quot;,&quot;#00FFFF&quot;,&quot;#228B22&quot;))   +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(dataset1$V1), max(dataset1$V1)))) + geom_point()  +\r\ngeom_text(aes(label=V3), nudge_y = 1000)\r\n```\r\nSee that it draw points and the text values in all the lines.
