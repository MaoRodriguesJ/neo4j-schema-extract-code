apparent how to string these together if you need to add or remove extra layers.

This answer makes use of both recursion (your initial query, modified) and pivot. \r\n\r\nThe following code will allow you to build the hierarchy by columns, with a few caveats.\r\nIf you wish to extend the number of layers, you still need to code change.  The reason for this is that SQL Server requires the column definition ( if we aren&#39;t writing dynamic SQL ). Additionally, the names are not propagated through the result.  You can get these with a function or as a part of a select statement.\r\n\r\nTo add new levels to your hierarchy ( 10 have been included ), you would add an additional column (ie [11] or [n] in sq_consolidated array and sq_merge array, add the max([n]) as LnID to sq_final.\r\n\r\nThis answer also depends on you mapping at the lowest level of the hierarchy ( which was a part of the requirements ).\r\n\r\n    WITH\r\n        sq_hierarchylevels AS\r\n            (SELECT    vircustid\r\n                      ,parentvircustid\r\n                      ,name\r\n                      ,1      AS hierlevel\r\n                      ,[name] AS constname\r\n               FROM    virtualcustomer\r\n              WHERE    parentvircustid IS NULL\r\n             UNION ALL\r\n             SELECT    i.vircustid\r\n                      ,i.parentvircustid\r\n                      ,i.name\r\n                      ,hierlevel + 1\r\n                      ,hier.constname\r\n               FROM    virtualcustomer  i\r\n                       INNER JOIN sq_hierarchylevels hier ON hier.vircustid = i.parentvircustid),\r\n        sq_consolidated AS\r\n            (SELECT    *\r\n               FROM    sq_hierarchylevels hier\r\n                       PIVOT (max( vircustid )\r\n                             FOR hierlevel\r\n                             IN( [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10] )) AS piv\r\n              WHERE    parentvircustid IS NOT NULL),\r\n        sq_merge AS\r\n            (SELECT    orig.vircustid\r\n                      ,orig.parentvircustid\r\n                      ,orig.[name]\r\n                      ,vircustid   AS l1id\r\n                      ,orig.[name] AS l1name\r\n                      ,[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]\r\n               FROM    virtualcustomer  orig\r\n                       LEFT JOIN sq_consolidated fills ON (orig.name = fills.constname)\r\n              WHERE    orig.parentvircustid IS NULL),\r\n        sq_final AS\r\n            (SELECT      vircustid\r\n                        ,[name]\r\n                        ,max( l1id ) AS l1id\r\n                        ,max( [2] ) AS l2id\r\n                        ,max( [3] ) AS l3id\r\n                        ,max( [4] ) AS l4id\r\n                        ,max( [5] ) AS l5id\r\n                        ,max( [6] ) AS l6id\r\n                        ,max( [7] ) AS l7id\r\n                        ,max( [8] ) AS l8id\r\n                        ,max( [9] ) AS l9id\r\n                        ,max( [10] ) AS l10id\r\n                 FROM    sq_merge\r\n             GROUP BY    vircustid, name)\r\n    SELECT      *\r\n        FROM    sq_final\r\n    ORDER BY    vircustid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032722/sql-recursion-and-pivot-to-create-hierarchy/58035683#58035683","title":"SQL Recursion and pivot to create hierarchy"}],"owner":{"reputation":21930,"user_id":1678148,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb1aee4193fab0cdc8ccd3ca950c038e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Darren Wainwright","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1678148/darren-wainwright"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21930,"user_id":1678148,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb1aee4193fab0cdc8ccd3ca950c038e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Darren Wainwright","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1678148/darren-wainwright"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569017628,"creation_date":1568999942,"last_edit_date":1569003244,"question_id":58032722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032722","body_markdown":"I have to create and apply a hierarchy to customers, where i do not have control over the customer table or its database.\r\n\r\nTo do this i am creating a separate database that will contain virtual customers and a mapping table. \r\n\r\nThere are other processes in place that will take the results of this script and apply it to the customers from the uncontrolled Db.\r\n\r\n**VirtualCustomer Table** - I have control over this table design.\r\n\r\nThese &#39;customers&#39; represent the hierarchy that has to be applied.\r\n\r\n    VirCustID    |    ParentVirCustID    |    Name\r\n    2001         |    NULL               |    Vehicle\r\n    2002         |    2001               |    Car\r\n    2003         |    NULL               |    Tech\r\n    2004         |    2003               |    Comms\r\n\r\n**HierarchyAssignment Table** - I have control over this table design\r\n\r\nUsing this table as the mechanism to join the customer to the virtual customer.

Unfortunately whenever I&#39;m clicking on a button or changing value on a slider `zoom` and `pan` is resetting (which is not surprising). See example below:\r\n\r\n[Exaple app][1]\r\n\r\nIs there any way to keep the `pan` and `zoom` values on `inputs` change ?

`^` as a logical XOR operator is highly unusual. It works, but I would avoid it for readability&#39;s sake. `!=` is a good replacement.\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn !((val1 != null) != (val2 != null)) &amp;&amp; !(val2 != null &amp;&amp; val1.compareTo(val2) != 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can replace the double negation with `==`. Nice.\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn ((val1 != null) == (val2 != null)) &amp;&amp; !(val2 != null &amp;&amp; val1.compareTo(val2) != 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also distribute the remaining `!` via [De Morgan&#39;s laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws):\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn ((val1 != null) == (val2 != null)) &amp;&amp; (val2 == null || val1.compareTo(val2) == 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s better, but to be honest I still find it unwieldy. I&#39;d go with something more straightforward even if it&#39;s not a single line statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (val1 == null) {\r\n    return val2 == null;\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    return val2 != null &amp;&amp; val1.compareTo(val2) == 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could use the ternary operator in place of `if`/`else`. Up to personal preference which you find more readable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn val1 == null\r\n    ? val2 == null\r\n    : val2 != null &amp;&amp; val1.compareTo(val2) == 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou mention that you need to use `compareTo()`. For others who might read this answer, if you don&#39;t have to use `compareTo()` I&#39;d use `equals()` instead.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (val1 == null) {\r\n    return val2 == null;\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    return val1.equals(val2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, as it so happens, you wouldn&#39;t even need to write this method at all. The built-in [`Objects.equals()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Objects.html#equals-java.lang.Object-java.lang.Object-) method does exactly this: it returns true if two objects are equal, or if they&#39;re both null.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032709/negation-of-boolean-expressions-with-xor/58032805#58032805","title":"negation of boolean expressions with XOR"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1427,"user_id":1279180,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59873d5c010ca863c32c41281faf81bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nimo23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279180/nimo23"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569002435,"post_id":58033155,"comment_id":102468520,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032709/negation-of-boolean-expressions-with-xor/58033155#comment102468520_58033155"},{"owner":{"reputation":7703,"user_id":1786065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/udTpS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rogue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1786065/rogue"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1427,"user_id":1279180,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59873d5c010ca863c32c41281faf81bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nimo23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279180/nimo23"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569002589,"post_id":58033155,"comment_id":102468593,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032709/negation-of-boolean-expressions-with-xor/58033155#comment102468593_58033155"},{"owner":{"reputation":1427,"user_id":1279180,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59873d5c010ca863c32c41281faf81bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nimo23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279180/nimo23"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569002938,"post_id":58033155,"comment_id":102468718,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032709/negation-of-boolean-expressions-with-xor/58033155#comment102468718_58033155"},{"owner":{"reputation":25472,"user_id":85421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e56d684a3291bbab986c3e8e5d389ff9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Carlos Heuberger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/85421/carlos-heuberger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569002943,"post_id":58033155,"comment_id":102468720,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032709/negation-of-boolean-expressions-with-xor/58033155#comment102468720_58033155"},{"owner":{"reputation":7703,"user_id":1786065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/udTpS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rogue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1786065/rogue"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25472,"user_id":85421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e56d684a3291bbab986c3e8e5d389ff9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Carlos Heuberger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/85421/carlos-heuberger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569003485,"post_id":58033155,"comment_id":102468931,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032709/negation-of-boolean-expressions-with-xor/58033155#comment102468931_58033155"},{"owner":{"reputation":25472,"user_id":85421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e56d684a3291bbab986c3e8e5d389ff9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Carlos Heuberger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/85421/carlos-heuberger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569007472,"post_id":58033155,"comment_id":102470304,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032709/negation-of-boolean-expressions-with-xor/58033155#comment102470304_58033155"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7703,"user_id":1786065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/udTpS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rogue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1786065/rogue"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7703,"user_id":1786065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/udTpS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rogue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1786065/rogue"},"comment_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569003504,"last_edit_date":1569003504,"creation_date":1569002202,"answer_id":58033155,"question_id":58032709,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58033155","body_markdown":"If scale wasn&#39;t an issue, I would utilize a ternary here, and take advantage of `Object#equals` returning `false` for `null`:\r\n\r\n    //Basically Objects#equals at this point\r\n    public static boolean isEqual(BigDecimal val1, BigDecimal val2) {\r\n        return val1 == null ?

For example, you can check the 4th entry in the kclust$clust variable and you will see that there are 4 cluster centers, but right below that you will see that most points are assigned to cluster 1. \r\n\r\n\r\n    library(tidyverse)\r\n    centers = data.frame( grps  = 1:5,\r\n            gsize = c(1000, 500, 750, 900, 800),\r\n            m1    = c(  -2,  -1,   0,   1,   2),\r\n            m2    = c(   0,   3,   1,   2,   4),\r\n            m3    = c(   1,   4,   2,   5,  -1),\r\n            m4    = c(   2,  -3,   4,  -1,   1) )\r\n\r\n    # training set generation\r\n    kd = centers %&gt;%\r\n      group_by(grps) %&gt;%\r\n      do(data.frame( v1= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m1[1]),\r\n                     v2= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m2[1]),\r\n                     v3= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m3[1]),\r\n                     v4= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m4[1])) ) \r\n\r\n    minClusters = 1\r\n    maxClusters = 10\r\n\r\n    kclust  &lt;- kd %&gt;%\r\n      crossing(k = minClusters:maxClusters) %&gt;%\r\n      group_by(k) %&gt;%\r\n      do(clust = kmeans(select(., v1, v2, v3, v4), .$k[1], nstart=5))enter code here\r\n\r\n    &gt; kclust$clust[4]\r\n    [[1]]\r\n    K-means clustering with 4 clusters of sizes 982, 771, 1399, 798\r\n\r\n    Cluster means:\r\n              v1         v2         v3         v4\r\n    1 -2.0413678 0.01394798  0.9787409  1.9646186\r\n    2 -0.0179719 1.05571578  2.0228387  4.0233226\r\n    3  0.2979344 2.34438159  4.6230947 -1.6822656\r\n    4  1.9941418 4.03159297 -1.0617125  0.9776119\r\n\r\n    Clustering vector:\r\n       [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n      [69] 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [137] 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [205] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [273] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [341] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [409] 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\r\n     [477] 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [545] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [613] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [681] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [749] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\r\n     [817] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n     [885] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n    [953] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 1\r\n     [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 2950 entries ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTry increasing the means to a larger range (* see UPDATE below) and results should be better. The other issue is that the data is ordered by the groups so it is also causing issues in the view when you only look at the 1st few samples (they should get assigned to the same cluster). Try shuffling the data points and the results would look more reasonable.\r\n\r\n    centers = data.frame( grps  = 1:5,\r\n                          gsize = c(1000, 500, 750, 900, 800),\r\n                          m1    = c(-10, -5, 0, 5, 10),\r\n                          m2    = c(-10, -5, 0, 5, 10),\r\n                          m3    = c(-10, -5, 0, 5, 10),\r\n                          m4    = c(-10, -5, 0, 5, 10) )\r\n\r\n    # training set generation\r\n    kd = centers %&gt;%\r\n      group_by(grps) %&gt;%\r\n      do(data.frame( v1= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m1[1]),\r\n                     v2= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m2[1]),\r\n                     v3= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m3[1]),\r\n                     v4= rnorm(.$gsize[1], .$m4[1])) ) %&gt;%\r\n      ungroup()\r\n    \r\n    minClusters = 1\r\n    maxClusters = 10\r\n    \r\n    kclust  &lt;- kd %&gt;%\r\n      sample_frac(size=1) %&gt;%\r\n      crossing(k = minClusters:maxClusters) %&gt;%\r\n      group_by(k) %&gt;%\r\n      do(clust = kmeans(select(., v1, v2, v3, v4), .$k[1], nstart=5))\r\n\r\n\r\n    &gt; kclust$clust[5]\r\n    [[1]]\r\n    K-means clustering with 5 clusters of sizes 900, 1000, 800, 750, 500\r\n    \r\n    Cluster means:\r\n                 v1           v2          v3          v4\r\n    1   4.947859954  4.990537346  4.96409669  5.02513562\r\n    2 -10.014275191 -9.990181395 -9.96969088 -9.96127717\r\n    3  10.054780835  9.942738199 10.03617191 10.01820661\r\n    4   0.005084275 -0.003034476 -0.03353889 -0.01343343\r\n    5  -5.056184108 -5.004413465 -5.00059546 -5.06765925\r\n    \r\n    Clustering vector:\r\n       [1] 2 4 4 2 4 2 4 1 4 4 5 4 1 3 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 5 2 4 2 2 4 3 2 1 3 1 2 2 3 4 1 4 1 3 3 5 2 3 3 1 1 4 5 2 4 2 4 2 2 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 1 5\r\n      [69] 2 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 4 2 1 1 2 2 4 4 2 2 5 5 4 2 3 4 5 2 5 3 5 5 4 3 3 3 1 3 5 3 4 1 3 4 1 2 2 3 4 1 1 3 3 1 2 3 5 2 3 1 2 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 1 4\r\n     [137] 4 3 1 4 5 2 3 1 4 1 3 3 1 2 3 3 1 3 1 4 4 2 1 1 5 3 3 2 4 3 5 3 1 3 1 4 4 2 1 3 1 2 3 5 2 1 3 1 3 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 3 2 2 5 2 3 3 1 5 3 2\r\n     [205] 5 3 2 2 3 5 2 4 5 4 1 1 2 2 3 1 4 2 4 1 5 3 3 3 5 4 1 2 3 3 5 1 1 5 1 3 3 2 2 5 3 2 2 1 2 4 2 5 4 5 5 2 4 5 3 4 5 3 1 1 2 1 1 2 4 2 4 1\r\n     [273] 2 3 4 5 2 3 1 5 3 3 3 3 5 4 3 4 2 3 2 4 1 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 3 5 4 5 2 1 4 2 1 3 2 3 4 4 2 2 2 4 3 3 1 4 1 3 5 1 3 3 1 3 3 2 4 1 2 4 2 3\r\n     [341] 2 3 3 2 3 1 5 3 2 5 2 3 4 4 1 2 5 3 1 3 1 1 1 1 3 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 3 5 4 1 4 3 4 3 4 1 4 5 5 5 4 2 4 3 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 2 4 5 4 2 1 1 1\r\n     [409] 4 1 5 2 4 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 5 2 3 5 2 3 1 4 1 1 4 3 3 1 1 1 3 2 2 5 1 3 2 2 2 5 4 4 5 4 1 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 5 1 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 3 1 1 1 2 3 2 3 4\r\n     [477] 2 3 4 2 5 2 4 2 3 1 5 4 3 4 3 3 2 4 3 3 5 2 5 4 4 1 1 2 3 1 5 4 3 1 2 5 2 2 4 2 3 3 2 4 1 3 5 2 1 3 5 5 2 1 3 1 1 5 5 2 1 5 3 2 2 3 3 2\r\n     [545] 2 1 4 4 4 1 2 1 5 5 2 1 4 3 3 2 5 5 2 4 3 2 4 1 3 3 1 3 4 3 2 4 2 5 4 4 3 1 4 5 4 2 1 4 4 2 3 1 2 2 2 4 1 2 2 1 5 5 2 2 4 4 1 5 4 4 4 4\r\n     [613] 2 3 3 1 1 3 3 1 4 4 5 1 2 1 1 4 3 2 5 4 2 5 3 3 3 1 4 1 2 3 5 2 2 4 4 5 2 3 3 1 3 4 3 5 2 2 2 2 4 3 3 2 3 2 4 3 2 2 1 3 3 3 4 3 2 3 3 1\r\n     [681] 3 2 2 5 4 2 4 4 5 2 1 3 1 2 4 1 3 3 4 1 4 4 3 2 2 4 4 3 5 4 1 1 5 2 2 3 5 4 1 1 4 2 5 3 3 1 2 1 2 4 4 2 1 3 2 2 2 3 1 4 1 1 1 4 3 2 3 5\r\n     [749] 1 4 4 3 4 4 4 2 4 2 3 3 1 1 1 4 2 3 1 4 1 4 3 2 3 2 2 4 1 5 1 4 2 4 2 2 1 4 3 4 5 2 3 4 4 2 2 1 5 1 2 1 2 1 1 5 1 5 2 4 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 4\r\n     [817] 5 1 4 2 4 4 4 5 3 2 1 4 1 3 4 2 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 4 5 1 2 5 3 5 4 1 4 1 4 1 3 2 4 3 1 3 5 4 3 1 5 4 3 2 4 3 3 4 4 3 5 4 2 4 2 1\r\n     [885] 1 1 4 2 4 5 1 2 5 4 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 4 1 5 4 2 2 2 4 1 4 3 4 1 2 4 2 1 4 3 5 1 1 5 5 4 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 2 1 1 1 1 3 2 4 1 1 4 2 5 2\r\n     [953] 3 4 5 2 5 4 1 3 5 2 4 3 4 4 2 4 2 4 1 1 1 1 2 2 4 1 1 3 2 4 3 1 5 1 2 5 4 2 3 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 5 4\r\n     [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 2950 entries ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nAnd, I verified that the real issue is the second one (i.e. your data is ordered).

You would do this as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnp.random.seed(10) # write any number you like\r\na = np.random.rand(100)\r\nnp.random.seed(10) # write any number you like\r\nb = np.random.rand(100)\r\nprint(a == b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you set a seed, the &quot;random&quot; component of it is gone - you will always get the same figures.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True\r\n  True  True  True  True]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNB: ```len(all_historic_data)``` is an int, so ```range(len(all_historic_data))``` is a range object, holding values 0, 1, ..., len(all_historic_data) - 1. For example, if you run \r\n```\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    print(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, the output will be \r\n\r\n```\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, you can notice all of these numbers, except the first one, will be less that 0.8. If you use this to make a train set, then there will be only one observation in your train set.\r\n\r\nIf you still want to compare numbers in a range object with a float, using ```np.arange```, as mentioned by @Dan, might help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032681/get-a-mask-of-len-of-true-false-array/58032949#58032949","title":"Get a mask of len of True/False array"}],"owner":{"reputation":2536,"user_id":817659,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc6960319324ecebe786580dfca13f07?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ivan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/817659/ivan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2536,"user_id":817659,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc6960319324ecebe786580dfca13f07?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ivan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/817659/ivan"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569001221,"creation_date":1568999743,"last_edit_date":1569000431,"question_id":58032681,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032681","body_markdown":"This code works:\r\n\r\n    all_historic_data = pd.DataFrame()\r\n\r\n    percent_of_data = 0.8\r\n    #create train and test sets\r\n    #this methodology will randomly select percent_of_data of our data\r\n    \r\n    msk = np.random.rand(len(all_historic_data)) &lt; percent_of_data\r\n    train = all_historic_data[msk]\r\n    test = all_historic_data[~msk]\r\n\r\nHowever, if I don&#39;t want a random number and I try this:\r\n\r\n    msk = range(len(all_historic_data)) &lt; percent_of_data\r\n    \r\nI get an error:\r\n\r\n    TypeError: &#39;&lt;&#39; not supported between instances of &#39;range&#39; and &#39;float&#39;\r\n\r\nHow do I get a fixed `array` where the number of entries of `True` to `False` ratio is exactly `percent_of_data`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032681/get-a-mask-of-len-of-true-false-array","title":"Get a mask of len of True/False array"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","text"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":166592,"user_id":87189,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98e7d6edce863e7a1bf8199b082eb25e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tadman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/87189/tadman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569000618,"post_id":58032676,"comment_id":102467854,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032676/mysql-row-size-too-large-8126#comment102467854_58032676"},{"owner":{"reputation":62932,"user_id":205608,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bc0b9dbb708d97e5e7293f9597ad9c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"O.

I&#39;ll point you to the right documentation to look at.\r\n\r\nFirst, you&#39;ll want to use the [Teams OAuth Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/46.teams-auth). I&#39;ve got [a PR](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/038df5bfa3c97c2dea8858f6a3ee3e1e6272dd41/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/46.teams-auth/README.md#to-try-this-sample) in place to add instructions for getting it to work properly, but the gist of it is:\r\n\r\n1. [Add Authentication to your Bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&amp;tabs=csharp%2Cbot-oauth)\r\n2. Add your OAuth Connection Name to the `ConenctionName` key in `appsettings.json` (along with appid/password)\r\n3. [Enable the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)\r\n4. [Install your Bot to Teams via App Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-app-studio), ensuring that you&#39;ve added `token.botframework.com` to the [Valid Domains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#validdomains) (Note: In App Studio, this is in `Manifest Editor &gt; Your App &gt; Domains and Permissions`)\r\n\r\nOnce authenticated, it will return a token and will validate it for each message. If you have a specific OAuth provider that isn&#39;t listed in the OAuth Settings blade in the Azure Portal, and if they have a free trial, let me know and I can help you test it. The key is that after you enter the settings, you save and click the &quot;Test&quot; button to make sure it works in the Azure Portal before adding it to your bot.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032637/how-can-i-use-bot-builder-to-make-an-authenticated-request-to-a-third-party-serv/58067829#58067829","title":"How can I use Bot Builder to make an authenticated request to a third party service?"}],"owner":{"reputation":518,"user_id":1600655,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/827196bc5d841d854c47ce9422fe066e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"garie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1600655/garie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":518,"user_id":1600655,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/827196bc5d841d854c47ce9422fe066e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"garie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1600655/garie"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58067829,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569261592,"creation_date":1568999527,"last_edit_date":1569007583,"question_id":58032637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032637","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating a Microsoft Teams bot that will allow a user to log in with a third-party OAuth and make authenticated requests to a non-Microsoft web service. I am able to use an `OAuthPrompt` to log in with my third-party OAuth provider, using a connection set up in Azure Bot Services. When I authenticate, I receive a guid which is presumably a key that corresponds to my OAuth token in the Bot Framework Token Service.\r\n\r\nI am unclear on how to use this guid to make authenticated requests against my web service. The [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) states (emphasis mine):\r\n&gt; To perform certain operations on behalf of a user ... the bot will need to call an external service, such as the Microsoft Graph, GitHub, or **a company&#39;s REST service**. Each external services has a way of securing those calls, and a common way to secure such a call is to issue those requests using a user token that uniquely identifies the user on that external service (sometimes referred to as a JWT).\r\n\r\nThis documentation indicates to me that it should be possible to use make authenticated requests to my web service via the Bot Token Framework Service or that it should be possible to retrieve my OAuth token to make authenticated requests directly to my service from my bot. I cannot find any example of anyone doing this, and have spent days looking through documentation and the botbuilder source repositories.\r\n\r\nThe bot should response to messages or actions from the user with results from the web service.

There is no need to &quot;hide&quot; the element as is usually done in vanilla JS or jQuery, React will handle that based on the `state` or props that contain information about which pieces are on the board.\r\n\r\nYou need to send an identifier to the piece in order to have a callback for the Parent component to update the state based on the pieces:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// constructor:\r\n\r\nthis.state = {\r\n  pieces: [&quot;pawn&quot;, &quot;rook&quot;, &quot;queen&quot;]\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\n// render:\r\n\r\n{ this.state.pieces.map((piece, i) =&gt; (\r\n  &lt;Piece type={piece} onClick={() =&gt; this.deletePiece(i)} /&gt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Here&#39;s a codesandbox of a working example.][1]\r\n\r\n(**Note:** Ideally pieces would have an ID instead of just an index to avoid re-renders, but the important part of the example is to see how the variable `i` allows the callback to delete the piece back in the parent component) \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codesandbox.io/embed/thirsty-jackson-wh6kz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032628/react-accessing-the-component-that-triggered-a-synthetic-event/58035493#58035493","title":"React: accessing the component that triggered a synthetic event"}],"owner":{"reputation":2926,"user_id":1927589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFUiX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James Newton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927589/james-newton"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569015945,"creation_date":1568999460,"question_id":58032628,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032628","body_markdown":"I am creating a game using React. The game uses a `&lt;Board /&gt;` component and several `&lt;Piece /&gt;` components, which display `&lt;img&gt;` HTML&#160;elements. When the player clicks on a Piece, it is removed from the Board. Something like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Board&gt;\r\n      &lt;Piece /&gt;\r\n      &lt;Piece /&gt;\r\n      &lt;Piece /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Board&gt;\r\n\r\nI have attached an `onClick` event listener to the Board. I can use `event.target` to get the `&lt;img&gt;`&#160;element that the player clicked on. It is very easy to use `event.target.classList.add(&quot;removed&quot;)` and to create a CSS rule that hides all elements with the &quot;removed&quot; class:\r\n\r\n    .removed {\r\n      display: none;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, this seems to violate the principles of React. I imagine that it would be better to modify the Board&#39;s `state` property, so that when it the Board component is rendered, none of the &quot;removed&quot; Pieces are shown.\r\n\r\nThis means that I need to obtain a pointer to the Piece component whose `&lt;img&gt;` element was clicked. I had expected to find such a pointer in the synthetic event that React generates, but no.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I maintain two arrays: one with the `state` data for each Piece component, and one containing a pointer to each `&lt;img&gt;` element. I find the index of the `&lt;img&gt;` element in the second array, and make changes to an object in the `state` array at the same index. But this feels like a hack.\r\n\r\nIs there a more React-y way to approach this issue?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032628/react-accessing-the-component-that-triggered-a-synthetic-event","title":"React: accessing the component that triggered a synthetic event"},{"tags":["android"],"owner":{"reputation":331,"user_id":492628,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":30,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93bfe9042479fb1ff535295b2a18bb5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Negar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/492628/negar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568999455,"creation_date":1568999455,"question_id":58032626,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032626","body_markdown":"I have a very strange problem during install my apk file on android device from filemanager, some information are:\r\n\r\n 1.

have some experience with Jenkins and have started using Jenkinsfiles in the past year, but, I&#39;ve come across something I haven&#39;t been able to explain (or maybe I just haven&#39;t come across it yet in the docs).\r\n\r\nI have a Jenkinsfile as part of a multi-branch pipeline. In that Jenkinsfile, I basically have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npipeline {\r\n  agent any\r\n\r\n  stages {\r\n    stage(&#39;Checkout&#39;) {\r\n      checkout(...)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    stage(&#39;Build&#39;) {\r\n      agent {\r\n        docker {\r\n          image &#39;maven:3-alpine&#39;\r\n          args &#39;...&#39;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      steps {\r\n        sh &#39;mvn -B clean package&#39;\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen executed, the &quot;Build&quot; stage pulls down the branch based on the branch I&#39;m executing the Jenkinsfile in, and overwrites the previously-checked out branch from the &quot;Checkout&quot; stage (which is a different branch).\r\n\r\nNow, if I move the &quot;Checkout&quot; steps into the &quot;Build&quot; stage immediately before the Maven sh command, it works, but I notice that the stage is first still pulling down the branch as described above, and then the &quot;Checkout&quot; steps now overwrite that branch.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#39;m guessing that there&#39;s something special about this particular &quot;Build&quot; stage that I&#39;m missing, as I&#39;ve used this particular methodology before with other projects, the only real differences being in other ones there was no agent specified and it wasn&#39;t Java-based (not that I think that has anything to do with it).\r\n\r\nAny insight would be appreciated as I&#39;d like to not just apply this &quot;workaround&quot; and rather get it right.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032609/jenkins-checking-out-repo-overtop-of-previously-checked-out-code-from-jenkinsfil","title":"Jenkins Checking out Repo overtop of Previously Checked Out Code from Jenkinsfile"},{"tags":["databricks","azure-databricks"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12096628,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC3lBPiJ_PRWoaEJvHtX4bFs_OUK9hyFVR8rQl8bQ=k-s128","display_name":"wsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096628/wsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569006340,"post_id":58033069,"comment_id":102469952,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032608/azure-databricks-display-function-is-not-showing-plotting-options/58033069#comment102469952_58033069"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12096628,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC3lBPiJ_PRWoaEJvHtX4bFs_OUK9hyFVR8rQl8bQ=k-s128","display_name":"wsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096628/wsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569006600,"post_id":58033069,"comment_id":102470033,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032608/azure-databricks-display-function-is-not-showing-plotting-options/58033069#comment102470033_58033069"},{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":11006647,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ha7Y9aXd2DE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQOJlFcxf7UUAOwZpwzHMEZMU08O0A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Goldengenova","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11006647/goldengenova"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12096628,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC3lBPiJ_PRWoaEJvHtX4bFs_OUK9hyFVR8rQl8bQ=k-s128","display_name":"wsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096628/wsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569006878,"post_id":58033069,"comment_id":102470122,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032608/azure-databricks-display-function-is-not-showing-plotting-options/58033069#comment102470122_58033069"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12096628,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC3lBPiJ_PRWoaEJvHtX4bFs_OUK9hyFVR8rQl8bQ=k-s128","display_name":"wsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096628/wsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569023640,"post_id":58033069,"comment_id":102474152,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032608/azure-databricks-display-function-is-not-showing-plotting-options/58033069#comment102474152_58033069"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":11006647,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ha7Y9aXd2DE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQOJlFcxf7UUAOwZpwzHMEZMU08O0A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Goldengenova","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11006647/goldengenova"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569001805,"creation_date":1569001805,"answer_id":58033069,"question_id":58032608,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58033069","body_markdown":"What kind of plot are you looking for?

My recommendation is to use one of these alternatives to setting the proxy directly in your code using selenium.\r\n\r\n 1. Set the proxy with credentials on the host machine - just be careful to turn the proxy off when you don&#39;t need it or to set it up in a virtual machine that you only use with the proxy. that is how they recommend doing it on the selenium website: https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#using-a-proxy\r\n 2. Use Luminati Proxy manager (https://github.com/luminati-io/luminati-proxy) to set up a proxy port that does not require authentication and passes the traffic on with your proxy credentials.\r\n 3. Use puppeteer to handle headless chrome (https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/) as the puppeteer library comes with the right version of chromium and is much easier to get started with.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032604/python-selenium-chromedriver-authenticate-luminati-proxy/58058348#58058348","title":"Python selenium chromedriver authenticate luminati proxy?"}],"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":8635371,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iGTWTNDjap0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIw/Ck8Gc5i4Hhs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abhimanyu Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8635371/abhimanyu-singh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58058348,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569226960,"creation_date":1568999274,"question_id":58032604,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032604","body_markdown":"Hi I am using selenium chromedriver and using luminati proxy with it.\r\nBut I cant figure out how to set proxy username and password.\r\n\r\nI have tried this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport random\r\nfrom selenium import webdriver\r\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\r\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\r\nfrom selenium.webdriver import DesiredCapabilities\r\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\r\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\r\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.proxy import Proxy, ProxyType, ProxyTypeFactory\r\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\r\n\r\nusername = &#39;lum-customer-XXXX-static&#39;\r\npassword = &#39;XXXXXX&#39;\r\nport = 22225\r\nsession_id = random.random()\r\nsuper_proxy_url = (&#39;http://%s-session-%s:%s@zproxy.lum-superproxy.io:%d&#39; %(username, session_id, password, port))\r\n\r\nproxy = Proxy()\r\nproxy.http_proxy = proxy_url\r\nproxy.ftp_proxy = proxy_url\r\nproxy.ssl_proxy = proxy_url\r\nproxy.no_proxy = &quot;localhost&quot;\r\nproxy.proxy_type = ProxyType.MANUAL\r\n\r\nchromedriver_path = &#39;/usr/local/share/chromedriver&#39; # Change this to your own chromedriver path!\r\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chromedriver_path,chrome_options=chrome_options)\r\ndriver.get(&quot;https://whatismyipaddress.com/&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut Is not connecting to my the proxy server.\r\nI have also tried desired_capabilities.

have a generic interface which I want to implement in my code all round though the implementation may vary at some inheritance level.Why I&#39;m doing this is because I have been writing this code for every single project I have been making and I&#39;m bored of writing the same code with some little or no tweaks all the time.\r\n\r\nI created this interface:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n// A generic interface for implementing the basic database operations.\r\n// This interface can easily be implemented with custom user logic.\r\n// The KId generic parameter is the primary key of the associated entity and the TEntity\r\n// refers to the entity type.\r\n// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n// &lt;typeparam name = &quot;K&quot; &gt; The primary key of the entity.&lt;/typeparam&gt;\r\n// &lt;typeparam name = &quot;TEntity&quot; &gt; The type of entity.&lt;/typeparam&gt;\r\npublic interface IGenericEntity&lt;K, TEntity&gt;\r\n{\r\n    // ........Definition codes...............\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough I can implement this in all my Service Implementation classes at different levels but I may be writing some things which are the same in the other Service Implementations.\r\n\r\nI now decided to create this class called `GenericEntityImplementation` which I will Implement the IGenericEntity.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public class GenericEntityImplementation&lt;K, TEntity, TDbContext&gt; : \r\n        IGenericEntity&lt;K, TEntity&gt; where TDbContext : DbContext\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly TDbContext _DbContext;\r\n\r\n        public GenericEntityImplementation(TDbContext DbContext)\r\n        {\r\n            _DbContext = DbContext;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n/*1 */  public virtual async Task&lt;OperationResult&gt; DeleteAsync(Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; expression)\r\n/*2 */  {\r\n/*3 */      Task TaskResult = await _DbContext.Set&lt;TEntity&gt;().RemoveRange&lt;TEntity&gt;(expression);\r\n/*4 */      if (TaskResult.Status == TaskStatus.RanToCompletion)\r\n/*5 */      {\r\n/*6 */          return new OperationResult()\r\n/*7 */          {\r\n/*8 */              Message = &quot;&quot;,\r\n/*9 */              ReturnObject = null,\r\n/*10*/              Status = OperationStatus.Deleted,\r\n/*11*/              Succeeded = true\r\n/*12*/          };\r\n/*13*/      }\r\n/*14*/  }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`K` is the key type  \r\n`TEntity` could be the database class or rather database table to be scaffolded  \r\n`TDbContext` is of type `DbContext` as can be seen above.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen above I have passed a virtual DbContext into the class which I want to perform all the database operations at this layer.But since I&#39;ve been trying, but as can be seen on line 3, the editor shows me that my code has some problems (underlined red).\r\n\r\nMy question is can someone explain to me how I can tell the DbContext passed to the class the type of entity I am trying to refer to at any instance like I can do in the code below?\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ViewDbContext : IdentityDbContext\r\n{\r\n    public HotelDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;HotelDbContext&gt; options) : base(options)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public DbSet&lt;View&gt; Views { get; set;

= DbContext;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public virtual bool Any()\r\n    {\r\n        return _DbContext.Views.Any() ? true : false;\r\n

If you want to update your existing map to the same order, then you can do: `map..clear()..addAll(newMap);` afterwards.\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid the extra map, you can delete keys and re-add them instead.\r\n\r\n    for (var key in [&quot;Due Today&quot;, &quot;Overdue&quot;, &quot;Future&quot;]) {\r\n       if (map.containsKey(key)) {\r\n         var value = map[key];\r\n         map.delete(key);\r\n         map[key] = value;\r\n       }\r\n    }  \r\n\r\nThis should remove and re-add each key, if it&#39;s there at all, in the order you want them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032554/how-to-rearrange-map-keys-in-dart/58033776#58033776","title":"How to rearrange map keys in dart?"}],"owner":{"reputation":149,"user_id":6081174,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":18,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3oeRb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maulik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6081174/maulik"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569475532,"creation_date":1568999017,"question_id":58032554,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032554","body_markdown":"I have a map like below :\r\n\r\n    {\r\n     &quot;Future&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;accountId&quot;: 57,\r\n      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Inez&quot;,\r\n      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Mitchell&quot;,\r\n      &quot;middleName&quot;: &quot;J&quot;,\r\n     }\r\n    ],\r\n    &quot;Overdue&quot;: [\r\n     {\r\n      &quot;accountId&quot;: 5,\r\n      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Mak&quot;,\r\n      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Mitchell&quot;,\r\n      &quot;middleName&quot;: &quot;M&quot;,\r\n     }\r\n    ],\r\n    &quot;Due Today&quot;: [\r\n     {\r\n      &quot;accountId&quot;: 59,\r\n      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Jack&quot;,\r\n      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Daniel&quot;,\r\n      &quot;middleName&quot;: &quot;P&quot;,\r\n     }\r\n    ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand wanted the map like in below order, Due Today first, Overdue 2nd and Future at last.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n      {\r\n      &quot;Due Today&quot;: [\r\n     {\r\n      &quot;accountId&quot;: 59,\r\n      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Jack&quot;,\r\n      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Daniel&quot;,\r\n      &quot;middleName&quot;: &quot;P&quot;,\r\n     }\r\n    ],\r\n    &quot;Overdue&quot;: [\r\n     {\r\n      &quot;accountId&quot;: 5,\r\n      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Mak&quot;,\r\n      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Mitchell&quot;,\r\n      &quot;middleName&quot;: &quot;M&quot;,\r\n     }\r\n    ],&quot;Future&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;accountId&quot;: 57,\r\n      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Inez&quot;,\r\n      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Mitchell&quot;,\r\n      &quot;middleName&quot;: &quot;J&quot;,\r\n     }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n also these keys in length are 3 but sometimes we got only two of them means Due Today and Future but we have to make sure order is like 1.

you can see from the `Exception`, the problem is when `Long.parseLong()` is being called from inside `Color.parseColor()`.\r\n\r\nThis `Exception` is due to wrong input being given to **Long.parseLong()** which is an extra character of `#`, which should normally be removed by `Color.parseColor()` before internally calling `Long.parseLong()`.\r\n\r\nThe `Exception` thrown by your code can demonstrated below:\r\n\r\n\tString str = &quot;#837A67&quot;;\r\n\tSystem.out.println(Long.parseLong(str, 16));\r\n\r\nWhere `16` is the RADIX for hexadecimal.  \r\n\r\nBut try this:\r\n\r\n\tString str = &quot;837A67&quot;;\r\n\tSystem.out.println(Long.parseLong(str, 16));\r\n\r\nAnd you will get the expected results.  \r\n\r\nThis shows that the `String` getting passed through `parseColor` is not correct because the `#` is not getting removed during `Color.parseColor()` most likely due to a _different_ character getting removed instead.  \r\n\r\nDouble check into the value you are passing to `Color.parseColor()` and ensure there are not any characters before the `#`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032535/parsing-color-no-longer-working-with-hex-values/58032683#58032683","title":"Parsing color no longer working with hex

- \r\nThe correct solution can be found [here](https://codepen.io/swank/pen/zYOyOda). Going off of [Taplar&#39;s](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1586174/taplar) suggestion. I made two additional classes that duplicate the active and inactive but with !important property.\r\n\r\n**Original Post**\r\n\r\nI am new to the coding world and am going crazy trying to figure this out. I found and am trying to modify this code posted at [Codepen][1].\r\n\r\nOn load, I would like to have .premium display as &#39;active&#39; and have .standard and .platinum display as &#39;inactive&#39;. Then on mouseover(), rearrange the classes so that what is being moused-over would have the &#39;active&#39; class and the others &#39;inactive&#39;. Lastly, when mouseleave() is triggered reset each div to the original default active and inactive.\r\n\r\n**HTML**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;section

That&#39;s because there is a window where data can arrive on the server between the initial fetch and the live update stream.\r\n\r\nUsually, that means you either miss messages or you get duplicates that are published to both. You can eliminate duplicates by tracking some kind of id or sequence number, but that means additional coding and computation.\r\n\r\nSSE can be used for both the initial fetch and the live updates on a single stream, avoiding the aforementioned sync challenges.\r\n\r\nThe client creates an `EventSource` to initiate an SSE stream. The server responds with the data that is already there, and thereafter publishes any new data that arrives on the server.\r\n\r\nIf you want, the server can include an event-id with each message. Then if a client becomes disconnected, the SSE client will automatically reconnect with the `last-event-id`, and the data flow resumes from where it left off. On the client-side, the auto-reconnect and resume from `last-event-id` is automatic as it is spec-ed by the standard.

Though the error I received is this: \r\n\r\nError: object &#39;New.Vec&#39; not found","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032472/finding-mean-of-a-column-in-an-r-data-set-by-using-for-loops-to-remove-missing","title":"Finding Mean of a column in an R Data Set, by using FOR Loops to remove Missing Values"},{"tags":["data-science","blogs","forecasting"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11505060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2494768700570056/picture?type=large","display_name":"Vish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11505060/vish"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568998616,"creation_date":1568998616,"question_id":58032469,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032469","body_markdown":"\r\nWhich data-science journals or blog I can look at if I want to know statistical facts about Sales and Revenue forecasting?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032469/need-suggestion-where-to-look-for-statastical-facts-about-sales-and-revenue-for","title":"Need Suggestion: Where to look for statastical facts about sales and revenue forecasting?"},{"tags":["vb.net"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12096367,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GP3vkGGm3XY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcEz2mky9hWTfibOou404ef6rxzlQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"thebluearchernc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096367/thebluearchernc"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569001238,"post_id":58032467,"comment_id":102468052,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032467/vb-net-mono-spaces-in-file-names#comment102468052_58032467"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12096367,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GP3vkGGm3XY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcEz2mky9hWTfibOou404ef6rxzlQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"thebluearchernc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096367/thebluearchernc"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568998607,"creation_date":1568998607,"question_id":58032467,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032467","body_markdown":"i am creating a frontend that controls VLC using the RC intrface\r\nI am programming in VB.net as that is what I have used for decades and I am too old to change hahaha\r\nthis will be running on a raspberry pi 3 with rasbian stretch using Mono \r\nall controls are working \r\nmy problem is VLC downloads the album art using the metadata in the mp3 file\r\nand stores it in a /.cache folder and will create directories and files with spaces in the filename\r\n\r\nI seem to have no control over this\r\n\r\nwhen i try to use a picturebox to load and display the art .jpg file on the raspberry pi i get file does not exists this does not happen in the windows environment\r\nbut it is there. i also know this is related somehow to spaces in file names \r\n\r\nCan someone recommend away to solve this problem \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032467/vb-net-mono-spaces-in-file-names","title":"vb.net mono spaces in file names"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-web-api","passbook"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12096661,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8cc991bd68403821bf1ef51cfcc715b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"scentsword","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096661/scentsword"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568998602,"creation_date":1568998602,"question_id":58032465,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032465","body_markdown":"I am having problems setting up the pkpass logging endpoint.\r\n\r\nWhen registering a book on my iPhone, the table for my logs doesn&#39;t populate. \r\nHowever, when I send a post request from postman to my webServiceURL/version/logs, the data is sent as expected.\r\n\r\nReference: [Part 1: Apple Wallet Passbook RESTful Web Services Using ASP.Net](https://medium.com/@yangzhoupostbox/asp-net-web-api-example-for-apple-wallet-passbook-a124a1d90bb3)\r\n\r\nHoping someone can help me on this.
