%{&quot;2019-01&quot; =&gt; 10}, &quot;Banana Split&quot; =&gt; %{&quot;2019-01&quot; =&gt; 16}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, for the exact result you want, if you don&#39;t want the dates as keys, you can replace that line for: `|&gt; Enum.map(fn {k, v} -&gt; %{date: k, quantity: Enum.sum(v)} end)}`\r\n\r\nLeaving you with:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nEnum.map(data, fn {product, sales} -&gt;                                                                          \r\n  {\r\n    product,                                                                                                    \r\n    Enum.group_by(sales, &amp;(String.slice(&amp;1.date, 0, 7)), &amp;(&amp;1.quantity))\r\n    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {k, v} -&gt; %{date: k, quantity: Enum.sum(v)} end)}             \r\nend) |&gt; Map.new() \r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a result of:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n%{\r\n  &quot;Almond Fudge&quot; =&gt; [%{date: &quot;2019-01&quot;, quantity: 10}],\r\n  &quot;Banana Split&quot; =&gt; [%{date: &quot;2019-01&quot;, quantity: 16}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to @zwippie for pointing out to String.slice. I hadn&#39;t realized you were asking for the month. `String.slice/3` will take a string, the initial position, and the length. So Slicing the date string from 0, taking 7 digits would produce strings with the year and month.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438771/how-to-groupby-in-a-map/58439452#58439452","title":"How to groupby in a map?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12231392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pOLnAXdoPxc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reKAbhgioL6OWYb6RmutGf4YnpEjQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Siddhant Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12231392/siddhant-singh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58439452,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571342934,"creation_date":1571337081,"question_id":58438771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438771","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to filter out which item sold the most in a particular month.

is known as &quot;zipping&quot;. You can use a [**`zip :: [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [(a, b)]`**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:zip). Indeed, for example:\r\n\r\n    Prelude&gt; zip [1,2,3] [4,5,6]\r\n    [(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)]\r\n\r\nYou can implement your own `zip` through explicit recursion. If one of the two lists (or both) are empty, then the result is an empty list. If both lists are non-empty, then you should yield a 2-tuple of the two heads of the list, and recurse on the two tails.\r\n\r\nSo a program will look like:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zip&#39; ::

The goal of the gui is to enter 1 or 2, and then press the button to let the while loop run.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;windows.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;random&gt;\r\n

Create a class that implements ```ListAdapter```. (or just subclass ```ArrayAdapter```), the Adapter that backs your list.\r\n2. Define an interface in that class that contains a callback that passes an identifier for the button that was clicked. \r\n   Example:\r\n```\r\n         public interface ListButtonClickListener{\r\n                void onListButtonClicked(&lt;some identifier for the button that was clicked);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n3. Create a member variable of type ```ListButtonClickListener``` in the ```ListAdapter ```subclass created in step 1.\r\n\r\n4. In your ```Activity```, create an anonymous class implementing the ```ListButtonClickListener```. The ```onListButtonClicked()``` method will handle the specific button that was clicked using the identifier and is where you will start the ```Activity``` from.\r\n \r\n5. Set the instance of the ```ListButtonClickListener``` created in step 4 as the member variable in step 3.\r\n\r\n6. In the ```Button``` ```OnClickListener```&#39;s in your ```Adapter``` subclass, invoke the  ```onListButtonClicked()``` callback with that button&#39;s unique identifier.  The ```ListButtonClickListener``` implementation defined in step 4 will then handle the ```Activity``` launch.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438731/listview-how-to-go-to-a-new-activity-on-clicking-a-button-in-the-listview/58439144#58439144","title":"ListView: How to go to a new activity on clicking a button in the ListView?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12174610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAKpoCeP13Bj2qWmr8Sag6RtASrVrbMe3u-i0WAzA=k-s128","display_name":"SuDz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12174610/sudz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12735,"user_id":4860513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zNzBp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"W0rmH0le","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4860513/w0rmh0le"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58439000,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571339290,"creation_date":1571336910,"last_edit_date":1571338188,"question_id":58438731,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438731","body_markdown":"I have a ListView on MainActivity and each item contains a textView and a button.\r\n\r\nI want to go to an Activity(say X) on clicking the button in the list.\r\nSo my first thought was to setOnClickListener for the button in my custom adapter and use intent to go to activity X.\r\nI wrote this inside `setOnClickListener` of button in the custom adapter:\r\n\r\n`Intent intent = new Intent(MainAcivity.this, ActivityX.class);`\r\n\r\n\r\nI can not pass `MainActivity.this` as the first parameter for the intent as it is not the enclosing class.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nMy goal is to go from `MainActivity` to `ActivityX` on clicking the button inside of a `ListView`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438731/listview-how-to-go-to-a-new-activity-on-clicking-a-button-in-the-listview","title":"ListView: How to go to a new activity on clicking a button in the ListView?"},{"tags":["winapi","hook","detours"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1578,"user_id":2440728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fWyQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VuVirt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2440728/vuvirt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571337871,"post_id":58438730,"comment_id":103217621,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438730/how-to-apply-detours-hook#comment103217621_58438730"},{"owner":{"reputation":367768,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571341904,"post_id":58438730,"comment_id":103219298,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438730/how-to-apply-detours-hook#comment103219298_58438730"},{"owner":{"reputation":367768,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1571342145,"post_id":58438730,"comment_id":103219411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438730/how-to-apply-detours-hook#comment103219411_58438730"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12097044,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4262bad179488ade2278093151e1bbe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max_ReFactor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097044/max-refactor"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571382072,"post_id":58438730,"comment_id":103229554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438730/how-to-apply-detours-hook#comment103229554_58438730"},{"owner":{"reputation":176,"user_id":11737733,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jPKyG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeffrey Shao -

The problem is that 1) text reference definitions are displayed upon rendering to pdf (they should not), 2) text references do not work - calling them results only in the text of the call (not the referenced text) being displayed, and 3) references to table and figures does not work as it does with `bookdown::pdf_document2` output. How can I either get the author and page numbers in `bookdown::pdf_document2` output or else get the references to work in `rticles::elsevier_article`?\r\n\r\nBelow is an example that illustrates the issue. I&#39;m using RStudio 1.2.1335.\r\n\r\n````\r\n---\r\ntitle: Problems with `rticles::elsevier_article` output \r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Alice Anonymous\r\n    email: alice@example.com\r\n    affiliation: Some Institute of Technology\r\n    footnote: Corresponding Author\r\n  - name: Bob Security\r\n    email: bob@example.com\r\n    affiliation: Another University\r\naddress:\r\n  - code: Some Institute of Technology\r\n    address: Department, Street, City, State, Zip\r\n  - code: Another University\r\n    address: Department, Street, City, State, Zip\r\nabstract: |\r\n  This is the abstract.\r\n\r\njournal: &quot;Ecological Monographs&quot;\r\ndate: &quot;`r Sys.Date()`&quot;\r\ncsl: elsevier-harvard.csl\r\noutput: rticles::elsevier_article\r\n#output:bookdown::pdf_document2\r\ngeometry: margin=2.54cm\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe Problems I have\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nI would like to use the `rticles::elsevier_article` output because it 1) handles authors and affiliations the way I want, and 2) it nicely omits the page number from the firat page. Both of these things I can&#39;t seem to easily (if at all) accomplish using `bookdown::pdf_document2` output. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I specify `rticles::elsevier_article` output, I run into several problems: 1) text reference definitions are displayed upon rendering to pdf (they should not), 2) text references do not work - calling them results only in the text of the call (not the referenced text) being displayed, and 3) references to table and figures does not work as it does with `bookdown::pdf_document2` output. There is one more issue too - in one test case I inserted a table (using `kableExtra`), and knitting failed because of some latex `tabu` environment error, even though it looks to me like the `rticles::elsevier_article` output does indeed load the `tabu` package (but I had to load it in the YAML header to get the knitting to work). \r\n\r\nFor example, lets define a text reference so I can use a super script 2 to specify square kilometers in a figure caption. The reference definition should not show in the rendered pdf (and it does not when I use the `bookdown::pdf_document2` output, but it frustratingly does so when I use the `rticles::elsevier_article` output).\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- text references for use in tables and captions (must be separated by empty line)--&gt;\r\n(ref:km2) km^2^\r\n\r\nNow lets make a figure (below) and reference it here (Figure \\@ref(fig:testfig)). The figure includes the text reference in the caption, but it does not display the referenced text, but only the exact text that is suppose to call the reference text. And my inline reference to the figure does not work.\r\n\r\n```{r,testfig, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 3, fig.align = &quot;center&quot;,fig.cap=paste0(&quot;This is a classic quadratic plot - it could represent &quot;,&quot;(ref:km2)&quot;,&quot;.&quot;)}\r\n\r\nx=-5:5\r\n\r\nplot(x,x**2,xlab=&quot;my assets&quot;, ylab=&quot;my joy&quot;, main=&quot;Not true&quot;)\r\n\t\r\n```\r\n````","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438723/author-affiliations-in-rmarkdown-yaml-header-using-rticles","title":"Author affiliations in Rmarkdown YAML header, using rticles"},{"tags":["asp.net","single-page-application"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":913,"user_id":1001919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ebabc4cc32e4304bdaa2d1a57c0c767?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"forX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1001919/forx"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24902,"user_id":1139830,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ee9qe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1139830/mason"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571405383,"post_id":58439167,"comment_id":103241435,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438721/adding-server-side-code-in-single-page-application/58439167#comment103241435_58439167"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":913,"user_id":1001919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ebabc4cc32e4304bdaa2d1a57c0c767?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"forX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1001919/forx"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571338837,"creation_date":1571338837,"answer_id":58439167,"question_id":58438721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58439167","body_markdown":"I first change my web.config to process html file.\r\n[Enabling processed asp net][1]\r\n\r\nAfter just need to use \r\n[embedded .net tag][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://leedjones.co.uk/enabling-html-files-to-be-processed-by-the-asp-net-pipeline/\r\n  [2]: https://weblogs.asp.net/ahmedmoosa/embedded-code-and-inline-server-tags\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n    &lt;system.web&gt;\r\n      &lt;compilation debug=&quot;true&quot; targetFramework=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;buildProviders&gt;\r\n          &lt;add extension =&quot;.html&quot; type=&quot;System.Web.Compilation.PageBuildProvider&quot;/&gt;\r\n          &lt;add extension =&quot;.htm&quot; type=&quot;System.Web.Compilation.PageBuildProvider&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/buildProviders&gt;\r\n      &lt;/compilation&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;system.webServer&gt;\r\n            &lt;handlers&gt;\r\n                &lt;add name=&quot;HTML&quot; path=&quot;*.html&quot; verb=&quot;GET, HEAD, POST, DEBUG&quot;\r\n                     type=&quot;System.Web.UI.PageHandlerFactory&quot; resourceType=&quot;Unspecified&quot; requireAccess=&quot;Script&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;add name=&quot;HTM&quot; path=&quot;*.htm&quot; verb=&quot;GET, HEAD, POST, DEBUG&quot;\r\n                     type=&quot;System.Web.UI.PageHandlerFactory&quot; resourceType=&quot;Unspecified&quot; requireAccess=&quot;Script&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;/handlers&gt;\r\n        &lt;/system.webServer&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/system.web&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438721/adding-server-side-code-in-single-page-application/58439167#58439167","title":"Adding server side code in single page application"}],"owner":{"reputation":913,"user_id":1001919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ebabc4cc32e4304bdaa2d1a57c0c767?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"forX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1001919/forx"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571338837,"creation_date":1571336872,"question_id":58438721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438721","body_markdown":"I have a single page application, in .net 4 but created from empty web application (Application web ASP.NET .NET Framework -&gt; empty project).

Is it an issue with how my tabs are named?\r\n\r\n    =SUMPRODUCT(COUNTIF(INDIRECT( &quot;&#39;&quot;&amp; A1:A3 &amp;&quot;&#39;!F2:F1000&quot;),&quot;Pass&quot;))\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLLLK.png\r\n\r\nI am not looking for a VBA solution.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438719/countif-across-multiple-renamed-worksheets","title":"COUNTIF Across Multiple &quot;renamed&quot; worksheets"},{"tags":["javascript","html","bootstrap-4"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":842,"user_id":381124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLvil.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mike Poole","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/381124/mike-poole"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571337235,"post_id":58438717,"comment_id":103217356,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438717/why-does-it-not-add-to-cart-when-i-click-add-to-cart#comment103217356_58438717"},{"owner":{"reputation":842,"user_id":381124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLvil.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mike Poole","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/381124/mike-poole"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571337502,"post_id":58438717,"comment_id":103217474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438717/why-does-it-not-add-to-cart-when-i-click-add-to-cart#comment103217474_58438717"},{"owner":{"reputation":414,"user_id":2837277,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c8871b94d93ba5ac9411c106a496e88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"King11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2837277/king11"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571341308,"post_id":58438717,"comment_id":103219054,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438717/why-does-it-not-add-to-cart-when-i-click-add-to-cart#comment103219054_58438717"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":2229399,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/978a8ab4595244f5acb08e0c07240a1a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2229399","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2229399/user2229399"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571342427,"post_id":58439922,"comment_id":103219521,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438717/why-does-it-not-add-to-cart-when-i-click-add-to-cart/58439922#comment103219521_58439922"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12229230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f76f59a61068d784a5c9f38faa283683?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NhungN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12229230/nhungn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571344067,"post_id":58439922,"comment_id":103220226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438717/why-does-it-not-add-to-cart-when-i-click-add-to-cart/58439922#comment103220226_58439922"},{"owner":{"reputation":414,"user_id":2837277,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c8871b94d93ba5ac9411c106a496e88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"King11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2837277/king11"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571344173,"post_id":58439922,"comment_id":103220271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438717/why-does-it-not-add-to-cart-when-i-click-add-to-cart/58439922#comment103220271_58439922"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":2229399,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/978a8ab4595244f5acb08e0c07240a1a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2229399","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2229399/user2229399"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571342334,"creation_date":1571342334,"answer_id":58439922,"question_id":58438717,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58439922","body_markdown":"I see 2 issues from the code snippet you have given.\r\n\r\nIssue 1 - You are loading script.js (I assume that is where you have your page level scripting code) before loading jquery.\r\n\r\nSolution - Move the jquery reference to the above and move script.js reference below.\r\n\r\n1. jQuery\r\n2.

All the changes you make are made to the temp copy. When you save, it replaces the file you opened with the temp copy thereby &quot;writing&quot; your changes to disk. If you close without saving, it simply deletes the temp copy.\r\n\r\nWhen you send as an attachment, unsaved changes are included in the attachment. But the workbook is not &quot;saved&quot; at that point because if you try to close it, Excel will prompt you to save your changes.\r\n\r\nWhat if, when you Save and Send - Send as Attachment, Excel simply attaches the temp copy and names the attachment the same as the opened workbook. In fact, since you can attach a workbook that&#39;s never been saved before, it must be using the temp copy.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s my theory on why it&#39;s happening the way it is. What to do about it? I&#39;m not sure. I think I would figure out how to hijack the Send as Attachment function in the Ribbon&#39;s Backstage to force a save or to simply not allow this workbook to be sent without saving.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to go that route, search for Excel Ribbon File Backstage and you should find some instructions on how to modify that particular function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438675/beforesave-and-aftersave-ignored-when-saving-as-attachment/58440976#58440976","title":"Beforesave and Aftersave ignored when saving as attachment"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":12234542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqr34eOfdhQmjbwSMaT8cYtMr2w93u7eBrJs8hdg=k-s128","display_name":"The Cats Meow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234542/the-cats-meow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23,"user_id":12234542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqr34eOfdhQmjbwSMaT8cYtMr2w93u7eBrJs8hdg=k-s128","display_name":"The Cats Meow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234542/the-cats-meow"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58440976,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571347874,"creation_date":1571336686,"last_edit_date":1571345410,"question_id":58438675,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438675","body_markdown":"I have some code that I have put in Workbook_AfterSave and Workbook_BeforeSave.

customers = {one, two, three};\r\n\r\nNow we can loop over the elements and print out if the cities are the same:\r\n\r\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; customers.size(); ++i)\r\n    {\r\n      for(int j = 0;

If a player does not have stats then just ignore them and print only those with stats. \r\n\r\nHow can I print something like below: If `id` on players matches with `id` on stats, then I have to print stats like below. Couldn&#39;t even start. Any hint or answer would be great help. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I define a Gridspec like so: \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport matplotlib.gridspec as grd\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))\r\ngs = grd.GridSpec(2, 1, wspace=0, hspace=0,

10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then plot a point on the edge of one of the subplots that share a border, \r\n```\r\nfirst.scatter(5, 5)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\nthe point gets clipped on the border and only the top half of the scatter circle is displayed. Is there a way for the point to show up across the border? (Adding `clip_on=False` doesn&#39;t affect the outcome).\r\n\r\nA partial solution is to set `second.patch.set_alpha(0)` so that the second half of the scatter point appears. The issue with this is that in my original plot, each subplot has a background color set with \r\n\r\n```\r\nsecond.axhspan(*second.get_ylim(), facecolor=&#39;red&#39;, alpha=0.5)\r\n```\r\nand so even if I set the axes background to transparent with `second.patch.set_alpha(0)`, the overlapping scatter point will now have half of it be covered in a 0.5 alpha color, which I don&#39;t want. Put simply, I want the scatter points to have zorder higher than anything else, including surrounding subplots. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe only other solution I&#39;ve thought of (if there&#39;s truly no easy way to do this), would be to overlay a transparent axes over the entire figure, and plot my scatter points there. The reason I don&#39;t want to do that is because in reality, my Gridspec is very complicated and combines several non-linear y-axes, and thus mapping points from absolute coordinates to relative figure coordinates would be quite difficult. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438652/scatter-points-on-subplot-edge-within-gridspec-get-clipped","title":"Scatter points on subplot edge within Gridspec get clipped"},{"tags":["jquery","vue.js","animation","transition"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":396,"user_id":871404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67510f33edd5a7407a04ec77e31487e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"drake035","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/871404/drake035"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571432466,"creation_date":1571432466,"answer_id":58458151,"question_id":58438650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58458151","body_markdown":"This can&#39;t work with `v-if` because then the content isn&#39;t there on page load and it takes time for Vue to summon it which prevents the CSS animation to work properly.\r\n\r\nInstead, `v-show` must be used so that the content is already there in the DOM.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438650/replicating-jquery-slidedown-with-vue/58458151#58458151","title":"Replicating jQuery&#39; slideDown() with Vue"}],"owner":{"reputation":396,"user_id":871404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67510f33edd5a7407a04ec77e31487e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"drake035","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/871404/drake035"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571432466,"creation_date":1571336576,"question_id":58438650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438650","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to apply [this example][1] to make my content appear, upon clicking a button, with a vertical slide animation similar to jQuery&#39; slideUp/slideDown.\r\n\r\nMy content is inside some `Portfolio` component that I call thus:\r\n\r\n    &lt;portfolio v-if=&quot;portfolioOpen&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nClicking a button toggles variable `portfolioOpen` from `false` to `true`, then in my Portfolio component I have this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;style lang=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;\r\n      .portfolio-enter-active,\r\n      .portfolio-leave-active {\r\n         transition: all 100ms ease-in 0s\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      .portfolio-enter-to,\r\n      .portfolio-leave {\r\n         max-height: 1000px;\r\n         overflow: hidden;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      .portfolio-enter,\r\n      .portfolio-leave-to {\r\n         overflow: hidden;\r\n         max-height: 0;\r\n      }\r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find any difference between this and the pen mentioned above.

I had to choose one NOSQL data structure and study it myself. I chose Graph databases and did a little project to show my skills. I had to build a database in Neo4J based on a relational database. \r\n\r\nThe project focusses on bikes that you can use and put back at different stations around the city of Antwerp. Something most of the big cities have. There are 3 types of nodes in my database. First of all, there are rides. A ride consists of a rideId, a startTime, an endtime, a startLockId, and an endLockId. Then there are stations where you can put the bikes. Every ride has a startlock and an endlock. So there are also 2 types of relations between these nodes. One where the ride leaves, and one where it arrives. A station consists of a lockId, a street and a number (the housenumber). Each station is situated in a certain district in Antwerp. the districts consist of just a name. There are a total of 7 districts in the database.\r\n\r\nThere are certain queries I had to write to show my skills in Neo4J, but there is one that I just can&#39;t find. The question asks: &quot;What districts have the most rides between them?&quot;. \r\n\r\nCurrently I came to this query which lists up the beginning and end district of all rides:\r\n\r\n    MATCH (d1:District)&lt;--(s1:Station)&lt;--(r:Ride)--&gt;(s2:Station)--&gt;(d2:District) \r\n    WHERE d1.Name &lt;&gt; d2.Name \r\n    RETURN d1, d2\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been searching the internet, and I&#39;ve been trying with COUNT(), ORDER BY() and COLLECT() methodes, but can&#39;t seem to find the solution, or come closer to it.

I have declared my instance variables and have made a constructor for assigning starter and main course but I can&#39;t seem to display it. Any help will be appreciated and if you could explain what your code does that will hugely help me out!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438616/object-oriented-programming-java","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"Object oriented programming - java"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","zsh","pipenv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571336461,"post_id":58438609,"comment_id":103217009,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438609/how-to-set-user-path-permanently-on-mac-os-catalina-zsh-shell#comment103217009_58438609"},{"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571343024,"post_id":58438609,"comment_id":103219788,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438609/how-to-set-user-path-permanently-on-mac-os-catalina-zsh-shell#comment103219788_58438609"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12234473,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBvZSIVr9gMV5UaTKQNKhREXJvgrbmuVEC8BBO5yQ=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"tundebosoro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234473/tundebosoro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571348086,"post_id":58438643,"comment_id":103221685,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438609/how-to-set-user-path-permanently-on-mac-os-catalina-zsh-shell/58438643#comment103221685_58438643"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571336544,"creation_date":1571336544,"answer_id":58438643,"question_id":58438609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58438643","body_markdown":"If you&#39;re using Homebrew, then another option is to install `pipenv` like so:\r\n\r\n`brew install pipenv`\r\n\r\nThis installs it globally.

Therefore you don&#39;t gain much from using `this` in places where it is not required to be used. So, I recommend: only write down `this` when you [have to][1].\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the real issue here: don&#39;t write such `display()` methods. The real world practice: @Override the `toString()` method, and have that return a *meaningful* representation of your class.\r\n\r\nThen whenever you intend to log or display an instance of your class, you call `employee.toString()` ... and you use the returned string the way you like it.\r\n\r\nMeaning: it is a really bad idea to *display* to the console.

Then the build system (e.g. gradle) will pull the defined artifacts into your build automatically.  You setup this local repository, such as artifactory, yourself and configure your gradle build to look at this local repository for artifacts, in addition to looking at the central repositories where common open source artifacts are stored.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the overall high-level approach.  The detail of how you manage this in your environment, I can&#39;t provide here (for one, I am not familiar enough with gradle to provide a meaningful concrete answer using it).\r\n\r\nIn terms of an example which uses some of the technology you mention in your question (multi-module project with native libs, java code and gradle build), the JavaFX system has all of that and source code can be found here https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx.  However, JavaFX is a large, sophisticated project which has native portions targeting different native systems (OS X, Windows, Linux) and your particular application may not need as much customization as JavaFX.  Still, perhaps you might get something out of reviewing how the JavaFX developers tackled this problem.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is the separation of concerns between the build system and generated artifacts and the deployment system and deployed services.  For some of your components, you may not need to have runtime or compile dependencies via libraries imported in a gradle type dependency management system.  Instead, as you describe in your question, you have a loose coupling via a REST API, so the UI layer doesn&#39;t actually have a compile time dependency on the server.  So the REST based portion might be deployed to a local server, or an Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure server.  If AWS, a cloud formation template might be used to push the service out to an EC2 box via an Ansible script.  Automating that kind of stuff is outside the scope of artifactory, git, gradle, etc. and can get kind of complicated pretty fast and is beyond what I would be prepared to talk about in detail here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438593/organizing-project-libraries/58442190#58442190","title":"Organizing Project Libraries"}],"owner":{"reputation":332,"user_id":544235,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec878d862080a5eac9af341353935c46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/544235/chris"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571357286,"creation_date":1571336335,"question_id":58438593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438593","body_markdown":"I know this is a problem solved a long time ago, but I&#39;m having trouble figuring out how to go about this.\r\n\r\nI have a multipart project as follows:\r\n\r\nNative-Module(C based) --&gt; Core(business logic, Java) --&gt; UI/API module/layer\r\n\r\nThe native module and core module will remain the same in all variations.

provides a very great argument called `state:` in modules. this argument can be used to control the behavior of the module on the target nodes i.e absent/present i.e delete/add in the case of user.\r\n\r\nBefore calling the `user:` module with `delete` as an argument you need to create a list of all the users on the target node and then compare it with the users in the above json and then call the `user:` module with `delete:` argument.\r\n\r\n    - name: Get users\r\n      uri:\r\n        url: http://users.com/users\r\n        method: GET\r\n        return_content: yes\r\n

I seem to have some parts of the program where the values comes out to true, and some where it turns out be false, but only some of the time.  My thought process is that I know that due to the multiple threads,  ``` cachedUseFeature = ToolBox.Config.Flights.IsActive(&quot;UseFeature&quot;, overrideName); ``` could be called multiple times.  However, I don&#39;t see how it could give different answers at the various times it is called.  Would a lazy value for cachedUseFeature solve this, or is there something else going on?  Looking at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30076233/is-lazyt-a-good-solution-for-a-thread-safe-lazy-loaded-singleton, I am tempted to put a lock around Toolbox.Config everywhere it is used, but I&#39;m not sure that is the correct solution either.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438534/how-can-i-make-this-c-property-thread-safe","title":"How can I make this c# property

1): #verification to see if the car is at the end of its route\r\n                        new_destiny = random.choice(traci.edge.getIDList())\r\n                        traci.vehicle.changeTarget(str(i),str(new_destiny))\r\n\r\nThe whole code its in this link: &lt;https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/issues/6168&gt;\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438781/function-changetarget-its-failing","title":"Function changeTarget() it&#39;s failing"},{"tags":["node.js","express"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":428,"user_id":1724911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67930c7437bac6b061c864246369aea0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Victor.Palyvoda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1724911/victor-palyvoda"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571339284,"post_id":58438780,"comment_id":103218231,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438780/how-to-get-public-ip-address-of-client-sending-the-request-using-nodejs-express#comment103218231_58438780"},{"owner":{"reputation":428,"user_id":1724911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67930c7437bac6b061c864246369aea0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Victor.Palyvoda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1724911/victor-palyvoda"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571339377,"post_id":58438780,"comment_id":103218277,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438780/how-to-get-public-ip-address-of-client-sending-the-request-using-nodejs-express#comment103218277_58438780"},{"owner":{"reputation":428,"user_id":1724911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67930c7437bac6b061c864246369aea0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Victor.Palyvoda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1724911/victor-palyvoda"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571339577,"post_id":58438780,"comment_id":103218367,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438780/how-to-get-public-ip-address-of-client-sending-the-request-using-nodejs-express#comment103218367_58438780"},{"owner":{"reputation":411,"user_id":10818509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be3c36f15912146c6d0f1201f89a5d0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jedu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10818509/jedu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":428,"user_id":1724911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67930c7437bac6b061c864246369aea0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Victor.Palyvoda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1724911/victor-palyvoda"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571339832,"post_id":58438780,"comment_id":103218473,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438780/how-to-get-public-ip-address-of-client-sending-the-request-using-nodejs-express#comment103218473_58438780"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":411,"user_id":10818509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be3c36f15912146c6d0f1201f89a5d0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jedu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10818509/jedu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571339049,"post_id":58439006,"comment_id":103218118,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438780/how-to-get-public-ip-address-of-client-sending-the-request-using-nodejs-express/58439006#comment103218118_58439006"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":10294022,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7JZC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Thomas Aumaitre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10294022/thomas-aumaitre"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571338156,"creation_date":1571338156,"answer_id":58439006,"question_id":58438780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58439006","body_markdown":"You must use [ip module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip)\r\n\r\n`npm install ip`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438780/how-to-get-public-ip-address-of-client-sending-the-request-using-nodejs-express/58439006#58439006","title":"How to get public IP address of client sending the request using Nodejs express?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":538,"user_id":941493,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb97cb47fce441bfceffc8c3efadcbc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/941493/tomas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571349597,"creation_date":1571349597,"answer_id":58441273,"question_id":58438780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58441273","body_markdown":"Your code is actually correct. There are two reasons why it is not working for you:\r\n\r\n1. `req.connection.remoteAddress` shows the ip address of requester. In your case, your node is listening at private ip address so the only foreign ip address which can contact your server is another computer working on the same private ip range. Using public ip address for your node instance would fix the problem.\r\n\r\n2. `req.headers[&#39;x-forwarded-for&#39;]` can work only if there is a header present in the request. Usually this is the case when you have a proxy (some http server - nginx, apache...) listening on public network and relaying communication to the node server which is accessible only from private network. And this proxy will add `x-forwarded-for` header to the request with ip address of the original client. In your case you don&#39;t have a proxy or the proxy is not configured to do it.

this:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nEnum.map(data, fn {product, sales} -&gt;              \r\n  {\r\n    product,                          \r\n    Enum.group_by(sales, &amp;(String.slice(&amp;1.date, 0, 7)), &amp;(&amp;1.quantity))\r\n    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {k, v} -&gt;\r\n      {k, Enum.sum(v)}\r\n    end) |&gt; Map.new()\r\n  }\r\nend) |&gt; Map.new()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis line: `Enum.group_by(sales, &amp;(&amp;1.date), &amp;(&amp;1.quantity))` will create maps with the dates as keys and a list of values as values.\r\n\r\nAnd then you can convert that to a map with the date as keys and the total sum as values piping it into: `Enum.map(fn {k, v} -&gt; {k, Enum.sum(v)} end) |&gt; Map.new()`\r\n\r\nAnd the final result will be:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n%{&quot;Almond Fudge&quot; =&gt; %{&quot;2019-01&quot; =&gt; 10}, &quot;Banana Split&quot; =&gt; %{&quot;2019-01&quot; =&gt; 16}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, for the exact result you want, if you don&#39;t want the dates as keys, you can replace that line for: `|&gt; Enum.map(fn {k, v} -&gt; %{date: k, quantity: Enum.sum(v)} end)}`\r\n\r\nLeaving you with:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nEnum.map(data, fn {product, sales} -&gt;                                                                          \r\n  {\r\n    product,                                                                                                    \r\n    Enum.group_by(sales, &amp;(String.slice(&amp;1.date, 0, 7)), &amp;(&amp;1.quantity))\r\n    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {k, v} -&gt; %{date: k, quantity: Enum.sum(v)} end)}             \r\nend) |&gt; Map.new() \r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a result of:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n%{\r\n  &quot;Almond Fudge&quot; =&gt; [%{date: &quot;2019-01&quot;, quantity: 10}],\r\n  &quot;Banana Split&quot; =&gt; [%{date: &quot;2019-01&quot;, quantity: 16}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to @zwippie for pointing out to String.slice. I hadn&#39;t realized you were asking for the month. `String.slice/3` will take a string, the initial position, and the length. So Slicing the date string from 0, taking 7 digits would produce strings with the year and month.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438771/how-to-groupby-in-a-map/58439452#58439452","title":"How to groupby in a map?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12231392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pOLnAXdoPxc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reKAbhgioL6OWYb6RmutGf4YnpEjQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Siddhant Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12231392/siddhant-singh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58439452,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571342934,"creation_date":1571337081,"question_id":58438771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438771","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to filter out which item sold the most in a particular month.

Create a class that implements ```ListAdapter```. (or just subclass ```ArrayAdapter```), the Adapter that backs your list.\r\n2. Define an interface in that class that contains a callback that passes an identifier for the button that was clicked. \r\n   Example:\r\n```\r\n         public interface ListButtonClickListener{\r\n                void onListButtonClicked(&lt;some identifier for the button that was clicked);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n3. Create a member variable of type ```ListButtonClickListener``` in the ```ListAdapter ```subclass created in step 1.\r\n\r\n4. In your ```Activity```, create an anonymous class implementing the ```ListButtonClickListener```. The ```onListButtonClicked()``` method will handle the specific button that was clicked using the identifier and is where you will start the ```Activity``` from.\r\n \r\n5. Set the instance of the ```ListButtonClickListener``` created in step 4 as the member variable in step 3.\r\n\r\n6. In the ```Button``` ```OnClickListener```&#39;s in your ```Adapter``` subclass, invoke the  ```onListButtonClicked()``` callback with that button&#39;s unique identifier.

The problem is that 1) text reference definitions are displayed upon rendering to pdf (they should not), 2) text references do not work - calling them results only in the text of the call (not the referenced text) being displayed, and 3) references to table and figures does not work as it does with `bookdown::pdf_document2` output. How can I either get the author and page numbers in `bookdown::pdf_document2` output or else get the references to work in `rticles::elsevier_article`?\r\n\r\nBelow is an example that illustrates the issue. I&#39;m using RStudio 1.2.1335.\r\n\r\n````\r\n---\r\ntitle: Problems with `rticles::elsevier_article` output \r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Alice Anonymous\r\n    email: alice@example.com\r\n    affiliation: Some Institute of Technology\r\n    footnote: Corresponding Author\r\n  - name: Bob Security\r\n    email: bob@example.com\r\n    affiliation: Another University\r\naddress:\r\n  - code: Some Institute of Technology\r\n    address: Department, Street, City, State, Zip\r\n  - code: Another University\r\n    address: Department, Street, City, State, Zip\r\nabstract: |\r\n  This is the abstract.\r\n\r\njournal: &quot;Ecological Monographs&quot;\r\ndate: &quot;`r Sys.Date()`&quot;\r\ncsl: elsevier-harvard.csl\r\noutput: rticles::elsevier_article\r\n#output:bookdown::pdf_document2\r\ngeometry: margin=2.54cm\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe Problems I have\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nI would like to use the `rticles::elsevier_article` output because it 1) handles authors and affiliations the way I want, and 2) it nicely omits the page number from the firat page. Both of these things I can&#39;t seem to easily (if at all) accomplish using `bookdown::pdf_document2` output. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I specify `rticles::elsevier_article` output, I run into several problems: 1) text reference definitions are displayed upon rendering to pdf (they should not), 2) text references do not work - calling them results only in the text of the call (not the referenced text) being displayed, and 3) references to table and figures does not work as it does with `bookdown::pdf_document2` output. There is one more issue too - in one test case I inserted a table (using `kableExtra`), and knitting failed because of some latex `tabu` environment error, even though it looks to me like the `rticles::elsevier_article` output does indeed load the `tabu` package (but I had to load it in the YAML header to get the knitting to work). \r\n\r\nFor example, lets define a text reference so I can use a super script 2 to specify square kilometers in a figure caption. The reference definition should not show in the rendered pdf (and it does not when I use the `bookdown::pdf_document2` output, but it frustratingly does so when I use the `rticles::elsevier_article` output).\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- text references for use in tables and captions (must be separated by empty line)--&gt;\r\n(ref:km2) km^2^\r\n\r\nNow lets make a figure (below) and reference it here (Figure \\@ref(fig:testfig)). The figure includes the text reference in the caption, but it does not display the referenced text, but only the exact text that is suppose to call the reference text. And my inline reference to the figure does not work.\r\n\r\n```{r,testfig, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 3, fig.align = &quot;center&quot;,fig.cap=paste0(&quot;This is a classic quadratic plot - it could represent &quot;,&quot;(ref:km2)&quot;,&quot;.&quot;)}\r\n\r\nx=-5:5\r\n\r\nplot(x,x**2,xlab=&quot;my assets&quot;, ylab=&quot;my joy&quot;, main=&quot;Not true&quot;)\r\n\t\r\n```\r\n````","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438723/author-affiliations-in-rmarkdown-yaml-header-using-rticles","title":"Author affiliations in Rmarkdown YAML header, using rticles"},{"tags":["asp.net","single-page-application"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":913,"user_id":1001919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ebabc4cc32e4304bdaa2d1a57c0c767?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"forX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1001919/forx"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24902,"user_id":1139830,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ee9qe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1139830/mason"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571405383,"post_id":58439167,"comment_id":103241435,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438721/adding-server-side-code-in-single-page-application/58439167#comment103241435_58439167"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":913,"user_id":1001919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ebabc4cc32e4304bdaa2d1a57c0c767?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"forX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1001919/forx"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571338837,"creation_date":1571338837,"answer_id":58439167,"question_id":58438721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58439167","body_markdown":"I first change my web.config to process html file.\r\n[Enabling processed asp net][1]\r\n\r\nAfter just need to use \r\n[embedded .net tag][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://leedjones.co.uk/enabling-html-files-to-be-processed-by-the-asp-net-pipeline/\r\n  [2]: https://weblogs.asp.net/ahmedmoosa/embedded-code-and-inline-server-tags\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n    &lt;system.web&gt;\r\n      &lt;compilation debug=&quot;true&quot; targetFramework=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;buildProviders&gt;\r\n          &lt;add extension =&quot;.html&quot; type=&quot;System.Web.Compilation.PageBuildProvider&quot;/&gt;\r\n          &lt;add extension =&quot;.htm&quot; type=&quot;System.Web.Compilation.PageBuildProvider&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/buildProviders&gt;\r\n      &lt;/compilation&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;system.webServer&gt;\r\n            &lt;handlers&gt;\r\n                &lt;add name=&quot;HTML&quot; path=&quot;*.html&quot; verb=&quot;GET, HEAD, POST, DEBUG&quot;\r\n                     type=&quot;System.Web.UI.PageHandlerFactory&quot; resourceType=&quot;Unspecified&quot; requireAccess=&quot;Script&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;add name=&quot;HTM&quot; path=&quot;*.htm&quot; verb=&quot;GET, HEAD, POST, DEBUG&quot;\r\n                     type=&quot;System.Web.UI.PageHandlerFactory&quot; resourceType=&quot;Unspecified&quot; requireAccess=&quot;Script&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;/handlers&gt;\r\n        &lt;/system.webServer&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/system.web&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438721/adding-server-side-code-in-single-page-application/58439167#58439167","title":"Adding server side code in single page application"}],"owner":{"reputation":913,"user_id":1001919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ebabc4cc32e4304bdaa2d1a57c0c767?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"forX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1001919/forx"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571338837,"creation_date":1571336872,"question_id":58438721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438721","body_markdown":"I have a single page application, in .net 4 but created from empty web application (Application web ASP.NET .NET Framework -&gt; empty project).

All the changes you make are made to the temp copy. When you save, it replaces the file you opened with the temp copy thereby &quot;writing&quot; your changes to disk. If you close without saving, it simply deletes the temp copy.\r\n\r\nWhen you send as an attachment, unsaved changes are included in the attachment. But the workbook is not &quot;saved&quot; at that point because if you try to close it, Excel will prompt you to save your changes.\r\n\r\nWhat if, when you Save and Send - Send as Attachment, Excel simply attaches the temp copy and names the attachment the same as the opened workbook. In fact, since you can attach a workbook that&#39;s never been saved before, it must be using the temp copy.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s my theory on why it&#39;s happening the way it is. What to do about it? I&#39;m not sure. I think I would figure out how to hijack the Send as Attachment function in the Ribbon&#39;s Backstage to force a save or to simply not allow this workbook to be sent without saving.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to go that route, search for Excel Ribbon File Backstage and you should find some instructions on how to modify that particular function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438675/beforesave-and-aftersave-ignored-when-saving-as-attachment/58440976#58440976","title":"Beforesave and Aftersave ignored when saving as attachment"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":12234542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqr34eOfdhQmjbwSMaT8cYtMr2w93u7eBrJs8hdg=k-s128","display_name":"The Cats Meow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234542/the-cats-meow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23,"user_id":12234542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqr34eOfdhQmjbwSMaT8cYtMr2w93u7eBrJs8hdg=k-s128","display_name":"The Cats Meow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234542/the-cats-meow"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58440976,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571347874,"creation_date":1571336686,"last_edit_date":1571345410,"question_id":58438675,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438675","body_markdown":"I have some code that I have put in Workbook_AfterSave and Workbook_BeforeSave.

customers = {one, two, three};\r\n\r\nNow we can loop over the elements and print out if the cities are the same:\r\n\r\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; customers.size(); ++i)\r\n    {\r\n      for(int j = 0;

If a player does not have stats then just ignore them and print only those with stats. \r\n\r\nHow can I print something like below: If `id` on players matches with `id` on stats, then I have to print stats like below. Couldn&#39;t even start. Any hint or answer would be great help. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I define a Gridspec like so: \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport matplotlib.gridspec as grd\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))\r\ngs = grd.GridSpec(2, 1, wspace=0, hspace=0,

10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then plot a point on the edge of one of the subplots that share a border, \r\n```\r\nfirst.scatter(5, 5)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\nthe point gets clipped on the border and only the top half of the scatter circle is displayed. Is there a way for the point to show up across the border? (Adding `clip_on=False` doesn&#39;t affect the outcome).\r\n\r\nA partial solution is to set `second.patch.set_alpha(0)` so that the second half of the scatter point appears. The issue with this is that in my original plot, each subplot has a background color set with \r\n\r\n```\r\nsecond.axhspan(*second.get_ylim(), facecolor=&#39;red&#39;, alpha=0.5)\r\n```\r\nand so even if I set the axes background to transparent with `second.patch.set_alpha(0)`, the overlapping scatter point will now have half of it be covered in a 0.5 alpha color, which I don&#39;t want. Put simply, I want the scatter points to have zorder higher than anything else, including surrounding subplots. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe only other solution I&#39;ve thought of (if there&#39;s truly no easy way to do this), would be to overlay a transparent axes over the entire figure, and plot my scatter points there. The reason I don&#39;t want to do that is because in reality, my Gridspec is very complicated and combines several non-linear y-axes, and thus mapping points from absolute coordinates to relative figure coordinates would be quite difficult. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438652/scatter-points-on-subplot-edge-within-gridspec-get-clipped","title":"Scatter points on subplot edge within Gridspec get clipped"},{"tags":["jquery","vue.js","animation","transition"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":396,"user_id":871404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67510f33edd5a7407a04ec77e31487e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"drake035","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/871404/drake035"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571432466,"creation_date":1571432466,"answer_id":58458151,"question_id":58438650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58458151","body_markdown":"This can&#39;t work with `v-if` because then the content isn&#39;t there on page load and it takes time for Vue to summon it which prevents the CSS animation to work properly.\r\n\r\nInstead, `v-show` must be used so that the content is already there in the DOM.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438650/replicating-jquery-slidedown-with-vue/58458151#58458151","title":"Replicating jQuery&#39; slideDown() with Vue"}],"owner":{"reputation":396,"user_id":871404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67510f33edd5a7407a04ec77e31487e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"drake035","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/871404/drake035"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571432466,"creation_date":1571336576,"question_id":58438650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438650","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to apply [this example][1] to make my content appear, upon clicking a button, with a vertical slide animation similar to jQuery&#39; slideUp/slideDown.\r\n\r\nMy content is inside some `Portfolio` component that I call thus:\r\n\r\n    &lt;portfolio v-if=&quot;portfolioOpen&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nClicking a button toggles variable `portfolioOpen` from `false` to `true`, then in my Portfolio component I have this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;style lang=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;\r\n      .portfolio-enter-active,\r\n      .portfolio-leave-active {\r\n         transition: all 100ms ease-in 0s\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      .portfolio-enter-to,\r\n      .portfolio-leave {\r\n         max-height: 1000px;\r\n         overflow: hidden;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      .portfolio-enter,\r\n      .portfolio-leave-to {\r\n         overflow: hidden;\r\n         max-height: 0;\r\n      }\r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find any difference between this and the pen mentioned above.

I had to choose one NOSQL data structure and study it myself. I chose Graph databases and did a little project to show my skills. I had to build a database in Neo4J based on a relational database. \r\n\r\nThe project focusses on bikes that you can use and put back at different stations around the city of Antwerp. Something most of the big cities have. There are 3 types of nodes in my database. First of all, there are rides. A ride consists of a rideId, a startTime, an endtime, a startLockId, and an endLockId. Then there are stations where you can put the bikes. Every ride has a startlock and an endlock. So there are also 2 types of relations between these nodes. One where the ride leaves, and one where it arrives. A station consists of a lockId, a street and a number (the housenumber). Each station is situated in a certain district in Antwerp. the districts consist of just a name. There are a total of 7 districts in the database.\r\n\r\nThere are certain queries I had to write to show my skills in Neo4J, but there is one that I just can&#39;t find. The question asks: &quot;What districts have the most rides between them?&quot;. \r\n\r\nCurrently I came to this query which lists up the beginning and end district of all rides:\r\n\r\n    MATCH (d1:District)&lt;--(s1:Station)&lt;--(r:Ride)--&gt;(s2:Station)--&gt;(d2:District) \r\n    WHERE d1.Name &lt;&gt; d2.Name \r\n    RETURN d1, d2\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been searching the internet, and I&#39;ve been trying with COUNT(), ORDER BY() and COLLECT() methodes, but can&#39;t seem to find the solution, or come closer to it.

I have declared my instance variables and have made a constructor for assigning starter and main course but I can&#39;t seem to display it. Any help will be appreciated and if you could explain what your code does that will hugely help me out!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438616/object-oriented-programming-java","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"Object oriented programming - java"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","zsh","pipenv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571336461,"post_id":58438609,"comment_id":103217009,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438609/how-to-set-user-path-permanently-on-mac-os-catalina-zsh-shell#comment103217009_58438609"},{"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571343024,"post_id":58438609,"comment_id":103219788,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438609/how-to-set-user-path-permanently-on-mac-os-catalina-zsh-shell#comment103219788_58438609"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12234473,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBvZSIVr9gMV5UaTKQNKhREXJvgrbmuVEC8BBO5yQ=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"tundebosoro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234473/tundebosoro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571348086,"post_id":58438643,"comment_id":103221685,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438609/how-to-set-user-path-permanently-on-mac-os-catalina-zsh-shell/58438643#comment103221685_58438643"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571336544,"creation_date":1571336544,"answer_id":58438643,"question_id":58438609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58438643","body_markdown":"If you&#39;re using Homebrew, then another option is to install `pipenv` like so:\r\n\r\n`brew install pipenv`\r\n\r\nThis installs it globally.

Therefore you don&#39;t gain much from using `this` in places where it is not required to be used. So, I recommend: only write down `this` when you [have to][1].\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the real issue here: don&#39;t write such `display()` methods. The real world practice: @Override the `toString()` method, and have that return a *meaningful* representation of your class.\r\n\r\nThen whenever you intend to log or display an instance of your class, you call `employee.toString()` ... and you use the returned string the way you like it.\r\n\r\nMeaning: it is a really bad idea to *display* to the console.

Then the build system (e.g. gradle) will pull the defined artifacts into your build automatically.  You setup this local repository, such as artifactory, yourself and configure your gradle build to look at this local repository for artifacts, in addition to looking at the central repositories where common open source artifacts are stored.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the overall high-level approach.  The detail of how you manage this in your environment, I can&#39;t provide here (for one, I am not familiar enough with gradle to provide a meaningful concrete answer using it).\r\n\r\nIn terms of an example which uses some of the technology you mention in your question (multi-module project with native libs, java code and gradle build), the JavaFX system has all of that and source code can be found here https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx.  However, JavaFX is a large, sophisticated project which has native portions targeting different native systems (OS X, Windows, Linux) and your particular application may not need as much customization as JavaFX.  Still, perhaps you might get something out of reviewing how the JavaFX developers tackled this problem.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is the separation of concerns between the build system and generated artifacts and the deployment system and deployed services.  For some of your components, you may not need to have runtime or compile dependencies via libraries imported in a gradle type dependency management system.  Instead, as you describe in your question, you have a loose coupling via a REST API, so the UI layer doesn&#39;t actually have a compile time dependency on the server.  So the REST based portion might be deployed to a local server, or an Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure server.  If AWS, a cloud formation template might be used to push the service out to an EC2 box via an Ansible script.  Automating that kind of stuff is outside the scope of artifactory, git, gradle, etc. and can get kind of complicated pretty fast and is beyond what I would be prepared to talk about in detail here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58438593/organizing-project-libraries/58442190#58442190","title":"Organizing Project Libraries"}],"owner":{"reputation":332,"user_id":544235,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec878d862080a5eac9af341353935c46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/544235/chris"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571357286,"creation_date":1571336335,"question_id":58438593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58438593","body_markdown":"I know this is a problem solved a long time ago, but I&#39;m having trouble figuring out how to go about this.\r\n\r\nI have a multipart project as follows:\r\n\r\nNative-Module(C based) --&gt; Core(business logic, Java) --&gt; UI/API module/layer\r\n\r\nThe native module and core module will remain the same in all variations.
