Unless there is at least 1 foreground thread in your application. \r\n\r\nWhen you start application, main thread enters `Main()` method. It get bytes from the socket and starts a new thread passing these bytes as an argument. And then your main thread exits, but as you created your [foreground](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.thread.isbackground?view=netframework-4.8) thread application still works. New thread creates form and shows it, but it does not initialize message dispatching loop, that&#39;s why your form is not rendered completely and behaves as a handing application - it just does not process any messages from the user (mouse over, clicks, dragging etc). Meantime, you freeze a thread for 5 seconds and then it exits, your application is closed.\r\n\r\nSo no problem here, there is no magic, everything is deterministic and works exactly as you programmed it :)\r\n\r\nTry use `Application.Run(mainForm);` or `mainForm.ShowDialog()` instead of `mainForm.Show()`. These methods will start application messaging loop and you&#39;ll see form opened till you close it. Read more about application messaging loop [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.application.run?view=netframework-4.8).\r\n\r\nAnother note is that you don&#39;t [set an apartment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.thread.setapartmentstate?view=netframework-4.8) in your UI thread. Read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4154429/apartmentstate-for-dummies) more what the hack is that. Please call `t.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);` before you call `Start()`. Another option is to mark your `Main()` with `STAThreadAttribute` and run your form as I described above in your `Main()` method.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235886/how-to-visualize-the-data-from-c-console-app-in-windows-form/58244682#58244682","title":"How to visualize the data from c# console app in windows form?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8602745,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48303fb175a2306c27ab1e8acbda23d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8602745/mark"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8602745,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48303fb175a2306c27ab1e8acbda23d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8602745/mark"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570239498,"creation_date":1570189884,"last_edit_date":1570190226,"question_id":58235886,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235886","body_markdown":"I&#39;m getting data from UDP port and there is no problem to show it in console.

The fun part is:\r\n\r\n1. If you leave out processId, Vs Code says &quot;unable to parse the process id&quot;\r\n2. If you specify a processId, Vs Code says &quot;processId cannot be used with miDebuggerServerAddress&quot;\r\n\r\nOf course, if I am using a debugger server address, server is already attached to PID and it makes sense that processId can&#39;t be used in this case. But if I leave it out, VS Code gives the 1. error. This is cyclic in a way.\r\n\r\nAnyone is able to attach to a remote process in VS Code C++ debugger with gdbserver address, that is my question.

This means the _first time_ you do one of these things, all objects turned on under the gameobject referenced by `mainGame` will run their `Awake` and `Start` methods, but not the second time. Also depending which objects are active (like I said I can&#39;t fully see what component is on what object and which objects are referenced by which serialized field) you might be able to introduce a state error on `BackToMainMenu._isInMainMenu` because that field isn&#39;t changed when you hit play. Here is a fantastic image showing execution timeline in Unity: \r\n[Monobehavior Timeline][1]\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n 1. The second time you run the game `DepthOfField` won&#39;t call `Start` a second time. Instead try `OnEnable`.\r\n 2. The conversation and game logic is not shown in your post, but likely it also is initializing in `Start` and won&#39;t run a second time.\r\n 3. A bit of trickiness around Coroutines is likely to blame here. When `DepthOfField` starts it also starts a coroutine. That coroutine _keeps going even if you set the gameobject inactive_. So you run the game once, that coroutine starts, you turn the object off when you hit escape, the coroutine finishes, you hit play again, but `DepthOfField.dephOfFieldFinished == true` and your playerAnimator is disabled and won&#39;t enable again.\r\n 4. Also 5. This kind of behavior can be tricky and is usually dependent on what else you have going on in your scene. Since you have one scene with everything at once, you need to watch out for putting stuff in `Awake` and `Start` since this will only run once. Instead you can try a number of things, my favorite is usually to set up a singleton or static class that works as a state machine for the whole scene. It will call custom `Initialize` functions in your behaviors instead of using `Awake` and `Start`. \r\n\r\nKeep references to your coroutines by doing things like:\r\n```c#\r\n    private Coroutine depthOfFieldRoutineRef;\r\n    \r\n    private OnEnable()\r\n    {\r\n        if (depthOfFieldRoutineRef != null)\r\n        {\r\n            StopCoroutine(depthOfFieldRoutineRef);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        depthOfFieldRoutineRef = \r\n            StartCoroutine(changeValueOverTime\r\n            (depthOfField.focalLength, 1, clipLength));\r\n        // Don&#39;t forget to set depthOfFieldRoutineRef to null again at the end of routine!\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor simple pausing behavior you can also try setting `Time.timescale = 0;` and back to 1 when you want play to resume.\r\n\r\nLess a question than a set of problems, hopefully this set of solutions helps!\r\n\r\nTutorial on [Awake and Start][2]\r\n\r\nDocs on [Coroutines][3]\r\n\r\nDocs on [Time.timescale][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/u8DPJ.png\r\n  [2]: https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/awake-and-start\r\n  [3]: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-timeScale.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235869/still-pausing-resuming-and-start-a-new-game-is-not-working-good-canr-figure-wh/58240523#58240523","title":"Still pausing/resuming and start a new game is not working good.

While the player is rotating on the Z and post processing effect is working if I press the Escape key it will bring me back to the Main Menu but then if I press the Escape key again it will start the game over again from the begin.\r\n\r\nBut if I&#39;m waiting in my game for the player to finish rotating on the Z and the post processing effect is finished and then pressing on Escape it will bring the main menu and second time will resume the game from the same point.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t figure out why when the player is rotating and the post process is working the escape key make it start the game over again from the being ?\r\n\r\n[![Hierarchy][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot of the game when start and after finish the rotating and the process stack :\r\n\r\n[![On the left when the game start cutscene on the right starting a conversation][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Da0tV.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOCxN.jpg\r\n\r\nAnother problem I noticed now. After the game start using the post process and the player rotating finished if I press Escape it will go to main menu and escape again will be back to the game but for example in the second screenshot the conversation is not continue. It will return to the same point in the game but things not seems to continue like the conversation.\r\n\r\nOn the Back to main menu object I have a script attached to it :\r\n\r\n    using

The game start with the main menu.\r\n\r\n2. When clicking the PLAY button a new game start.\r\n\r\n3. When a new game start the script Depth Of Field is in action using the post processing. Also I&#39;m locking the player so the player will not be able to move either the mouse or the player it self.\r\n\r\n4. When the depth of field script finished his work a conversation between Navi and the Player start. When a conversation is in action the player can move the mouse 360 degrees but cant move the player to any direction.\r\n\r\n5. When the conversation ended the player can also move to any direction.\r\n\r\nProblems :\r\n\r\n1. When start a new game while the depth of field script is in work pressing escape will bring the main menu but pressing escape again will not resume the depth of field script but will start it all over again.\r\n\r\n2. When waiting the conversation to end if not pressing escape until the conversation ended then when moving around and pressing escape it will bring the main menu and again will resume the game from the same point.\r\n\r\n3. The problems is when the game is doing something like the depth of field it will start the game over again instead resuming or when in conversation in the middle the conversation will never continue.\r\n\r\n4. The ides with the escape key is once to get to main menu and second to resume the game. \r\n\r\n5. The PLAY button is what should only start a new game and not the escape key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a bit long but everything is connected.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235869/still-pausing-resuming-and-start-a-new-game-is-not-working-good-canr-figure-wh","title":"Still pausing/resuming and start a new game is not working good.

Same problem with my locally compiled version.  Looking at the source for socat, it has in xio-termios.c:\r\n\r\n    int xiotermios_flush(int fd) {\r\n        if (_xiotermios_doit) {\r\n            if (Tcsetattr(fd, TCSADRAIN, &amp;_xiotermios_data.termarg) &lt; 0) {\r\n                Error3(&quot;tcsetattr(%d, TCSADRAIN, %p): %s&quot;,\r\n                    fd, &amp;_xiotermios_data.termarg, strerror(errno));\r\n                return -1;\r\n            }\r\n            _xiotermios_doit = false;\r\n        }\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI presume that tcsetattr works a bit differently on a Mac because the same code works fine on Linux. Can anyone help me fix this?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I decided to try to create a docker container running socat as a workaround.\r\n\r\n    FROM alpine:3.10.2\r\n    RUN apk add --no-cache socat\r\n    ENTRYPOINT [&quot;socat&quot;]\r\n\r\nThen I ran the container with:\r\n\r\n    docker run --rm -ti socat STDIO,raw TCP:host.docker.internal:40707\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that didn&#39;t work either, and

A minimal change of my code to make it work? ikegami is right, the cause of no match is the ^ in /^$expr$/ . When the parser reenters the regex recursively it again checks for beginning of string, which fails. So I cannot have ^ and $ in the regex it seems. Without them my string matches. But then some invalid strings match too, like A(1+2)*(3+4)B . In the absence of ^ and $ it doesn&#39;t necessarily match the whole string. Problem. \r\n\r\nikegami suggested a solution to this in a comment above. I&#39;ll just write it out. I have tested it and it works:\r\n\r\n\t$number = &#39;\\d+&#39;;\r\n\t$atom = &quot;($number|\\\\((?1)\\\\))&quot;;\r\n\t$product = &quot;$atom(\\\\*$atom)*&quot;;\r\n\t$sum = &quot;$product(\\\\+$product)*&quot;;\r\n\t$expr = $sum;\r\n\tif (&#39;(1+2)*(3+4)&#39; =~ /^($expr)$/)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tprint &quot;OK&quot;;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nNotice that I now have (?1) instead of (?R) and that I have enclosed $expr in brackets. (?1) refers to the first capture group, which is ($expr). So the recursion reenters this subex instead of the whole regex. ^ is not met again. That solves it.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235834/regular-expression-with-recursion-in-perl/58241588#58241588","title":"regular expression with recursion in Perl"}],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":10443339,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8c070d86c7cd0c0e39d5089c80a4388?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Henrik4","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10443339/henrik4"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570214003,"creation_date":1570189618,"question_id":58235834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235834","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use this but can&#39;t make it work.

tried to do what I think you want here, using a full custom control.  [The code is on GitHub][1].  There may be easier ways to do this, but because you want the Background of the control split into three and colored I thought the logical thing to do was to put three Rectangles into the Control Template and color them.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]  \r\n\r\nThe code contains a ColorSlider control, with dependency properties Color1, Color2, Color3 (of type Brush) for the three colors, and Width1, Width2, Width3 (doubles) for the three widths.\r\n\r\nTo do this we set up a ColorSlider class which registers the dependency properties (excerpt):\r\n\r\n    public class ColorSlider : Slider\r\n    {\r\n        public static readonly DependencyProperty Width1Property = DependencyProperty.Register(&quot;Width1&quot;, typeof(double), typeof(ColorSlider), new UIPropertyMetadata(0.0));\r\n        [TypeConverter(typeof(LengthConverter))]\r\n        public double Width1\r\n        {\r\n            get { return (double)GetValue(Width1Property); }\r\n            set { SetValue(Width1Property, value); }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nWe need a copy of the Slider Control Template targetting the ColorSlider and then with a Stackpanel in its grid as below (excerpt clearly):\r\n\r\n                    &lt;StackPanel Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; Panel.ZIndex=&quot;-1&quot; Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;Rectangle Fill=&quot;{TemplateBinding Color1}&quot; Height=&quot;{TemplateBinding Height}&quot; Width=&quot;{TemplateBinding Width1}&quot; /&gt;\r\n                        &lt;Rectangle Fill=&quot;{TemplateBinding Color2}&quot; Height=&quot;{TemplateBinding Height}&quot; Width=&quot;{TemplateBinding Width2}&quot; /&gt;\r\n                        &lt;Rectangle Fill=&quot;{TemplateBinding Color3}&quot; Height=&quot;{TemplateBinding Height}&quot; Width=&quot;{TemplateBinding Width3}&quot; /&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can create a color slider and set these properties:\r\n\r\n    &lt;local:ColorSlider x:Name=&quot;MyColorSlider&quot; Template=&quot;{DynamicResource ColorSliderControlTemplate}&quot; Width=&quot;200&quot; Height=&quot;50&quot;\r\n    Color1=&quot;Red&quot; Color2=&quot;Green&quot; Color3=&quot;Blue&quot; Width1=&quot;68&quot; Width2=&quot;66&quot; Width3=&quot;66&quot;&gt;&lt;/local:ColorSlider&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd we can set them dynamically from code:\r\n\r\n                MyColorSlider.Width3 = 20;\r\n                MyColorSlider.Color1 = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Orange);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nHope that helps, it&#39;s obviously a little basic.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/rich-newman/ColorSlider\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gKtks.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235802/is-it-possible-to-have-multiple-backgrounds-for-slider-trackbar-control-in-wpf/58243421#58243421","title":"Is it possible to have multiple backgrounds for Slider Trackbar Control in WPF?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11874175,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8d4ebb338094a86ce1614e72f1eb195?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Noob Guy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11874175/noob-guy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11874175,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8d4ebb338094a86ce1614e72f1eb195?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Noob Guy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11874175/noob-guy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58243421,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570225045,"creation_date":1570189493,"last_edit_date":1570191299,"question_id":58235802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235802","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a multi color slider.

The MCTS result is then used to train the neural network.\r\n\r\nI already parallelized the CPU execution by launching multiple processes which each build up their own tree. This is effective and has now lead to a **GPU bottleneck**! (nvidia-smi showing the GPU at 100% all the time)\r\n\r\nI have devised 2 strategies to parallelize GPU evaluations, however both of them have problems.\r\n\r\n - **Each process evaluates the network only on batches from its own tree.** In my initial naive implementation, this meant a batch size of 1. However, by refactoring some code and adding a &#39;virtual loss&#39; to discourage (but not completely block) the same node from being picked twice we can get larger batches of size 1-4. The problem here is that we cannot allow large delays until we evaluate the batch or accuracy suffers, so a small batch size is key here.\r\n\r\n - **Send the batches to a central &quot;neural network worker&quot; thread which combines and evaluates them.** This could be done in a large batch of 32 or more, so the GPU could be used very efficiently. The problem here is that the tree workers send CUDA tensors &#39;round-trip&#39; which is not supported by PyTorch. It is supported if I clone them first, but all that constant copying makes this approach slower than the first one.\r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe a clever batching scheme that I&#39;m not seeing could make the first approach work. Using multiple GPUs could speed up the first approach too, but the kind of parallelism I want is not natively supported by PyTorch. Maybe keeping all tensors in the NN worker and only sending ids around could improve the second approach, however the difficulty here is how to synchronize effectively to get a large batch without making the CPU threads wait too long.\r\n\r\nI found next to no information on how AlphaZero or AlphaGo Zero were parallelized in their respective papers. I was able to find limited information online however which lead me to improve the first approach.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any advice on this, particularly if there&#39;s some point or approach I missed.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235790/how-do-i-effectively-parallelize-alphazero-on-the-gpu","title":"How do I effectively parallelize AlphaZero on the GPU?"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2","facet","facet-wrap","facet-grid"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4914,"user_id":6498650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCWyN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"s_t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6498650/s-t"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570192335,"post_id":58235789,"comment_id":102845843,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235789/how-do-i-order-x-axis-within-facet-nested#comment102845843_58235789"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11021403,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d94bf7aa2ba610176fd2d272f72dddfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cms72","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11021403/cms72"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4914,"user_id":6498650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCWyN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"s_t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6498650/s-t"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570195554,"post_id":58235789,"comment_id":102847499,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235789/how-do-i-order-x-axis-within-facet-nested#comment102847499_58235789"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11021403,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d94bf7aa2ba610176fd2d272f72dddfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cms72","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11021403/cms72"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4914,"user_id":6498650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCWyN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"s_t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6498650/s-t"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570197629,"post_id":58235789,"comment_id":102848569,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235789/how-do-i-order-x-axis-within-facet-nested#comment102848569_58235789"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":11021403,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d94bf7aa2ba610176fd2d272f72dddfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cms72","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11021403/cms72"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570272228,"post_id":58247304,"comment_id":102866066,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235789/how-do-i-order-x-axis-within-facet-nested/58247304#comment102866066_58247304"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3748,"user_id":11374827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Pyny.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"teunbrand","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11374827/teunbrand"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570270167,"creation_date":1570270167,"answer_id":58247304,"question_id":58235789,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58247304","body_markdown":"The problem is not the x-axis, the x-axis only has one value within each facet.

I am using CloudKit to do that. I figured that error handling is to most time consuming task here. Right now I am at the .zoneNotFound error. I understand what it means and have an idea how to handle it, but I simply lack the most important information to do it, which is the record zone itself that could not be found. I have had a look at the userInfo and errorUserInfo of the CKError object. The only thing I could find is an entry with the key &quot;CKErrorDescription&quot; that has a value of type Any. The debugger in Xcode tells me it has the following value:\r\n\r\nError fetching record zone [CKRecordZoneID: 0x7fab20631b20; ownerName=_ _defaultOwner_ _, zoneName=my-data] from server: Zone &#39;my-data&#39; does not exist\r\n\r\nSo I believe that the record zone is somehow in that value, only I am not able to get it from there, because I do not know the type of value (except Any). Of course I could parse the error message itself and extract the zone&#39;s name and go on from there. However, this seams very complicated to me.

Power BI (PBI) data model, is a lighter weight version of Analysis Service. If you have PBI Desktop open, you can open task manager and see that there is a Analysis Services instance in the background.\r\n\r\n[![Power BI Desktop Analysis Services Instance][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnalysis Services will be able to hold more data, and is not limited to the 10GB data set size, and you also have other features based for an Enterprise Organisation. Analysis Services can also sit over a data source in direct query mode or import the data, like Power BI.\r\n\r\nIn your question you mentioned that the Direct Query Mode &#39;is notorious for having performance issues&#39;, however that will be dependent on the structure and size of the data source. For a number of projects that I have deployed, I have used Direct Query to sit over data sources that have been at least 50-100GB, however these have been mostly standard Star Schema data warehouses, or a defined reporting table, both will have the relevant indexes, covering indexes, or Column Store Indexes to allow more efficient retrieval of data. Direct Query Mode will slow down due to the number of query&#39;s that it has the do on the data source based on the measure, relationships and the connection overhead. Another can be the number of visuals on page, as each visual is a query and each one has to run on the data source.\r\n\r\nOne other method to increase the speed of Direct Query would be to use [Aggregations][2] in Power BI, to store an Imported subset of data in Power BI. If the query can be answered by the aggregation layer then it will be answered quicker. Microsoft demonstrated this with the &#39;[Trillion Row Demo][3]&#39; \r\n\r\nIn terms of the Power BI Direct Query Issues, from the range of clients that I interact with, those that do have issues with Direct Query, have a mash up of tables in an inefficient schema, running sub optimal query&#39;s on the data source, with a number of data transformations in DAX, and DAX measures that have been badly written, for example lots of DISTINCT COUNTS &amp; SWITCH.\r\n\r\nSo, if you wish to import the data, and it is over 10GB then Analysis Services is your best option. If you can set up the data structure in a good way, there should be no issues with Power BI and Direct Query.\r\n\r\nHope that helps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXMJ9.png\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-aggregations\r\n  [3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-kSWhcOM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235730/azure-analysis-services-vs-direct-query/58283517#58283517","title":"Azure Analysis Services vs Direct Query"}],"owner":{"reputation":133,"user_id":6513537,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/afda724085805f4677dbf0766f546182?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Carltonp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6513537/carltonp"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58283517,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570526593,"creation_date":1570189241,"question_id":58235730,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58235730","body_markdown":"I&#39;m tring to assess the best approach, in terms of cost and performance, in accessing data and running queries on a dataset using Power BI with Azure Analysis Services or Power BI with Direct Query.\r\n\r\nI have trie to illustrate both approaches with the following diagram.\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nFrom the diagram steps 4 and 5 describe accessing data in Azure Data Lake using Power BI with Direct Query.

The idea is that any JSX element can be passed in and it will be formated and displayed. In order for this to work properly, especially the sorting algorithms that do multiple passes, I need to know when the images and videos have loaded and taken on their native resolutions so that i can scale them and preserve the ratios. To do this I want to attach a onload and onabort property to every image contained inside a JSX element passed to my function that updates my component state telling the component the image has loaded. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure how to do this because there is no restriction on the structure of the incoming JSX element. It could have any level of nesting and the image or video could be anywhere inside that structure. If I were doing it post-render I&#39;d do:\r\n\r\n```TS\r\n   //gridRef.current is the grid element ref I get through useRef()\r\n   const images = gridRef.current.querySelectorAll(&#39;img&#39;);\r\n   images.forEach((image, index) =&gt; {\r\n      if (image.complete) //mark current image as already loaded\r\n      else {\r\n         image.onload = () =&gt; {\r\n            //mark current image as loaded after it loads\r\n         };\r\n         image.onabort = () =&gt; {\r\n            //mark current image as loaded after it aborts\r\n         };\r\n         image.onerror = () =&gt; {\r\n            //mark current image as loaded after it errors out\r\n         };\r\n         //mark current image as not loaded yet\r\n      }\r\n   });\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnd the same for videos. I don&#39;t want to do it post rendering, though, because the image could load after the image.complete check and before the listener being attached which would cause a bug. It&#39;d be much more natural to do this before even rendering the element, but how?\r\n\r\nI&#39;d want one of the following:\r\n\r\n1) Something similar to image.complete property that tells me if all the elements descendants are loaded, so if I used it on my grid element it would return true only after all the images in all the descendant nodes have loaded. Then I could do this check post-render and wouldn&#39;t need to edit the JSX.\r\n\r\n2) A way of searching through the JSX element hierarchy and retrieving then editing all the img and video elements.\r\n\r\n3) A property that fires a function when all a components descendants have loaded.\r\n\r\n4) Anything else that achieves the same goals.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58235676/how-to-edit-a-recieved-jsx-element-to-attach-a-prop-to-any-img-element-inside-it","title":"How to edit a recieved JSX element to attach a
