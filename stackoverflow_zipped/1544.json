The problem is that only a horizontal splitting is allowed and doing a vertical splitting requires 1/ to rotate the shape to have a vertical split and 2/ to rotate the inner text in the opposite direction.\r\n```\r\n\\documentclass{article}\r\n\r\n\\usepackage{tikz}\r\n\\usetikzlibrary{shapes.multipart}\r\n\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\r\n\\node [circle split,draw,rotate=90] (y) {\\rotatebox{-90}{$\\sigma$}\r\n     \\nodepart{lower} \\rotatebox{-90}{$f$}};\r\n\\end{tikzpicture}\r\n\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nBut doing that with with regular tikz command is very easy and allows a better control on node appearance, and text alignment. \r\n\r\nI suggest, to first put your text nodes.

Check the inspector, if you have an error it&#39;s more than likely according to Magento, you&#39;ve done something wrong. If it&#39;s CSS like this, you have MIME type errors, often that means it&#39;s not being referenced correctly or you have an url issue. If you look at the second url I mentioned that you have on the page, that refers to a file structure. ignore the version bit and then you can follow the structure from pub. If that&#39;s wrong you need to fix where the file is. Also remember that most if not all server systems are case sensitive on the file and folder names.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175016/custom-css-not-loading-on-some-pages-particularly-those-with-forms/58212979#58212979","title":"Custom CSS not loading on SOME pages - particularly those with forms?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12076325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9da50c921d414050d0302ee6490366ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kweste","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076325/kweste"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12076325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9da50c921d414050d0302ee6490366ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kweste","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076325/kweste"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570081650,"creation_date":1569875949,"last_edit_date":1569941102,"question_id":58175016,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175016","body_markdown":"So I installed Magento, extended the blank theme, and threw in a little bit of custom CSS... the CSS works on some pages, like the homepage, privacy policy, and catalog pages but doesn&#39;t work on others.

It works just fine in all browsers EXCEPT IE11, because it hates me.  I&#39;ve been searching everywhere for an answer and can&#39;t seem to figure it out.\r\n\r\nThis component takes an image, shrinks it so that it fits either width or height-wise within the available container (which one depends if it&#39;s a landscape or portrait photo), and then centers the image horizontally and vertically within the container.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using jquery to get the width, hoping that would normalize it between browsers, I&#39;ve tried style refactoring, and even refactored the way my components work (though this one was overdue for a refactor anyways).\r\n\r\nOn image load, the loadImage event fires, and in the first few lines of the method, I&#39;m seeing the issue\r\n\r\n```\r\nloadImage: function (el) {\r\n                if (!el) {\r\n                    return;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                var width = el.naturalWidth;\r\n                var height = el.naturalHeight;\r\n                var parentWidth = el.parentElement.clientWidth;\r\n                var parentHeight = el.parentElement.clientHeight;\r\n                ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nel.parentElement.clientWidth is 100% of the container width, rather than being the size of the image!\r\n\r\nThis is using vue js, but here&#39;s the html\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&#39;thumbnail-container&#39;&gt;\r\n        &lt;img class=&#39;item-thumbnail&#39; ref=&#39;imgEl&#39;\r\n             :src=&#39;imageSource&#39;\r\n             :style=&#39;{ width: thumbnailWidth,\r\n                                height: thumbnailHeight,\r\n                                &quot;margin-left&quot;: thumbnailMarginLeft,\r\n                                &quot;margin-top&quot;: thumbnailMarginTop }&#39;\r\n             @load=&#39;imgLoaded&#39; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything is calculating correctly, the issue is that thumbnail-container is the full width of the column its in in IE11, but only the size of the img tag within it in chrome, so the height and width get thrown off.\r\n\r\nThese are the styles on thumbnail-container\r\n```\r\n.thumbnail-container {\r\n        height: 100%;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n        position: relative;\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThumbnail container&#39;s parent&#39;s styling:\r\n```\r\n.modules-widget-thumbnail-body .modules-widget-thumbnail-cont {\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected result is for the img tag to dictate the size of thumbnail container, not the other way around.  This set up works in chrome, firefox, and edge, but not IE11.  Does anyone have any ideas what&#39;s wrong with my styling?\r\n\r\nNote: Not sure why this is marked as a duplicate, the link there clearly specifies browser window size being incorrect, this is for an element size being incorrect, and, as stated, I&#39;ve already tried using the jquery width/height methods with no change\r\n\r\nLooks like it&#39;s related to flex though, removing .module.widget&#39;s display: flex makes them display the same, but is there any way to mimic what chrome is doing in IE?\r\n \r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function imgLoaded(e) {\r\n      console.log(&quot;Width: &quot; + e.target.parentElement.clientWidth + &quot; Height: &quot; + e.target.parentElement.clientHeight);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .module.widget .module-body {\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n    .modules-widget-thumbnail-body {\r\n        margin-left: auto;\r\n        margin-right: auto;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .modules-widget-thumbnail-body .modules-widget-thumbnail-cont {\r\n        height: 100%;\r\n        position: relative;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .thumbnail-container[data-v-537a556c] {\r\n        height: 100%;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n        position: relative;\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .modules-widget-thumbnail-body .modules-widget-thumbnail-cont img {\r\n        align-self: center;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n        max-height: 100%;\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .module.widget {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: column;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        background-color: #FFF;\r\n        border: 1px solid #D9DFE1;\r\n        border-radius: 3px;\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;modules-widget-thumbnail module widget&quot;&gt; \r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;modules-widget-thumbnail-body module-body&quot; style=&quot;height: 400px;&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div id=&quot;modules-widget-thumbnail-thumbnail-1570032551907&quot; class=&quot;modules-widget-thumbnail-cont thumbnail-view&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div data-v-537a556c=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;thumbnail-container&quot; style=&quot;position: relative;&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img data-v-537a556c=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UBPVhan.jpg&quot; onload=&quot;imgLoaded(event)&quot; class=&quot;item-thumbnail&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175011/ie11-has-different-clientwidth-and-clientheight-than-all-other-browsers","title":"IE11 has different clientWidth and clientHeight than all other browsers"},{"tags":["python","selenium","redux"],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6854418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7d850ce0f51a1ddb3ea6848fe8c432d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mert cihan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6854418/mert-cihan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569875916,"creation_date":1569875916,"question_id":58175009,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175009","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini\r\n\r\nHow can I access the Redux state from a python selenium test.

Then you can assign the whole folder to a `AssetBundle tag` as should your scene be.\r\n\r\n![Example](https://i.imgur.com/pFf88WC.png)\r\n\r\nYour scene the client needs to download has to be in the **same asset-bundle tag**.\r\n\r\n**Note :** if you can&#39;t store them all in the same folder, just assign their asset-bundle tag manually for each asset (or subfolder) you want to add to the bundle.\r\n\r\nNow you can run a method to create the bundle for you, as the following :\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[MenuItem(&quot;Bundles/Create all bundles&quot;)]\r\nstatic void BuildAllAssetBundles()\r\n{\r\n    BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles(Path.Combine(Application.dataPath, &quot;AssetBundleLocation&quot;), BuildAssetBundleOptions.None, BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[There](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetBundles-Workflow.html) is more information about **How to build an asset-bundle**.\r\n\r\nNow all files required should be store in the asset-bundle file, **&#39;Edit&#39; except script files**. Take a look at [UnityEngine.AssetBundle](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.html) class to load and unload bundles/assets.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\n\r\nWhat will actually work to include your script file within an asset-bundle is to write your code in a **TextAsset** file (.txt).\r\n\r\nThose files will give you a string once loaded from the asset-bundle.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nAssetBundle ab = AssetBundle.LoadFromFile(Path.Combine(Application.dataPath, &quot;StreamingAssets/exampleassetbundle&quot;)); // Your asset-bundle path\r\nTextAsset textAsset = ab.LoadAsset&lt;TextAsset&gt;(ab.GetAllAssetNames()[0]); // In my example I only have 1 file in the asset-bundle, the TextAsset\r\nstring flatCode = textAsset.text;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the thing is, you have to compile the flat string code to an actual C# class.\r\nThis is called **Runtime compilation**.\r\n\r\nThere is many tutorials about how to do it, [as this stackexchange post](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/130268/how-do-i-compile-a-c-script-at-runtime-and-attach-it-as-a-component-to-a-game-o).\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a bit tricky, but will do what you want.\r\n\r\n**Note :** IOS and Android may not let you compile code at runtime, so depends on your target platform, you will have to investigate further.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175004/how-to-load-scripts-required-by-asset-bundle-unity/58176916#58176916","title":"How to load scripts required by asset-bundle unity?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7137846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-k9c117q8HIg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHWw/AAwImivSL8U/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"nabeel ismail","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7137846/nabeel-ismail"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9476,"user_id":1092820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc78da24118b403595f62fa7856e1b6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ruzihm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1092820/ruzihm"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569947290,"creation_date":1569875876,"last_edit_date":1569947290,"question_id":58175004,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175004","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a unity project in which game scene get downloaded and run at run-time.

Type casts would happen when you parse your json into `FunctionMeta[I, O]`, not when you run it.\r\n\r\n2) Use type-aligned data structures to store the sequence of functions as proposed in the discussion you linked. \r\n\r\n3) After you make functions of 1 argument work - model functions of multiple arguments as functions from `HList`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175003/runtime-avoiding-asinstanceof/58188392#58188392","title":"Runtime avoiding asInstanceOf"}],"owner":{"reputation":1134,"user_id":3138874,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99b7f4326b3943feb8f4644e19a662a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3138874/omid"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1134,"user_id":3138874,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99b7f4326b3943feb8f4644e19a662a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3138874/omid"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569945021,"creation_date":1569875873,"last_edit_date":1569941899,"question_id":58175003,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175003","body_markdown":"Here is a simplified version of a design that is trying to compose function in runtime.

They&#39;re *abstracting away* the fact that the encapsulated data is stored in an array. To the calling code, the data might as well be stored in a `Collection`, a `Dictionary`, an `ArrayList`, a `HashSet` ....it makes no difference at all: given an index, the property is able to retrieve and return an item.\r\n\r\nTypically, you expose indexed properties on a custom collection class - and you expose such a property along with other members such as `Count`, `Add`, and `Clear`.\r\n\r\nBut this isn&#39;t a custom collection class.\r\n\r\nSo, a solution could be to expose a `TeamCount` and a `GroupCount` property. Note that exposing `UBound(pTeam)` or `UBound(pGroup)` would make your abtraction a leaky one, and could cause problems if you later decide that you&#39;d rather have a `Collection` to hold the encapsulated data.\r\n\r\n    Public Property Get TeamCount() As Long\r\n        TeamCount = UBound(pTeam) + 1 &#39;&lt;~ array is zero-based, so count is +1\r\n    End Property\r\n\r\n    Public Property Get GroupCount() As Long\r\n        If UBound(pGroup) &gt;= 0 Then &#39;&lt;~ would be -1 if uninitialized\r\n            GroupCount = UBound(pGroup) + 1\r\n        End If\r\n    End Property\r\n\r\nThen you can do:\r\n\r\n    For ctr = 0 To evt.TeamCount - 1\r\n\r\nNote that this is still a leaky abstraction: the zero-based nature of the encapsulated array is bleeding everywhere.\r\n\r\nA better abstraction would enable this to work:\r\n\r\n    For Each t In evt.Teams\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to achieve this - here&#39;s the easiest (and probably the least performant):\r\n\r\n    Public Property Get Teams() As Collection\r\n        Dim result As Collection\r\n        Set result = New Collection\r\n        Dim i As Long\r\n        For i = LBound(pTeams) To UBound(pTeams)\r\n            result.Add pTeams(i)\r\n        Next\r\n        Set Teams = result\r\n    End Property","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174989/excel-vba-compile-error-argument-not-optional-while-iterating-through-array-atta/58175451#58175451","title":"Excel VBA Compile Error Argument Not optional while iterating through array attached to a class collection"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12144157,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-B58dhO9oKvs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdBnqHf7QezEKKBcKDZUxUqOdxHdA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Poison","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12144157/poison"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570025581,"creation_date":1569875818,"question_id":58174989,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58174989","body_markdown":"I keep getting the error &quot;Compile Error: Argument not optional&quot; while looping through the Team/Group arrays attached to the class Event stored in a collection\r\n\r\nIt gives a compile error at lines as it is not treating the object as Array:\r\n\r\n    For ctr = LBound(evt.Team) To UBound(evt.Team)\r\n    For ctr = LBound(evt.Group) To UBound(evt.Group)\r\n\r\nBut when i directly print it referencing the index it works... like this line:\r\n\r\n    Debug.Print evt.Team(0)\r\n    Debug.Print evt.Group(1)\r\n\r\nMy requirement is simple.\r\n\r\n1.

It is still possible to scroll the map outside of the circle.\r\n\r\nHow can I pass the users gestures down to the MapView so that the circle is just an actual, visual overlay without any functionality?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174984/overlay-views-but-propagate-input-down-to-lowest-z-index","title":"Overlay views but propagate input down to lowest z-index"},{"tags":["c#","c++",".net","directx",".net-core-3.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":88100,"user_id":477420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0eb05243292dee6726c128660d31583b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexei Levenkov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/477420/alexei-levenkov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569877062,"post_id":58174983,"comment_id":102731090,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174983/cant-link-c-net-core-3-0-with-directx-9-0-dependency#comment102731090_58174983"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12145081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fc63e4525d1be6592cb305812b88d99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145081/rob"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":88100,"user_id":477420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0eb05243292dee6726c128660d31583b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexei Levenkov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/477420/alexei-levenkov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569877458,"post_id":58174983,"comment_id":102731221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174983/cant-link-c-net-core-3-0-with-directx-9-0-dependency#comment102731221_58174983"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12145081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fc63e4525d1be6592cb305812b88d99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145081/rob"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570226827,"creation_date":1570226827,"answer_id":58243638,"question_id":58174983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243638","body_markdown":"No one is probably paying attention to this but here is the answer.

I just made a new angular component called menu and just introduced it into all the components that needed it. This happens because the ionicMenu is not referenced again when you go back. You cannot use ionic cli here. You may have to manually work it out. I will edit again if I find the code and put it here.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: Here&#39;s the steps.\r\n\r\n 1. Make a ionic page component called `menu` using ionic-cli\r\n 2. Throw this in its HTML\r\n```html\r\n&lt;ion-header&gt;\r\n  &lt;ion-toolbar [color]=&quot;currentColor&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;ion-buttons slot=&quot;start&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-menu-button&gt;&lt;/ion-menu-button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ion-buttons&gt;\r\n    &lt;ion-title&gt;\r\n      My App\r\n    &lt;/ion-title&gt;\r\n  &lt;/ion-toolbar&gt;\r\n&lt;/ion-header&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ion-menu contentId=&quot;child-content&quot; side=&quot;start&quot; menuId=&quot;custom&quot; class=&quot;my-custom-menu&quot; type=&quot;overlay&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;ion-header&gt;\r\n    &lt;ion-toolbar [color]=&quot;currentColor&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-title&gt;Menu&lt;/ion-title&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ion-toolbar&gt;\r\n  &lt;/ion-header&gt;\r\n  &lt;ion-content&gt;\r\n    &lt;ion-list (click) = &quot;closeMenu()&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-item routerLink=&quot;/dashboard/home&quot; closeMenu&gt;Home&lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-item routerLink=&quot;/dashboard/myorder&quot; menuClose&gt;My Order&lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-item routerLink=&quot;/dashboard/aboutus&quot; menuClose&gt;About us&lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-item routerLink=&quot;/dashboard/contactus&quot; menuClose&gt;Contact us&lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-item routerLink=&quot;/dashboard/feedback&quot; menuClose&gt;Feedback&lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n      &lt;ion-item (click) = &quot;logout()&quot;&gt;Log Out&lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ion-list&gt;\r\n  &lt;/ion-content&gt;\r\n&lt;/ion-menu&gt;\r\n&lt;ion-content overflow-scroll=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;ion-router-outlet id=&quot;child-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/ion-router-outlet&gt;\r\n&lt;/ion-content&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3. Copy all the routes for which you want the menu component from `app-routing.module.ts` and paste them into `menu.module.ts` like\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { NgModule } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\nimport { CommonModule } from &#39;@angular/common&#39;;\r\nimport { FormsModule } from &#39;@angular/forms&#39;;\r\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from &#39;@angular/router&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { IonicModule } from &#39;@ionic/angular&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { MenuPage } from &#39;./dashboard.page&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    component: MenuPage,\r\n    children: [\r\n      {\r\n        path: &#39;&#39;, redirectTo: &#39;home&#39;, pathMatch: &#39;full&#39;\r\n      },\r\n      { path: &#39;schedule&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../schedule/schedule.module#SchedulePageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;orderstatus/:id&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../orderstatus/orderstatus.module#OrderstatusPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;payment&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../payment/payment.module#PaymentPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;aboutus&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../aboutus/aboutus.module#AboutusPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;contactus&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../contactus/contactus.module#ContactusPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;howitworks&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../howitworks/howitworks.module#HowitworksPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;myorder&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../myorder/myorder.module#MyorderPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;orderdetails/:id&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../orderdetails/orderdetails.module#OrderdetailsPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;feedback&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../feedback/feedback.module#FeedbackPageModule&#39; },\r\n      { path: &#39;home&#39;, loadChildren: &#39;../home/home.module#HomePageModule&#39; },\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    CommonModule,\r\n    FormsModule,\r\n    IonicModule,\r\n    RouterModule.forChild(routes)\r\n  ],\r\n  declarations: [MenuPage]\r\n})\r\nexport class MenuPageModule { }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n 4. You should now have a common menu for all the routes under Menu Page. And should be able to access them as `/menu/somepage` if you don&#39;t like the `menu` in the path, change it to somethinglike `dashboard` or something in `app-routing.module.ts`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174956/how-can-i-make-the-menus-being-displayed-correctly-when-navigating-between-pages/58254605#58254605","title":"How can I make the menus being displayed correctly when navigating between pages"}],"owner":{"reputation":2309,"user_id":6347013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89f3b3b69b2b962fa9c1724355baa48e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kinetic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6347013/kinetic"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1570870673,"creation_date":1569875618,"question_id":58174956,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58174956","body_markdown":"The application I&#39;m developing has this structure: there&#39;s two main pages with each a different side menu.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing the first page, the right menu is being displayed.

I have a string that is read in from a file in json format. I want use each library to parse this string repeatedly and then determine the average time that the library takes to parse the file.\r\n\r\nMy results are confusing. For example, using kotlin-serialization, the first time the string is parsed, it takes 140ms. I parsed it 5 more times in the same run of the app, and it took 3, 4, 4, 2, and 5 ms, respectively. Clearly, the subsequent executions are benefiting from some sort of caching or memory advantage.

Since a user can do multiple messages on a single TCP connection I would like to be able to setup rate limiting to mitigate to a safe threshold.\r\n\r\nHow would I go about setting up a solution for rate limiting for WebSockets with HAProxy?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174918/rate-limiting-websocket-messages-with-haproxy","title":"Rate-limiting WebSocket messages with HAProxy"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","rspec","rubygems","factory-bot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15842,"user_id":580346,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba17945a06aac247b06548d5afe341e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mrzasa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/580346/mrzasa"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569875740,"post_id":58174917,"comment_id":102730637,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174917/adding-factory-bot-to-rails-test-suite-breaks-it#comment102730637_58174917"},{"owner":{"reputation":1083,"user_id":3944700,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4df64cd1de5941fb49263a19d80f1482?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hashrocket","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3944700/hashrocket"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569878206,"post_id":58174917,"comment_id":102731479,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174917/adding-factory-bot-to-rails-test-suite-breaks-it#comment102731479_58174917"}],"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":10565289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1744372365672405/picture?type=large","display_name":"Richard Jarram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10565289/richard-jarram"},"last_editor":{"reputation":56,"user_id":10565289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1744372365672405/picture?type=large","display_name":"Richard Jarram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10565289/richard-jarram"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569880441,"creation_date":1569875388,"last_edit_date":1569880441,"question_id":58174917,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58174917","body_markdown":"**EDIT: This problem has been solved. [The thread that solved my problem can be found here][1]. Thanks to @mrzasa for pointing this out.**\r\n\r\nAs soon as I set up Factory Bot in this project and run the ```rspec spec``` command, my test suite fails. But it was running perfectly fine before that.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve set up Factory Bot before. I know what I&#39;m doing in this regard. This isn&#39;t a question about config or initialisation.\r\n\r\nMore background info:\r\n\r\nHere are the gems of interest for :test, :dev environments:\r\n```\r\nfactory_bot 5.1.0, 5.0.2\r\nfactory_bot_rails 5.1.0, 5.0.2\r\nrspec-support 3.8.2\r\nrspec-rails 3.8.2\r\nrspec-mocks 3.8.1\r\nrspec-core 3.8.2\r\nrspec-expecrtations 3.8.4\r\nrspec-activemodel-mocks 1.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the error messages:\r\n\r\nWhen I specify Factory_Bot v. 5.1.0 &amp; Factory_Bot_rails v. 5.1.0\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Superclass mismatch for class Cipher \r\n/Users/richardjarram/.rbenv/versions/2.4.4/lib/ruby/2.4.0/openssl/cipher.rb:64\r\nconstant OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher is deprecated\r\n```\r\n**EDIT: I removed duplicate open_ssl versions in the gemset. RSpec is now working again. [Thread that solved my problem][1] and thanks to @mrzasa for pointing this out.**\r\n\r\nWhen I specify Factory_Bot v 5.0.2 &amp; Factory_Bot_Rails v.5.0.2\r\n```\r\n/Users/richardjarram/.rbenv/versions/2.4.4/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/rspec-core-3.8.2/lib\r\n/rspec/core/reporter.rb:229:in `require&#39;: cannot load such file -- rspec/core/profiler (LoadError)\r\n```\r\nI actually dug into the core rspec files in my gems and I&#39;ve noticed that on l.229 the Profile.new class is being called but there is no require in the file. This entire situation is incredibly bizarre.\r\n\r\n**EDIT: Once the open_ssl issue was solved, FactoryBot is working on the latest version (5.1.0). The older version (5.0.2) however, is imcompatible with my current project.**\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!

So my API will send me a JSON like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    id: 12,\r\n    email: &quot;example@mail.xy&quot;,\r\n    projects: [\r\n      {\r\n        name: &quot;Project X&quot;,\r\n        created: 2019,\r\n        ...\r\n      },\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut sometimes I want to load the project team (for example to admin the team) and I&#39;ll retrieve a JSON as follows: (Just the inverted version)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    name: &quot;Project X&quot;,\r\n    created: 2019,\r\n    team: [\r\n      {\r\n        id: 12,\r\n        email: &quot;example@mail.xy&quot;,\r\n        ...\r\n      },\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow in my angular application I instantiate an object for the retrieved data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class Project {\r\n  name: string;\r\n  created: number | Date;\r\n  team: ProjectTeam;\r\n\r\n  constructor(data: ProjectAPI) {\r\n    this.name = data.name;\r\n    this.created = data.created;\r\n    this.team = new ProjectTeam(data.team);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface ProjectAPI { ... }\r\n\r\nexport class ProjectTeam {\r\n  members: []ProjectTeamMember;\r\n  \r\n  constructor(data) {\r\n    this.members = data.map(elm =&gt; new ProjectTeamMember(elm));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class ProjectTeamMember {\r\n  user: User;\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  constructor(data) {\r\n    this.user = new User(data);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class User {\r\n  id: number;\r\n  projects: []Project;\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  constructor(data) {\r\n    this.id = data.id;\r\n    this.projects = data.projects ? data.projects.map(elm =&gt; new Project(elm)) : null;\r\n    // Here i would get a circular dependency\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd i would do the same thing the other way around if i could, but then i would get a circular dependency.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s the proper way to handle this kind of problem? Or wouldn&#39;t you instantiate objects and just control nested data over an interface?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answers :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174907/how-to-handle-circular-dependent-data-structure-in-typescript","title":"How to handle circular dependent data structure in typescript"},{"tags":["docker","gitlab","docker-image"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":173,"user_id":5788718,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3290a8ff6a8126d8efaa8f03f3ed873f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"DragonSGA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5788718/dragonsga"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569879311,"creation_date":1569879311,"answer_id":58175561,"question_id":58174906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58175561","body_markdown":"A Dockerfile is a **file** with instructions on how to build a docker image.\r\nIn your case it is just an empty folder.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can start here: [Docker Get Started Build Image][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174906/docker-build-via-gitlab-container-registry-failed/58175561#58175561","title":"Docker Build via GitLab Container Registry Failed"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9691426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ca0480585b15e8621faa9a864de1a96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RaZzLe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9691426/razzle"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569879311,"creation_date":1569875347,"question_id":58174906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58174906","body_markdown":"I follow the instructions on [GitLab Container Registry][1] but in the end I always receive the below error message on my Powershell line.\r\n\r\n    Sending build context to Docker daemon  14.44MB\r\n    Error response from daemon: unexpected error reading Dockerfile: read /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder160316193/Dockerfile: is a directory\r\n\r\nAnd, what I&#39;m doing previously are:\r\n\r\n 1.

counting the amount of activities on your activity sheet, do you only need to count the amount of times your user defined number occurs in a range of cells containing just numbers? If so, this dumbed down version could easily do the trick when adapted and added to your code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSub addin_values()\r\nDim Lastrow As Integer, i As Integer\r\nDim activityNumber As String\r\nDim i As integer: i = 1\r\nDim hit As String\r\nDim coppy As New Collection\r\nactivityNumber = InputBox(&quot;Input Activity Number&quot;)\r\nLastrow = Sheets(&quot;Sheet2&quot;).Cells(Sheets(&quot;Sheet2&quot;).Rows.Count, &quot;A&quot;).End(xlUp).Row\r\nFor Each cel In Sheets(&quot;Sheet2&quot;).Range(&quot;A1:A&quot; &amp; Lastrow)    \r\nIf cel.Value Like &quot;*&quot; &amp; activityNumber &amp; &quot;*&quot; Then\r\n    Sheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;).Range(&quot;A&quot; &amp; 2 + i).EntireRow.Insert\r\n    Sheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;).Range(&quot;A&quot; &amp; 2 + i).Value    \r\n    i = i+1\r\nEnd If\r\nNext cel\r\nFor i = 1 To coppy.Count\r\n = coppy(i)\r\nNext i\r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there is more information in the cells than just the activity number, adapt like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDim activityNumber As String &#39;replace dim of activityNumber with this\r\nactivityNumber = &quot;*&quot; &amp; activityNumber &amp; &quot;*&quot; &#39;add in after the inputbox\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT** as per the updated question the offset values of each hit needs to be copied. This is a bit more tricky than just counting the amount of hits. So I opted to add a loop which searches all cells in the spreadsheet, and add the offset of all hits to a collection. Then in sheet 1 another loop will insert a new row for each hit in the collection and past the value.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSub addin_values()\r\nDim Lastrow As Integer, i As Integer\r\nDim activityNumber As

you may know `attr_accessor` accepts a list of symbols (or strings) and for each one two methods are defined: a so-called a setter (e.g. `health=`) and getter (`health`). A list (not an actual type btw.) is one or several expressions separated by a comma, so in your case Ruby expected another expression after `:armor` because you put a comma thereafter.\r\n\r\n(If the trailing comma was intentional, tell us. Some programmers use and recommend them in certain cases (and depending on the language). Though it would make any answer a bit more complicated since Ruby is actually fine with them - just not in this case.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever that&#39;s only one part of your bug&#39;s explanation. One of Ruby&#39;s most basic features as a programming language is that nearly everything has a value (expressions). For example, try something like ` x = if ...` in other languages! It often won&#39;t work as many languages have if-statements, not if-expressions.\r\n\r\nIn Ruby method definitions are also expressions: defining a method via `def` (`def foo; end`) used to return `nil`. Since Ruby 2.1 method definitions return the method&#39;s name (`:foo`). Now the return value of def-expressions may not seem to be very useful to you and it isn&#39;t in many cases but you probably agree the method name (`:foo`) is certainly more useful than `nil`.\r\n\r\nThe primary use case for this are methods like `private`, `public`, `method_function`, etc. which aren&#39;t keywords but are used like one (their defining feature is for calls the parentheses are omitted):\r\n\r\n    private def foo\r\n    end\r\n    # before 2.1\r\n    private  # from now on every method in this class context will be private\r\n    def foo\r\n    end\r\n    # or\r\n    def foo\r\n    end\r\n    private :foo  # only foo will be private but we have to repeat the name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur friend `attr_accessor` is also such a keyword-like method but the value of `def` expressions is more important here. Remember it&#39;s the name of a method as a symbol. You wrote (simplified):\r\n\r\n    attr_accessor :health, :damage, :armor,\r\n    def initialize(health, damage, armor)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # which after the method was defined becomes\r\n    attr_accessor :health, :damage, :armor, :initialize\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make it a bit more clear - without `attr_accessor` your code might look like this:\r\n\r\n    class Battler\r\n      def initialize(health, damage, armor)  # takes 3 required arguments\r\n      end\r\n      def health\r\n        @health\r\n      end\r\n      def health=(v)\r\n        @health = v\r\n      end\r\n      # damage, armor\r\n      def initialize  # takes no arguments\r\n        @initialize\r\n      end\r\n      def initialize=(v)\r\n        @initialize = v\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nYou see you&#39;re redefining `Battler#initialize` and your new one doesn&#39;t take arguments because getters usually don&#39;t.\r\n\r\nRedefinitions aren&#39;t treated as errors since they can be intentional however Ruby can emit a warning for you. Run `ruby -w test.rb` on the command line and it outputs:\r\n\r\n&gt;     test.rb:15: warning: assigned but unused variable - knight\r\n&gt;     test.rb:16: warning: assigned but unused variable - goblin\r\n&gt;     test.rb:2: warning: method redefined; discarding old initialize\r\n&gt;     test.rb:3: warning: previous definition of initialize was here\r\n&gt;     Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n&gt;              1: from test.rb:15:in `&lt;main&gt;&#39;\r\n&gt;     test.rb:15:in `new&#39;: wrong number of arguments (given 3, expected 0) (ArgumentError)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere you can see that in line 2 the `initialize` method which was originally defined on line 3 is redefined. If you&#39;re confused why line 3 comes before line 2 here, then remember that the method definition is part of the list passed to `attr_accessor` so the def-expr has to be evaluated before the call.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174877/why-does-ruby-compiler-count-expected-number-of-arguments-in-this-case-as-zero/58176158#58176158","title":"Why does Ruby compiler count expected number of arguments in this case as zero?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12145161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3HHQ64l8Cr0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfGb-5P9tl6_2WaUepj0_uw4qs4Pw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"FireBurn256","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145161/fireburn256"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15842,"user_id":580346,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba17945a06aac247b06548d5afe341e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mrzasa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/580346/mrzasa"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569883775,"creation_date":1569875193,"last_edit_date":1569876117,"question_id":58174877,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58174877","body_markdown":"I am quite new to the Ruby, and I ran into problem with defining an object of a class.

But less start from the class `Course` here is my version\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class Course {\r\n        private String nameCourse;\r\n        private String codeCourse;\r\n        private int creditsCourse = 0;\r\n        \r\n    \r\n       public void nameCourse(String name){\r\n         this.nameCourse = name;\r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       public void codeCourse(String name){\r\n         this.codeCourse = name.toUpperCase();\r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       \r\n       public void creditsCourse(int credits){\r\n         this.creditsCourse = credits;\r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       \r\n       @Override\r\n       public String toString(){\r\n           return &quot;Course &quot; + this.nameCourse + &quot; with code &quot; +  this.codeCourse + &quot; credit for the course &quot; + this.creditsCourse;\r\n       }\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit does exactly the same work of your but it uses setter instead of the constructor method have a look at this [Setter][1]. I also used the `@Override` annotation to override the standard toString() method of the [Object class][2].\r\nNow to your implementation of the control the main problem with your `Logic` class is that you are limited to just 6 courses what if you need more \r\nLuckily for us, Java has [ArrayList][3] that can handle a dynamically sized array of any class\r\nHere is my example code \r\n\r\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        ArrayList&lt;Course&gt; courses = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        Course course;\r\n        for (int counter = 0; counter &lt; 10; counter++) {\r\n            course = new Course();\r\n            course.codeCourse(&quot;cs&quot; + counter);\r\n            course.nameCourse(&quot;Computer Science &quot; + counter);\r\n            course.creditsCourse(10 + counter);\r\n            courses.add(course);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        for (Course c : courses) {\r\n            System.out.println(c.toString());\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nyou can see the declaration `ArrayList&lt;Course&gt; courses = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()` and the add to the list of the new course `courses.add(course)` and finally `System.out.println(c.toString())` to print the content of the object as string.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like \r\n\r\n    Course Computer Science 0 with code CS0 credit for the course 10\r\n    Course Computer Science 1 with code CS1 credit for the course 11\r\n    Course Computer Science 2 with code CS2 credit for the course 12\r\n    Course Computer Science 3 with code CS3 credit for the course 13\r\n    Course Computer Science 4 with code CS4 credit for the course 14\r\n    Course Computer Science 5 with code CS5 credit for the course 15\r\n    Course Computer Science 6 with code CS6 credit for the course 16\r\n    Course Computer Science 7 with code CS7 credit for the course 17\r\n    Course Computer Science 8 with code CS8 credit for the course 18\r\n    Course Computer Science 9 with

code provided in the question doesn&#39;t appear to take into consideration an input date that is itself an actual EOM (End Of Month).\r\n\r\nOne idea to address an input date that is an EOM would be to add 1 day to the input date thus pushing us into the &#39;next&#39; month (at which point the &#39;previous&#39; month&#39;s EOM == our input date); for all other dates the &#39;previous&#39; month&#39;s EOM will be the same (eg, &#39;previous&#39; EOM will be the same for 20200315 and 20200316 (20200315 + 1 day)).\r\n\r\nTo find the &#39;previous&#39; month&#39;s EOM we&#39;ll take a given month&#39;s BOM (Beginning Of Month) and subtract 1 day.

On the other hand, there is internal API that provides what we need - if we are daring enough and allowed to work with internals.\r\n\r\nLooking at public api and digging into the implementation details of TextAreaSkin, it turns out that (currently, up to fx13 and probably later)\r\n\r\n- `textArea.getParagraphs()` seems to return the charSequences that are separated by a hard linebreak\r\n- the skin merges all paragraphs into a single text node\r\n- text has-a textLayout field that handles the line/char layout\r\n- textLayout provides a method `getLines()` which returns an array of textLines separated by either soft or hard linebreaks, for counting we are only interested in its length.\r\n\r\nBelow is a quick example that demonstrates how to make use of these internals. Basically, it looks up the area&#39;s text node (available after the skin is attached), reflectively accesses its textLayout and query the length of the lines array.\r\n\r\nNote that this is for fx9+ (probabbly not much changed against fx8 except for pulling the skins into public scope, didn&#39;t check, though). To allow access to internals, we need to tweak module access restrictions at both compiletime and runtime.\r\n\r\nCompiletime:\r\n\r\n    --add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene.text=ALL_UNNAMED\r\n\r\nRuntime:\r\n\r\n    --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene.text=ALL-UNNAMED\r\n    --add-opens javafx.graphics/javafx.scene.text=ALL-UNNAMED\r\n\r\nThe example to play with:\r\n\r\n    public class TextAreaLineCount extends Application {\r\n    \r\n        String info = &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. &quot; +\r\n                &quot;Nam tortor felis, pulvinar in scelerisque cursus, pulvinar at ante. &quot; +\r\n                &quot;Nulla consequat congue lectus in sodales.&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        private Parent createContent() {\r\n            TextArea area = new TextArea(info);\r\n            area.setWrapText(true);\r\n            \r\n            area.appendText(&quot;\\n&quot; + info);\r\n            \r\n            Button append = new Button(&quot;append paragraph&quot;);\r\n            append.setOnAction(e -&gt; {\r\n                area.appendText(&quot;\\n &quot; + info);\r\n                LOG.info(&quot;paragraphs: &quot; + area.getParagraphs().size());\r\n            });\r\n            Button logLines = new Button(&quot;log lines&quot;);\r\n            logLines.setOnAction(e -&gt; {\r\n                Text text = (Text) area.lookup(&quot;.text&quot;);\r\n                // getTextLayout is a private method in text, have to access reflectively\r\n                // this is my utility method, use your own :)\r\n                TextLayout layout = (TextLayout) FXUtils.invokeGetMethodValue(Text.class, text, &quot;getTextLayout&quot;);\r\n                LOG.info(&quot;&quot; + layout.getLines().length);\r\n            });\r\n            BorderPane content = new BorderPane(area);\r\n            content.setBottom(new HBox(10, append, logLines));\r\n            return content;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\r\n            stage.setScene(new Scene(createContent()));\r\n            stage.setTitle(FXUtils.version());\r\n            stage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unused&quot;)\r\n        private static final Logger LOG = Logger\r\n                .getLogger(TextAreaLineCount.class.getName());\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174808/javafx-8-count-rows-in-textarea/58220178#58220178","title":"JavaFX 8 count rows in &quot;textarea&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":1450,"user_id":2475470,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7b9b1aacdc6bbc9d7fba048300c0dee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Grendel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2475470/grendel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1450,"user_id":2475470,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7b9b1aacdc6bbc9d7fba048300c0dee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Grendel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2475470/grendel"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":90,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570294650,"creation_date":1569874808,"last_edit_date":1570294650,"question_id":58174808,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58174808","body_markdown":"We are trying to count the number of rows in a TextArea&lt;br&gt;\r\nHere are the TextArea properties PrefWidth 600 and PrefHeight 620 with MaxHeight 620&lt;br&gt;\r\nWrap Text is set to true.

Each of the quads should have different material.\r\n\r\nWhen I create the cube manually and assing the materials to quads also manually, everyting works fine when I run it in editor, or using Unity Remote 5, or when I build the project on device.\r\n\r\nBut when I create the cube programmatically the material is not displayed on android device nor in the editor. It is blue or white (none of the material colors I assigned). But according to inspector, the generated quads have correct materials assigned.\r\n\r\nThe code that creates the cube and assigns the material is in Start() method. It also worked fine when I created new blank project and programmatically create only one quad with a material.\r\n\r\nHere is the code I use to create the quads:\r\n\r\n```Transform parent = cubeTransform.transform;\r\n\r\nQuaternion parentRotation = parent.localRotation;\r\nparent.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 0);\r\n\r\nvar quad = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Quad);\r\nquad.GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;().position = GetQuadPosition(parent, game.GameSize, x, y, parent.position.z);\r\nquad.GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;().localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 0);\r\nquad.GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;().localScale = GetQuadSize(parent, game.GameSize, x, y);\r\nquad.GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;().SetParent(parent);\r\n                \r\nMaterialType materialType = cubeTransform.materialType;\r\nMaterial material = cubeMaterials.Single(q =&gt; q.materialType.Equals(materialType)).material;\r\nquad.GetComponent&lt;MeshRenderer&gt;().material = material;\r\n\r\nparent.localRotation = parentRotation;\r\n```\r\nTo explain some of the code, the cube is empty game object that consists of six empty game objects that has the rotation and position set as it should be and the quads are added to each side (there is more quads on one side of the cube).\r\n\r\nThe code is not polished..","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58174800/material-not-rendering-on-android","title":"Material not rendering on

My non-game software has elements of 3D in a few views which roughly represents 30-40% of the software for mobile devices (iOS and Windows). We used ActionScript3 with Away3D engine and Flash/Adobe Air player to deploy the app.\r\n\r\nMy limited research indicates that Unity3D and or Unreal engines are a solid option but may be faced with a lot of challenges with the non-3D views/features which include pretty much all kinds of standard software views with lists, 2D graphics, graphs, tables, HTML views, PDF preview, web services, database and more. Not to mention that the App actively communicates with a dedicated Admin Panel via API for full App/User/Content management, securely.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like to use the VisualStudio.NET IDE using C# to create and deploy my software on iOS and Windows and which will have an integrated 3D engine that I can call for the 3D views. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not possible (to my knowledge).\r\n\r\nTo conclude, my big question is which technology do you think I should investigate further that will allow long term stability and scalability of my 2D/3D non-game software, taking into account available resources, manpower, ease of use, cybersecurity aspects, etc... \r\n\r\n**Your help is highly appreciated**!
