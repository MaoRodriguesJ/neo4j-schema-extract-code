Anyone here who can help me with it? I came to the point that I probably have to use `.values()` and `.annotate()`. But my results are quite far away from what my goal ist.\r\n\r\nHere my models.py:\r\n\r\n    class Entity(TimeStampedModel):\r\n        name = models.CharField()\r\n        type = models.CharField()\r\n        salience = models.FloatField()\r\n        sentiment_magnitude = models.FloatField()\r\n        sentiment_score = models.FloatField()\r\n        language = models.CharField()\r\n        answer = models.ForeignKey(\r\n            Answer, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=&quot;entities&quot;\r\n        )\r\n    \r\n    class Answer(TimeStampedModel):\r\n        question = models.ForeignKey(\r\n            &quot;surveys.Question&quot;, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=&quot;answers&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        response = models.ForeignKey()\r\n        answer = models.TextField()\r\n    \r\n    class Question(TimeStampedModel):\r\n        survey = models.ForeignKey(\r\n            &quot;surveys.Survey&quot;, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=&quot;questions&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        title = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_(&quot;Title&quot;))\r\n        focus = models.CharField()\r\n    \r\n    class Response(TimeStampedModel):\r\n        survey = models.ForeignKey(\r\n            &quot;surveys.Survey&quot;, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=&quot;responses&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        order = models.ForeignKey()\r\n        attendee = models.ForeignKey()\r\n        total_time = models.PositiveIntegerField()\r\n        ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()\r\n        language = models.CharField()\r\n    \r\n    class Survey(TimeStampedModel):\r\n        id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, editable=False, default=uuid.uuid4)\r\n        event = models.ForeignKey()\r\n        template = models.CharField()\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, what I tried so far.

 I interpret this as gap and islands problem with some twists.  Instead of putting the &quot;end&quot; values on different rows, I would put effective and end dates on one row:\r\n\r\n    select product, store, region, type,\r\n           min(eff_dt),\r\n           date_add(lead(eff_dt) over (partition by product order by min(eff_dt), -1) as\r\n    from (select t.*,\r\n                 row_number() over (partition by product order by eff_dt) as seqnum_p,\r\n                 row_number() over (partition by product, store, region, type order by eff_dt) as seqnum_psrt\r\n          from t\r\n         ) t\r\n    group by product, store, region, type, (seqnum - seqnum_psrt);\r\n\r\nIf you want this on different rows, you can use `union all`:\r\n\r\n    select product, store, region, type, eff_dt\r\n    from (select t.*,\r\n                 lag(eff_dt) over (partition by product, store, region, type order by eff_dt) as prev_psrt_date,\r\n                 lag(eff_dt) over (partition by product order by eff_dt) as prev_date\r\n          from t\r\n         ) t\r\n    where prev_date is null or prev_date &lt;&gt; prev_psrt_date\r\n    union all\r\n    select product, store, region, type,\r\n           date_add(next_date, 1)\r\n    from (select t.*,\r\n                 lead(eff_dt) over (partition by product, store, region, type order by eff_dt) as next_psrt_date,\r\n                 lead(eff_dt) over (partition by product order by eff_dt) as next_date\r\n          from t\r\n         ) t\r\n    where next_date &lt;&gt; next_psrt_date or next_psrt_date is null;\r\n\r\nThe trick here to find rows with the same values is to compare the previous/next date -- but by different partitions of the data.  This is simpler than comparing each column independently, and it also works for `NULL` values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392620/compare-records-and-generate-records/58392820#58392820","title":"Compare records and Generate records"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11720193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d83d2a618c28c94a54618479cf5ef8b7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"marie20","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11720193/marie20"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11720193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d83d2a618c28c94a54618479cf5ef8b7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"marie20","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11720193/marie20"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571160098,"creation_date":1571135544,"last_edit_date":1571160098,"question_id":58392620,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392620","body_markdown":"My requirement is to arrange the records in chronological order and compare every record to its very next record in sequence. If the 2nd record is different than the previous record (in the asc order) pertaining to any field and the record is Active (i.e.flag = &#39;F&#39;), then split the 2nd record by generating a record with eff_date = eff_dt of the second record - 1 day. If the next record is Inactive (ie.e flag = &#39;C&#39; then only output this record but no need to split and create new record\r\nContinue this comparison for all the records.\r\n\r\nFor e.g.,\r\n\r\n    product | eff_dt | store | region | type\r\n    12345 | 18/05/2017 | HA | CA | F\r\n    12345 | 05/10/2018 | K1 | CA | F\r\n    12345 | 01/02/2019 | K1 | CA | F\r\n    12345 | 15/07/2019 | AB | GA | C\r\n    12345 | 07/09/2019 | BT | MD | F\r\n\r\nFrom the above table, first we arrange the records in chronological order.  \r\nNow we compare the first record with second record and see that &quot;store&quot; has changed in the second record `HA -&gt; K1` and second record is active (flag = F). Hence, both the first record and the second record are needed for the output and the second record will be split in 2 parts - a new record is created with ( `eff_dt - 1` ) day.  \r\nNow when we compare the third record to the second record, we see that there is no change in the values of any field and also that the record is Active, and hence this record will be ignored and won&#39;t be output.   \r\nNow we compare the fourth record to the third record we see that it is Inactive (`flag = &#39;C&#39;`) hence, this record will be output as-is but no new record will be generated like we did for the first scenario.  \r\nFinally, the 5th record is found to be the first **Active** record after the product was **closed** (in the 4th record), hence will be also output but no new record will be created.\r\n\r\nThe expected output will be :\r\n\r\n    product | eff_dt | store | region | type\r\n    12345 | 18/05/2017 | HA | CA | F      &lt;&lt;--- output\r\n    12345 | 04/10/2017 | HA | CA | F      &lt;&lt;--- new record generated with (eff_dt - 1)\r\n    12345 | 05/10/2018 | K1 | CA | F      &lt;&lt;--- output as-is\r\n                                               &lt;&lt;--- record not output since no change in values\r\n    12345 | 15/07/2019 | AB | GA | C      &lt;&lt;--- record has changes but also Inactive. Hence, output as-is and new record generation not required\r\n    12345 | 07/09/2019 | BT | MD | F      &lt;&lt;--- record output since this indicates product is reopened and is active again. No new record required.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help with the above logic and how to split the record by creating a new record with eff_dt - 1.\r\nPlease let me know if additional

Reason of the message: ##\r\n\r\n&gt; **This message means that the network connection from the client to the server is working, and that SSH is running. However, key-based authenticatication failed.**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting steps: ##\r\n\r\n&gt; - **Make sure that you have authenticated to gcloud as an IAM user with the [compute instance admin role][1].** \r\n\r\n run `gcloud auth login [IAM-USER]` then try `gcloud compute ssh` again.\r\n\r\n&gt; - **Verify that persistent SSH Keys metadata for gcloud is set for either the project or instance.**\r\n\r\n `gcloud compute project-info describe --format flattened | grep \r\n   commonInstanceMetadata.items | grep ssh | grep -v expireOn`\r\n\r\n&gt;- **It&#39;s possible that you lost the private key, mismatched a keypair, etc. You can force gcloud to generate a new SSH keypair by doing the following:**\r\n\r\n1. If present, by moving `~/.ssh/google_compute_engine` and `~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub`. For example:\r\n\r\n &gt;`mv ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub.old`\r\n\r\n &gt;`mv ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.old`\r\n\r\n2. Try `gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE-NAME]` again. A new keypair will be created and the public key will be added to the SSH keys metadata.\r\n\r\n&gt; - **Verify that the [Linux Guest Environment][2] scripts are installed and\r\n   running.

implementing Facebook Login on my app using Azure B2C and I have to use SFAuthenticationSession to do this because FB doesn&#39;t allow it to run inside a WKWebView. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m basically trying to implement a SFAuthenticationSession with the URL that returns from my server side that is something like this:\r\n\r\n    https://companyName.b2clogin.com/companyName.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;nonce=xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=https://myrul-qa.azurewebsites.net&amp;response_mode=query&amp;scope=offline_access%20openid%20xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx&amp;state=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;domain_hint=facebook.com&amp;p=B2C_1_SiUpIn\r\n\r\nThe problem is, my completion handler is not getting called.\r\n\r\nMy code is basically this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    var authSession: SFAuthenticationSession?\r\n\r\n    func auth(url: URL) {\r\n        \r\n        authSession?.cancel()\r\n        \r\n        self.authSession = SFAuthenticationSession(url: url, callbackURLScheme: nil) { (url, error) in\r\n            # this completion here is not getting

this way, using the facebook URL instead of mine Azure B2C URL the completion is getting called: \r\n\r\n```\r\n    func auth2() {\r\n        let appID = Constant.facebookId\r\n\r\n        var components = URLComponents()\r\n        components.scheme = &quot;https&quot;\r\n        components.host = &quot;m.facebook.com&quot;\r\n        components.path =

   \r\n```\r\nI decalred newscrollPanel in the staffPanel constructor. \r\n\r\nId like to be able to add the newscrollPanel variable in the same place i add the other GUI elements (see botton of code) so that the panel appears next to sort by name. My code ive posted is how i believe this would be done but i recieve the error described at the start. If i add the panel within the sortbylastName action Listener then the panal appears at the end after the Logout button which is false(see this image https://i.imgur.com/sh28fbX.png) Id like to place the scroll pannel next to the sortbylastName Button as shown in the image.

answer your first question, this is quite simple: \r\n\r\nYou have 2 promise object when you get to those lines you mentioned: one is held by `promise` variable, and the other by `p1` variable. When you chain the `catch` directly to `promise`, it does not apply to the promise that is coming back from the `then` chaining - which is stored in `p1`- so you get `unhandled promise rejection error` on the **promise that comes back from the `then` clause**.\r\n\r\nBut, when you chain it to `p1`, which is already chained to `promise`, then the `catch` clause covers them both so no error here.\r\n\r\nThe difference essentailly is that line //1 can catch rejections / errors both from the original promise and then `.then` promise, but line //2 catches only rejects from original promise, leaving rejectes from the `.then` unhandled.\r\n\r\nAbout 2nd question I&#39;m sorry, but too high level for me and I don&#39;t wanna give incomplete / inaccurate answer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392534/unhandled-rejection-error-why-promise-chain-design-decision/58393696#58393696","title":"Unhandled Rejection Error - why? // Promise Chain Design decision?"}],"owner":{"reputation":28354,"user_id":2300597,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBo7Q.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"peter.petrov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2300597/peter-petrov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":28354,"user_id":2300597,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBo7Q.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"peter.petrov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2300597/peter-petrov"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58393696,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571145637,"creation_date":1571135280,"last_edit_date":1571137092,"question_id":58392534,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392534","body_markdown":"A) See please the code below.   \r\nIf I use line `// 1` I get the `onError` method called, that&#39;s OK.   \r\nBut if I use line `// 2` (and comment out `// 1`), then `onError` is still called but there is also an unhandled rejection error. Why? This kind of forces me to do chaining as in `// 1`. If I don&#39;t do chaining but call `catch` on the original promise then I get the `unhandled rejection error`.   \r\n\r\nB) Why the calls `p.then` and `p.catch` do not return the original promise `p`? I find this weird. In all libs which I have seen to allow chaining, the original object (i.e. the `this` object) is returned. In JavaScript when we do `promise1.then(...)` a new `promise2` is a returned which is not the `promise1`. I find this weird. What is the logical reasoning behind this? To me it seems like an unnecessary complication and even a bad practice. Yet another `gotcha` which one needs to remember when working with JavaScript. But OK... I am sure smart people decided to take this approach so... what is the reasoning behind this decision?

Works fine when domain name or ip address mentioned if firewall is disabled.\r\n\r\nHow to solve `UnknownHostException` when domain name is mentioned if firewall is enabled.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392518/unknownhostexception-when-firewall-is-enabled-in-kubeadm","title":"UnknownHostException when firewall is enabled in kubeadm"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","react-redux"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":5959638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/626c6333120e3a590f013dca1d8eef54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gangadhar Gandi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5959638/gangadhar-gandi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571135376,"post_id":58392516,"comment_id":103131168,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392516/cant-undertsand-why-single-array-inside-state-is-not-working#comment103131168_58392516"},{"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":5278604,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec80ee63884e809b8c986a4cbabf855d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AgentX4000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5278604/agentx4000"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":146,"user_id":5959638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/626c6333120e3a590f013dca1d8eef54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gangadhar Gandi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5959638/gangadhar-gandi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571135725,"post_id":58392516,"comment_id":103131373,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392516/cant-undertsand-why-single-array-inside-state-is-not-working#comment103131373_58392516"},{"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":5959638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/626c6333120e3a590f013dca1d8eef54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gangadhar Gandi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5959638/gangadhar-gandi"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571135818,"post_id":58392516,"comment_id":103131427,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392516/cant-undertsand-why-single-array-inside-state-is-not-working#comment103131427_58392516"},{"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":5278604,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec80ee63884e809b8c986a4cbabf855d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AgentX4000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5278604/agentx4000"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":146,"user_id":5959638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/626c6333120e3a590f013dca1d8eef54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gangadhar Gandi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5959638/gangadhar-gandi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571136014,"post_id":58392516,"comment_id":103131528,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392516/cant-undertsand-why-single-array-inside-state-is-not-working#comment103131528_58392516"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":511,"user_id":3262983,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nHQys.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LonelyCpp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3262983/lonelycpp"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571135939,"creation_date":1571135939,"answer_id":58392733,"question_id":58392516,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58392733","body_markdown":"redux state needs to be immutable. `items:state.items` mutates the state which wont be picked up by redux. \r\n\r\ntry `{...state, items}` (where `items` is the new list) or try using Immutable.JS\r\n\r\nfurther info here - https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392516/cant-undertsand-why-single-array-inside-state-is-not-working/58392733#58392733","title":"Can&#39;t undertsand why single array inside state is not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":5278604,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec80ee63884e809b8c986a4cbabf855d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AgentX4000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5278604/agentx4000"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58392733,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571135939,"creation_date":1571135218,"question_id":58392516,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392516","body_markdown":"I&#39;m learning react and redux and can&#39;t seem to understand why a simple array in my state is not functioning right but if I add just another variable which is not even being used then every thing works fine.

is not weird or stupid, first contact with pagination is always a hassle ;)\r\n\r\nWith bootstrap, you could get away with just knowing the maximal occurrences of your card records. You could wrap everything while using **rows** and **cols**, check out this example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;\r\n      1 of 5\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;\r\n      2 of 5\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;\r\n      3 of 5\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;\r\n      4 of 5\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;\r\n      5 of 5\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;  \r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n[Fiddle][1]\r\n \r\nThanks to `.col-4`, you will always get three cards in a row. In your example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;card-group&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;?php foreach ($item as $items) { ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;\r\n        // Your card content goes here, use $item\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;?php } ?&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore importantly, it seems you writing something in plain PHP. If you want to go public, you should consider a framework that has already some validation capabilities and function helpers - even build in pagination! I would pick [Laravel][2] for that. \r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nFixed mistake.

I also moved `.content-5-inside` up one level in the DOM and then this element had a lot of white space at the bottom.

All source code is stored in a remote GIT repository, and on another server we have a Jenkins which is supposed to automatically build the projects, but it does not yet do the job to deploy the build artifacts to a third server where the pre-production version of the solution is running. \r\n\r\nRight now, the deployment is manual since I have not yet managed to automatize is properly, and I would kindly ask for help how to get my Jenkins job running. In the following, I will present what my tries for the automation and also the current manual process.\r\n\r\n### The Jenkins job so far\r\n+ Section **Source code management**: I have chosen GIT, entered the correct repository URL, credentials, and specified the branch `*/master`.\r\n+ Section **Build triggers**: I go for **Poll SCM** with `H 7-21/4 * * 1-5` as a schedule.\r\n+ Section **Build environment**: I only ticked *Inject environment variables to build process* and as *Properties Content* we have `VSToolsPath=../packages/MSBuild.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.targets.14.0.0.3/tools/VSToolsPath`.\r\n+ Section **Build**: \r\n  + I first *execute a window batch command* `nuget.exe restore ourProject.sln` to get the appropriate packages. \r\n  + Next, I *build a visual studio solution using MSBuild*. Here, we did only have the choice to use `.Net VS 2015 install (32bit)`. As command line arguments, I tried several things, so far only `/t:clean;build` works without errors.\r\n\r\n### The manual build and deployment process\r\nLet me quote from the project&#39;s deployment guide:\r\n&gt; +  **Step 1.** In *Visual Studio Professional*, navigate to **View &gt; Other Windows &gt; Task Runner Explorer**. Ensure that `webpack` is not running, start `webpack-prod` instead and wait until it finishes.\r\n+ **Step 2.** In the **Solution Explorer**, initiate the build process for the two startup projects by right-click on the project name and choosing *Publish*\r\n+ **Step 3:** On the pre-production machine start the **Internet Information Services (IIS)** and navigate on the **Connections** side bar on the left to **PRE-PROD &gt; Sites &gt; ourProject**. Stop the website by clicking `Stop` on the (right) side bar *Actions* under *Manage Website*.\r\n+ **Step 4:** To upload you can just drag and drop the corresponding files from your local machine onto the remote desktop into the folder `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ourProject`. \r\n  + For the API project copy `C:\\ourProject\\API` to the remote deployment folder `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ourProject\\API`. Ensure that you take only the four items `bin`, `Global.asax`, `packages.config` and `Web.config`.\r\n  + For the UI project, copy `C:\\ourProject\\UI` to the remote deployment folder  `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ourProject\\UI`. Choose all items except `appSettings.config`.\r\n+ **Step 5:** Restart the website by clicking `Start` on the (right) side bar *Actions* under *Manage Website*.\r\n\r\nMy problem is now how to automatize the deployment steps 3 to 5.\r\n\r\n## What I tried so far\r\nI tried to introduce a packaging step inside Jenkins **Build** section, although I was told that I do not need that. As command line I tried \r\n```\r\n/t:clean;build;package /p:PackageFileName=&quot;%workspace%/myProject_package_%BUILD_NUMBER%.zip&quot;\r\n```\r\nbut this gives me the following error\r\n&gt; C:\\JenkinsWorkDir\\workspace\\ourProject.sln.metaproj : error MSB4057: The target &quot;package&quot; does not exist in the project. [C:\\JenkinsWorkDir\\workspace\\ourProject.sln]\r\n\r\nI am aware of [SO question on that particular error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41021034/error-msb4057-missing-target-pack-when-building-netstandard-nuget-package), but I was not able to resolve that. Also, I would prefer to to deploy without packaging, if that is possible, mainly because I am not sure what to make out of the file-selection described in the manual step 4. \r\n\r\n## References\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41021034/error-msb4057-missing-target-pack-when-building-netstandard-nuget-package - I failed to resolve my packaging error\r\n* https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/continuous-deployment-with-jenkins-and-net/\r\n* https://dzone.com/articles/cicd-in-aspnet-mvc-using-jenkins\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392447/deploy-asp-net-projects-with-jenkins-without-packaging","title":"Deploy ASP.net projects with Jenkins (without packaging)?"},{"tags":["google-apps-script"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":11644600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3Vc8sEWwxIw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc15xu5VGucqlVAsWpzZ14yJuyQNw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dpei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11644600/dpei"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571224295,"post_id":58393189,"comment_id":103166947,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392446/how-to-open-filter-view-without-opening-a-new-tab-or-browser-window-using-apps-s/58393189#comment103166947_58393189"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3360,"user_id":11599789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4650ead58d59d090529a6f31ab3462cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ziganotschka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11599789/ziganotschka"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571137437,"creation_date":1571137437,"answer_id":58393189,"question_id":58392446,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58393189","body_markdown":"Unfortunately the method `setFilter(filter)` has not been implemented so far.\r\n\r\nAlso, the method `getFilter()` does not accept parameters, see [here][1].\r\n\r\nI recommend you to have a look [here][2] to find examples what you can do with filters at current stage.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that you need to combine `SpreadsheetApp` with the [Advanced Sheets Service][3] to achieve your goal.\r\n\r\n[1]:https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#getfilter\r\n\r\n[2]:https://sites.google.com/site/scriptsexamples/learn-by-example/google-sheets-api/filters\r\n[3]:https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/sheets","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392446/how-to-open-filter-view-without-opening-a-new-tab-or-browser-window-using-apps-s/58393189#58393189","title":"How to open filter view without opening a new tab or browser window using Apps Script"}],"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":11644600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3Vc8sEWwxIw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc15xu5VGucqlVAsWpzZ14yJuyQNw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dpei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11644600/dpei"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43,"user_id":11644600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3Vc8sEWwxIw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc15xu5VGucqlVAsWpzZ14yJuyQNw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dpei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11644600/dpei"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571138799,"creation_date":1571134985,"last_edit_date":1571138799,"question_id":58392446,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392446","body_markdown":"I would like to open filter views via button.

For example we could have a view `SimpleSum` which has a special `equals` that makes `a + 0` and `0 + a` and `a` equal or a view `SimpleProduct` that does something similar with `a * 1` and `1 * a` and `a`.\r\n\r\nThe way I have implemented it right now are static methods for each view, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static Optional&lt;SimpleSum&gt; viewAsSimpleSum(Expression e) {\r\n    if(isSimpleSum(e)) {\r\n        return Optional.of(new SimpleSum(e));\r\n    } else {\r\n        return Optional.empty();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static boolean isSimpleSum(Expression e) {\r\n    // cascade of &quot;instanceof&quot; or implementation via visitor\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince there are potentially many different views and algorithms (e.g. a mapping all &quot;viewables&quot; in a stream while leaving the &quot;nonviewables&quot; untouched) that are not dependent on the exact type of view, I would like to have some generic methods like `public static &lt;E&gt; Optional&lt;E&gt; viewAs(Expression e)` or `public static &lt;E&gt; boolean isViewableAs(Expression e)` in some helper class.  Unfortunately I have not succeeded so far (the only viable idea I had was throwing an exception from the constructor of the view, but this I don&#39;t find sufficiently pretty).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to implement something like this in generically Java?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392443/best-pattern-to-view-special-cases-of-immutable-objects","title":"Best pattern to &quot;view&quot; special cases of immutable Objects"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-aop"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":87,"user_id":6078174,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mSfmR5-qURA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOU/4wPjvIHS-BQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raman Preet Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6078174/raman-preet-singh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571138670,"post_id":58392779,"comment_id":103132867,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392441/configure-pointcut-for-spring-jpa-repository-methods/58392779#comment103132867_58392779"},{"owner":{"reputation":77868,"user_id":2696260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WflRS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"M.

It shows\r\n&gt; how you can store credentials for a database in Secrets Manager, and\r\n&gt; then use those credentials in an application that needs to access the\r\n&gt; database.\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**Compliance with Standards**\r\n\r\nAWS Secrets Manager has undergone auditing for the [these][3] standards and can be part of your solution when you need to obtain compliance certification.\r\n\r\nYou can explore this [article][4] to read and write secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need to maintain files, not only object then you can store in s3 and pull files during deployment. but better to enable [server-side encprtion][5].\r\n\r\nBut I will prefer secret manager instead of s3 and environment variable.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can for s3 [here][6] and [here][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-secrets-manager-store-distribute-and-rotate-credentials-securely/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6eZOt.png\r\n  [3]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/tutorials_basic.html\r\n  [5]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html\r\n  [6]: https://dev.to/joaquimadraz/envt---environment-variables-management-from-s3-dl3\r\n  [7]: https://github.com/sachaos/s3env","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392419/how-to-manage-environment-specific-files-in-aws/58392889#58392889","title":"How to manage environment specific files in AWS"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":313,"user_id":7541412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73746c637e4b96106be13bd0d2df3ee7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hassan Murtaza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7541412/hassan-murtaza"},"last_editor":{"reputation":313,"user_id":7541412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73746c637e4b96106be13bd0d2df3ee7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hassan Murtaza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7541412/hassan-murtaza"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571147607,"last_edit_date":1571147607,"creation_date":1571138270,"answer_id":58393421,"question_id":58392419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58393421","body_markdown":"Bajjuri,\r\n\r\nAs Adil said in answer,\r\n\r\n - AWS Secret Manager -- if you want to store data as key, value pairs.\r\n - AWS S3 -- if you want to store files securely.\r\n\r\n&gt; Adding to his answer, you can use AWS [CodeDeploy Environment\r\n&gt; Variables][1] to fetch the files according to the your environment.\r\n&gt; Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve CodeDeploy deployment group for dev environment with\r\n&gt; name &quot;DEV&quot; and deployment group for prod environment with name &quot;PROD&quot;,\r\n&gt; you can use this variable in bash script and call it in life cycle\r\n&gt; hooks of appspec file to fetch the files or secret accordingly.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been using this technique in production for long and it works like a charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/using-codedeploy-environment-variables/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392419/how-to-manage-environment-specific-files-in-aws/58393421#58393421","title":"How to manage environment specific files in AWS"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8856040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3166c05a6155840c1085de99b243795e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bajjuri sushmitha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8856040/bajjuri-sushmitha"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571147607,"creation_date":1571134882,"question_id":58392419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392419","body_markdown":"I am having properties file specific for dev, test and other environments.

Since you&#39;re just starting out here, I&#39;ve gone and done as Mary suggested in a direct comment to your question -- used String.Split() to get a list of words, and an instance of StringBuilder to rebuild the string, as shown in the code below.  This console app code should get you started, though still you&#39;ll have to work out a few of the issues yourself, or traverse some of the links at the bottom to produce better output (if needed):\r\n\r\n    Module Module1\r\n        Sub Main()\r\n            Dim test1 As String = &quot;The Quick Brown Fox in Missisippi Jumped over the Lazy Dog in Tallahassee, \r\n    and told his cousin in Texarkansas, saying the word antidisestablishmentarianism while doing it.&quot;\r\n            Dim wrds As String() = test1.Split()\r\n            Dim wrd As String\r\n            Dim part1 As String\r\n            Dim part2 As String\r\n            Dim sb As Text.StringBuilder = New System.Text.StringBuilder()\r\n            For Each wrd In wrds\r\n                If wrd.Length &gt; 8 Then\r\n                    part1 = wrd.Substring(0, 8)\r\n                    part2 = wrd.Substring(8)\r\n                    sb.Append(part1)\r\n                    sb.Append(&quot; &quot;)\r\n                    sb.Append(part2)\r\n                    sb.Append(&quot; &quot;)\r\n                Else\r\n                    sb.Append(wrd)\r\n                    sb.Append(&quot; &quot;)\r\n                End If\r\n            Next\r\n            Dim finalAnswer As String = sb.ToString()\r\n            Console.WriteLine(finalAnswer)\r\n            Console.WriteLine()\r\n            Console.ReadLine()\r\n        End Sub\r\n    End Module\r\n\r\nand here is the output from the above program:\r\n    \r\n    The Quick Brown Fox in Missisip pi Jumped over the Lazy Dog in Tallahas see, \r\n    and told his cousin in Texarkan sas, saying the word antidise stablishmentarianism while doing it. \r\n\r\nNote that I&#39;ve given you what you asked for, but not necessarily what you really want -- the last part of antidisestablishmentarianism is still too long, the strings, as split, are not pleasing to read.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s really not that easy, and in my opinion, there&#39;s almost an art to it. Therefore...\r\n\r\nFollowing is further information and some links for your to make sure it&#39;s what you want.\r\n\r\nFirst, Here is one person&#39;s [Pseudocode for a recursive solution][1] close to what you want.\r\n\r\nSecond, from [another developer (Bjarke Ebert)][2], \r\n&gt; Donald E. Knuth did a lot of work on the line breaking algorithm in\r\n&gt; his TeX typesetting system. This is arguably one of the best\r\n&gt; algorithms for line breaking - &quot;best&quot; in terms of visual appearance of\r\n&gt; result.\r\n\r\nAnd third, [some good suggestions from JasCav here][3]:\r\n&gt; Obviously, Donald Knuth&#39;s algorithms are excellent. Although there is\r\n&gt; not a C# implementation available, have you considered converting\r\n&gt; another implementation to C#?

you want your referrer code to be only numbers, perhaps generating a unique code is not the best idea. Instead you can save the code in a database, start from `000001` and work your way up. \r\n\r\nIn this case you&#39;re guaranteed to have unique codes since you know all the previous codes.\r\n\r\nThis could also work with alphanumeric characters using the same principle. But starting with `000AAA` or something similar.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the guaranteed non collision you can also keep track of issued referrer codes and invalidate them at will using a column such as `is_active`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nConcrete example from your code:\r\n\r\nLets assume that client Dave has referrer code `illqhx`. Lets also assume that client Linda wants a referrer code too.\r\n\r\nYour code may look something like this:\r\n    \r\n    // get dave&#39;s referrer code from the database\r\n    $dave_referrer_code = &#39;illqhx&#39;;\r\n    $linda_referrer_code = $dave_referrer_code++;\r\n    var_dump($dave_referrer_code); // illqhx\r\n    var_dump($linda_referrer_code); // illqhz\r\n\r\n    // Do note that this code won&#39;t work, it&#39;s just an example\r\n\r\nWhat you should actually do is get the column with the largest id from the database, get the referrer code from there and increment that.\r\n\r\nHaving a `unique` index on the `referrer_code` column will guaranteed uniqueness since you can&#39;t have duplicate codes.\r\n\r\nIt makes much easier as far as I&#39;m concerned. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392384/how-to-generate-unique-referral-code-in-php/58392522#58392522","title":"how to generate unique referral code in php"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12199128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rnu2rXFB13I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcBpM0vIR4xhc8-7z7re4a5y6X_qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zain Shabir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199128/zain-shabir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571141303,"post_id":58393926,"comment_id":103134283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392384/how-to-generate-unique-referral-code-in-php/58393926#comment103134283_58393926"},{"owner":{"reputation":1495,"user_id":1086048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/136318aac9eb75eb79122faeffbe9cf8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dissident Rage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086048/dissident-rage"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12199128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rnu2rXFB13I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcBpM0vIR4xhc8-7z7re4a5y6X_qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zain Shabir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199128/zain-shabir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571150209,"post_id":58393926,"comment_id":103139798,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392384/how-to-generate-unique-referral-code-in-php/58393926#comment103139798_58393926"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12199128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rnu2rXFB13I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcBpM0vIR4xhc8-7z7re4a5y6X_qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zain Shabir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199128/zain-shabir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571212842,"post_id":58393926,"comment_id":103160753,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392384/how-to-generate-unique-referral-code-in-php/58393926#comment103160753_58393926"},{"owner":{"reputation":1495,"user_id":1086048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/136318aac9eb75eb79122faeffbe9cf8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dissident Rage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086048/dissident-rage"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12199128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rnu2rXFB13I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcBpM0vIR4xhc8-7z7re4a5y6X_qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zain Shabir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199128/zain-shabir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571238330,"post_id":58393926,"comment_id":103175697,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392384/how-to-generate-unique-referral-code-in-php/58393926#comment103175697_58393926"},{"owner":{"reputation":1495,"user_id":1086048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/136318aac9eb75eb79122faeffbe9cf8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dissident Rage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086048/dissident-rage"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12199128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rnu2rXFB13I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcBpM0vIR4xhc8-7z7re4a5y6X_qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zain Shabir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199128/zain-shabir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571238411,"post_id":58393926,"comment_id":103175742,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392384/how-to-generate-unique-referral-code-in-php/58393926#comment103175742_58393926"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1495,"user_id":1086048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/136318aac9eb75eb79122faeffbe9cf8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dissident Rage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086048/dissident-rage"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571139871,"creation_date":1571139871,"answer_id":58393926,"question_id":58392384,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58393926","body_markdown":"I recommend adding something like the following to your User class.

By doing so, any component can give a **`[formControl]`** as input to this colour picker component and colour picker can update its value with the help of these functions, it can set its state to touched or untouched, it can set it&#39;s validity to valid/invalid. Basically you get full control inside colour picker component over the control object, you do what you need to and when you need to. \r\n\r\nNow on the other hand, other components using this component can listen to value changes using **`valueChanges`**, listen for status changes using **`statusChanges`** etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could use **valueChanges** when you are only interested in listening changes because while listening you could not update the value of control (because it will go in infinite loop, you will change the value and again valueChanges subscription would fire again.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n###TLDR;\r\n\r\nThey both are different things, have different use cases. One is an interface which a class has to implement while other one is a stream of changed values that any component can listen inside a function. It would not be good to compare the two.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OTmOZ.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392380/why-to-use-valueaccessors-in-angular/58395573#58395573","title":"Why to use ValueAccessor&#39;s in Angular?"}],"owner":{"reputation":513,"user_id":3900951,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":23,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e076f3a0ca5a50d106a2d699d4ca539?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thomas Banderas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3900951/thomas-banderas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58395573,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571191110,"creation_date":1571134750,"question_id":58392380,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392380","body_markdown":"As we know, all `ValueAccessors` (I mean: `NumberValueAccessor`, `RangeValueAccessor`, etc...) are interfaces which are &#39;proxy&#39; between native input and Angular `FormControl`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**But what is the purpose of use it?** \r\nIt is not simpler (and better) to call `.valueChanges` on `FormControl`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392380/why-to-use-valueaccessors-in-angular","title":"Why to use ValueAccessor&#39;s in Angular?"},{"tags":["ssas","mdx"],"owner":{"reputation":997,"user_id":624339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b382e6de0195475373cbbc45c5f38859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vldmrrdjcc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/624339/vldmrrdjcc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571134750,"creation_date":1571134750,"question_id":58392379,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392379","body_markdown":"I have one strange performance problem with one MDX query when I say:\r\n\r\n        Non Empty  NonEmpty(\r\n           \r\n            NonEmpty (  \r\n            {[Customer].[Customer Name].[My Customer]}\r\n            *  AddCalculatedMembers (  DrillDownMember ( { [Account].[Account Code].DefaultMember } ,  { [Account].[Account Code].[All] }  , Recursive )  )  \r\n            ) \r\n    * {[Measures].[Measure 1],[Measures].[Measure 2],[Measures].[Measure 3]}\r\n            )\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nThis query executes in 2 minutes, and after I clear cash with xmla command query speed is still 2 minutes. \r\n\r\nAfter I change order of cross join like this (so set of measures comes first):\r\n\r\n     Non Empty  NonEmpty(\r\n        {[Measures].[Measure 1],[Measures].[Measure 2],[Measures].[Measure 3]} *\r\n        NonEmpty (  \r\n        {[Customer].[Customer Name].[My Customer]}\r\n        *  AddCalculatedMembers (  DrillDownMember ( { [Account].[Account Code].DefaultMember } ,  { [Account].[Account Code].[All] }  , Recursive )  )  \r\n        ) \r\n        )\r\n\r\nthe same query executes in 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n***But after I cleared cash and reverted query to one that executed in 2 minutes, suddenly it still executes in 30 seconds.
