am trying to display the results of some intrinsically positive data in a graph using gnuplot, however I cannot smooth the data whilst keeping the smoothed lines positive. \r\n\r\nI only have 17 points so to make the graph appear smooth, I have tried using csplines. The csplines often interpolate the lines between points to be negative which is a poor representation of the data as they are necessarily positive. I have also tried using bezier, the lines weren&#39;t negative but they didn&#39;t intersect all the data points. Is there a way I can force csplines to remain positive or is there a different smoothing commmand that is better suited to this task.

There is a way _to return [one of a selection of] type[s]  in C functions without using void pointers_.   A struct that is defined to contain two members, \r\n\r\n - A union defined with all of the types of interest.    \r\n - An enum with values indicating which type is being passed.  \r\n\r\nBecause C is not an object oriented language such as `Java` or `Python`, the methods used to accomplish what you want in `C` are not as elegant as what you might in the other laguages, but I have used this method in C, and gets the job done:\r\n\r\n    typedef enum {\r\n       CHAR,\r\n       INT,\r\n       DOUBLE,\r\n       UCHAR,\r\n       UINT,\r\n       ...  //etc etc etc\r\n    } TYPE;\r\n    \r\n    typedef union  {\r\n       char char_var;\r\n       int  int_var;\r\n       double dble_var;\r\n       unsigned char uchar_var;\r\n       unsigned int uint_var;\r\n       ... /// etc etc\r\n    }VAR;\r\n    \r\n    typedef struct {\r\n       VAR var;  // one of the types contained in union\r\n       TYPE type;  // corresponding emum value indicating type sent\r\n    } DATA;\r\n    \r\n    DATA data *pData;\r\n\r\nThis prototype can be used to pass any type (defined in the struct and union above):       \r\n\r\n    DATA * returnAnyType(DATA *data);\r\n\r\nOnce the function processes its input and returns, the values returned can be fed into a `printf` statement via a `switch` statement.  A very bare bones example illustrates: \r\n\r\n    int main(void)\r\n    {\r\n    \tDATA dataout = {12, INT};\r\n    \r\n    \tDATA *datain = returnAnyType(&amp;dataout);\r\n    \tif(datain)\r\n

\t\t\t\tbreak;\r\n    \t\t\tcase (INT):\r\n    \t\t\t\tprintf(&quot;Type returned is \\&quot;int\\&quot;, its value is: %d&quot;, datain-&gt;var.int_var);\r\n    \t\t\t\tbreak;\r\n    \t\t\t// and so

Most sorts have a way of keeping the sorted and unsorted data in separate areas, so that it&#39;s clear what has already been sorted. This sort doesn&#39;t seem to do that.\r\n\r\nIt looks the like the only criteria for a switch to occur is when `board[0] &gt; board[1]`. Is that really all there is?\r\n\r\n\r\nMy suggestions for the code are below:\r\n\r\n\r\n    class MarblesBoard:\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self, marble_sequence):\r\n            self.board = [x for x in marble_sequence]\r\n\r\nIsn&#39;t that a bit redundant? Why not:\r\n\r\n\r\n    class MarblesBoard:\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self, marble_sequence):\r\n            self.board = marble_sequence\r\n\r\n&gt; I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to print the output as numbers\r\n&gt; separated by a space\r\n\r\nThat takes me to your implementation of `__str__`:\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n            return str(self.board)\r\n\r\nThat won&#39;t do. Take a look at the string I get back when I try to do something similar in the shell:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; str([1, 2, 3])\r\n    &#39;[1, 2, 3]&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; \r\n\r\nYou&#39;re better off using `str.join`:\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return &quot; &quot;.join(map(str, self.board))\r\n\r\nYour `switch` method looks fine, except for the fact that you don&#39;t need to return anything from it. Just swap the elements and that&#39;s all you need to do.\r\n\r\nIf I&#39;ve understood the `rotate` method correctly, it can be simplified:\r\n\r\n    def rotate(self):\r\n        self.board.append(self.board.pop(0))\r\n\r\nAgain, you don&#39;t need to return anything from this function.\r\n\r\nYour `is_sorted` can be simplified as well:\r\n\r\n    def is_sorted(self):\r\n        return self.board == sorted(self.board)\r\n\r\n\r\nI would also maybe add a method called `should_rotate` to your `MarblesBoard` class, which returns `True` or `False` depending on whether or not the solver should rotate or switch. It&#39;s meant to be used by the solver later:\r\n\r\n    def should_rotate(self):\r\n        return self.board[0] &gt; self.board[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the `Solver` class. First the `__init__` method:\r\n\r\nBy naming the parameter `MarblesBoard`, (the same name as the class), you are shadowing the identifier of the class - so I wouldn&#39;t call the parameter that. I think `marbles_board` is a better name.\r\n\r\nSecond, I don&#39;t see a good reason for explicitly making `steps` an instance variable in your `__init__`, since the only place you&#39;re using it is in the `solve` method. I would just get rid of it for now.\r\n\r\nThird, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to bind `self.board` to the `board` object of the `MarblesBoard` instance. If your `Solver` class basically just wraps around a `MarblesBoard.board`, you might as well not even make this class and just do all your solving in the `MarblesBoard` class. Again, you don&#39;t need to explicitly `return` from your `__init__`.\r\n\r\n    class Solver:\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self, marbles_board):\r\n            self.marbles_board = marbles_board\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `solve` can be simplified a bit as well:\r\n\r\n    def solve(self):\r\n        \r\n        number_of_steps = 0\r\n        \r\n        while not self.marbles_board.is_sorted():\r\n            if self.marbles_board.should_rotate():\r\n                self.marbles_board.rotate()\r\n            else:\r\n                self.marbles_board.switch()\r\n            number_of_steps += 1\r\n        print(f&quot;Number of steps: {number_of_steps}&quot;)\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s kind of funny that your implementation of `solve` worked as well as it did, seeing as how you are passing in `self` (the `Solver` object) as an argument for the `rotate` and `switch` methods.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457818/variation-on-bubble-sort-infinite-loop-error/58458117#58458117","title":"Variation on Bubble Sort infinite loop error"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12167350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5cd8d65ce478199a15d6060c99d12f4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dumdum","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167350/dumdum"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12167350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5cd8d65ce478199a15d6060c99d12f4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dumdum","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167350/dumdum"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571433741,"creation_date":1571430778,"last_edit_date":1571432599,"question_id":58457818,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457818","body_markdown":"In a particular board game, there is exactly one row and it comprises N spaces, numbered 0 through N - 1 from left to right.

Any help on that would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n    class MarblesBoard:\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;creates a marble board with number marbles in specific spots&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        def __init__(self, marble_sequence):\r\n            self.board = [x for x in marble_sequence]\r\n        \r\n        def __str__(self):\r\n            return str(self.board)\r\n        \r\n        def __repr__(self):\r\n            return &quot;%r &quot; % (self.board)\r\n        \r\n        def switch(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;switch the marbles in position 0 and 1&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            self.board[0], self.board[1] = self.board[1], self.board[0]\r\n            return self.board\r\n            \r\n        def rotate(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;Move the marble in position 0 to position N - 1, and move all other marbles one space to the left (one index lower)&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            copy_board = self.board.copy()\r\n            copy_board[len(self.board)-1] = self.board[0]\r\n            for x in range(1, len(self.board)):\r\n                copy_board[x - 1] = self.board[x]\r\n            self.board = copy_board\r\n            return self.board\r\n        \r\n        def is_sorted(self):\r\n            return self.board == sorted(self.board):\r\n    \r\n    class Solver:\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;solves the marble sorting game when given a marble board as input&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        \r\n        def __init__(self, MarblesBoard):\r\n            self.steps = 0\r\n            self.board = MarblesBoard.board\r\n            return\r\n        \r\n        def solve(self):\r\n            n = len(self.board)\r\n            # print(&quot;n = &quot;, n)\r\n            print(self.board)\r\n            while MarblesBoard.is_sorted(self) == False:\r\n                if self.board[0] &gt; self.board[1]:\r\n                    MarblesBoard.rotate(self)\r\n                    print(self.board)\r\n                    self.steps += 1\r\n                else:\r\n                    MarblesBoard.switch(self)\r\n                    print(self.board)\r\n                    self.steps += 1\r\n            print(&quot;total steps: &quot;, self.steps)\r\n\r\nWith regards to output, the code works fine for the example output here:\r\n\r\n    board2 = MarblesBoard((1,3,0,2))\r\n    solver = Solver(board2)\r\n    solver.solve()\r\n\r\n    [1, 3, 0, 2]\r\n    [3, 1, 0, 2]\r\n    [1, 0, 2, 3]\r\n    [0, 2, 3, 1]\r\n    [2, 0, 3, 1]\r\n    [0, 3, 1, 2]\r\n    [3, 0, 1, 2]\r\n    [0, 1, 2, 3]\r\n    total steps:  7\r\n\r\nHowever, if I add a 4 into the starting board:\r\n\r\n    board2 = MarblesBoard((1,3,0,2,4))\r\n    solver = Solver(board2)\r\n    solver.solve()\r\n\r\n    [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]\r\n    [3, 1, 0, 2, 4]\r\n    [1, 0, 2, 4, 3]\r\n    [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]\r\n    [2, 0, 4, 3, 1]\r\n    [0, 4, 3, 1, 2]\r\n    [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]\r\n    [0, 3, 1, 2, 4]\r\n    [3, 0, 1, 2, 4]\r\n    [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]\r\n    [1, 0, 2, 4, 3]\r\n    [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]\r\n    [2, 0, 4, 3, 1]\r\n    [0, 4, 3, 1, 2]\r\n    [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]\r\n    [0, 3, 1, 2, 4]\r\n    [3, 0, 1, 2, 4]\r\n\r\nNote that 3 0 1 2 4 repeats as the second iteration and the last listed iteration.

I hope this is not frowned upon.)\r\n\r\nI want to minimize a very well-behaved real-valued objective function $f$ from R^I. Feasible points are inside the convex hull of a finite set of points x^1 through x^n. \r\nI am only interested in finding the point y where f(y) is maximized, and do not care about the N weights (in the N-dimensional simplex) that allow me to write y as a convex combination of the x^i.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could simply write the optimization as:\r\n\r\n    popt = fmincon(@(p) f(x&#39;*p),[],[],ones(1,N),1,zeros(N,1),[]);\r\n    y = x&#39;*popt;\r\n\r\nHowever, if the points that span the convex hull are nearly multicollinear, then this compound function (as a function of p) is very flat around the optimum. I suspect that this is slowing down fmincon a lot, and would help it &quot;solve the problem&quot; in the R^I space rather than over the N dimensional simplex.

You can also query the SSH endpoint for each server; the server version string will contain &quot;babeld&quot; for GitHub Enterprise, an OpenSSH string for GitLab, and usually something Java-based for Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nThere are also distinctive HTTP headers for some servers.  You can tack on `/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack` to the end of the URL (which is the refs endpoint).  GitHub will provide you a server header with `GitHub Babel`, GitLab may provide you with special `GitLab` headers, and Bitbucket may also provide identifiable headers (such as `x-server`).\r\n\r\nIn general, though, you can&#39;t parse commit messages based on the remote server type, since a particular project may have moved from one to another.

assertThat(snackMachine.moneyInside()).isEqualTo(Money.HALF_DINAR);\r\n```\r\n*Be noted: the object snackMachine is from class SnackMachine but the return is from Money&#39;s class.\r\nhere is the code for moneyInside.\r\n```java\r\n    public Money moneyInside() {\r\n        return Money.mInsideMachine;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe Code of second file(non changable)(SnackMachine class) Unit test\r\n```java\r\n @Test\r\n    void buying_a_snack_after_inserting_just_enough_money_then_the_money_inside_should_equals_to_money_inserted() {\r\n

System.out.println(&quot;Moneyinside (Unit test)&quot;+Money.mInsideMachine.current_Money.toString());\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Money half dinar (Unit

assertThat(snackMachine.moneyInside()).isEqualTo(Money.HALF_DINAR);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added some code to print the values and the output is:\r\n\r\n```java \r\nMoneyinside (Unit test)0.50\r\nMoney half dinar (Unit test)0.5\r\n\r\n\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\nExpecting:\r\n &lt;com.progressoft.induction.Money@885&gt;\r\nto be equal to:\r\n

are several points that need to be adapted in your Cloud Function.\r\n\r\nFirst of all you need to configure your billing account, as mentioned in the error log. Apparently you are calling a service that is not considered to be a Google-owned service, therefore you need to have an &quot;active&quot; Flame or Blaze plan. See https://firebase.google.com/pricing/ (hover your mouse on the question mark which is right after the &quot;Cloud Functions&quot; title)\r\n\r\n*********************************\r\n\r\nSecondly, you chain different promises by doing\r\n\r\n            authClient.authorize()\r\n                .then(credentials =&gt; {\r\n                    //....\r\n                    return playDeveloperApiClient.purchases.products.get();\r\n                })\r\n                .then((axiosResponse) =&gt; {..})\r\n                .catch(reason =&gt; {\r\n                    //....\r\n                    return null;\r\n                });\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n but you don&#39;t return the first Promise in the chain: You should do `return authClient.authorize()`.\r\n\r\n**********************\r\n\r\nThirdly, in parallel of the promise chain (or in the middle of it) you do `return null;`. \r\n\r\n            authClient.authorize()\r\n                .then(credentials =&gt; {...})\r\n                .then((axiosResponse) =&gt; {..})\r\n                .catch(reason =&gt; {...});\r\n \r\n            return null;   //  &lt;--- !!\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n                .then((axiosResponse) =&gt; {\r\n                    if (axiosResponse.status === 200 &amp;&amp; axiosResponse.data.purchaseState === 0) {\r\n                        return changeShowAdsFalse(userID);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        console.log(typeof axiosResponse.status);\r\n                        //Here you should do something, i.e. throw an error\r\n                    }\r\n                    return null;   //  &lt;--- !!\r\n                });\r\n\r\n**************\r\nFourthly, since you are using the `then()` method to chain your promises, you can remove the `async` keyword in the `onCreate()` method.\r\n\r\n****************\r\nSo, after  configuring your billing account, the following should do the trick. However note that I haven&#39;t seen the code of the `changeShowAdsFalse()` function but I make the assumption, from your comment above, that it returns a Promise.\r\n\r\n    exports.validatePurchases = functions.firestore\r\n        .document(&#39;users/{userID}/purchasesRemoveAds/{documentID}&#39;)\r\n        .onCreate((snap, context) =&gt;

The purpose of this is so we can execute these functions on different angular projects at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis works, but the part that doesn&#39;t is the output from these commands does not get logged to the console.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s essentially what I&#39;m doing (this code is executed by NodeJS):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec;\r\n\r\n    async function execute(cmd) {\r\n      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n        exec(cmd, (err, stdout, stderr) =&gt; {\r\n          if (err) {\r\n            reject(err);\r\n          } else {\r\n            resolve({ stdout, stderr });\r\n          }\r\n        });\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function executeCommandAsync(cmd) {\r\n      const projects = [&#39;proj1&#39;, &#39;proj2&#39;]; // arbitrary list, we get it in a different way\r\n\r\n      projects.forEach(project =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(`Executing command &#39;${cmd}&#39; on project ${project}...`);\r\n\r\n        execute(`${cmd} ${project}`)\r\n          .then(() =&gt;\r\n            console.log(\r\n              `Successfully executed command &#39;${cmd}&#39; on project &#39;${project}&#39;!`\r\n            )\r\n          )\r\n          .catch(err =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(\r\n              `Error occurred executing &#39;${cmd}&#39; command on project &#39;${project}&#39;`\r\n            );\r\n            console.log(`${err}`);\r\n          });\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nSo in the above example, I can pass in a command to execute on all projects, i.e. &#39;ng build&#39;.

ANY help is appreciated, I&#39;ve been stuck with this assignment for a while now and just can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef convertBinToHex(binary):\r\n    binToHex = hex(int(binary, 2))\r\n    temp = list(binToHex)\r\n    temp = temp[2:]\r\n    binToHex = &quot;&quot;.join(temp).upper()\r\n    return binToHex\r\n\r\n\r\ndef convertUnicodeToUTF(unicodeBin, symbolDecimal, returnBin):\r\n    # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6240055/manually-converting-unicode-codepoints-into-utf-8-and-utf-16\r\n    bytesCount = 0\r\n    if int(&quot;0000&quot;, 16) &lt;= symbolDecimal &lt;= int(&quot;007F&quot;, 16):\r\n        if returnBin:\r\n            return unicodeBin\r\n        return convertBinToHex(unicodeBin)\r\n    elif int(&quot;0080&quot;, 16) &lt;= symbolDecimal &lt;= int(&quot;07FF&quot;, 16):\r\n        bytesCount = 2\r\n    elif int(&quot;0800&quot;, 16) &lt;= symbolDecimal &lt;= int(&quot;FFFF&quot;, 16):\r\n        bytesCount = 3\r\n    elif int(&quot;10000&quot;, 16) &lt;= symbolDecimal &lt;= int(&quot;10FFFF&quot;, 16):\r\n        bytesCount = 4\r\n    else:\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    if bytesCount == 2:\r\n        template = [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;]\r\n    elif bytesCount == 3:\r\n        template = [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;x&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;]\r\n    elif bytesCount == 4:\r\n        template = [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;x&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;x&#39;]\r\n    else:\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    results = []\r\n    unicodeList = list(unicodeBin)\r\n    counter = len(unicodeList) - 1\r\n\r\n    for el in reversed(template):\r\n        if el == &#39;x&#39;:\r\n            if counter &gt;= 0:\r\n                results.append(unicodeList[counter])\r\n                counter -= 1\r\n            else:\r\n                results.append(&#39;0&#39;)\r\n        elif el == &#39;0&#39;:\r\n            results.append(&#39;0&#39;)\r\n        else:\r\n            results.append(&#39;1&#39;)\r\n\r\n    results.reverse()\r\n    results = &quot;&quot;.join(results)\r\n\r\n    if returnBin:\r\n        return results\r\n    else:\r\n        return convertBinToHex(results)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncodePage = {}\r\nwith open(&quot;CP437.txt&quot;) as f:\r\n    for line in f:\r\n        (key, val) = line.split()\r\n        codePage[key] = val\r\n\r\ntext = []\r\n\r\nwith open(&quot;386intel.txt&quot;, &#39;rb&#39;) as f:\r\n    while True:\r\n        c = f.read(1)\r\n        if c:\r\n            # Converts bytes to bits (string)\r\n            text.append(&quot;{:08b}&quot;.format(int(c.hex(), 16)))\r\n        if not c:\r\n            print(&quot;End of file&quot;)\r\n            break\r\n\r\n\r\nbytesString = 0\r\nbytesStringInt = 0\r\nresultFile = open(&quot;rez.txt&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;)\r\n\r\nfor item in text:\r\n    decimalValue = int(item, 2)\r\n    newUnicode = codePage[str(decimalValue)]\r\n    unicodeToBin = &quot;{0:08b}&quot;.format(int(newUnicode, 16))\r\n    bytesString = convertUnicodeToUTF(unicodeToBin, decimalValue, True)\r\n    if len(bytesString) &gt;

there is no &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;. A possible solution depends on the usage patterns, your resources and requirements.\r\n\r\nQuestions to ask:\r\n\r\n - How big is the total dataset, now and in the future?\r\n - How big is the displayed dataset?\r\n - How many users with searches?\r\n - Is it a business application with a closed user group or a public web application that needs to scale?\r\n - What is the update frequency and what kind of updates are common?\r\n - How many different search patterns are present?\r\n\r\nThe biggest question of all:\r\n\r\n*Is it really needed?*\r\n\r\nLooking at a bunch of search interfaces, the user expects an update only when there is an interaction. If it is similar to a search, then the users will not expect an instant update. An instant update can be useful and &quot;innovative&quot;, but you do spend a lot of engineering costs into that problem.\r\n\r\nSo before jumping onto the engineering task, make sure that the benefit will justify the costs. Maybe check on these alternative approaches first:\r\n\r\n 1. Don&#39;t do it. Only update on a user interaction. Maybe add a reload button.\r\n 2. Only notify the user that an update occurred, but only update when the user hits &quot;reload&quot;. This solves the problem that the user may not have the browser tab in focus and the transfer is a waste.\r\n\r\n&gt; But I am concerning the memory usage that this will create in case I have a lot of users and the user list with the item ids can be very big too.\r\n\r\nIn our applications we observe that there are not so many different search patterns / filters. Let&#39;s say you might have 1000 user sessions, but only 20 different popular searches. If that is true, you can do:\r\n\r\n - For each search filter, you can store a hash value of the result.\r\n - If you do the update of the main data, you run the searches again and only send an update to the user if the hash value changed.\r\n\r\nIf it is a public web application, you should optimize more. E.g. don&#39;t send an update when the application has no focus.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457684/java-in-memory-cache-with-subcaches-for-each-client/58499051#58499051","title":"Java in-memory cache with subcaches for each client"}],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":7136237,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/145ec68ff6c9dca3c49f9af9edf9483c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Peter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7136237/peter"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571729040,"creation_date":1571430113,"question_id":58457684,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457684","body_markdown":"I have a ConcurrentMap which is my in-memory cache/database for my web app.\r\nThere I have stored my entity with the id as key.\r\nThis is how my entity basically looks like.\r\n    \r\n    public class MyEntity {\r\n         private int id;\r\n         private String name;\r\n         private Date start;\r\n         private Date end;\r\n         ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow I have multiple Users which requests different data from my map.\r\nUser1 has a filter for the start date. So for example he only gets item 1, 2, and 3 of my map. User2 has also a filter and only gets item 2, 3, 4, 5 of the map.\r\nSo they only get a part of the complete map. I am doing the filtering on my server because the map is to big to send the complete map and I need to check other attributes.\r\n\r\nMy problem now is that the entries in the map can be updated / removed / added from some other API calls and I want to live update the entries on the user side.\r\n\r\nFor now I am sending a notification to the users that the map has been updated and then every user loads the complete data which the user needs.\r\nFor example item 8 has been updated. User1 gets a notification and loads item 1, 2, 3 again even if the update was only on item 8. So in this case it would be unnecessary to update for User1 because he doesnt need item 8.\r\n\r\nNow i am searching for a good solution so that the User only receives the necessary updates.\r\n\r\nOne way I was thinking about was to store temporarily all items id which the user requested. So on an update notification I can check if the item updated is in the list and then send the updated item to the user only if it is in the users list.\r\nBut I am concerning the memory usage that this will create in case I have a lot of users and the user list with the item ids can be very big too.\r\n\r\nWhat would be a good solution to send only the added / updated / removed item to the user and only if the user needs that item?\r\nSo something like observing only a part of the base map (cache) but with a notification for every action like adding, updating and removing item.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457684/java-in-memory-cache-with-subcaches-for-each-client","title":"Java in-memory cache with subcaches for each client"},{"tags":["javascript","html","ajax"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5284,"user_id":978005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9219975d0b744e19422761516d419f12?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Phix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/978005/phix"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571430292,"post_id":58457682,"comment_id":103252464,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457682/how-do-i-change-a-picture-using-javascript-and-ajax#comment103252464_58457682"},{"owner":{"reputation":658,"user_id":3224608,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0d3eO.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"daddygames","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3224608/daddygames"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571430328,"post_id":58457682,"comment_id":103252475,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457682/how-do-i-change-a-picture-using-javascript-and-ajax#comment103252475_58457682"},{"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":9746624,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0e2ecaa9f88e53663efe6443c98cb7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wzrd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9746624/wzrd"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571430994,"post_id":58457682,"comment_id":103252713,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457682/how-do-i-change-a-picture-using-javascript-and-ajax#comment103252713_58457682"},{"owner":{"reputation":8848,"user_id":5217142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57daeb5f96b7a591e3447d41e59bbc94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"traktor53","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5217142/traktor53"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571441554,"post_id":58457682,"comment_id":103255224,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457682/how-do-i-change-a-picture-using-javascript-and-ajax#comment103255224_58457682"},{"owner":{"reputation":8848,"user_id":5217142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57daeb5f96b7a591e3447d41e59bbc94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"traktor53","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5217142/traktor53"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571441819,"post_id":58457682,"comment_id":103255266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457682/how-do-i-change-a-picture-using-javascript-and-ajax#comment103255266_58457682"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":9746624,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0e2ecaa9f88e53663efe6443c98cb7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wzrd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9746624/wzrd"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7320,"user_id":215552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26bda02894d869c95f620de4b7cd386d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Heretic Monkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215552/heretic-monkey"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571481767,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571430202,"creation_date":1571430104,"last_edit_date":1571430202,"question_id":58457682,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457682","body_markdown":"I have four folders which all have photos in them.

Is this an issue with Meteor, is DDP just going slow?\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say I have some default generic collection called Objects.\r\n\r\n    const Objects = new Mongo.Collection(&quot;Objects&quot;); \r\n\r\nSo in my onCreated I subscribe to a collection as follows\r\n\r\n    Template.foo.onCreated(function () {\r\n        var self = this;\r\n    \r\n        self.autorun(function () {\r\n            const objId= FlowRouter.getParam(&quot;id&quot;);\r\n    \r\n            \r\n                self.objectSubscription = Meteor.subscribe(&#39;obj&#39;, objId, {\r\n                    onReady: function () {\r\n                      \r\n                    },\r\n                    onStop: function (error) {\r\n                        if (error) {\r\n                            alert(&#39;error&#39;)\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n\r\n\r\nThen in onRendered I have to hack it and unnecessarily re-subscribe because I don&#39;t have objId i.e. I can&#39;t just use Objects.find(),\r\n\r\n    Template.foo.onRendered(function () {\r\n        const objId= FlowRouter.getParam(&quot;id&quot;);\r\n    \r\n        Meteor.subscribe(&#39;obj&#39;, objId, {\r\n            onReady: function () {\r\n                $(&#39;#obj&#39;).addClass(&#39;highlight&#39;);\r\n            },\r\n            onStop: function (error) {\r\n                if (error) {\r\n                    alert(&#39;error&#39;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        //I feel like I should just be able to do \r\n        //const obj = Objects.findOne({_id:objId})\r\n        //$(&#39;#obj&#39;).addClass(&#39;highlight&#39;)\r\n\r\n    });\r\n        \r\nAny insights, why would I be losing data in minimongo? And is it bad practice to &quot;re-subscribe&quot;?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457658/meteor-tracker-not-receiving-subscriptions-automatically","title":"Meteor Tracker

answering the question, I would like to clear some air about measuring the performance of PowerShell cmdlets. Native PowerShell is very good in streaming objects and therefore could save a lot of memory if streamed correctly (**do not assign a stream to a variable or use brackets**). PowerShell is also capable of invoking almost every existing [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) methods (like `Add()`) and technologies like [LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/).\r\n\r\nThe usual way of measuring the performance of a command is:\r\n\r\n    (Measure-Command {&lt;myCommand&gt;}).TotalMilliseconds\r\n\r\nIf you use this on native powershell streaming cmdlets, they appear not to perform very well in comparison with statements and dotnet commands. Often it is concluded that e.g. LINQ outperforms native PowerShell commands well over a factor hundred. The reason for this is that LINQ is reactive and using a deferred (lazy) execution: It tells it has done the job but it is actually doing it at the moment you need any result (besides it is caching a lot of results which is easiest to exclude from a benchmark by starting a new session) where of Native PowerShell is rather proactive: it passes any resolved item immediately back into the pipeline and any next cmdlet (e.g. `Export-Csv`) might than finalize the item and release it from memory.  \r\nIn other words, if you have a slow input (see: [Advocating native PowerShell](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58357033/1701026)) or have a large amount data to process (e.g. larger than the physical memory available), it might be better and easier to use the Native PowerShell approach.  \r\nAnyways, if you are comparing any results, you should test is in practice and test it end-to-end and not just on data that is already available in memory.\r\n\r\nBuilding a list\r\n---------------\r\nI agree that using the `Add()` method on a list is much faster that using `+=` which concatenates the new item with the current array and then **reassigns** it back to the array.  \r\nBut again, both approaches stall the pipeline as they collect all the data in memory where you might be better off to intermediately release the result to the disk.  \r\n\r\nHashTables\r\n----------\r\nYou will probably find the most performance improvement in using a hash table as they are optimized for a [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).  \r\nAs it is required to compare two collections to each other, you can&#39;t stream both but as explained, it might be best and easiest you use 1 hash table for one side and compare this to each item in a stream at the other side and because you want to compare the `AllData` which each of the other tables, it is best to index that table into memory (in the form of a hash table).\r\n\r\nThis is how I would do this:\r\n\r\n    $Main = @{}\r\n    ForEach ($Item in $All) {\r\n    \t$Main[$Item.EmployeeNumber] = @{MainName = $Item.Name; MainDomain = $Item.Domain}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    ForEach ($Name in &#39;AAA&#39;, &#39;BBB&#39;, &#39;CCC&#39;, &#39;DDD&#39;) {\r\n    \tImport-Csv &quot;C:\\$Name.csv&quot; | Where-Object {$Main.ContainsKey($_.EmployeeNumber)} | ForEach-Object {\r\n    \t\t[PSCustomObject](@{EmployeeNumber = $_.EmployeeNumber; Name = $_.Name; Domain = $_.Domain} + $Main[$_.EmployeeNumber])\r\n    \t} | Export-Csv &quot;C:\\Output$Name.csv&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Addendum**\r\n\r\nBased on the comment (and the duplicates in the lists), it appears that actually a join on all keys is requested and not just on the `EmployeeNumber`. For this you need to concatenate the concerned keys (separated with a separator that is *not* used in the data) and use that as key for the hash table.  \r\nNot in the question but from the comment it appears also that full-join is expected. For the right-join part this can be done by returning the right object in case there is no match found in the main table (`$Main.ContainsKey($Key)`). For the left-join part this is more complex as you will need to track ($InnerMain) which items in main are already matched and return the leftover items in the end:\r\n\r\n    $Main = @{}\r\n    $Separator = &quot;`t&quot;\t\t\t\t\t\t# Chose a separator that isn&#39;t used in any value\r\n    ForEach ($Item in $All) {\r\n    \t$Key = $Item.EmployeeNumber, $Item.Name, $Item.Domain -Join $Separator\r\n    \t$Main[$Key] = @{MainEmployeeNumber = $Item.EmployeeNumber; MainName = $Item.Name; MainDomain = $Item.Domain}\t# What output is expected?\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    ForEach ($Name in &#39;AAA&#39;, &#39;BBB&#39;, &#39;CCC&#39;, &#39;DDD&#39;) {\r\n    \t$InnerMain = @($False) * $Main.Count\r\n    \t$Index = 0\r\n    \tImport-Csv &quot;C:\\$Name.csv&quot; | ForEach-Object {\r\n    \t\t$Key = $_.EmployeeNumber, $_.Name, $_.Domain -Join $Separator\r\n    \t\tIf ($Main.ContainsKey($Key)) {\r\n    \t\t\t$InnerMain[$Index] = $True\r\n    \t\t\t[PSCustomObject](@{EmployeeNumber = $_.EmployeeNumber; Name = $_.Name; Domain = $_.Domain} + $Main[$Key])\r\n    \t\t} Else {\r\n    \t\t\t[PSCustomObject](@{EmployeeNumber = $_.EmployeeNumber; Name = $_.Name; Domain = $_.Domain; MainEmployeeNumber = $Null; MainName = $Null; MainDomain = $Null})\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\t$Index++\r\n    \t} | Export-Csv &quot;C:\\Output$Name.csv&quot;\r\n    \t$Index = 0\r\n    \tForEach ($Item in $All) {\r\n    \t\tIf (!$InnerMain[$Index]) {\r\n    \t\t\t$Key = $Item.EmployeeNumber, $Item.Name, $Item.Domain -Join $Separator\r\n    \t\t\t[PSCustomObject](@{EmployeeNumber = $Null; Name = $Null; Domain = $Null} + $Main[$Key])\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\t$Index++\r\n    \t} | Export-Csv &quot;C:\\Output$Name.csv&quot;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457655/which-operator-provides-quicker-output-match-contains-or-where-object-for-larg/58474740#58474740","title":"Which operator provides quicker output -match -contains or Where-Object for large CSV files"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":1861131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b34effe3c1127653d9cad0585744ea0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeetcu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1861131/jeetcu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46,"user_id":1861131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b34effe3c1127653d9cad0585744ea0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeetcu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1861131/jeetcu"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58474740,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571650930,"creation_date":1571429961,"last_edit_date":1571509771,"question_id":58457655,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457655","body_markdown":"I am trying to build a logic where I have to query 4 large CSV files against 1 CSV file.

It looks at the defined width of the block it&#39;s animating and basically calculates the steps (interim widths) needed to get from 0 to that width, and sets the width to those steps every x milliseconds, over the total you&#39;ve given it.\r\n\r\nSo, now that we&#39;ve told jQuery how wide it will be, it can calculate the correct amount to animate in each step.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n\r\n        var search_block = $(&#39;.search-block&#39;);\r\n        var search_block_overlay = $(&#39;.search-block-overlay&#39;);\r\n\r\n        $(&#39;#dashboard-sub-search&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function() {\r\n\r\n            search_block.animate({width: &quot;toggle&quot;}, 300);\r\n            search_block.addClass(&quot;search-block-active&quot;);\r\n            search_block_overlay.addClass(&quot;search-block-overlay-active&quot;);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        $(&#39;#close-search&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function() {\r\n            search_block.animate({width: &quot;toggle&quot;}, 300);\r\n            search_block.css({&#39;display&#39;: &#39;none&#39;});\r\n            search_block_overlay.removeClass(&quot;search-block-overlay-active&quot;);\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .search-block {\r\n        display: none;\r\n        background: white;\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        width: 600px;\r\n        height: 100vh;\r\n        top: 0;\r\n        padding: 30px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .search-header {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .search-form {\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .search-content {\r\n        margin-left: 38px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .close-search {\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n        font-size: 36px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .search-block-active {\r\n        display: block;\r\n    }\r\n    .search-block-overlay {\r\n        display: none;\r\n        background-color: rgba(9, 30, 66, 0.54);\r\n        width: calc(100% - 600px);\r\n        height: 100vh;\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        top: 0;\r\n        right: 0;\r\n    }\r\n    .search-block-overlay-active {\r\n        display: block;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.css&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;dashboard-sub-top-search mt-4&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;i id=&quot;dashboard-sub-search&quot; class=&quot;fa fa-search dashboard-sub-search&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;search-block&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;search-header&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;close-search-block mr-3&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;i id=&quot;close-search&quot; class=&quot;fa fa-times close-search&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;search-form&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; placeholder=&quot;Search&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;search-content mt-5&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h6&gt;Recent search history&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;search-block-overlay&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457653/jquery-width-input-field-bug/58458101#58458101","title":"jQuery width input field bug"}],"owner":{"reputation":474,"user_id":7301337,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F8vRp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rainier laan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7301337/rainier-laan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":474,"user_id":7301337,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F8vRp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rainier laan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7301337/rainier-laan"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58458101,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571432175,"creation_date":1571429955,"last_edit_date":1571431171,"question_id":58457653,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457653","body_markdown":"I made a custom search block that slides out when you click on the search icon.

There must be a faster way to drop dataframes from memory...what am I missing? \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457648/faster-way-to-delete-dataframes-in-pandas-on-jupyter","title":"Faster way to delete dataframes in pandas on jupyter?"},{"tags":["react-native","expo","react-native-flatlist"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":6051323,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2e158ebb542a2af7f7646a658ea65b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mmelotti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6051323/mmelotti"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571431898,"post_id":58457644,"comment_id":103253032,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457644/flatlist-content-doesnt-fit-100#comment103253032_58457644"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11777895,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156163453200894/picture?type=large","display_name":"Hatim Fayez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11777895/hatim-fayez"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571429902,"creation_date":1571429902,"question_id":58457644,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457644","body_markdown":"I have this FlatList content doesn&#39;t fit 100% on android emulator while in ios it fits\r\n\r\nI tried different styling for both container and contentContainer but nothing works \r\n\r\nI tried as well to search a lot for days to solve this issue, I removed &lt;ScrollView&gt;

This is governed by the [JLS, Section 15.27.3][1], which states:\r\n\r\n&gt; A lambda expression is compatible in an assignment context, invocation context, or casting context with a target type T if T is a functional interface type (&#167;9.8) and the expression is _congruent_ with the function type of the _ground target type_ derived from T.\r\n\r\nThe type `String` is not a functional interface type, but `Runnable` is.  The lambda takes no arguments and returns no data, so it is _congruent_ with `Runnable`.\r\n\r\nMore generally, the types of parameters in a lambda expression must match the types of parameters of the single abstract method of a functional interface type, and the return types must match also.\r\n\r\nIn your example, each of the 3 functional interface types is distinct, so at most one will match.  If there are multiple functional interface types that could possible match, that would be ambiguous, only resolvable by casting the lambda expression to the intended functional interface type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.27.3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457643/how-does-the-compiler-know-which-class-the-lamba-is-implementing/58457792#58457792","title":"How does the compiler know which class the lamba is implementing?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11861,"user_id":148844,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/263aa1ae12d9757f78167b80e596c3df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chloe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/148844/chloe"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58457792,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571430650,"creation_date":1571429899,"question_id":58457643,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457643","body_markdown":"I see [`Thread()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#constructor.summary) takes both `Runnable` and `String` for single argument constructors.
