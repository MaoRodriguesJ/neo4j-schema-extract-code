This list of tasks will simply be files loaded through the GUI (1 file per test).\r\n\r\nWhen at test is started, it should start right away. The tests could be very long and very asynchronous in that an action could take seconds or tens of minutes  (e.g. heating up a device), followed by a measurement that takes a few seconds (or minutes), followed by a long period of inaction (24 hours) before the test is repeated again.\r\n\r\nI could have up to 16 tests running at the same time, but I need the flexibility to be able to cancel any one of those tests at any time.

staleness issues are occurring because React is not aware of your dependencies on the component state.\r\n\r\nFor example, `useEffect` ensures that value of `showMoreRows` from the scope of the initial render will be called on every scroll. This copy of `showMoreRows` refers to the initial value of `pageNum`, but that value is &quot;frozen&quot; in a [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) along with the function and won&#39;t change when the component state does. Hence the scroll listening won&#39;t work as it needs to know the current state of `pageNum`.\r\n\r\nYou can resolve the issues by using [callbacks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) to &quot;hookify&quot; `showMoreRows` and `fetchData` and declare their dependence on the component state. You must then declare the dependence of `useEffect` on these callbacks and use a [clean-up function](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#cleaning-up-an-effect) to handle the effect being invoked more than once.\r\n\r\nIt would look something like this (I haven&#39;t tried running the code):\r\n\r\n\r\n    import React, { useState } from &#39;react&#39; \r\n    \r\n    function Table(props) {\r\n      const [ cities, setCities ] = useState([])\r\n      const [ pageNum, setPageNum ] = useState(0)\r\n\r\n      useEffect(()=&gt; { \r\n        // Run this only once by not declaring any dependencies\r\n        fetchData(0)\r\n      }, [])\r\n    \r\n      useEffect(()=&gt; {\r\n        // This will run whenever showMoreRows changes.\r\n\r\n        const onScroll = () =&gt; {\r\n          if (Math.ceil(table.scrollHeight - table.scrollTop) === table.clientHeight) showMoreRows()\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        document.querySelector(&quot;.TableComponent&quot;).onscroll = onScroll;\r\n\r\n        // Clean-up\r\n        return () =&gt; document.querySelector(&quot;.TableComponent&quot;).onscroll = null;\r\n      }, [showMoreRows])\r\n    \r\n      const showMoreRows = React.useCallback(async function () {\r\n        console.log(&quot;Show more rows!&quot;)\r\n        await fetchData(pageNum)\r\n      }, [fetchData, pageNum]);\r\n    \r\n      const fetchData = React.useCallback(async function (page) {\r\n        // some code, describing fetching\r\n        // EDIT2 start\r\n        console.log(pageNum)\r\n        // EDIT2 end\r\n        const jsonResponse = await {}// THE RESPONSE FROM THE FETCH\r\n        if(page) {\r\n          setCities([...cities, ...jsonResponse])\r\n          console.log(&quot;page is true&quot;, page)\r\n          setPageNum(pageNum + 1)\r\n        } else {\r\n          console.log(&quot;page is false&quot;, page) // this always runs and prints &quot;page is false 0&quot;\r\n          setCities([...cities, ...jsonResponse])\r\n          setPageNum(1)\r\n         }\r\n      }, [setCities, cities, setPageNum, pageNum]);\r\n\r\n      return &lt;div className=&quot;TableComponent&quot;&gt;

\r\n\r\nfunction Table(props) {\r\n  const [ cities, setCities ] = useState([])\r\n  const [ pageNum, setPageNum ] = useState(0)\r\n\r\n  useEffect(()=&gt; { // this sets up the listener for the infinite scroll\r\n    document.querySelector(&quot;.TableComponent&quot;).onscroll = () =&gt;

{ pageNum } \r\n           &lt;!-- The rest of the component --&gt; \r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nThe table features an &quot;infinite-scrolling&quot;-feature, so when you scroll to the bottom of the page it prints `&quot;Show more rows!&quot;` and runs `fetchData(pageNum)` to get more data. At this point, after the initial fetch, the `pageNum`-variable should be 1 or more, but for some reason the function acts as if it is 0. I put the `pageNum`-variable on display in the JSX, and I can see that it is `1`, but it still prints out `&quot;page is false 0&quot;` when ever I run it. \r\n\r\nWhen I try to google the issue, it seems the only similar thing could be that I try to read a useState-variable too soon after using setPageNum (before the redraw), but that isn&#39;t the case here as far as I can see. I give it plenty of time between tries, and it always says `pageNum` is zero. \r\n\r\nAny ideas as to what I am doing wrong, and how this makes sense in any way? \r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just tried the code I wrote over, and it seemed to work - however the full code I have doesn&#39;t work. Anyone have any ideas about problems related to this, even if the above code might work? \r\n\r\nEDIT2: I added a `console.log(pageNum)` to the `fetchData`-function, and tested a bit, and it seems that whatever I put into the initial value in `useState(VALUE)` is what is being printed. That makes **NO** sense to me. \r\nHelp.\r\n\r\nEDIT3: Added await, already had it in real code\r\n\r\nEDIT4: I&#39;ve tried at this for a while, but realized as I am using react that I could move the scroll-listener I have down to the JSX-area, and then it worked - for some reason. It now works. Can&#39;t really mark any answers as the correnct ones, but the problem is somewhat solved. \r\n\r\nThanks all who tried to help, really appreciate it.

href=&quot;https://www.example.com&gt;Cell Value 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;`), I need to write the href value (https://www.example.com in this case) and _not_ the html text (Cell Value 1 in this case)\r\n\r\nThe code below shows a function that loops over rows and then columns. I have no problems creating a CSV this way, but am struggling to implement the &quot;check&quot; for `&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;` values. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n\tfunction downloadCSV() {\r\n\t\tvar table = document.getElementById(&quot;table-example&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\t// Array of rowData arrays\r\n\t\tvar results = []; \r\n        // holds data from each table row\r\n\t\tvar rowData;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t   //iterate through rows, skipping header \r\n\t\tfor (var i = 1, row; row = table.rows[i]; i++) {\r\n\t\t\trowData = [];\r\n\r\n\t    \t//iterate through columns\r\n\t\t\tfor (var j = 0, col; col = row.cells[j]; j++) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Checking for href and extracing link\r\n\t\t\t\tlet link = $(this).find(&#39;a&#39;).attr(&#39;href&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log(link);\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\tif () {\r\n\t                 ....\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\telse {\r\n\t\t\t\t\trowData.push(col.textContent);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tresults.push(rowData);  \r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf needed, a sample table is:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;button onClick=&quot;downloadCSV()&quot;&gt;Download CSV&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;table id=&quot;table-example&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;thead&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Position&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Office&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Start date&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Salary&lt;/th&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n        &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com&quot;&gt;Tiger Nixon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;System Architect&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;61&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;2011/04/25&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;$320,800&lt;/td&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy goal was to implement an if-else where I would add the value of the `href` to the array is the table cell had one, or add the html text if not. However, the `link` variable is always undefined, even while iterating on a column that I know has an `&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;`.\r\n\r\n**Edit**:\r\n\r\nFollowing Taplar&#39;s suggestion that using `$(this)` in the for-loop was misguided, I came up with the following solution:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\t\t\tfor (var j = 0, col; col = row.cells[j]; j++) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Checking for href and extracing link\r\n\t\t\t\tvar links = col.getElementsByTagName(&#39;a&#39;);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tif (links.length &gt; 0) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar cellData = links[0].getAttribute(&#39;href&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar cellData = col.textContent;\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\trowData.push(cellData);\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440933/how-to-extract-hyperlinks-from-table-cells-in-row-column-loop","title":"How to extract hyperlinks from table cells in row/column loop"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","linux","boost"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":2090132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":27,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a225e00c91cc8bacd424e86d29cb5bdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jkallus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2090132/jkallus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571450770,"post_id":58440929,"comment_id":103256454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440929/how-to-install-pyrf24-python-library-for-python-3#comment103256454_58440929"}],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":2090132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":27,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a225e00c91cc8bacd424e86d29cb5bdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jkallus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2090132/jkallus"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571347549,"creation_date":1571347549,"question_id":58440929,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440929","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use an NRF24L01+ wireless transceiver with a Raspberry Pi. The mainstream library for this is https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/index.html and this library is in C++. Listed on that site is a python wrapper around this library https://github.com/mz-fuzzy/RF24 which is one of many but this one seems to be endorsed by the actual library maintainer. TMRh20 has instructions to install the library https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/Python.html and according to both maintainers the python library supports python 3. One of the issues with that is you need to manually link the python boost library which is acquired with \r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev\r\n```\r\nTo link it they suggest doing:\r\n```\r\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_python-py34.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_python3.so \r\n```\r\n which in my case since I have python 3.7 I substitute that in instead so libboost_python-py37.so\r\n\r\nIt builds and installs fine with \r\n```\r\npython3 setup.py build\r\nsudo python3 setup.py install\r\n```\r\nwhen I run python and try\r\n```\r\nimport RF24\r\n```\r\nI get this error\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\nImportError: /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_python27.so.1.67.0: undefined symbol: PyString_Type\r\n```\r\nIt seems like the wrapper library is being compiled against boost for python2.7 which shouldn&#39;t be happening since in the setup.py I&#39;ve changed it to be\r\n```\r\nmodule_RF24 = Extension(&#39;RF24&#39;,\r\n            libraries = [&#39;rf24-bcm&#39;, &#39;boost_python-py37&#39;],\r\n

You can observe this, for example, in the [source code of libstdc++](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/stl_map.h#L146):\r\n\r\n    typedef typename __gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits&lt;_Alloc&gt;::template\r\n\t   rebind&lt;value_type&gt;::other _Pair_alloc_type;\r\n\r\n    typedef _Rb_tree&lt;key_type, value_type, _Select1st&lt;value_type&gt;,\r\n\t    key_compare, _Pair_alloc_type&gt; _Rep_type;\r\n\r\nThe original allocator parameter `_Alloc` of `std::map` is _rebound_ to a map&#39;s value type and passed as a template argument to `_Rb_tree`. There, the allocator is again [rebound to the node type `_Rb_tree_node&lt;_Val&gt;`](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/stl_tree.h#L438):\r\n\r\n    typedef typename __gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits&lt;_Alloc&gt;::template\r\n\t   rebind&lt;_Rb_tree_node&lt;_Val&gt; &gt;::other _Node_allocator;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA typical usage of this mechanism is to exploit some _memory pool_-based allocator, which might considerably speed-up node allocations. However, beware that this technique is, generally, not straightforward. For instance, with `std::unordered_map`, the (rebound) allocator type is used both for allocation of nodes and allocation of the array of buckets. In the `allocate` member function, one then needs to distinguish both allocation types and use memory pooling just for allocation of nodes.\r\n\r\nWith `std::map`, there is no array of buckets, so, theoretically, the allocator should be used only for allocation of nodes. However, I am not sure whether this is guaranteed by the Standard.

That will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass LinkedList\r\n    {\r\n        public:\r\n             static LinkedList* Copy(LinkedList* c) {\r\n                  if(c == nullptr) {\r\n                       return nullptr;\r\n                  } else {\r\n                      return new LinkedList(data, Copy(prevNode));\r\n                  }\r\n             }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis static function takes any pointer and creates a copy of its value and its list.\r\n\r\nThen, inside your stack:\r\n```\r\nStack::Stack(const Stack&amp; original)\r\n    {\r\n        this-&gt;topNode = LinkedList::Copy(original.topNode);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBy doing it this way, you are actually creating new memory and not blindly copying the pointer. That&#39;s the big idea of deep copies.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re still confused on how deep copies work, I&#39;d suggest consulting your textbook or professor.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440873/i-need-to-do-a-deep-copy-am-i-using-my-copy-constructor-correctly/58441195#58441195","title":"I need to do a deep copy, am I using my copy constructor correctly?"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12235262"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13361,"user_id":428857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J477b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TonyK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/428857/tonyk"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571482217,"creation_date":1571347205,"last_edit_date":1571482217,"question_id":58440873,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440873","body_markdown":"I need to do a deep copy.

x86 platform. On a big-endian platform the bytes of the integer are reversed. In other words, the output is implementation-defined.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440858/convert-array-of-char-to-bytes-and-then-convert-bytes-to-int-and-vise-versa/58440892#58440892","title":"Convert array of char[] to bytes and then convert bytes to int and vise versa"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":367768,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571357461,"creation_date":1571357461,"answer_id":58442274,"question_id":58440858,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58442274","body_markdown":"Decimal `1163019592` is binary `01000101 01010010 01000101 01001000`, which is hex `0x45 0x52 0x45 0x48`.\r\n\r\n`&quot;HERE&quot;` is bytes `0x48 0x45 0x52 0x45`.\r\n\r\nSame bytes, different order.\r\n\r\nIf you want `&quot;HERE&quot;` to equate to `1163019592` without regard to endian, try this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    string s = &quot;HERE&quot;;\r\n    size_t n = s.length();\r\n\r\n    uint32_t number = 0;\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0;

I will show you this code: \r\n\r\n    public class Scheduler\r\n    {\r\n        private const int MSecond = 1000;\r\n        private readonly int _seconds = MSecond * 10;\r\n        private Timer _aTimer;\r\n\r\n        public void Start()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Sending is started ...&quot;);\r\n\r\n            _aTimer = new Timer();\r\n            _aTimer.Interval = _seconds;\r\n\r\n            _aTimer.Elapsed += OnTimedEvent;\r\n\r\n            _aTimer.AutoReset = true;\r\n\r\n            _aTimer.Enabled = true;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public bool IsWorking()\r\n        {\r\n            return _aTimer != null;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private async void OnTimedEvent(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            await JustDoIt();\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        private async Task JustDoIt()\r\n        {\r\n            _aTimer.Stop();\r\n            \r\n            // big and difficult work\r\n            await Task.Delay(1000 * 12);\r\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Done !!&quot;);\r\n            \r\n            _aTimer.Start();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void Stop()\r\n        {\r\n            _aTimer.Stop();\r\n            _aTimer = null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, to be sure that I have finished one job before starting new one I just cancel my timer directly after starting a job. Then, when the job is finished, I switch on my timer. This  helps my to avoid errors when several parallels job are trying to get access to resources or are writing in the database together. And my business rules directly tells me: jobs mast go one by one, not together. \r\n\r\nAll was ok but I decided to rewrite all on Scoped Hosted Background services. Here is [Microsoft documentation][1]. I will show you the result: \r\n\r\n`IScopedProcessingService`\r\n\r\n    internal interface IScopedProcessingService\r\n    {\r\n        Task DoWork(CancellationToken stoppingToken);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`ConsumeScopedServiceHostedService` \r\n\r\n    public class ConsumeScopedServiceHostedService : BackgroundService\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly ILogger&lt;ConsumeScopedServiceHostedService&gt; _logger;\r\n\r\n        public ConsumeScopedServiceHostedService(IServiceProvider services, \r\n            ILogger&lt;ConsumeScopedServiceHostedService&gt; logger)\r\n        {\r\n            Services = services;\r\n            _logger = logger;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public IServiceProvider Services { get; }\r\n\r\n        protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken) {\r\n            _logger.LogInformation(&quot;Consume Scoped Service Hosted Service is working.&quot;);\r\n\r\n            while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested) {\r\n                using (var scope = Services.CreateScope()) {\r\n                    IServiceProvider serviceProvider = scope.ServiceProvider;\r\n                    var service = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;IScopedProcessingService&gt;();    \r\n                    await service.DoWork(stoppingToken);\r\n                }\r\n                //Add a delay between executions.\r\n                await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10), stoppingToken);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        public override async Task StopAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)\r\n        {\r\n            _logger.LogInformation(\r\n                &quot;Consume Scoped Service Hosted Service is stopping.&quot;);\r\n\r\n            await Task.CompletedTask;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand `ScopedProcessingService`     \r\n\r\n    internal class ScopedProcessingService : IScopedProcessingService\r\n    {\r\n       // here is injections and constructor\r\n\r\n        public async Task DoWork(CancellationToken stoppingToken)\r\n        {\r\n          // a job with no fixed time. Sometimes it&#39;s minute, sometimes it&#39;s more, sometimes it&#39;s less           \r\n            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(40));\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd in the `Startup.cs`\r\n\r\n            services.AddHostedService&lt;ConsumeScopedServiceHostedService&gt;();\r\n            services.AddScoped&lt;IScopedProcessingService, ScopedProcessingService&gt;();\r\n\r\nSo how I can protect my application from parallels jobs? I need exactly one by one. \r\nOn the example above the next task will start after 10 seconds. But, if I right, the previous task will go on in this time! It means that I may have mess in my DB as result.  \r\n\r\n  [1]:

have just started learning C++.\r\n\r\nI am trying to create a linked list without the use of class. So, in the main function, I have head and tail pointer. After that, I am asking the user for the task to be performed. User has to enter A, if he wants to add a new student. To print the list, user has to enter P and to quit the program. I have written the following program to achieve the task:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nstruct Student {\r\n    string name;\r\n    Student* next;\r\n};\r\n\r\nvoid add_student(Student *, Student *);\r\nvoid print_list(Student *);\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{   \r\n    Student *head, *tail;\r\n    head=NULL;\r\n    tail=NULL;\r\n    \r\n    while (true) {\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\nOptions:\\n&quot;;\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;To add Student [A]\\n&quot;;\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;To print Student list [P]\\n&quot;;\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Quit Q  [Q]\\n&quot;;\r\n\r\n        string choice = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        cin &gt;&gt; choice;\r\n\r\n        if (choice.compare(&quot;A&quot;) == 0) {\r\n            add_student(head, tail);\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Book successfully added.\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (choice.compare(&quot;P&quot;) == 0) {\r\n            print_list(head);\r\n        }\r\n        else if (choice.compare(&quot;Q&quot;) == 0) {\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Bye!&quot;;\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Invalid choice.\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid add_student(Student *head, Student *tail)\r\n{\r\n    string name;\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter name of student \\n&quot;;\r\n    cin &gt;&gt; name;\r\n    \r\n    Student *temp = new Student;\r\n    temp-&gt;name = name;\r\n    temp-&gt;next = NULL;\r\n    \r\n    if(head==NULL)\r\n    {\r\n        head=temp;\r\n        tail=temp;\r\n        temp=NULL;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\t\r\n        tail-&gt;next=temp;\r\n        tail=temp;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Check student has been added successfully.\r\n    print_list(head);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid print_list(Student *head)\r\n{\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Student list is as following:\\n&quot;;\r\n    Student *temp=new Student;\r\n    temp=head;\r\n    while(temp!=NULL)\r\n    {\r\n      cout&lt;&lt; temp-&gt;name &lt;&lt;&quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n      temp = temp-&gt;next;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is every time a new student is added it is added as the first element in the list instead of adding it at the last. I think, I am doing some mistakes with Pass by reference. \r\n\r\nRequest you to please check and suggest me where am I doing the mistake. It would be of great help, because I am a begineer in C++ and I really want to learn from my mistakes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440844/how-to-pass-struct-by-reference-in-c","title":"How to pass struct by reference in

The solution I have right now works great for rewriting a subdomain with optional parameters to routing values, but I am struggling to pass sub-directory URLs to routes or querystrings. Most of the parameters I am working with are also optional so the rules have to consider any combination of those parameters or nothing. \r\n\r\nThe end goal is a feathering effect with hyphen separated locations on the subdomain side and categories on the sub-directory side.

My concern there is that a route containing the same pattern of category/subcategory might end up being sent to the root domain instead of the subdomain. \r\n\r\nDue to the aforementioned concerns I think using querystrings for the categories would be better than using routes. right now I can load a page at http://city-state.example.com/?category=categoryslug&amp;subcategory=subcategoryslug just fine. Next I would like to be able to change those querystrings to categoryslug/subcategoryslug and rewrite it to /local/{state}/{city}/?categoryslug=categoryslug&amp;subcategoryslug=subcategoryslug. I DO NOT want the url rewritten to anything like ?category=&amp;subcategory= because that would not be compatible with how the pages select data based on querystrings.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441065/iis-url-rewriting-with-routing-for-subdomains-and-optional-parameters-in-asp-net","title":"IIS URL Rewriting with Routing for Subdomains and Optional Parameters in ASP.Net 4.5 Webforms"},{"tags":["python","pandas","time-series"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12235316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IN3QD_M8rKA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rctRHuMTdITgn1ZUnGQ0rX82KwAQg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"c pam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12235316/c-pam"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571374371,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571348451,"creation_date":1571348451,"question_id":58441062,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441062","body_markdown":"I am working on the dataset regarding login/logout time, and suppose to calculate the time difference between login/logout (ie: shift duration) for each of the agent here.

Gitlab/hub is almost an order of magnitude slower over the network compared to our earlier subversion installation, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    (dev) go|c:\\srv\\lib\\examradar&gt; python -c &quot;import time;start=time.time();import os;os.system(&#39;svn up&#39;);print time.time() - start&quot;\r\n    Updating &#39;.&#39;:\r\n    At revision 31294.\r\n    0.559000015259\r\n    \r\n    (dev) go|c:\\srv\\lib\\code\\dkrepo&gt; python -c &quot;import time;start=time.time();import os;os.system(&#39;git pull&#39;);print time.time() - start&quot;\r\n    Already up to date.\r\n    Current branch master is up to date.\r\n    4.31999993324\r\n\r\nie. 150 svn repos will at least take 84 seconds, while 150 git repos will take over 10 minutes(!)\r\n(running the same commands in ubuntu on wsl on win10 gives 0.48secs and 1.52secs -- go figure ;-)\r\n\r\nWith a script we can do all &quot;easy&quot; updates in parallel and get the git-case down to ~100 seconds. Unfortunately, we&#39;re running into timeouts (very often when doing `git rev-parse @{u}`), so I&#39;m looking for the most effective way to update a git repo and be kind to the git servers.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m open to &quot;cheating&quot; e.g. if there is a way of knowing (with high probability), outside of git, that a repo doesn&#39;t need to be updated (webhooks?, background fetch-daemons?)\r\n\r\nMessing up a repo is very disruptive, so it should bail if pulling would create a merge conflict.\r\n\r\n# current code\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using the python invoke package to make calling commands easier. I&#39;ll be happy with answers that only uses raw git commands too. Here is what I have so far...\r\n\r\nFirst a convenience function that prints the command being ran, and its output, and returns the output as a string:\r\n\r\n    from invoke import task\r\n    \r\n    def runner(c):\r\n        return lambda cmd: c.run(cmd, hide=False, echo=True).stdout.strip()\r\n\r\nthen a task/function to get the repo status.

Book =\r\n        from title in Title\r\n        from chapters in Chapter.Many()\r\n        select new Book(title, chapters);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, if you want the file to be parsed without a newline at the end of the file, you also have to make the ```Whitespace``` at the end of the ```Chapter``` be optional:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static readonly TokenListParser&lt;PrjToken, string&gt; Chapter =\r\n        from chapterName in Text\r\n        from wh in Whitespace.Optional()\r\n        select chapterName;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the end we end up with (Complete parser):\r\n```\r\npublic class MyParsers\r\n{\r\n    public static readonly TokenListParser&lt;PrjToken, string&gt;

This list of tasks will simply be files loaded through the GUI (1 file per test).\r\n\r\nWhen at test is started, it should start right away. The tests could be very long and very asynchronous in that an action could take seconds or tens of minutes  (e.g. heating up a device), followed by a measurement that takes a few seconds (or minutes), followed by a long period of inaction (24 hours) before the test is repeated again.\r\n\r\nI could have up to 16 tests running at the same time, but I need the flexibility to be able to cancel any one of those tests at any time.

staleness issues are occurring because React is not aware of your dependencies on the component state.\r\n\r\nFor example, `useEffect` ensures that value of `showMoreRows` from the scope of the initial render will be called on every scroll. This copy of `showMoreRows` refers to the initial value of `pageNum`, but that value is &quot;frozen&quot; in a [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) along with the function and won&#39;t change when the component state does. Hence the scroll listening won&#39;t work as it needs to know the current state of `pageNum`.\r\n\r\nYou can resolve the issues by using [callbacks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) to &quot;hookify&quot; `showMoreRows` and `fetchData` and declare their dependence on the component state. You must then declare the dependence of `useEffect` on these callbacks and use a [clean-up function](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#cleaning-up-an-effect) to handle the effect being invoked more than once.\r\n\r\nIt would look something like this (I haven&#39;t tried running the code):\r\n\r\n\r\n    import React, { useState } from &#39;react&#39; \r\n    \r\n    function Table(props) {\r\n      const [ cities, setCities ] = useState([])\r\n      const [ pageNum, setPageNum ] = useState(0)\r\n\r\n      useEffect(()=&gt; { \r\n        // Run this only once by not declaring any dependencies\r\n        fetchData(0)\r\n      }, [])\r\n    \r\n      useEffect(()=&gt; {\r\n        // This will run whenever showMoreRows changes.\r\n\r\n        const onScroll = () =&gt; {\r\n          if (Math.ceil(table.scrollHeight - table.scrollTop) === table.clientHeight) showMoreRows()\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        document.querySelector(&quot;.TableComponent&quot;).onscroll = onScroll;\r\n\r\n        // Clean-up\r\n        return () =&gt; document.querySelector(&quot;.TableComponent&quot;).onscroll = null;\r\n      }, [showMoreRows])\r\n    \r\n      const showMoreRows = React.useCallback(async function () {\r\n        console.log(&quot;Show more rows!&quot;)\r\n        await fetchData(pageNum)\r\n      }, [fetchData, pageNum]);\r\n    \r\n      const fetchData = React.useCallback(async function (page) {\r\n        // some code, describing fetching\r\n        // EDIT2 start\r\n        console.log(pageNum)\r\n        // EDIT2 end\r\n        const jsonResponse = await {}// THE RESPONSE FROM THE FETCH\r\n        if(page) {\r\n          setCities([...cities, ...jsonResponse])\r\n          console.log(&quot;page is true&quot;, page)\r\n          setPageNum(pageNum + 1)\r\n        } else {\r\n          console.log(&quot;page is false&quot;, page) // this always runs and prints &quot;page is false 0&quot;\r\n          setCities([...cities, ...jsonResponse])\r\n          setPageNum(1)\r\n         }\r\n      }, [setCities, cities, setPageNum, pageNum]);\r\n\r\n      return &lt;div className=&quot;TableComponent&quot;&gt;

\r\n\r\nfunction Table(props) {\r\n  const [ cities, setCities ] = useState([])\r\n  const [ pageNum, setPageNum ] = useState(0)\r\n\r\n  useEffect(()=&gt; { // this sets up the listener for the infinite scroll\r\n    document.querySelector(&quot;.TableComponent&quot;).onscroll = () =&gt;

{ pageNum } \r\n           &lt;!-- The rest of the component --&gt; \r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nThe table features an &quot;infinite-scrolling&quot;-feature, so when you scroll to the bottom of the page it prints `&quot;Show more rows!&quot;` and runs `fetchData(pageNum)` to get more data. At this point, after the initial fetch, the `pageNum`-variable should be 1 or more, but for some reason the function acts as if it is 0. I put the `pageNum`-variable on display in the JSX, and I can see that it is `1`, but it still prints out `&quot;page is false 0&quot;` when ever I run it. \r\n\r\nWhen I try to google the issue, it seems the only similar thing could be that I try to read a useState-variable too soon after using setPageNum (before the redraw), but that isn&#39;t the case here as far as I can see. I give it plenty of time between tries, and it always says `pageNum` is zero. \r\n\r\nAny ideas as to what I am doing wrong, and how this makes sense in any way? \r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just tried the code I wrote over, and it seemed to work - however the full code I have doesn&#39;t work. Anyone have any ideas about problems related to this, even if the above code might work? \r\n\r\nEDIT2: I added a `console.log(pageNum)` to the `fetchData`-function, and tested a bit, and it seems that whatever I put into the initial value in `useState(VALUE)` is what is being printed. That makes **NO** sense to me. \r\nHelp.\r\n\r\nEDIT3: Added await, already had it in real code\r\n\r\nEDIT4: I&#39;ve tried at this for a while, but realized as I am using react that I could move the scroll-listener I have down to the JSX-area, and then it worked - for some reason. It now works. Can&#39;t really mark any answers as the correnct ones, but the problem is somewhat solved. \r\n\r\nThanks all who tried to help, really appreciate it.

href=&quot;https://www.example.com&gt;Cell Value 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;`), I need to write the href value (https://www.example.com in this case) and _not_ the html text (Cell Value 1 in this case)\r\n\r\nThe code below shows a function that loops over rows and then columns. I have no problems creating a CSV this way, but am struggling to implement the &quot;check&quot; for `&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;` values. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n\tfunction downloadCSV() {\r\n\t\tvar table = document.getElementById(&quot;table-example&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\t// Array of rowData arrays\r\n\t\tvar results = []; \r\n        // holds data from each table row\r\n\t\tvar rowData;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t   //iterate through rows, skipping header \r\n\t\tfor (var i = 1, row; row = table.rows[i]; i++) {\r\n\t\t\trowData = [];\r\n\r\n\t    \t//iterate through columns\r\n\t\t\tfor (var j = 0, col; col = row.cells[j]; j++) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Checking for href and extracing link\r\n\t\t\t\tlet link = $(this).find(&#39;a&#39;).attr(&#39;href&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log(link);\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\tif () {\r\n\t                 ....\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\telse {\r\n\t\t\t\t\trowData.push(col.textContent);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tresults.push(rowData);  \r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf needed, a sample table is:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;button onClick=&quot;downloadCSV()&quot;&gt;Download CSV&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;table id=&quot;table-example&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;thead&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Position&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Office&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Start date&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Salary&lt;/th&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n        &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com&quot;&gt;Tiger Nixon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;System Architect&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;61&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;2011/04/25&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;$320,800&lt;/td&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy goal was to implement an if-else where I would add the value of the `href` to the array is the table cell had one, or add the html text if not. However, the `link` variable is always undefined, even while iterating on a column that I know has an `&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;`.\r\n\r\n**Edit**:\r\n\r\nFollowing Taplar&#39;s suggestion that using `$(this)` in the for-loop was misguided, I came up with the following solution:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\t\t\tfor (var j = 0, col; col = row.cells[j]; j++) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Checking for href and extracing link\r\n\t\t\t\tvar links = col.getElementsByTagName(&#39;a&#39;);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tif (links.length &gt; 0) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar cellData = links[0].getAttribute(&#39;href&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar cellData = col.textContent;\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\trowData.push(cellData);\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440933/how-to-extract-hyperlinks-from-table-cells-in-row-column-loop","title":"How to extract hyperlinks from table cells in row/column loop"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","linux","boost"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":2090132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":27,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a225e00c91cc8bacd424e86d29cb5bdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jkallus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2090132/jkallus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571450770,"post_id":58440929,"comment_id":103256454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440929/how-to-install-pyrf24-python-library-for-python-3#comment103256454_58440929"}],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":2090132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":27,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a225e00c91cc8bacd424e86d29cb5bdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jkallus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2090132/jkallus"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571347549,"creation_date":1571347549,"question_id":58440929,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440929","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use an NRF24L01+ wireless transceiver with a Raspberry Pi. The mainstream library for this is https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/index.html and this library is in C++. Listed on that site is a python wrapper around this library https://github.com/mz-fuzzy/RF24 which is one of many but this one seems to be endorsed by the actual library maintainer. TMRh20 has instructions to install the library https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/Python.html and according to both maintainers the python library supports python 3. One of the issues with that is you need to manually link the python boost library which is acquired with \r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev\r\n```\r\nTo link it they suggest doing:\r\n```\r\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_python-py34.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_python3.so \r\n```\r\n which in my case since I have python 3.7 I substitute that in instead so libboost_python-py37.so\r\n\r\nIt builds and installs fine with \r\n```\r\npython3 setup.py build\r\nsudo python3 setup.py install\r\n```\r\nwhen I run python and try\r\n```\r\nimport RF24\r\n```\r\nI get this error\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\nImportError: /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_python27.so.1.67.0: undefined symbol: PyString_Type\r\n```\r\nIt seems like the wrapper library is being compiled against boost for python2.7 which shouldn&#39;t be happening since in the setup.py I&#39;ve changed it to be\r\n```\r\nmodule_RF24 = Extension(&#39;RF24&#39;,\r\n            libraries = [&#39;rf24-bcm&#39;, &#39;boost_python-py37&#39;],\r\n

You can observe this, for example, in the [source code of libstdc++](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/stl_map.h#L146):\r\n\r\n    typedef typename __gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits&lt;_Alloc&gt;::template\r\n\t   rebind&lt;value_type&gt;::other _Pair_alloc_type;\r\n\r\n    typedef _Rb_tree&lt;key_type, value_type, _Select1st&lt;value_type&gt;,\r\n\t    key_compare, _Pair_alloc_type&gt; _Rep_type;\r\n\r\nThe original allocator parameter `_Alloc` of `std::map` is _rebound_ to a map&#39;s value type and passed as a template argument to `_Rb_tree`. There, the allocator is again [rebound to the node type `_Rb_tree_node&lt;_Val&gt;`](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/stl_tree.h#L438):\r\n\r\n    typedef typename __gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits&lt;_Alloc&gt;::template\r\n\t   rebind&lt;_Rb_tree_node&lt;_Val&gt; &gt;::other _Node_allocator;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA typical usage of this mechanism is to exploit some _memory pool_-based allocator, which might considerably speed-up node allocations. However, beware that this technique is, generally, not straightforward. For instance, with `std::unordered_map`, the (rebound) allocator type is used both for allocation of nodes and allocation of the array of buckets. In the `allocate` member function, one then needs to distinguish both allocation types and use memory pooling just for allocation of nodes.\r\n\r\nWith `std::map`, there is no array of buckets, so, theoretically, the allocator should be used only for allocation of nodes. However, I am not sure whether this is guaranteed by the Standard.

That will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass LinkedList\r\n    {\r\n        public:\r\n             static LinkedList* Copy(LinkedList* c) {\r\n                  if(c == nullptr) {\r\n                       return nullptr;\r\n                  } else {\r\n                      return new LinkedList(data, Copy(prevNode));\r\n                  }\r\n             }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis static function takes any pointer and creates a copy of its value and its list.\r\n\r\nThen, inside your stack:\r\n```\r\nStack::Stack(const Stack&amp; original)\r\n    {\r\n        this-&gt;topNode = LinkedList::Copy(original.topNode);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBy doing it this way, you are actually creating new memory and not blindly copying the pointer. That&#39;s the big idea of deep copies.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re still confused on how deep copies work, I&#39;d suggest consulting your textbook or professor.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440873/i-need-to-do-a-deep-copy-am-i-using-my-copy-constructor-correctly/58441195#58441195","title":"I need to do a deep copy, am I using my copy constructor correctly?"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12235262"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13361,"user_id":428857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J477b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TonyK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/428857/tonyk"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571482217,"creation_date":1571347205,"last_edit_date":1571482217,"question_id":58440873,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440873","body_markdown":"I need to do a deep copy.
