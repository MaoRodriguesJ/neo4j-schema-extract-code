Does anyone know why?\r\n\r\nI tried to change my routes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\n\r\nRoute::get(&#39;/&#39;, &#39;AdminController@index&#39;);\r\n\r\nRoute::get(&#39;/{id}&#39;,[\r\n    &#39;as&#39; =&gt; &#39;adminmodul.deactivate&#39;,\r\n    &#39;uses&#39; =&gt; &#39;AdminController@deactivate&#39;\r\n]);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoute::resource(&#39;/adminmodul&#39;, &#39;AdminController&#39;);\r\n\r\nRoute::get(&#39;/{id}/edit&#39;, &#39;AdminController@edit&#39;)-&gt;name(&#39;adminmodul.edit&#39;);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is my web.php\r\n\r\ni have a AdminController.php where I have methods: index, create(dont use this), edit, update, destroy and deactivate\r\n\r\nfor example: \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic function destroy($id)\r\n    {\r\n        $user = User::find($id);\r\n        $angebot = Angebot::where(&#39;firma&#39;, $id);\r\n        $angebot-&gt;delete();\r\n        $user-&gt;delete();\r\n\r\n        return redirect(&#39;/&#39;)-&gt;with(&#39;success&#39;, &#39;Nutzer wurde erfolgreich gel&#246;scht&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    public function deactivate($id)\r\n    {\r\n        $user = User::find($id);\r\n        if ($user-&gt;verified == 1){\r\n            $user-&gt;verified = 0;\r\n            $user-&gt;save();\r\n            $angebot = Angebot::where(&#39;firma&#39;, $id);\r\n            $angebot-&gt;delete();\r\n            return redirect(&#39;/&#39;)-&gt;with(&#39;success&#39;, &#39;Nutzer wurde erfolgreich deaktiviert&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if($user-&gt;verified == 0){\r\n            $user-&gt;verified = 1;\r\n            $user-&gt;save();\r\n            return redirect(&#39;/&#39;)-&gt;with(&#39;success&#39;, &#39;Nutzer wurde erfolgreich aktiviert&#39;);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe index page is working.

And then you can replace the fragment by call the fragment transition function to replace or add fragments over it.

encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n        xmlns:app=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&quot;\r\n        xmlns:tools=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/tools&quot;\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/main_container&quot;\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        app:layout_behavior=&quot;@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior&quot;\r\n        tools:showIn=&quot;@layout/app_bar_main&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;fragment\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/nav_host_fragment&quot;\r\n            android:name=&quot;androidx.navigation.fragment.NavHostFragment&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            app:defaultNavHost=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n            app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n            app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n            app:navGraph=&quot;@navigation/mobile_navigation&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;\r\n\r\nThen go into your activity_main.xml file and add this\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;androidx.drawerlayout.widget.DrawerLayout xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n        xmlns:app=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&quot;\r\n        xmlns:tools=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/tools&quot;\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/drawer_layout&quot;\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:fitsSystemWindows=&quot;true&quot;\r\n        tools:openDrawer=&quot;start&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;include\r\n            layout=&quot;@layout/app_bar_main&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;

The WebView contains some input fields and a button to continue to the next page. I am able to enter the text in the input fields. After leaving the input field a blur event should get called that performs some additional formatting and validation. However the blur event never gets called and therefore I cannot continue to the next page.\r\n\r\nIt looks like [webKeys()][1] is just injecting some text and that [webClick()][2] simply triggers a click event. That&#39;s probably why focus never changes and the blur event never gets called. When I physically press the input field myself the event does get triggered and I also see the Android input cursor. When the test case is running I don&#39;t see the cursor when text is entered in the input fields.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to trigger the blur event programmatically or set focus to an element within

But `.COM/.NET` regitrars are now mandated to have an RDAP server also so once you know who is the registrar of any domain (and you have a link to its RDAP server in the registry RDAP server reply) you can query its own RDAP server for further details\r\n- for all gTLDs, and due to GDPR, they are under some ICANN temporary specification that basically has the consequence that no contact data will be displayed (either in whois or RDAP in fact) only typically a link or an obfuscated email to join the registrant, and like only the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n    $ wget -qO - https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/domain/google.com | jq &#39;.events[] | select(.eventAction | contains(&quot;expiration&quot;)) | .eventDate&#39;\r\n    &quot;2028-09-14T04:00:00Z&quot;\r\n    \r\n    $ wget -qO - https://rdap.markmonitor.com/rdap/domain/GOOGLE.COM | jq &#39;.entities[] | select(.roles[0] | contains(&quot;registrant&quot;)) | .vcardArray[1] | .[2][3][6]&#39;\r\n    &quot;US&quot;\r\n\r\n(Note that registrar RDAP server does not conform to current ICANN specification because last element of address should be country full name and country ISO code should be in a separate &quot;CC&quot; property).\r\n\r\nOf course a proper RDAP client or library will shield you from such details and provide easy accessors to data.\r\n\r\nPS: and even if you do not use RDAP but insist on whois, DO NOT use whois blindly towards any server, use only the authoritative sources, that is the registries.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075068/how-to-check-domain-details-in-python3/58083632#58083632","title":"How to check domain details in Python3?"}],"owner":{"reputation":279,"user_id":10662221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7df13c98e60751c6b94f4a009c7b47fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"makeshift-programmer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10662221/makeshift-programmer"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569338826,"creation_date":1569309774,"question_id":58075068,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58075068","body_markdown":"I want to check the validity of a domain name (say, google.com) and also other details like domain age, expiry date, registrant country etc. Some of these problems are solved by Who-is but their paid solution is too expensive for me to use.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any clue how this can be done in Python3?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075068/how-to-check-domain-details-in-python3","title":"How to check domain details in Python3?"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","google-cloud-platform","google-kubernetes-engine","google-cloud-composer"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":809,"user_id":10161098,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/216be1f595f55bebe8a765a448fc31b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ch_mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10161098/ch-mike"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569531918,"creation_date":1569531918,"answer_id":58124772,"question_id":58075066,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58124772","body_markdown":"There are a couple possible solutions described in [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43628993/run-exe-and-powershell-tasks-with-airflow), basically:\r\n\r\n1.

So from week 201601, every week is basically a week later, which causes problem when finding seasonality patterns.\r\n\r\nDo I have to delete week 201553 or what is the appropriate continuation?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075027/how-to-declare-a-time-series-of-weekly-data","title":"How to declare a time series of weekly data?"},{"tags":["c#","dynamics-crm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":2501476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkB3S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2501476/ryan-james"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569321146,"post_id":58075024,"comment_id":102551102,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075024/dynamics-365-on-premise-active-directory-account-iorganisationservice#comment102551102_58075024"},{"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":2501476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkB3S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2501476/ryan-james"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569322025,"post_id":58075024,"comment_id":102551597,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075024/dynamics-365-on-premise-active-directory-account-iorganisationservice#comment102551597_58075024"},{"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":2203878,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cL7vh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sudeep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2203878/sudeep"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":117,"user_id":2501476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkB3S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2501476/ryan-james"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569333182,"post_id":58075024,"comment_id":102558015,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075024/dynamics-365-on-premise-active-directory-account-iorganisationservice#comment102558015_58075024"},{"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":2501476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkB3S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2501476/ryan-james"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569791707,"post_id":58075024,"comment_id":102700829,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075024/dynamics-365-on-premise-active-directory-account-iorganisationservice#comment102700829_58075024"}],"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":2203878,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cL7vh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sudeep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2203878/sudeep"},"last_editor":{"reputation":117,"user_id":2501476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkB3S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2501476/ryan-james"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569322046,"creation_date":1569309606,"last_edit_date":1569322046,"question_id":58075024,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58075024","body_markdown":"My client is using On-Premise D365.\r\nI need to connect with it using the SDK.

              value2.1`\r\n\r\n`  value1.2                   value2.2`\r\n\r\n`. `              \r\n\r\n`.`\r\n\r\n`  value1.n                   value2.nm`\r\n\r\n`.`\r\n\r\n`.`\r\n\r\n\r\nwhilst all other content remains untouched.\r\n\r\nI already have code that can access the first sheet and find the `value1.n` i&#39;m looking for, but I&#39;m unable to proceed further.\r\n\r\nAny help on this is appreciated.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport openpyxl\r\ncount = 0\r\nfor f in files:\r\n    if f[-4:] == &quot;xlsx&quot;:\r\n        book = openpyxl.load_workbook(f)\r\n        sheet = book.active\r\n        for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True):\r\n            for data in row:\r\n                if data == &quot;value1.n&quot;:\r\n                    count = count + 1\r\n                    print(data)\r\n                    print(count)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe print statements are just for me to keep track.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using Windows 10, and coding on locally installed Jupyter Notebook that uses a Python3 notebook.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075018/change-contents-of-a-specific-cell-in-multiple-xlsx-files-in-python","title":"Change contents of a specific cell in

The output is just a binary mask for the input image. It can be used for masking the red heart shape in the **input image**, but otherwise it&#39;s just a binary image with no relation to other images. I&#39;d say it&#39;s won&#39;t do you any good for different shapes. In theory, you could use it to compute color model from the original image, but it won&#39;t get you anywhere since the model would just bring you back to your initial thresholding values (170:10 degree red, see point 2).\r\n 2. The two masks you are generating represent the color you are searching for and can be used for any image you want to find the red in range 170:10 degrees with further limits on the saturation and value. Those binary masks alone will tell you if there&#39;s any pixel in the range specified or not.\r\n 3. Now if you want to find if there&#39;s red or not in the image, you can just take the produced ```mask``` and sum the value of pixels, either with ````cv::sum``` or ```cv::countNonZero``` functions and see if the result is greater than 0.\r\n 4. For getting more parameters of the red object, you&#39;d need to do some more, but the mask you produced is a good start, but your question was about just detecting, so not sure if you want any morphology down the line\r\n\r\nTry running your code on any image with multiple colors and it will produce masks for whatever is red within the given range. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074968/use-mask-in-opencv-to-detect-color-similarity/58075777#58075777","title":"Use mask in opencv to detect color similarity"}],"owner":{"reputation":371,"user_id":4590499,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBwCU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daqs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4590499/daqs"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569312495,"creation_date":1569309394,"question_id":58074968,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58074968","body_markdown":"[![red-img][1]][1]\r\n\r\n    cv::Mat3b bgr = cv::imread(&quot;red_test.png&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    cv::Mat3b hsv;\r\n    cvtColor(bgr, hsv, cv::COLOR_BGR2HSV);\r\n    \r\n    cv::Mat1b mask1, mask2;\r\n    inRange(hsv, cv::Scalar(0, 70, 50), cv::Scalar(10, 255, 255), mask1);\r\n    inRange(hsv, cv::Scalar(170, 70, 50), cv::Scalar(180, 255, 255), mask2);\r\n    \r\n    cv::Mat1b mask = mask1 + mask2;\r\n\r\nIn order to detect the red heart in the image, the code above when applied is applied which provides with 2 masked images namely &#39;mask1&#39; and &#39;mask2&#39;.

For instance, \r\n\r\n - The total amount of sale of event A takes place before 2019-01-01 is 0, \r\n - The total amount of sale of event A takes place before 2019-03-01 is 100, and \r\n - The total amount of sale of event A takes place before 2019-04-15 is 100 + 150 + 200 = 450.\r\n\r\nBasically, it is almost the same like conditional cumulative sum but only for all previous values (excluding current value[s]). I am able to obtain the desired result using this line:\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;Sale_Total&#39;] = [df.loc[(df[&#39;Event&#39;] == df.loc[i, &#39;Event&#39;]) &amp; (df[&#39;Date&#39;] &lt; df.loc[i, &#39;Date&#39;]), \r\n                               &#39;Sale&#39;].sum() for i in range(len(df))]\r\n\r\nAlthough, it is slow but it works fine. I believe there is a better and faster way to do that. I have tried these lines:\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;Total_Previuos_Sale&#39;] = df[df[&#39;Date&#39;] &lt; df[&#39;Date&#39;]].groupby([&#39;Event&#39;])[&#39;Sale&#39;].cumsum()\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;Total_Previuos_Sale&#39;] = df.groupby([&#39;Event&#39;])[&#39;Sale&#39;].shift(1).cumsum().fillna(0)\r\n\r\nbut it produces NaNs or comes up with an unwanted result.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074962/conditional-running-sum-in-pandas-for-all-previous-values-only","title":"Conditional Running Sum in Pandas for All Previous Values Only"},{"tags":["tensorflow","keras","gpu"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":991,"user_id":5986252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cabd17a359de6510f3f774ab5975f9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jgorostegui","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5986252/jgorostegui"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569319251,"post_id":58074960,"comment_id":102550061,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074960/i-got-failed-to-get-convolution-algorithm-error-but-i-believe-my-tensorflow#comment102550061_58074960"},{"owner":{"reputation":100,"user_id":9115361,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JdKnB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Spencer Kraisler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9115361/spencer-kraisler"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":991,"user_id":5986252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cabd17a359de6510f3f774ab5975f9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jgorostegui","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5986252/jgorostegui"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569341077,"post_id":58074960,"comment_id":102562453,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074960/i-got-failed-to-get-convolution-algorithm-error-but-i-believe-my-tensorflow#comment102562453_58074960"},{"owner":{"reputation":100,"user_id":9115361,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JdKnB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Spencer Kraisler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9115361/spencer-kraisler"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":991,"user_id":5986252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cabd17a359de6510f3f774ab5975f9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jgorostegui","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5986252/jgorostegui"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569368125,"post_id":58074960,"comment_id":102571904,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074960/i-got-failed-to-get-convolution-algorithm-error-but-i-believe-my-tensorflow#comment102571904_58074960"}],"owner":{"reputation":100,"user_id":9115361,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JdKnB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Spencer Kraisler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9115361/spencer-kraisler"},"last_editor":{"reputation":100,"user_id":9115361,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JdKnB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Spencer Kraisler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9115361/spencer-kraisler"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569367956,"creation_date":1569309367,"last_edit_date":1569367956,"question_id":58074960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58074960","body_markdown":"I have a simple keras script that trains a conv net on the MNIST database.

I have dates in the form of Apr-2019, May-2019 etc., which is stored in the field name MonthYear.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the source of your problem. You shouldn&#39;t store such values in your table.  \r\nInstead, store proper dates, and convert them to whatever string representation you want to in the presentation layer.\r\n\r\nBe sure to store the dates in a column with a meaningful, descriptive name. Don&#39;t call it `Date` because it&#39;s not actually the date you care about, it&#39;s a combination of the month and a year. \r\nHowever, `MonthYear` might also not be the best choice for this column&#39;s name.   \r\n\r\nI would suggest `MonthStartDate` or something along these lines.  \r\nThis name both describe what data the column stores, and also means that the date resolution you need to deal with is month and not day.\r\n\r\nYou can, if you want to, add a computed column to the table to store the MMM-YYYY value of the date.

Java `long` variable is guaranteed to be 64 bits wide, so it is enough to contain an address, even on a 64-bit system.\r\nThe cast to `long` is just there to make the C++ type system happy.\r\nAs you see, the `SQ` macro is used to convert this address back to a proper pointer to an `sq_stsm_t` object.\r\n\r\nAs for your second question: all the macro does is get rid of some typing work.\r\nThe Java part of your program will always pass the `long`-typed `shdl` variable, so the `SQ` macro just provides easy access to the actual `sq_stsm_t` object.\r\n\r\nFinally, `new` and `delete` in C++ go together: `new` allocates memory and calls the constructor, `delete` calls the destructor and frees the memory again.\r\nNote that &quot;free&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;give back to the OS&quot;, so your process&#39;s memory usage can remain the same after this `delete` operation.\r\n\r\nAs for the comment in your code: `Java_com_project_package_JSQ_set_shdl` tries to call the Java method `boolean com.project.package.JSQ#set_JSQ_shdl(jlong)`, although it is not present in the code you pasted. I guess it is a simple setter for the `shdl` field?\r\n\r\nAs for your follow-up plans: implementing `AutoCloseable` is a good idea. You would need to create a `native void close()` method in your JSQ object which calls `delete` on the `sq_stsm_t` object stored in the `shdl` field and then replaces  the `shdl` field with `(jlong)nullptr`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074906/how-exactly-is-memory-allocation-taking-place-and-how-are-java-and-c-interacting/58075143#58075143","title":"How exactly is memory allocation taking place and how are Java and C interacting to keep track of the same object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":3837848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71ee0fa9c4daf76dc93933b30ae371fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"userAsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3837848/userash"},"last_editor":{"reputation":72,"user_id":3837848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71ee0fa9c4daf76dc93933b30ae371fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"userAsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3837848/userash"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58075143,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569310635,"creation_date":1569309162,"last_edit_date":1569310635,"question_id":58074906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58074906","body_markdown":"I have a class containing a member variable of type long and a set of native method declarations.

I will attempt to explain the scenario better with code snippets:\r\n\r\nJSQ.java\r\n```\r\nclass JSQ {\r\n    protected long shdl;\r\n    protected JSQ() { log(&quot;JSQ constructor&quot;); }\r\n    protected JSQ(String stmt, boolean isd)\r\n        throws DhSQLException\r\n    {\r\n        // calls a set of native methods\r\n        set_shdl();\r\n        setstmt(stmt, shdl);\r\n        setd(isd, shdl);\r\n        prep(shdl);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void finalize()\r\n    {\r\n        destroy(shdl);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private native void set_shdl() throws DhSQLException;\r\n    private native void setstmt(String s, long shdl) throws DhSQLException;\r\n    private native void setd(boolean b, long shdl);\r\n    private native void prep(long shdl) throws DhSQLException;\r\n    private native void destroy(long shdl);\r\n\r\n    protected void execute() throws DhSQLException\r\n    {\r\n        parExec(shdl);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected native void parExec(long shdl);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nJSQL.cxx\r\n```\r\n#define SQ ((sq_stsm_t *)(shdl))\r\n\r\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_com_project_package_JSQ_set_shdl\r\n(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj_This)\r\n{\r\n    jclass cls;\r\n    jmethodID mid;\r\n    cls = (env)-&gt;GetObjectClass (obj_This);\r\n    mid = (env)-&gt;GetMethodID (hThis,&quot;set_JSQ_shdl&quot;,&quot;(J)V&quot;);\r\n\r\n    status_t status;\r\n    // memory allocation\r\n    sq_stsm_t * S = new sq_stsm_t(status);\r\n    if(status)\r\n    {\r\n        if (S) { delete S; }\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    // I understand that we&#39;re attempting to call a Java method from a native method.\r\n    // But which method is it calling?\r\n    // Also, are we converting S from sq_stms_t type to jlong?\r\n    (env)-&gt;CallVoidMethod (obj_This,mid,(jlong) S);\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_com_project_package_JSQ_setstmt\r\n(JNIEnv *env, jobject, jstring jstmt, jlong shdl)\r\n{\r\n    status_t status;\r\n\r\n    // cstmt is obtained using jstmt\r\n\r\n    // Note: #define SQ ((sq_stsm_t *)(shdl))\r\n    status = SQ-&gt;SetStmt(cstmt);\r\n\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_com_project_package_JSQ_destroy\r\n(JNIEnv *, jobject, jlong shdl)\r\n{\r\n    delete SQ;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe points where I&#39;m confused:\r\n\r\n1. Why long and jlong and the conversion from the user defined type sq_stsm_t to long. I understand that Java is not aware of this user defined type. But why the choice of long?\r\n\r\n2. Why the #define on SQ and how exactly does destroy delete the memory allocated in set_shdl by calling delete on SQ?\r\n\r\nPost this, I have to find a replacement for finalize - for which I have concluded that AutoCloseable with try-with-resources is, by far, my best option. Since there are a lot of native calls involved, I&#39;m confused as to how I would go about it. But, that is a separate question to be addressed and I don&#39;t want to go into that here. Just mentioning to set some background on the use case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074906/how-exactly-is-memory-allocation-taking-place-and-how-are-java-and-c-interacting","title":"How exactly is memory allocation taking place and how are Java and C interacting to keep track of the same object?"},{"tags":["apache-nifi"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":416,"user_id":1224389,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f1a9cdbd8fec781cd344dfeba6311e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"YuriR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1224389/yurir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":416,"user_id":1224389,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f1a9cdbd8fec781cd344dfeba6311e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"YuriR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1224389/yurir"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569443891,"last_edit_date":1569443891,"creation_date":1569442498,"answer_id":58105963,"question_id":58074904,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58105963","body_markdown":"You can go this way:\r\n```\r\nGetFile -&gt;

Perhaps you can use [`Array.includes()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/tr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes)\r\n\r\n    this.dataSource.data.filter(data =&gt; !selectedRowIds.includes(data.userId))\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nThis is only an assumption since I don&#39;t know the content of `deleteUser` method. The method of the service seems to expect a **single** ID of a user. Therefore you either need to iterate over the selected IDs or refactor the service method to make it accept an array of IDs. But be careful, if you iterate over the array and make separate calls for each user, and if it calls an API endpoint, it can cause undesired behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n    selectedRowIds.forEach((selectedID) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n        this.UserService.deleteUser(selectedID).subscribe(res =&gt;{\r\n        //                            ^^ Here&#39;s a single ID\r\n        \r\n            this.dataSource.data = this.dataSource.data.filter(data =&gt; data.userId !== selectedID);\r\n        //                                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ filter by selectedID\r\n          }, err =&gt;{\r\n            console.error(err);  \r\n          }, ()=&gt;{\r\n            // this.clearUserForm();\r\n            this.loadUsers(this.pageIndex);\r\n          }\r\n        );\r\n    });\r\n\r\nBut I do not recommend this way. It can cause multiple calls to API (if you use any)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074899/remove-data-by-id/58074947#58074947","title":"Remove data by Id"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12022853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b0a5493bb8bf4c574691d6ec6a997e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pravu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12022853/pravu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569318367,"creation_date":1569318367,"answer_id":58077480,"question_id":58074899,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58077480","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve found the answer and it has solve my problem\r\n\r\n**Component Code**\r\n\r\n    selectedRow: any;\r\n    \r\n    removeSelectedRows(){\r\n        console.log(this.selectedRow.userId)\r\n           this.UserService.deleteUser(this.selectedRow.userId).subscribe(res =&gt;{\r\n            this.dataSource.data = this.dataSource.data.filter(data =&gt; data.userId!== this.selectedRow.userId);\r\n          }, err =&gt;{\r\n            console.error(err);  \r\n          }, ()=&gt;{\r\n            this.ngOnInit();\r\n            this.loadUsers(this.pageIndex);\r\n          });\r\n      }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074899/remove-data-by-id/58077480#58077480","title":"Remove data by Id"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12022853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b0a5493bb8bf4c574691d6ec6a997e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pravu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12022853/pravu"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1569318367,"creation_date":1569309148,"question_id":58074899,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58074899","body_markdown":"Actually, I want to delete data from list.

This was simply done by adding a view with bounds the as the status bar and applying a .5 alpha to it:\r\n\r\n    lazy var fadeStatusBar: UIView = {\r\n        let fadeStatusBar = UIView(frame: UIApplication.shared.statusBarView?.frame ?? UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame)\r\n        fadeStatusBar.backgroundColor = UIColor.black\r\n        fadeStatusBar.alpha = 0\r\n        fadeStatusBar.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\r\n        return fadeStatusBar\r\n    }()\r\n\r\nWhere `statusBarView` is an extension of UIApplication:\r\n\r\n    extension UIApplication {\r\n        var statusBarView: UIView? {\r\n            if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {\r\n                let tag = 38482458385\r\n                if let statusBar = self.keyWindow?.viewWithTag(tag) {\r\n                    return statusBar\r\n                } else {\r\n                    let statusBarView = UIView(frame: UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame)\r\n                    statusBarView.tag = tag\r\n    \r\n                    self.keyWindow?.addSubview(statusBarView)\r\n                    return statusBarView\r\n                }\r\n            } else {\r\n                if responds(to: Selector((&quot;statusBar&quot;))) {\r\n                    return value(forKey: &quot;statusBar&quot;) as?

However, this does not work anymore in iOS 13. I am merely wondering if it is at all still possible to accomplish, because I read in [another thread][1] that native iOS apps have removed this ability as well:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The status bar is rendered by a system process (out of the app\r\n&gt; process) on iOS 13 so there is no way for an app to change this.\r\n&gt; (Source: speaking to UIKit engineers at the WWDC 2019 labs.)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; You can see this in the Apple Books app, which used to dim the status\r\n&gt; bar in its dark mode on iOS 12, but this does not happen on iOS 13.\r\n\r\nMy question differs from the one referenced above, though, because the question there is to edit the alpha of the status bar itself, while I would be glad to use an overlay view instead. Any suggestion to achieve the desired result would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57083746/how-can-i-change-status-bar-alpha-in-ios-13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58074865/how-to-dim-status-bar-in-ios-13","title":"How to dim status bar in iOS 13"},{"tags":["excel"],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":11711490,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/925569058279abc86d0aba602bfc85a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"frifin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11711490/frifin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569309011,"creation_date":1569309011,"question_id":58074863,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58074863","body_markdown":"I am learning excel365 and I am not sure what exactly does edit-clear-series clear?

However, the embedded commas in the text columns cause it to crash.  SQL Server 2017 includes the option to set  `FORMAT =CSV and FIELDQUOTE = &#39;&quot;&#39;` but I am stuck with SQL Server 2008R2.  \r\n\r\nI could use DTS/SSIS but it links a VS version to a SQL version.  So if I write the SSIS in VS2012 or VS2010 it may not work with our SQL Server 2008R2.  And I don&#39;t&#39; think we have any VS2008 laying around.\r\n\r\nSo what is the next best way to import these CSV files.  \r\n\r\nBulk upload is the cleanest method to uploading half a dozen different csv files into different tables.\r\n\r\nDo I pre-process the csv files and replace commas with pipes.
