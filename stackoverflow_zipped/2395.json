If I pressed, as an example, the button 3 (the last one), the form and only the input that has `page=3` be submitted not the other inputs with `page=1`, `page=2`, `page=3` . I am using this to solve a pagination problem. How can I do this? I prefer not using `JavaScript`, or if I have to, only a very simple script be used in the solution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the number of buttons might be a lot. Actually, they are being inserted by a django template tag like:\r\n```\r\n    {% for i in page_obj.paginator.page_range %}\r\n    &lt;input name=&quot;page&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot;

0x000000000000086f &lt;+15&gt;:    ret    \r\n    End of assembler dump.\r\n\r\nIt suggests that the whole `struct test` was classified as `INTEGER` and returned in `rax`/`rdx`. But the reason for this is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the `struct test` is started with classifying each of its eightbytes `AMD64 ABI/3.2.3`.\r\n\r\n&gt; If the size of the aggregate exceeds a single eightbyte, each is\r\n&gt; classified separately. Each eightbyte gets initialized to class\r\n&gt; `NO_CLASS`.\r\n\r\nEach of the eightbyte is classified to have the `INTEGER` class `AMD64 ABI/3.2.3`:\r\n\r\n&gt; 4.Each field of an object is classified recursively so that always two\r\n&gt; fields are considered. The resulting class is calculated according\r\n&gt; to the classes of the fields in the eightbyte: \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; [...] \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; (d) If one of the classes is INTEGER, the result is the INTEGER. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [...]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n***QUESTION:*** What rule is used to classify the whole such structure?\r\n\r\nI did not find a suitable one in here `AMD64 ABI/3.2.3`:\r\n\r\n&gt; 5.Then a post merger cleanup is done: \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; (a) If one of the classes is MEMORY, the whole argument is passed in memory. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; (b) If X87UP is not\r\n&gt; preceded by X87, the whole argument is passed in memory. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; (c) If the\r\n&gt; size of the aggregate exceeds two eightbytes and the first eight- byte\r\n&gt; isn’t SSE or any other eightbyte isn’t SSEUP, the whole argument is\r\n&gt; passed in memory. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; (d) If SSEUP is not preceded by SSE or SSEUP, it is\r\n&gt; converted to SSE.\r\n\r\nNeither eightbyte of the struct is `MEMORY` nor `SSE` nor `X87` nor the whole struct exceeds two eightbytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967673/classify-struct-consisting-of-3-unsigned-int-according-to-sysv-abi","title":"Classify struct consisting of 3 `unsigned int` according to SysV ABI"},{"tags":["statistics","outliers"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1520,"user_id":10232932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec8ac182af86808de7f193677348c87d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PV8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10232932/pv8"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568716267,"post_id":57967672,"comment_id":102354620,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967672/finding-outliers-in-uniformly-distributed-data#comment102354620_57967672"},{"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568736059,"post_id":57967672,"comment_id":102365652,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967672/finding-outliers-in-uniformly-distributed-data#comment102365652_57967672"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1520,"user_id":10232932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec8ac182af86808de7f193677348c87d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PV8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10232932/pv8"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568716415,"creation_date":1568716415,"answer_id":57972423,"question_id":57967672,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57972423","body_markdown":"You probably need to seperate your dataframe into category A and B.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndfA = df.loc[df[&#39;Category&#39;] == &#39;A&#39;]\r\ndfB = df.loc[df[&#39;Category&#39;] == &#39;B&#39;]\r\ndfAquantile = dfA[&#39;Price&#39;].quantile(0.25)\r\n...\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967672/finding-outliers-in-uniformly-distributed-data/57972423#57972423","title":"Finding outliers in uniformly distributed data"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":12077434,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad74baa5521bb1bf3ba54ce8db69ab42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mr Pandey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12077434/mr-pandey"},"last_editor":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568736006,"creation_date":1568696944,"last_edit_date":1568736006,"question_id":57967672,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967672","body_markdown":"My dataset has 2 columns Category and Price.

grammar under Linux.\r\n* I want to know the history and usage platform of `for each`.\r\n* I want to know more about how I should understand this, instead of asking questions like now.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967654/what-is-the-difference-between-for-each-and-for-each","title":"What is the difference between for each and

exact error you are getting when calling `Integer.parseInt` might be happening because you never stripped off the parentheses from the string number before attempting to parse it.\r\n\r\nAssuming each input line would consist of one or more tuples looking like `(A, B)`, I would suggest the following:\r\n\r\n    Scanner inputFile = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;File to read from&quot;);\r\n    File file = new File (inputFile.nextLine());\r\n    inputFile = new Scanner(file);\r\n    ArrayList&lt;ponySort&gt; nameAge = new ArrayList&lt;ponySort&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    while (inputFile.hasNextLine()) {\r\n        String currentLine = inputFile.nextLine();\r\n        String[] parts = currentLine.split(&quot;(?&lt;=\\\\)) (?=\\\\()&quot;);\r\n        for (String part : parts) {\r\n            String input = part.replaceAll(&quot;[()]&quot;, &quot;&quot;);\r\n            int age = Integer.parseInt(input.split(&quot;, &quot;)[0]);\r\n            String name = input.split(&quot;, &quot;)[1];\r\n            nameAge.add(new ponySort(name, age));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe splitting logic I used takes a single line of one or more tuples, and splits on the space precisely located in between tuples (ignoring other spaces).  Then, we can remove the surrounding parentheses and use the same string splitting logic you were already using.\r\n\r\nNote: Java naming convention says that classes should begin with an _uppercase_ letter, so the name `PonySort` should be used instead of `ponySort`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967650/trying-reading-a-file-of-ints-and-strings-and-getting-errors/57967698#57967698","title":"Trying Reading a file of ints and strings and getting errors"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8252,"user_id":3461397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71b7ecb9151708614e90369748b1bcd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"oleg.cherednik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3461397/oleg-cherednik"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568704329,"creation_date":1568704329,"answer_id":57969096,"question_id":57967650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57969096","body_markdown":"I think you can just use custom delimeter for `Scanner` and read pair of `int` and `String`:\r\n\r\n     final class PonySort {\r\n    \r\n        public static final Comparator&lt;PonySort&gt; SORT_AGE_ASC = Comparator.comparingInt(PonySort::getAge).thenComparing(PonySort::getName);\r\n    \r\n        private final String name;\r\n        private final int age;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public static Set&lt;PonySort&gt; readFile(File file) throws FileNotFoundException {\r\n        try (Scanner scan = new Scanner(file)) {\r\n            scan.useDelimiter(&quot;(\\\\)\\\\s+\\\\()|(,\\\\s)|\\\\(|\\\\)&quot;);\r\n    \r\n            Set&lt;PonySort&gt; nameAge = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(PonySort.SORT_AGE_ASC);\r\n    \r\n            while (scan.hasNext()) {\r\n                int age = scan.nextInt();\r\n                String name = scan.next();\r\n                nameAge.add(new PonySort(name, age));\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            return nameAge;\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967650/trying-reading-a-file-of-ints-and-strings-and-getting-errors/57969096#57969096","title":"Trying Reading a file of ints and strings and getting errors"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10787625,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a65d14c147d6207c353bc15982dd9c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10787625/max"},"last_editor":{"reputation":673,"user_id":6903132,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c97171b837f5fbc70799f6d952ff581?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mahavir Jain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6903132/mahavir-jain"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568849942,"creation_date":1568696735,"last_edit_date":1568708025,"question_id":57967650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967650","body_markdown":"I am Writing a program that will read a file of names and ages and then will sort them in ascending order.

it. It&#39;s due to the fact that the offending class hierarchy removed their copy constructors and `operator =`.\r\n\r\nThe modified example can reproduce the errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &quot;pch.h&quot;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;algorithm&gt;\r\n#include &lt;cstdio&gt;\r\n#include &lt;map&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\npublic:\r\n\tFoo() { mi = 1; }\r\n\t~Foo() {}\r\n\r\n\t// NO COPIES.\t\r\n\tFoo(const Foo &amp;) = delete;\r\n\tFoo&amp; operator = (const Foo &amp;) = delete;\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n\tint mi;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass MyFoo : public Foo {\r\npublic:\r\n\tMyFoo() :Foo() {\r\n\t\tmj = 2;\r\n\t\tmk = nullptr;\r\n\t}\r\n\t~MyFoo() {}\r\n\r\n\t// NO COPIES.\r\n\tMyFoo(const MyFoo &amp;) = delete;\r\n\tMyFoo&amp; operator = (const MyFoo &amp;) = delete;\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n\tint mj;\r\n\tint* mk;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass YourFoo : public Foo {\r\npublic:\r\n\tYourFoo() :Foo() { mj = 2; }\r\n\t~YourFoo() {}\r\n\r\n\t// NO COPIES.\r\n\tYourFoo(const YourFoo &amp;) = delete;\r\n\tYourFoo&amp; operator = (const YourFoo &amp;) = delete;\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n\tint mj;\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tstd::map&lt;int, Foo&gt; yourmap;\r\n\tyourmap.insert(std::make_pair(3, Foo()));\r\n\tyourmap.insert({ 4, Foo() });\r\n\tyourmap.insert(std::pair&lt;int, Foo&gt;(5, Foo()));\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I guess the problem is that `std::map` must copy elements into its memory space. Then it just bumps into classes without copy constructors and complains. But the error messages are so misleading that I just can&#39;t figure out. The actual class hierarchy is pretty huge, so I didn&#39;t see those deleted parts. Guess someone does not want these things duplicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anybody can instruct how to decipher the compiler error messages near the beginning of my question so that I may get a better idea where to look, it would be greatly appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967624/compiler-error-c2664-using-stdmap-and-custom-class-as-its-value","title":"Compiler error C2664 using std::map and custom class as its value"},{"tags":["synchronization","activemq","cluster-computing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1985,"user_id":5939079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54d6ff8fc2f032cf9d4e34de6eb60940?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cokceken","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5939079/cokceken"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568701826,"post_id":57967618,"comment_id":102347305,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967618/activemq-5-multi-datacenter-cluster-sync#comment102347305_57967618"},{"owner":{"reputation":6746,"user_id":8381946,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ORs8fPNVzDU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADBs/F3IsdsProVY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Justin Bertram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8381946/justin-bertram"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568726499,"post_id":57967618,"comment_id":102360016,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967618/activemq-5-multi-datacenter-cluster-sync#comment102360016_57967618"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12077419,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Me8HSCU9xn0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfusvjHgmPhLmDmxB7BdXVPo_HYVg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user12077419","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12077419/user12077419"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568739936,"post_id":57967618,"comment_id":102367341,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967618/activemq-5-multi-datacenter-cluster-sync#comment102367341_57967618"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12077419,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Me8HSCU9xn0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfusvjHgmPhLmDmxB7BdXVPo_HYVg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user12077419","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12077419/user12077419"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568696531,"creation_date":1568696531,"question_id":57967618,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967618","body_markdown":"We have the following configuration.\r\n\r\n3 brokers in Datacenter A in a master/slave configuration using a shared file system.\r\n3 brokers in Datacenter B in a master/slave configuration using a shared file system.\r\n\r\nThere are producers sending messages to topics at Datacenter A.

SSL terminates\r\n   and send a decrypted request to the target.\r\n - Target group will receive http traffic.\r\n\r\nUpdate apache config to listen of port `80` and do restart.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\r\nServerAdmin feedback@touchbasic.app\r\nDocumentRoot &quot;/var/www/html/touchbasicdotapp&quot;\r\nServerName touchbasic.app\r\nErrorLog &quot;logs/touchbasic.app-error_log&quot;\r\nCustomLog &quot;logs/touchbasic.app-access_log&quot; common\r\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967607/how-to-transfer-hosting-of-a-https-website-to-ec2/57986659#57986659","title":"How to transfer hosting of a HTTPS website to EC2?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1266,"user_id":938562,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/30512612/picture?type=large","display_name":"Curtis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/938562/curtis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1266,"user_id":938562,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/30512612/picture?type=large","display_name":"Curtis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/938562/curtis"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57986659,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568789494,"creation_date":1568696424,"last_edit_date":1568706089,"question_id":57967607,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967607","body_markdown":"I have a domain on Godaddy https://touchbasic.app\r\nIt was hosted on HostGator where everything worked and was easy to set up.\r\nI can&#39;t figure out how to make my EC2 server host it so I can get rid of HostGator.\r\nI get ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT in when I go to my domain in my browser.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m hosting non-https domains just fine on my EC2 server.

What you should do is to define a data access interface, \r\n\r\n    type CRUD interface {\r\n      Create(yourModel) error\r\n      Read(page, size, skip) []yourModel\r\n      Update(yourModel) error\r\n      Delete(yourModel) error\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand implement it.\r\n\r\nYou then mock the interface, for example with [testify/mock](https://github.com/stretchr/testify#mock-package):\r\n\r\n    type MockedCRUD struct {\r\n      mock.Mock\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func(m *MockedCRUD)Create(y yourModel) error{\r\n      returned m.Called(y).Error(0)\r\n    }\r\n    // And so on and so forth\r\n\r\nSince `MockedCRUD` satisfies the CRUD interface, you can use it as you would use your `MongoCRUD` implementation, without any hassle:\r\n\r\n    func TestYourApplicationLogicCallingCreate( t *testing.T){\r\n        model := YourModel{Type: ”Baz”})\r\n\r\n        mocked := new(MockedCRUD)\r\n        mocked.On(”Create”,model).Return(ErrInvalidType)\r\n\r\n        app := YourApplication{CRUD:mocked}\r\n\r\n        err := app.yourApplicationLogicCallingCreate(model)\r\n\r\n        assert.Error(t,err)\r\n        assert.Equal(t,ErrInvalidType,err)\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nRemains the question how do you test the implementation of the CRUD interface. I used to use the mgo driver, originally developed by Gustavo Niemeyer and taken over by globalsign. That brought a nifty little package called [dbtest][dbtest]. It is actually a very thin wrapper around a MongoDB instance, starting and stopping one on demand, with the ability to reset the data in between tests.

handler?(selected) //here....\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        //rest of the code....\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext, in your `ViewController`, set the value of `handler` for `CheckableTableViewCell` instance in `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)` method, i.e.\r\n\r\n     class VC: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource {\r\n        //rest of the code...\r\n        \r\n        func tableView(_

The first time App renders, you render a Slider version 1.0. The second time, you render a Slider version 2.0. They may have very similar code, but they&#39;re different components and so react unmounts the old component and mounts the new one. Thus, the old input is removed from the dom and a new one is put in its place, and you&#39;re no longer dragging anything.\r\n\r\nHooks are not good for dynamically creating components. You could improve this somewhat by memoizing the slider component, but as soon as you have to break the memoization for any reason, a brand new component will have to be defined and this issue or ones like it will reappear.\r\n\r\nInstead, i would recommend that useSlider return the props, and then have the caller put them onto a standard `input` component.

In the view for create I have a `datepicker` for selecting just the date then I have starting_hour and starting_minute and finally I have finish_hour and `finish_minute` and for joining it for the correct format of `DateTime` I did this:\r\n```\r\n$appointment-&gt;start_time = &quot;&quot;.$request-&gt;date_request.&quot; &quot;.$request-&gt;starting_hour .&quot;:&quot;.$request-&gt;starting_minute.&quot;:&quot;;\r\n$appointment-&gt;finish_time = &quot;&quot;.$request-&gt;date_request.&quot; &quot;.$request-&gt;finish_hour .&quot;:&quot;.$request-&gt;finish_minute.&quot;:&quot;;\r\n```\r\nSo it saves like this `start_time: 2019-09-16 08:00:00` and `finish_time: 2019-09-16 08:00:00`. The problem I have is on the validation because it is for appointments so finish_hour can not be before start_hour. The date won&#180;t change because it is for appointments for one hour so i will use the same day but when trying to validate the hour I have problems. I have tried **with**:\r\n```\r\n&#39;starting_hour&#39;    =&gt;  &#39;required&#39;,\r\n&#39;starting_minute&#39;   =&gt;  &#39;required&#39;,\r\n&#39;finish_hour&#39;   =&gt;  &#39;required|after:starting_hour&#39;,\r\n&#39;finish_minute&#39;    =&gt;  &#39;required&#39;,\r\n```\r\nBut when trying to save I **get**:\r\n```\r\nThe finish hour must be a date after starting hour.\r\n```\r\nI am guessing this is because `Laravel` validation thinks also the date must be after the starting date but I only want the hour to be after the `starting_hour`.

guess the `.ReadyState` or `.Busy` properties remain unchanged when clicking button. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re not actually waiting to complete this action which is why it&#39;s missing some files (other than first one). Been there, done that.\r\n\r\nYou need to find a way to wait until you can download next file. I see 2 options (other than hardcoded delay):\r\n\r\n 1. if website tells you the file is downloading, loop while specific element updates, eg maybe there&#39;s a loading icon, or &#39;downloading&#39; text displayed, anything? If you&#39;re not sure, get &quot;body&quot; innerText before and after click and compare\r\n 2. count files in your download folder before click, and wait until count is greater after click - yeah it&#39;s not ideal, but it&#39;s an option\r\n\r\nAlso, just to point out:\r\n\r\n - I&#39;m not sure what the `Do While iecount &lt;&gt; xx` does, but I would get rid of that as it might be very inaccurate \r\n - rather than keep copying the `While ie.ReadyState &lt;&gt; 4 Or ie.Busy: DoEvents: Wend`, make it a function, it&#39;ll make your life easier and code tidier - you could add optional argument, a string that must be present in body&#39;s innerText (as mentioned above)\r\n - you&#39;re setting IE to nothing, but browser remains open, unless it&#39;s desired you can add `IE.quit` first","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967537/macro-downloading-files-from-ie-is-missing-or-stepping-over/57971033#57971033","title":"macro downloading files from IE is missing or stepping over"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11803714,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cCz2Uj4DoyE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAaKU/Aj_nyp69THE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Husnain Iqbal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11803714/husnain-iqbal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32752,"user_id":3219613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b01a7cc73ab19f844bdbcd951876ecb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pᴇʜ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3219613/p%e1%b4%87%ca%9c"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568711567,"creation_date":1568695926,"last_edit_date":1568700291,"question_id":57967537,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967537","body_markdown":"I am using the below code to download files from a website.

While Cassandra can be made to run\r\n&gt; on small servers for testing or development environments (including\r\n&gt; Raspberry Pis), a minimal production server requires at least 2 cores,\r\n&gt; and at least 8GB of RAM. Typical production servers have 8 or more\r\n&gt; cores and at least 32GB of RAM.\r\n\r\n**CPU**\r\n\r\n&gt; Cassandra is highly concurrent, handling many simultaneous requests\r\n&gt; (both read and write) using multiple threads running on as many CPU\r\n&gt; cores as possible. The Cassandra write path tends to be heavily\r\n&gt; optimized (writing to the commitlog and then inserting the data into\r\n&gt; the memtable), so writes, in particular, tend to be CPU bound.\r\n&gt; Consequently, adding additional CPU cores often increases throughput\r\n&gt; of both reads and writes.\r\n\r\n**Memory**\r\n\r\n&gt; Cassandra runs within a Java VM, which will pre-allocate a fixed size\r\n&gt; heap (java’s Xmx system parameter). In addition to the heap, Cassandra\r\n&gt; will use significant amounts of RAM offheap for compression metadata,\r\n&gt; bloom filters, row, key, and counter caches, and an in process page\r\n&gt; cache. Finally, Cassandra will take advantage of the operating\r\n&gt; system’s page cache, storing recently accessed portions files in RAM\r\n&gt; for rapid re-use.\r\n\r\n**The Cassandra heap should be no less than 2GB, and no more than 50% of your system RAM**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\r\n  [2]: http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/operating/hardware.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967519/cant-launch-cassandra-on-a-t2-microfree-tier-instance-connection-error/57967647#57967647","title":"Can&#39;t launch Cassandra on a t2.micro(free tier) instance - connection error"}],"owner":{"reputation":131,"user_id":11628353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa33f683310190766c07a3e328645046?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"WHOATEMYNOODLES","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11628353/whoatemynoodles"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57967647,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568696720,"creation_date":1568695772,"question_id":57967519,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967519","body_markdown":"Is it not possible to launch Cassandra on a t2.micro (free tier)?

sessions).\r\n\r\nThe **stderr messages that external programs output show up in PowerShell&#39;s error stream, but they do not cause an _exception_**, so your code runs and _fails quietly_.  \r\n(Similarly, an external program reporting a *nonzero exit code* does _not_ cause PowerShell to take any action.)\r\n\r\nTo see what went wrong, **you must inspect `psExec.Streams.Error`**, i.e. the error messages collected during the call.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn a comment you state that on examining the error stream you found that the error message there complained about `quser` not being found as a command (`The term &#39;quser&#39; is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. ...`).\r\n\r\nThis suggests one of two possible causes (it turned out to be (a)):\r\n\r\n* Either (a): Your System32 folder (typically, `C:\\Windows\\System32`) is inexplicably not listed in your `Path` environment variable (`$env:Path`), which would be highly unusual, though, and is worth investigating further.\r\n\r\n  * As a workaround in the meantime: while you could try to reference `quser.exe` and `logoff.exe` by their full paths, it gives you more flexibility to add the System32 folder to the `$env:PATH` as the first command.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstring logOff = &quot;$env:PATH += \\&quot;;$env:windir\\\\System32\\&quot;; quser.exe | Select-String \\&quot;Disc\\&quot; | ForEach{logoff.exe ($_.toString() -split &#39; +&#39;)[2]}&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n* Or (b): Your C# code uses the _32-bit_ version of the PowerShell SDK, and in the distinct directory that 32-bit applications see as `C:\\Windows\\System32` (which in reality is `C:\\Windows\\SysWow64`), neither `quser.exe` nor `logoff.exe` exist.\r\n\r\n  * You can try to call the _64-bit_ versions, by explicitly referencing them via virtual directory `C:\\Windows\\SysNative`&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; (which is visible only to 32-bit applications):\r\n\r\n```\r\nstring logOff = &quot;C:\\\\Windows\\\\SysNative\\\\quser.exe | Select-String \\&quot;Disc\\&quot; | ForEach{C:\\\\Windows\\\\SysNative\\\\logoff.exe ($_.toString() -split &#39; +&#39;)[2]}&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;[1] Note: I&#39;m assuming that the root of your Windows installation is `C:\\Windows`; a way to refer to it reliably even if it is located in a differently named directory is to use `$env:windir` instead of literal `C:\\Windows`.&lt;/sup&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967485/not-able-to-run-power-shell-script-in-net-console-app-using-system-automation-ma/57967845#57967845","title":"Not able to run power shell script in.Net console app using System.automation.management(Power shell package)"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":9844613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jps9x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vijay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9844613/vijay"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57967845,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568707222,"creation_date":1568695475,"question_id":57967485,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967485","body_markdown":"Hi I am creating an software where it should loggOff all except currently logged in user in Windows 10 system.\r\nI am able loggoff using a powershell command in powershell. find command below:\r\n```\r\nquser | Select-String &quot;Disc&quot;

$2.\r\n      $2=$3    ##Setting $3 value to $2 here.\r\n      $3=tmp   ##Setting variable tmp value to $3 here.\r\n      $4=&quot;-&quot;   ##Setting $4 as - as per requirement.\r\n    }          ##Closing condition BLOCK here.\r\n    1          ##Mentioning 1  will print edited/non-edited lines, awk works on method of pattern and action, by mentioning 1 I am making pattern/condition as true and no action is mentioned so default print of line will happen.\r\n    &#39; Input_file ##Mentioning Input_file name here.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967482/awk-swap-column-and-replace-another-column-conditionally/57967528#57967528","title":"Awk swap column and replace another column
