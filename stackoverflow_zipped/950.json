When passing a shared reference as parameter to a function, Rust will simply copy the reference. The type `&amp;T` is `Copy` for all `T`, since we are allowed to have any number of shared references at the same time.\r\n\r\nMutable references, on the other hand, are not `Copy`, since there can be only one of them at any given time. According to the usual Rust semantics for non-`Copy` types, this means that mutable references should be moved when passed as a parameter. So why does this code work?\r\n\r\n    fn foo(_: &amp;mut i32) {}\r\n    \r\n    fn main() {\r\n        let mut i = 42;\r\n        let r = &amp;mut i;\r\n        foo(r);\r\n        foo(r);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the compiler creates an _implicit reborrow_ whenever it assigns to a variable that is explicitly declared as a mutable reference, so the function calls are translated to `foo(&amp;mut *r)`. This creates a new borrow that only lasts for the duration of the function call, and the original reference `r` becomes available again once the lifetime of the reborrow ends.\r\n\r\nHowever, implicit reborrows are only generated for variables that are explicitly declared with a mutable reference type. If we change the definition of `foo()` above to\r\n\r\n    fn foo&lt;T&gt;(_: T) {}\r\n\r\nthe code will stop compiling. Now the parameter of `foo()` is not declared as a mutable reference anymore, so the compiler will not introduce an implicit reborrow, and will move ownership of `r` into the function in the first call instead, resulting in an error in the second function call.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens in your code. The function `to_writer()` is declared as\r\n\r\n    pub fn to_writer&lt;W, T: ?Sized&gt;(writer: W, value: &amp;T) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;\r\n    where\r\n        W: io::Write,\r\n        T: Serialize,\r\n\r\nSince the argument `writer` is not declared as a mutable reference, you need to create an explicit reborrow to avoid a move:\r\n\r\n    serde_json::to_writer(&amp;mut *out, &amp;1)?;\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution you gave in your question works as well – the `write_wrapper()` function receives an explicitly declared mutable reference as argument, so calls to this function trigger implicit reborrows.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316486/how-to-call-serde-jsonto-writer-twice-with-the-same-mutable-borrow/58336587#58336587","title":"How to call serde_json::to_writer twice with the same mutable borrow?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3483,"user_id":163832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef473f09095e5132ecaf3c25655cafa4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kannan Goundan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/163832/kannan-goundan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3483,"user_id":163832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef473f09095e5132ecaf3c25655cafa4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kannan Goundan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/163832/kannan-goundan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58336587,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570905070,"creation_date":1570687953,"last_edit_date":1570688500,"question_id":58316486,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58316486","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to write a function that calls [`serde_json::to_writer`](https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/ser/fn.to_writer.html) twice to write two things, but I can&#39;t figure out how.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s one attempt ([playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=ba84dbb8bf57466b92ec432894e86e44)):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nextern crate serde_json;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut out = std::fs::File::create(&quot;out.txt&quot;).unwrap();\r\n    write_stuff(&amp;mut out);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn write_stuff&lt;W: ?Sized&gt;(out: &amp;mut W) -&gt;

I would question why you need to use an ordered hash.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316482/how-to-sort-a-hash-with-a-value-inside-it/58316710#58316710","title":"How to sort a hash with a value inside it"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11925680,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Sp0aYNbL_l8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reRNRvKcGdwsyIMFX_X2EMIf5OcDg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nirmal Bhakat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11925680/nirmal-bhakat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4648,"user_id":10522579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7GQ6a.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ray","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10522579/ray"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58316710,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570693094,"creation_date":1570687934,"last_edit_date":1570693094,"question_id":58316482,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58316482","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve a hash \r\n\r\n    H = { abc: [1,1,2], def: [0,1,1], efg: [3,4,7] }\r\n\r\nHow to sort descending these with the last index of the array i.e., I need the hash to be like this `H = { efg: [3,4,7], abc: [1,1,2], def: [0,1,1]}`\r\n\r\n    H.values[2].sort\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316482/how-to-sort-a-hash-with-a-value-inside-it","title":"How to sort a hash with a value inside it"},{"tags":["python","list","queue"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":83498,"user_id":3001761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/feZwC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jonrsharpe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3001761/jonrsharpe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570688168,"post_id":58316481,"comment_id":102993081,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316481/update-the-python-list-with-new-values-after-exhausting-the-predefined-length-of#comment102993081_58316481"}],"owner":{"reputation":333,"user_id":8721742,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c5491d7078fca5c5a50713f0a6842cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Naren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8721742/naren"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570688161,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570687931,"creation_date":1570687931,"question_id":58316481,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58316481","body_markdown":"How to append values to list, but with maximum length of list being 10.\r\n\r\nIf I add new values to the list after exhausting the full limit of list, first value should get popped and latest value should get pushed.

Specifically, callbacks that mimic the functionaility of _onStartTrackingTouch()_ and _onStopTrackingTouch()_ are missing, although a progress change listener is supported. \r\n\r\nYou can, however, add this missing functionality by extending the _VerticalSeekBar_ as follows:\r\n\r\n\tclass MyVerticalSeekBar(context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet) : VerticalSeekBar(context, attrs) {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate var mChangeListener: OnVerticalSeekBarChangeListener? = null\r\n\r\n\t\tfun setOnVerticalSeekBarChangeListener(listener: OnVerticalSeekBarChangeListener?) {\r\n\t\t\tmChangeListener = listener\r\n\t\t\t// We will use the progress listener as defined in VerticalSeekBar.\r\n\t\t\tif (listener == null) {\r\n\t\t\t\tsuper.setOnProgressChangeListener(null)\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\tsuper.setOnProgressChangeListener { newProgress -&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlistener.onProgressChanged(this, newProgress, true)\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// Spy on touch events targeting the vertical seek bar to handle\r\n\t\t// onStartTrackingTouch() and onStopTrackingTouch()\r\n\t\toverride fun onInterceptTouchEvent(ev: MotionEvent): Boolean {\r\n\t\t\tif (mChangeListener != null) {\r\n\t\t\t\twhen (ev.actionMasked) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN -&gt; mChangeListener?.onStartTrackingTouch(this)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMotionEvent.ACTION_UP,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL -&gt;

Of course, when I exclude them and use original Tilen code I get the same result. \r\n\r\nAs you see, I tried arm_cfft_f32(…) and arm_cmplx_mag_f32(…) functions. I also tried arm_rfft_fast_f32(…) function for my purposes and got the same result.\r\n\r\nMy problem is magnitude calculation accuracy. My task expects to get accurate level calculations of predetermined harmonics. I measure clear sinusoidal AC signal with DC offset on the ADC input with voltmeter. Then I measure the signal frequency with FFT lib and get the signal level degradation with the frequency increase. I take into account restrictions regarding the maximum measured frequency for the given sampling rate and that fact, I can&#39;t use more than 4096 samples with CMSIS DSP FFT.\r\nI also need small frequency step, e.g., 1 Hz for the range between 100 and 1000 Hz. \r\n\r\nIn the picture given I show you the results. By the way, the frequency is measured with some error. 100 Hz is defined as 101Hz, 800 Hz – as 808Hz. But this doesn&#39;t confuse me much. \r\n\r\n[Blue line is measured with AC voltmeter. Red line is my measurements with FFT library. Sampling rate 4096 Hz, number of samples – 4096][1]\r\n\r\nThe same picture is attained for other frequency ranges and sampling rates.\r\n\r\nNow I see the only head-on decision is to mathematically adjust my results to real measured values. But this is not an elegant solution. It&#39;s highly likely that I neglect some important features of DSP FFT analysis and lack understanding of the math algorithm.\r\nOther FFT realizations are not so clear to me. And does it really make sense to use other libs, for example, kissFFT and so on? Who has proven experience with other libs and would be kind to share it with me? Any piece of advice is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTOuC.jpg\r\n  [2]:

allow the user to choose a base directory.

hashing, so we can re-hash and get the same value each time - which is a downside actually.\r\n\r\nIn case of __Argon2__ hashing we can&#39;t go this way, since the salt is random per entry and prepended to the hash (along with the rest of the params), so we must bring the data from the DB and only then verify the candidate for pass.\r\n\r\n__Questions:__\r\n\r\n* am I right in the understanding of Argon2 hashed passwords handling or have missed something?\r\n* should this kind of password handling pattern change be considered as negatively impacting the security of an app?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316378/password-storage-patterns-and-argon2","title":"password storage patterns and

This type can only be later resolved, when you call the inner function with the actual `obj: TObj` in a currying manner. That is  probably also the reason, why are using so many `any` types - and omitting `any` is always a good idea in order to enforce stronger typings.\r\n\r\nInstead the basic idea could be that we base `makeTransform` function typings completely on the `transformer` callback. `TObj` is now a type parameter of the inner function and has to meet the type constraints of the outer `transformer`. In addition we get rid of all `any` types and unnecessary type assertions.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction makeTransform&lt;\r\n  T extends Record&lt;string, (arg: any) =&gt; any&gt;\r\n&gt;(transformer: T) {\r\n  return &lt;TObj extends { [P in keyof T]: Parameters&lt;T[P]&gt;[0] }&gt;(obj: TObj) =&gt; {\r\n    const objClone: Omit&lt;TObj, keyof T&gt; = { ...obj };\r\n    // we have to cast here, only endresult will fit the type\r\n    const mapped = {} as { [P in keyof T]: ReturnType&lt;T[P]&gt; };\r\n\r\n    for (const k of Object.keys(transformer)) {\r\n      // just one way of working around Object.keys types\r\n      const kC = k as keyof T;\r\n      mapped[kC] = transformer[kC](obj[kC]);\r\n    }\r\n    return { ...objClone, ...mapped };\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTest it:\r\n```\r\nconst trans = makeTransform({\r\n  a: (x: number) =&gt; String(x * 2),\r\n  b: (x: string) =&gt; parseInt(x)\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst res0 = [{ a: 1, b: &quot;11&quot; }, { a: 2, b: &quot;22&quot; }].map(trans);\r\nconst res1 = [{ a: 1, b: &quot;11&quot;, c: new Date() }, { a: 2, b: &quot;22&quot;, c: {} }].map(trans);\r\nconst res2 = [{ a: 1 }, { a: 2, b: &quot;22&quot; }].map(trans); // error: b not found (OK)\r\nconst res3 = [{ a: 1, b: &quot;11&quot; }, { b: &quot;22&quot; }].map(trans); // error: a not found (OK)\r\nconst res4 = [{ a: &quot;1&quot;, b: &quot;11&quot;

back on line, you can replicate the data from the local SQL Server into the online server database.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is something called [`Progressive Web Apps`][1] , which will allow you below

Users would not expect the back button to call the onCreate, or create, your fragment again.\r\n\r\nAs an example, think about when you open the YouTube app on Android and you are shown your home screen, populated with videos based on your interests. When you tap on a video after a bit of scrolling and then midway through the video decide to go back by pressing the back button, you expect the app to go back where you tapped on the video, with the same amount of scrolling you had done, instead of reloading your entire home page again filling with new videos and resetting you to the top of the screen. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, back button in your app should do the same. If however, you want your back button to behave differently, android does provide a way to do this. Refer to [this][1] for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-custom-back","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316268/fragments-recreated-with-jetpacks-android-navigation-components/58316401#58316401","title":"Fragments recreated with Jetpack&#39;s Android Navigation components"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7986741,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6901f6faed2cf3c6f531813a08dedd2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"A.Da","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7986741/a-da"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570687549,"creation_date":1570686935,"question_id":58316268,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58316268","body_markdown":"I have two fragments (for ex. fragmentA and fragmentB). \r\n\r\nfirst , in fragmentA  use `findNavController().navigate(R.id.action_fragmentA_to_fragmentB)` to navigate to fragmentB .\r\n\r\nthen , in fragmentB if you want to back to fragmentA. there are two ways in below :\r\n\r\n- **just press back button** : fragmentA&#39;s `onCreate()` won&#39;t be called\r\n- **findNavController().navigate(R.id.action_fragmentB_to_fragmentA)** : fragmentA&#39;s `onCreate()` will be called\r\n\r\n**why?**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316268/fragments-recreated-with-jetpacks-android-navigation-components","title":"Fragments recreated with Jetpack&#39;s Android Navigation components"},{"tags":["wso2","wso2esb"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":6082483,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-r_AS137VFGA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIo/RYqAtBUABcM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arunan Sugunakumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6082483/arunan-sugunakumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571117831,"post_id":58316267,"comment_id":103122656,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316267/how-to-receive-request-at-the-middle-of-a-sequence-in-wso2-esb#comment103122656_58316267"},{"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":4988579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/678b2678915d13176928bad8ce31f8ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nishan256","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4988579/nishan256"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":146,"user_id":6082483,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-r_AS137VFGA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIo/RYqAtBUABcM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arunan Sugunakumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6082483/arunan-sugunakumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571119754,"post_id":58316267,"comment_id":103123275,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58316267/how-to-receive-request-at-the-middle-of-a-sequence-in-wso2-esb#comment103123275_58316267"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":4988579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/678b2678915d13176928bad8ce31f8ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nishan256","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4988579/nishan256"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570686935,"creation_date":1570686935,"question_id":58316267,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58316267","body_markdown":"My requirement is like below,\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n1.

am looking for a solution to handover a image URI to a native module in Android.\r\nThe problem is, that when I require a image in react native, it just returns a number.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;d need to load the URI directly or some sort of string that can be converted to a file and afterwards to URI in android.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nMy images are loaded in a separat file like this:\r\n\r\n    { sticker1: { uri: require(&#39;./Sticker_1.png&#39;), path: &#39;./Sticker_1.png&#39; } },\r\n\r\nAfterwards I display items in a Flatlist like this:\r\n\r\n    renderItem(item) {\r\n    const itemIndex = item.index;\r\n    const itemKey = `sticker${itemIndex + 1}`;\r\n    const sticker = item.item[itemKey];\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;TouchableOpacity\r\n        onPress={() =&gt; this.handOverSticker()}\r\n        key={itemKey}\r\n      &gt;\r\n          &lt;Image source={sticker.uri} style={styles.previewImage} key={itemKey} /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\r\n
