I have another Android 9 phone a Samsung S10 plus. The S10 plus does not crash when I press the button for taking a picture.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging I noticed that the G7 doesn&#39;t call ImageReader.OnImageAvailableListener while the S10 does. Looking at the code this is where the image is saved for use later on in CameraCaptureSession.CaptureCallback. The callback expects bytes to be populated and crashes when it isn&#39;t (I haven&#39;t included the stack trace because it&#39;s not a little unhelpful but I can if you think you would like to see it).\r\n\r\nI can get the G7 to save the image if I run it slowly through debug on &#39;some&#39; occasions.\r\n\r\nSo I have a button that calls the function onImageCaptureClick() inside it does a bunch of stuff but one of the things it does is create an ImageReader.OnImageAvailableListener. The OnImageAvailableListener saves the image and populates a variable bytes from the image buffer.

I also tried `p.communicate(timeout=10)`, and it hangs also with no `timeoutExpired` exception seen.\r\n\r\nI also tried `subprocess.check_output()`, and it hangs the 2nd call as well.\r\n\r\nThe python is 2.7.3.\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58001073/subsequent-call-to-python-subprocess-popen-communicate-hangs","title":"subsequent call to python subprocess.Popen().communicate() hangs"},{"tags":["php","nginx"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":622,"user_id":2223967,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/911e9d48c2f678f0180fb39f5ef8e630?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mohd Alomar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2223967/mohd-alomar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568857321,"post_id":58000960,"comment_id":102410745,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000960/nginx-configuration-for-multi-project-folders#comment102410745_58000960"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":153,"user_id":6204064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/233265043727921/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mikel Tawfik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6204064/mikel-tawfik"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568866010,"creation_date":1568866010,"answer_id":58003583,"question_id":58000960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58003583","body_markdown":"first if server_name , your localhost , set localhost \r\n\r\nsecond set your /srv/www\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\ncode\r\n\r\n    \t\t\r\n\r\n    server {  \r\n         location ~ /\\. { deny  all; }\r\n        listen *:80 ;\t\t\r\n         server_name   localhost   \t ;\r\n          root   /srv/www;\r\n        \r\n    \r\n        location / {root   /srv/www/;\r\n        \r\n                \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        index  index.htm  index.html  index.php;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n       location ^~ /ardu-component {    \r\n            try_files $uri /index.php$is_args$args;\r\n        }\r\n        \t\t\r\n        \t\t\r\n            location ~ ^/.+\\.php {\r\n                  fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;\r\n        fastcgi_index index.php;\r\n                    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /home/lecad/public_html/$fastcgi_script_name;\r\n                        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_script_name;\r\n        fastcgi_param PHP_ADMIN_VALUE &quot;open_basedir=\\&quot;/srv/www/:/tmp:/usr/local/lib/php:\\&quot;\r\n        include_path=\\&quot;/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php:/tmp:/srv/www/\\&quot;&quot;;\r\n                   include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;\r\n                }}\t\r\n            \r\n**if that not work  , try**\r\n\r\n \r\nupdate \r\n\r\n    try_files $uri /index.php$is_args$args;\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n    try_files /ardu-component/$uri /ardu-component/index.php$is_args$args;\r\n           \r\n            \r\nhoping that help you\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000960/nginx-configuration-for-multi-project-folders/58003583#58003583","title":"Nginx configuration for multi-project folders"}],"owner":{"reputation":362,"user_id":4836891,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y3GpI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ismael Moral","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4836891/ismael-moral"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58003583,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568866010,"creation_date":1568842206,"question_id":58000960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000960","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to set up nginx configuration file for multi-project php located in different folders.

As you have seen, the `TokenInterface` does not include a setter for the roles.\r\n\r\nAnd you can&#39;t `setAuthenticated(false)`, because then you would be clearing the first authentication _factor_, and going bac to zero.\r\n\r\nBut I believe you are approaching the problem the wrong way.\r\n\r\nLeave the token as it is, and use the listener for `onAuthenticationSuccess` to check  `User::organization::getMfa()` to decide if you need to:\r\n\r\n* send the user the secondary authentication code, \r\n* store somewhere that you are the authentication is not finished (e.g. in the session, in the DB in a user property, a separate store for this, etc).\r\n\r\n(Personally, I would make the requirement of MFA another role, so that could be stored on the token and you wouldn&#39;t need to check additional things for this).\r\n\r\nThen, create a [event subscriber][1] for **each** request.\r\n\r\nOn that listener you would inject `use Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Security`  to access the user and see if `User::organization::getMfa() === true`;  and whatever means to check if the authentication is not finished (e.g., if you stored in the session, or check the user entity directly, etc).\r\n\r\n* If you do not have a token, you `return`, this is a non-authenticated view and it&#39;s not the listeners problem.\r\n\r\n* If the user does not require MFA, you just `return`; nothing to do here.\r\n\r\n* If the user requires MFA but it is not in the middle of an authentication process, you `return`. This means the user has been already authenticated completely, and they can carry on.\r\n\r\n* If the user requires MFA and is in the middle of an authentication process, you display whatever means to finish it. Typically a form.\r\n\r\n* If the user requires MFA and is in the middle of an authentication process **and they are sending you the means to check this authentication** (e.g. a POST request with the appropriate fields), you verify that the authentication is good.\r\n\r\n* Is the verification good? You clear the &quot;authentication in process&quot; bit, and return. Further requests won&#39;t be intercepted.\r\n\r\n* Is the verification bad? You either let them check again, re-send the verification codes, log the user out completely so they start again...

When selecting another user, it deletes the current state regarding the now old user sets the new user which triggers the first useEffect hook again.\r\n\r\nMy issue becomes clear when looking at the code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Gallery = () =&gt; {\r\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(&#39;user1&#39;);\r\n  const [stories, setStories] = useState([]);\r\n  const [loadedAll, setLoadedAll] = useState(false);\r\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\r\n  const galleryRef = useRef(null);\r\n  const loadedAmount = useRef(0);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    let didCancel = false;\r\n\r\n    async function fetchData() {\r\n      setLoading(true);\r\n\r\n      const query = `/api/v1/stories/part/${user}?limit=${20}&amp;skip=${loadedAmount.current}&amp;sortBy=uploadedAt_desc`;\r\n      const result = await axios.get(query);\r\n      const count = result.data.length;\r\n\r\n      const transformedStories = result.data.map((story) =&gt; ({\r\n        ...story,\r\n        width: story.width || 1080,\r\n        height: story.height || 1920,\r\n      }));\r\n\r\n      if (!didCancel) {\r\n        setStories((currentStories) =&gt; [\r\n          ...currentStories,\r\n          ...transformedStories,\r\n        ]);\r\n        loadedAmount.current += count;\r\n\r\n        if (count &lt; 20) {\r\n          setLoadedAll(true);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        setLoading(false);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fetchData();\r\n\r\n    return () =&gt; {\r\n      didCancel = true;\r\n      setStories([]);\r\n      loadedAmount.current = 0;\r\n      setLoadedAll(false);\r\n    };\r\n  }, [user]);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    const handleScroll = (evt) =&gt; {\r\n      const scroller = galleryRef.current;\r\n      const loadTreshold = 500;\r\n      const shouldLoad =\r\n        window.innerHeight + window.scrollY &gt;=\r\n        scroller.clientHeight + scroller.offsetTop - loadTreshold;\r\n\r\n      if (shouldLoad) {\r\n        //\r\n        // Load next batch.\r\n        //\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, handleScroll);\r\n    return () =&gt; window.removeEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, handleScroll);\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n\r\n   return (\r\n      ...\r\n   );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I refactor my code, so that the next batch of images gets loaded when `handleScroll` succeeds? `handleScroll` checks whether the user scrolled far enough for us to request and display the next batch of images.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help, I&#39;m really stuck right now.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000931/how-to-implement-infinite-scrolling-with-react-hooks","title":"How to implement infinite scrolling with React Hooks?"},{"tags":["ml.net","data-transform","runtime-type"],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":6249793,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LatlD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Farhad Shariatzadeh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6249793/farhad-shariatzadeh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568841967,"creation_date":1568841967,"question_id":58000921,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000921","body_markdown":"Microsoft.ML.CustomMappingCatalog&lt;TSrc,TDst&gt; is taking a source type to retrieve data from and a destination type as a structure for the output object.

The first row of each text file contains an identical header (intentionally ignored by awk). I create the header as part of the table header for formatting purposes.\r\n\r\nExample - foo1.txt (shortened to first 4 rows of made-up data):\r\n\r\n    H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H7 H8 H9 H10\r\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\r\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\r\n    3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\r\n\r\nA template html file holding some CSS, table positions, and table strings to be replaced. It is important that this template html file is not written over, as it must be used many times for other cases (other sets of 6 text files). The table strings (MYTABLE1, MYTABLE2, …) will be what needs to be replaced by the shell script.\r\n\r\nExample - template.html:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    &lt;!--some html and css code, followed by below code--&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;table&gt;\r\n    &lt;caption&gt;foo1&lt;/caption&gt;\r\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n    MYTABLE1\r\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;table&gt;\r\n    &lt;caption&gt;foo2&lt;/caption&gt;\r\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n    MYTABLE2\r\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;table&gt;\r\n    &lt;caption&gt;foo3&lt;/caption&gt;\r\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n    MYTABLE3\r\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;!--then, continues through foo6 and MYTABLE6 and other html code--&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bash script opens each text file, and using awk, creates the &lt;th&gt; row and reads from the files to fill in each row below the header row. The table html is included between the values coming in from the text files. The output from awk is stored as a variable, which is then passed to sed to search the template.html file for the MYTABLE* strings, and replace them with the variables containing additional table code. Then, sed is to create a new html file so as to not write over the template.html file. The awk part of the script works as intended, however the sed part complains about the &#39;s/ and fails. I presume this is because there is html code being passed? I have tried multiple ways to get sed to accept the string variable, with each attempt having the &#39;s/ failure.\r\n\r\nExample - make_table.sh (included only the first 3 table elements to create):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nSTRING1=$(cat foo/foo1.txt | awk &#39; NR==1{next} BEGIN {\r\nprint &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;H1&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;H2&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H3&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H4&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H5&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H6&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H7&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H8&lt;/th&gt;&quot;,  &quot;&lt;th&gt;H9&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H10&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot; }\r\n{ print &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;&quot; $1 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;&quot; $2 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $3 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $4 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $5 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $6 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $7 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $8 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $9 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $10 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot; }&#39;)\r\n\r\nSTRING2=$(cat foo/foo2.txt | awk &#39; NR==1{next} BEGIN {\r\nprint &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;H1&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;H2&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H3&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H4&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H5&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H6&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H7&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H8&lt;/th&gt;&quot;,  &quot;&lt;th&gt;H9&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H10&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot; }\r\n{ print &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;&quot; $1 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;&quot; $2 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $3 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $4 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $5 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $6 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $7 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $8 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $9 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $10 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot; }&#39;)\r\n\r\nSTRING3=$(cat foo/foo3.txt | awk &#39; NR==1{next} BEGIN {\r\nprint &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;H1&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;H2&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H3&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H4&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H5&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H6&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H7&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H8&lt;/th&gt;&quot;,  &quot;&lt;th&gt;H9&lt;/th&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;th&gt;H10&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot; }\r\n{ print &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;&quot; $1 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=\\x22right\\x22&gt;&quot; $2 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $3 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $4 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $5 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $6 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $7 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $8 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $9 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; $10 &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot; }&#39;)\r\n\r\necho $STRING1\r\n#everything above works as intended\r\n\r\n#I&#39;ve tried (with no luck):\r\n#sed -e &#39;s/MYTABLE1/&#39;${STRING1}&#39;/&#39; \\\r\n#sed -e &#39;c/MYTABLE1/&#39;&quot;$(echo ${STRING1})&quot;&#39;/&#39; \\\r\n\r\n#below does not work\r\nsed -e &#39;s/MYTABLE1/&#39;&quot;$(echo ${STRING1})&quot;&#39;/&#39; \\\r\n    -e &#39;s/MYTABLE2/&#39;&quot;$(echo ${STRING2})&quot;&#39;/&#39; \\\r\n    -e &#39;s/MYTABLE3/&#39;&quot;$(echo ${STRING3})&quot;&#39;/&#39; \\\r\n    &lt; template.html &gt; template_new.html\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I get sed to accept those STRING* commands?

In a given period (column) any Category representing &lt; 5% of the total Amount in the Period should be regrouped into a Category called &#39;Other.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this exercise is to visualize the data in a stacked bar chart.  Below is the current version--the problem of many immaterial categories that differ from person to period is evident.  My gut was that the easiest way to accomplish this would be with a set of helper columns in the raw data.

Each HTTP request will continue to completion, as well as any of the other internal handlers that are called within `search()` before the promise is settled. \r\n\r\nAll `cancellation()` does is cause the internal state of the returned promise to transition from _pending_ to _rejected_ instead of _fulfilled_ if a later promise settles first so that the appropriate handler(s) for promise resolution will be called by the consuming code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000824/how-to-cancel-last-promise-if-not-resolved/58001399#58001399","title":"How to cancel last Promise if not

aren&#39;t cancelable as such, but are cancelled in a limited sense by causing them to be rejected.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, cancellation can be achieved with a small amount of elaboration around [`Promise.race()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race) and the promise-returning function you wish to be cancelable.\r\n\r\n\tfunction makeCancellable(fn) {\r\n\t\tvar reject_; // cache for the latest `reject` executable\r\n\t\treturn function(...params) {\r\n\t\t\tif(reject_) reject_(new Error(&#39;_cancelled_&#39;)); // If previous reject_ exists, cancel it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   // Note, this has an effect only if the previous race is still pending.\r\n\t\t\tlet canceller = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { // create canceller promise\r\n\t\t\t\treject_ = reject; // cache the canceller&#39;s `reject` executable\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\treturn Promise.race([canceller, fn.apply(null, params)]); // now race the promise of interest against the canceller\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAssuming your http call function is named `httpRequest` (`promise` is confusing):\r\n\r\n\tconst search = makeCancellable(httpRequest);\r\n\r\nNow, each time `search()` is called, the cached `reject` executable is called to &quot;cancel&quot; the preceding search (if it exists and its race has not already fulfilled).\r\n\r\n\t// Search 1: straightforward - nothing to cancel - httpRequest(200) is called\r\n\tsearch(200)\r\n\t.then(function() { console.log(&#39;search1 resolved&#39;) })\r\n\t.catch(function(err) { console.log(&#39;search3 rejected&#39;, err) });\r\n\r\n\t// Search 2: search 1 is cancelled and its catch callback fires - httpRequest(2000) is called\r\n\tsearch(2000)\r\n\t.then(function() { console.log(&#39;search2 resolved&#39;) })\r\n\t.catch(function(err) { console.log(&#39;search3 rejected&#39;, err) });\r\n\r\n\t// Search 3: search 2

console.log(&#39;search3 rejected&#39;, err) });\r\n\r\nIf necessary, the catch callbacks can test `err.message === &#39;_cancelled_&#39;` in order to distinguish between cancellation and other causes of rejection.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000824/how-to-cancel-last-promise-if-not-resolved/58002434#58002434","title":"How to cancel last Promise if not

to the answer of PatrickRoberts, I would suggest to use a `Map` to maintain a list of pending promises.\r\n\r\nI would however not maintain a reference to the `reject` callback outside of the promise constructor. I would suggest to abandon the idea of *rejecting* an outdated promise. Instead, just ignore it. Wrap it in a promise that never resolves or rejects, but just remains a dead promise object that does not ever change state. In fact, that silent promise could be the same one for every case where you need it.\r\n\r\nHere is how that could look:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const delay = (timeout, data) =&gt; new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(() =&gt; resolve(data), timeout));\r\n    const godot = new Promise(() =&gt; null);\r\n\r\n    const search = (function () { // closure...\r\n        const requests = new Map; // ... so to have shared variables\r\n        let id = 1;\r\n        \r\n        return async function search() {\r\n            let duration = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2000);\r\n            let request = delay(duration, &quot;data&quot; + id); // This would be an HTTP request\r\n            requests.set(request, id++);\r\n            let data = await request;\r\n            if (!requests.has(request)) return godot; // Never resolve...\r\n            for (let [pendingRequest, pendingId] of requests) {\r\n                if (pendingRequest === request) break;\r\n                requests.delete(pendingRequest);\r\n                // Just for demo we output something. \r\n                // Not needed in a real scenario:\r\n                console.log(&quot;ignoring search &quot; + pendingId);\r\n            }\r\n            requests.delete(request);\r\n            return data;\r\n        }    \r\n    })();\r\n\r\n    const reportSuccess = data =&gt; console.log(&quot;search resolved with &quot; + data);\r\n    const reportError = err =&gt; console.log(&#39;search rejected with &#39; + err);\r\n\r\n    // Generate a search at regular intervals.\r\n    // In a real scenario this could happen in response to key events.\r\n    // Each promise resolves with a random duration.\r\n    setInterval(() =&gt;

But you are also not including anything else in your question, so we can completely omit that. \r\n\r\nSo I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n    import { DatePipe } from &#39;@angular/common&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    @Component({\r\n      selector: &#39;...&#39;,\r\n      templateUrl: &#39;...&#39;,\r\n      styleUrls: [&#39;...&#39;],\r\n      providers: [DatePipe]\r\n    })\r\n\r\nInject it in the constructor and then use::\r\n\r\n    constructor(private fb: FormBuilder, private datePipe: DatePipe) {\r\n      this.myForm = this.fb.group({\r\n        field1: [this.datePipe.transform(new Date(), &#39;medium&#39;)]\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen remove the pipe from the template.\r\n\r\n**[STACKBLITZ][1]**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vaquvy?file=src/app/app.component.ts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000780/date-pipe-in-angular-formcontrolname/58008820#58008820","title":"Date pipe in Angular formControlName"}],"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":1993412,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d872f78fb393f8315b61c4fd7a64e05f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1993412","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1993412/user1993412"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568888333,"creation_date":1568841082,"question_id":58000780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000780","body_markdown":"Can someone please guide me to implement date pipe in angular 8 with formControlName\r\n\r\n**train.component.html**\r\n```\r\n&lt;mat-grid-tile colspan=1 rowspan=1&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;train-control&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; formControlName=&quot;{{ &#39;apprTimestamp&#39; | date:&#39;medium&#39; }}&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/mat-grid-tile&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut does not not seemed to work.
