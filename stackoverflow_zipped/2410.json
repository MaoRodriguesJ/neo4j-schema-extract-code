Then when your animation starts set the flag to `true` and when it&#39;s finished set it to `false`. Then in your `render()` method write a conditional render like `this.state.isAnimating === false &amp;&amp; &lt;CardContent /&gt;`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CSS Animation\r\nIf you are using CSS animation you can use the `transitionend` event to wait for the animation to end. Therefore you have to create a `ref` on the animating DOM element to which you can attach the event.\r\n\r\nDoes that help you a bit? Please let me know if you have any other questions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963871/debounce-jsx-elements-rendering-in-react/57963988#57963988","title":"Debounce jsx element&#39;s rendering in React"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5151,"user_id":5521607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0vvlR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Boiss&#233;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5521607/olivier-boiss%c3%a9"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568672310,"creation_date":1568672310,"answer_id":57965052,"question_id":57963871,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57965052","body_markdown":"Here is a [solution][1] using [react spring library][2]\r\n\r\n - I added a state variable in order to display or not the card content\r\n\r\n        const [contentVisible, setContentVisible] = React.useState(false); \r\n\r\n\r\n - I created a spring to handle the width transition, I set contentVisible to true as soon as the width approaches the 300\r\n\r\n        const { width } = useSpring({\r\n          width: open ? 300 : 120,\r\n          onFrame: ({ width }) =&gt; setContentVisible(width &gt; 299.8)\r\n        });\r\n\r\n - Finally, I created an animated card component\r\n        \r\n        const AnimatedCard = animated(Card);\r\n        ...\r\n        &lt;AnimatedCard classes={{ root: classes.card }} style={{ width }}&gt;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codesandbox.io/embed/expanding-panel-with-transition-7xye2\r\n  [2]: https://www.react-spring.io/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963871/debounce-jsx-elements-rendering-in-react/57965052#57965052","title":"Debounce jsx element&#39;s rendering in React"}],"owner":{"reputation":1350,"user_id":1770131,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3126242bf374fee1ef843d7580dd7cf5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"erp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1770131/erp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568672310,"creation_date":1568665023,"question_id":57963871,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963871","body_markdown":"I am wondering if it is possible to debounce a jsx element&#39;s rendering. I have an animation of a panel expanding that has some content in it. If the panel is empty (just the background) the animation is smooth and works as expected. The animation and associated components are all from Material-UI. The issue arises when the content is in the panel already so the animation (width expansion) just skips out to the width of the content making the animation look choppy. [Here is a similar example][1] to what I am referring to. This code is my code I am using in my panel and they work the same in terms of the expansion. Only difference is the content in this example is just lorem ipsum so the animation appears to work fine. Is it possible to debounce the `&lt;CardContent /&gt;` component&#39;s rendering like this?\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ open &amp;&amp;\r\n  (\r\n    _.debounce(e =&gt; {\r\n      return (\r\n

fully expanded through the animation before the content is rendered?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

can add new CSS classes (`.MyClass { background-color: yellow; }`) &amp; selectors (`#username[value=&quot;foo&quot;] { background:url(&quot;http://site&quot;); }`) with JavaScript, add new CSS rules inside `&lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt;` HTML tags and also by including a CSS document with `&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;mystyle.css&quot;&gt;`.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to use **inline CSS** to use existing CSS rules, but is it possible (on any of [top 10 modern browsers][1]) to define a new CSS rules **inside an attribute** (*inline CSS*)?\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n&lt;HTMLTAG attribute=&quot;.myClass { background-color: yellow; }&quot;&gt;text&lt;/HTMLTAG&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want to be extremely restrictive (Previously I asked about defining CSS class inside `&lt;p style=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`), so what I would like to know is, within which **attributes &amp;&amp; HTML tags** it is possible to define new CSS rules?\r\n\r\nE.g. one could put HTML inside iframe&#39;s *srcdoc* attribute (http://html5sec.org/#139):\r\n\r\n&gt; HTML5 specifies a &quot;srcdoc&quot; attribute for Iframes. This attribute,\r\n&gt; quite similar to data URIs, is capable of hosting HTML text to be\r\n&gt; rendered by the browser as the content of the Iframe. The\r\n&gt; pseudo-document created by the &quot;srcdoc&quot; attribute has full access to\r\n&gt; the hosting domain, although it runs in an artificial origin. This\r\n&gt; attribute should if at all only be used in combination with the Iframe\r\n&gt; Sandbox.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n&lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; p { background-color: yellow; } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we cheated here a bit and it were able to define some CSS rules, but inside an iframe.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nAnd this is how my browser renders it (Google Chrome 76, developers console):\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&lt;style&gt; p { background-color: yellow; } &lt;/style&gt;&lt;p&gt;text&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n    #document\r\n      &lt;html&gt;\r\n        &lt;head&gt;\r\n          &lt;style&gt;p { background-color: yellow;

I have the following XML file and I was wondering what the commands are to grab each comment with the date and time as well as each v row associated with that date and time. I&#39;m assuming I use a triple for loop and insert the commands into it however I&#39;m not exactly sure what those commands are. I want to use `from xml.etree import cElementTree as ET` and I&#39;m thinking I start the code like this\r\n\r\n    import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\r\n    tree = ET.parse(&#39;file.xml&#39;)\r\n    root = tree.getroot()\r\n    \r\n    # find the first &#39;item&#39; object\r\n    for elem in root:\r\n        for subelement in elem:\r\n            for row in subelement:\r\n                for v in row:\r\n                    print (v.attrib)\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t know how to grab the comment and I&#39;m not sure the nested for loops will get me to the right area and if the command is right.

When I originally created the form and functions, I was able to call $_POST[&#39;value&#39;] and return it in one of my php functions. But that suddenly stopped working a few weeks ago. Suddenly, it has started working again. Your help was just fantastic and it helped me understand better ajax and json. I believe this thread offers a lot more then others like it.

I want to add Kerberos auth to it.\r\n\r\nAssume:\r\n\r\n- I&#39;m on AD domain `example.com`\r\n- My host DNS entries are `host@example.com`\r\n- My Kerberos realm is `EXAMPLE.COM`, \r\n\r\nFrom answers such as [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22991646/3821009) one, I figured that the keytab has to contain entries such as:\r\n\r\n    HTTP/virt01.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n    ...\r\n    HTTP/virt09.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n    HTTP/svc01.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n    ...\r\n    HTTP/svc09.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n\r\nin order for browsers and other clients (such as other non-interactive services) to be able to authenticate against the servers. Is the above correct?\r\n\r\nIf it is, a follow up question is - is there a way to make a &quot;service alias&quot; so to speak, so I can put just one entry in keytab:\r\n\r\n    HTTP/svc-alias.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n\r\nsomehow? This in order to be able to move the service to other hosts for example and not have to regen the keytab with a new host and CNAME added. Especially important for local testing. E.g. if this is tested on `workstation583`, a new keytab entry for that workstation would have to be made, which is really inconvenient.\r\n\r\nIf not possible, what is the easiest way to manage adding / removing hostnames? How is this done in practice with multi-server deployments to make it manageable?\r\n\r\nAny resources answering any of the above are appreciated as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963821/service-mapping-for-keytabs","title":"Service mapping for keytabs"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1988,"user_id":1212401,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed478436fcb05fd3ae15da650d2a8cd6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chris Doyle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1212401/chris-doyle"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568664956,"post_id":57963818,"comment_id":102338738,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963818/i-want-to-be-able-to-find-all-anagrams-of-a-user-input-using-a-text-file-that-i#comment102338738_57963818"},{"owner":{"reputation":608,"user_id":11432434,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lYnbtUu9EOU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf-9ybhwxbzBDHJNyQWMDDx97hP7g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SimonN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11432434/simonn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568665088,"post_id":57963818,"comment_id":102338807,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963818/i-want-to-be-able-to-find-all-anagrams-of-a-user-input-using-a-text-file-that-i#comment102338807_57963818"},{"owner":{"reputation":3301,"user_id":10366273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1c2BX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MyNameIsCaleb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10366273/mynameiscaleb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568665127,"post_id":57963818,"comment_id":102338827,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963818/i-want-to-be-able-to-find-all-anagrams-of-a-user-input-using-a-text-file-that-i#comment102338827_57963818"},{"owner":{"reputation":111,"user_id":10552640,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d29ea973ff7557ba6510ef47518c9051?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10552640/gary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568666734,"post_id":57963818,"comment_id":102339385,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963818/i-want-to-be-able-to-find-all-anagrams-of-a-user-input-using-a-text-file-that-i#comment102339385_57963818"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12076185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d178deb7e1055e3020507a1bdc89bea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dds44","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076185/dds44"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3220,"user_id":1159558,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/feOB0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"oblalex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159558/oblalex"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568666986,"creation_date":1568664763,"last_edit_date":1568666986,"question_id":57963818,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963818","body_markdown":"I am trying to create code to go through the file, sort each word by lexicographical order, and then compare that to the lexicographically ordered user input.

See summarized code below:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic abstract class Component {\r\n\r\n  public void add() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void remove() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public ArrayList&lt;Component&gt; getItems() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public ItemIterator iterator() {\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Composite extends Component implements Iterable&lt;Component&gt; {\r\n\r\n  ArrayList&lt;Component&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;Component&gt;();\r\n  String name;\r\n\r\n  public ItemIterator iterator() {\r\n  return new ItemIterator(this);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public Composite(String name) {\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public getName() {\r\n  // returns name\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public ArrayList&lt;Component&gt; getItems() {\r\n  return this.items;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ItemIterator implements Iterator&lt;Component&gt; {\r\n\r\n  ArrayList&lt;Component&gt; breadthFirstSearch = new ArrayList&lt;Component&gt;();\r\n  Component currentItem;\r\n\r\n  public ItemIterator(Component firstItem) {\r\n  currentItem = firstItem;\r\n  breadthFirstSearch.add(currentItem);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public boolean hasNext() {\r\n  if (breadthFirstSearch.isEmpty()) {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n  return true;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public Component next() {\r\n  // This method pops the root item the first time, creates its children, \r\n  // places at end of ArrayList,\r\n  // then returns the root. Second time the same operations are performed\r\n  // on the following item in the breadth first traversal of the tree.\r\n  if (hasNext()) {\r\n    Component nextItem = breadthFirstSearch.get(0);\r\n    if (nextItem instanceof Composite) {\r\n      for (Component item : currentItem.getItems()) {\r\n        breadthFirstSearch.add(item);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    breadthFirstSearch.remove(0);\r\n    if (hasNext()) {\r\n      currentItem = breadthFirstSearch.get(0);\r\n    }\r\n    return nextItem;\r\n  }\r\n  return null;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Demo {\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    Component bag = new Composite(&quot;bag&quot;);\r\n    Component plasticBag = new Composite(&quot;plastic bag&quot;);\r\n    Component makeupBag = new Composite(&quot;makeup bag&quot;);\r\n    Component phone = new Composite(&quot;phone&quot;);\r\n    Component lipstick = new Composite(&quot;lipstick&quot;);\r\n    Component mascara = new Composite(&quot;mascara&quot;);\r\n\r\n    bag.add(plasticBag); bag.add(makeupBag);\r\n    plasticbag.add(phone); makeupBag.add(lipstick); makeupBag.add(mascara);\r\n\r\n    ItemIterator itr = bag.iterator();\r\n\r\n    while (itr.hasNext()) {\r\n      System.out.println(itr.next().getName());\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above compiles and runs fine, it works. However, I am not certain of whether it is programmatically acceptable. The structure of it seems to fundamentally go against other Iterator implementations that I have seen (implementations that I discovered after finishing the above solution), but I can&#39;t quite grasp/explain what is so wrong about it. The other way of implementing Iterable (in a different context) was of the form:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic abstract class Component {\r\n\r\n  public void add() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void remove() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public ArrayList&lt;Component&gt; getItems() {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote the lack of an iterator() method in the abstract class above. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Composite extends Component implements Iterable&lt;Component&gt; {\r\n\r\n  ArrayList&lt;Component&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;Component&gt;();\r\n  String name;\r\n\r\n  public Iterator&lt;Component&gt; iterator() {\r\n  \r\n    return new Iterator() {\r\n      public boolean hasNext() {\r\n      // Code\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      public Iterator&lt;Component&gt; next() {\r\n      // Code\r\n      };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public Composite(String name) {\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public getName() {\r\n  // returns name\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public ArrayList&lt;Component&gt; getItems() {\r\n  return this.items;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich way of structuring the solution is better, and is my way of doing it outright wrong/bad practice and if so, why? I am new to Java, so I apologize if this turns out to be a bad question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963817/implementing-an-iterator-on-composite-design-pattern-through-separate-class-is","title":"Implementing an Iterator on Composite Design Pattern Through Separate Class - Is It programmatically valid?"},{"tags":["html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1705,"user_id":10967889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrFdS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"weegee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10967889/weegee"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568665414,"post_id":57963816,"comment_id":102338930,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963816/why-does-my-custom-scrollbar-box-shadow-styles-not-affect-the-body-scrollbar#comment102338930_57963816"},{"owner":{"reputation":1867,"user_id":5056347,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBHCy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"darkhorse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5056347/darkhorse"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1705,"user_id":10967889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrFdS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"weegee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10967889/weegee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568665541,"post_id":57963816,"comment_id":102338974,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963816/why-does-my-custom-scrollbar-box-shadow-styles-not-affect-the-body-scrollbar#comment102338974_57963816"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1705,"user_id":10967889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrFdS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"weegee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10967889/weegee"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568665829,"creation_date":1568665829,"answer_id":57964022,"question_id":57963816,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57964022","body_markdown":"Just use the [inset option](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp) in [`box-shadow`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp) for scroll bar shadows\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    ::-webkit-scrollbar {\r\n      width: 14px;\r\n      height: 14px;\r\n      background-color: white;\r\n       -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px black\r\n    }\r\n    ::-webkit-scrollbar-button {\r\n      background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\r\n    }\r\n    ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {\r\n      height: 50px;\r\n      background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\r\n      border: 4px solid white;\r\n      border-radius: 10px;\r\n    }\r\n    ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {\r\n      background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\r\n    }\r\n    ::-webkit-resizer {\r\n      background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\r\n    }\r\n    html{\r\n      background-color:white;\r\n      height:100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div style=&quot;height: 5000px;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n      &lt;div style=&quot;margin: auto; width: 100px; height: 500px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div style=&quot;height: 1000px; padding: 24px;&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div&gt;Some content&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963816/why-does-my-custom-scrollbar-box-shadow-styles-not-affect-the-body-scrollbar/57964022#57964022","title":"Why does my custom scrollbar box shadow styles not affect the body scrollbar?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1867,"user_id":5056347,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBHCy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"darkhorse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5056347/darkhorse"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57964022,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568665829,"creation_date":1568664749,"question_id":57963816,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963816","body_markdown":"I have a simple scrollbar stylesheet that changes the scrollbar&#39;s appearance in Webkit based browsers.

order to understand why the second call behaves kind of strangely and why, as proposed by Leo Aso, removing the keywords `inline` and `reified` (which requires an inlinable function) also breaks the first call, you have to understand type erasure and how `reified`  enables type reification first. \r\n\r\n*Note: The following code is written in Java since I&#39;m more familiar with Java&#39;s than with Kotlin&#39;s syntax. Furthermore, this makes type erasure easier to explain.*\r\n\r\nThe *type parameter* of a *generic function* isn&#39;t available at runtime; Generics are a &quot;compile-time trick&quot; only. This applies to both, Java and Kotlin (since Kotlin is able to run on the JVM). The process in which the generic type information is removed is called *type erasure* and happens during compilation. So how do generic functions work *at runtime*? Consider the following function which returns the most valuable element of an arbitrary collection.\r\n```java \r\n&lt;T&gt; T findHighest(Comparator&lt;T&gt; comparator, Collection&lt;? extends T&gt; collection) {\r\n    T highest = null;\r\n    for (T element : collection) {\r\n        if (highest == null || comparator.compare(element, highest) &gt; 0)\r\n            highest = element;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return highest;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this function can be invoked with many different kinds of collections etc, the value of the *type variable* `T` might vary over time. To ensure compatiblity with all of them, the function gets refactored during type erasure. After type erasure has completed, the function will look somehow similar to this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nObject findHighest(Comparator comparator, Collection collection) {\r\n    Object highest = null;\r\n    for (Object element : collection) {\r\n        if (highest == null || comparator.compare(element, highest) &gt; 0)\r\n            highest = element;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return highest;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring type erasure, type variables are replaced with their bound. In this case, the bound type is `Object`. Parameterized don&#39;t keep their generic type information generally. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you&#39;d compile the erased code, some problems will occur. Consider the following code (unerased) which calls the erased one:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nComparator&lt;CharSequence&gt; comp = ...\r\nList&lt;String&gt; list = ...\r\nString max = findHighest(comp, list);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs `#findHighest(Comparator, Collection)` now returns `Object`, the assignment in line 3 would be illegal. The compiler therefore inserts a cast there during type erasure.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n...\r\nString max = (String) findHighest(comp, list);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the compiler always knows which cast it has to insert, type erasue doesn&#39;t cause any problems in most cases. However, it comes with a few restrictions: `instanceof` doesn&#39;t work, `catch (T exception)` is illegal (whereas `throws T` is allowed since the calling function knows what kind of exception it has to expect), etc. The restriction you had to fight with is the lack of *reifiable* (= full type information available at runtime) generic types (there are a few exceptions, but they do not matter in this context). \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nBut wait, Kotlin has support for reified types, right? That&#39;s true, but as I&#39;ve mentioned earlier, this is only true for inlinable functions. But why is that?\r\n\r\nWhen a function which signature contains the keyword `inline` is invoked, the invoking code is replaced with the code of this function. As the &quot;copied&quot; code no longer has to be compatible with all kinds of types, it can be optimized for the context it is used in. \r\n\r\nOne possible optimization is to replace the type variables in the &quot;copied code&quot; (there&#39;s a lot more happening under the hood) *before* type erasure is done. The type information is therefore preserved and also available at runtime; it is indistinguishable from any other non-generic code. \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;s&gt;Although both of your functions, `#jsonToObject(ExclusionStrategy?)` and `#sendRequestAsync(String, Any?, Int, Token?)`, are marked as inlinable and have reifiable type parameters, there&#39;s still something you&#39;ve missed: `T` is, at least in your call to `#toJsonObject(ExclusionStrategy?)`, NOT reifiable. \r\n\r\nOne reason for this is your call to `#suspendCoroutine(...)`. To understand why this is a problem, we have to look at its declaration first:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nsuspend inline fun &lt;T&gt; suspendCoroutine(\r\n    crossinline block: (Continuation&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Unit\r\n): T\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `crossinline`-keyword is problematic as it stops the compiler from inlining the code that is declared inside `block`. The lambda you pass to `#suspendCoroutine` will therefore be transfered into an anonymous inner class. Technically, this happens under the hood at runtime. \r\n\r\nThe generic type information is therefore NOT available anymore, at least not at runtime. \r\nAt the point where you invoke `#jsonToObject(...)`, the type variable `T` is erased to `Object`. The `TypeToken` Gson generates therefore looks like this: \r\n\r\n```java \r\nTypeToken&lt;HttpResponse&lt;Object&gt;&gt;\r\n```\r\n&lt;/s&gt;\r\n\r\n**Update**: This is, as I&#39;ve found after some further research, NOT true. `crossinline` doesn&#39;t stop the compiler from inlining lambdas, it just forbids them to influence the function&#39;s control flow. I probably mixed it up with the keyword `noinline`, which, as the name implies, actually forbids inlining. \r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;m pretty sure about the following part. However, I still have to find out why Gson is unable to determine and/or to deserialize the type correctly. I&#39;ll update this post as soon as I know more. \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nThat brings us to the final part which tries to explain the weird exception you received. For that, we have to take a look at Gsons&#39; internals. \r\n\r\nInternally, Gson has two main types that are responsible for reflective serialization and deserialization: `TypeAdapterFactory` and `TypeAdapter&lt;T&gt;.`\r\n\r\nA `TypeAdapter&lt;T&gt;` only adapts (= provides the (de-)serialization logic for) one specific type. This means that `Integer`, `Double`, `List&lt;String&gt;` and `List&lt;Float&gt;` are all handled by different `TypeAdapter&lt;T&gt;`s.\r\n\r\n`TypeAdapterFactory`s are responsible for, as their names already imply, providing matching `TypeAdapter&lt;T&gt;`s. The differentiation between `TypeAdapter&lt;T&gt;`s and `TypeAdapterFactory`s is extremely useful as one factory might create all adapters for e.g. a collection type like `List` as they all work in a similar way. \r\n\r\nIn order to determine what kind of adapter you need, Gson expects you to pass a `TypeToken&lt;T&gt;` when calling a (de-)serialization function which should process a generic type. `TypeToken&lt;T&gt;` uses a &quot;trick&quot; to access the type information passed to its type parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as you call `Gson#fromJson(this, object: TypeToken&lt;T&gt;() {}.type)`, Gson iterates through all available `TypeAdapterFactory`s until it finds one that can provide an appropriate `TypeAdapter&lt;T&gt;`. Gson comes with a variety of `TypeAdapterFactory`s, including factories for primitive data types, wrapper types, basic collection types, date and many more. Besides that, Gson provides two special factories:\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory As the name already implies, this factory tries to access the object&#39;s data reflectively. In order to adapt the type of each field appropriately, it requests one matching TypeAdapter&lt;T&gt; per field. This is the factory that will be selected for (de-)serialzing HttpRequest.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;ObjectTypeAdapter.Factory This factory only returns an ObjectTypeAdapter. The snippet below shows what it does on object deserialization (respectively the field in your HttpRequest object):&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override public Object read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\r\n    JsonToken token = in.peek();\r\n    switch (token) {\r\n    ...\r\n    case BEGIN_OBJECT:\r\n      Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = new LinkedTreeMap&lt;String, Object&gt;(); // &lt;-----\r\n      in.beginObject();\r\n      while (in.hasNext()) {\r\n        map.put(in.nextName(), read(in));\r\n      }\r\n      in.endObject();\r\n      return map;   // &lt;-----\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why you get a `ClassCastException` with a `com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963799/reified-generic-parameter-inside-coroutine-is-not-working/57982480#57982480","title":"Reified generic parameter inside coroutine is not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":110,"user_id":5762040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc7b128fabc7c7d39e0c69410511b40f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michal Zhradnk Nono3551","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5762040/michal-zhradnk-nono3551"},"last_editor":{"reputation":110,"user_id":5762040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc7b128fabc7c7d39e0c69410511b40f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michal Zhradnk Nono3551","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5762040/michal-zhradnk-nono3551"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":186,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":57982480,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1568927843,"creation_date":1568664671,"last_edit_date":1568797584,"question_id":57963799,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963799","body_markdown":"I am creating http json client.

I have two other (lot older!) machines, which can process this code OK. One is on windows 10, other on windows 7. The issue is on another device also with windows 10.\r\n\r\nI have read somewhere that this error is generated by Python being in directories with non-ASCII symbols in its names. Seeing that, I have put python in C:\\ root. Also, I have setup PATH variable accordingly (already in installer).\r\n\r\nHow can this be fixed?\r\n\r\nPlease, notify me if full (working) MWE is neccessary instead of link to CTAN site. If so, I try to minimize to official file to as small ammount of code as possible and edit the question.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help,\r\n\r\nRegards, Tomas\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just while I got comment, found out, that a folder .matplotlib is generated in my windows 10 user directory (containing non-ACII letters in its path). Comparing .matplotlib content among machines I found out, that if the savefig() function is called successfully, there are a lot of files, otherwise, only two.\r\n\r\nNow I am sure, that the reason for this is that while using PythonTeX and matplotlib, a .matplotlib directory is created in user home directory, which (in my case) is a faulty path.\r\n\r\nIs there a way, how to change the location where is this directory created?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963768/pythontex-python-latex-error-of-savefig-in-pythontex-gallery-file","title":"PythonTeX (Python + Latex) error of savefig() in PythonteX Gallery file"},{"tags":["ruby","enumerator"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4752,"user_id":490454,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqygM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BobRodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/490454/bobrodes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4752,"user_id":490454,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqygM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BobRodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/490454/bobrodes"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1568692055,"last_edit_date":1568692055,"creation_date":1568690903,"answer_id":57966958,"question_id":57963765,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57966958","body_markdown":"You can `rescue` the `StopIteration` explicitly, but there&#39;s also the idea that the `loop` method internally rescues a `StopIteration` exception by simply exiting the loop. (Inside `loop`, `raise StopIteration` has the same effect as `break`.)\r\n\r\nThis code simply exits the loop when you try to peek past the end:\r\n\r\n    a = %w(a b c d e).to_enum\r\n\r\n    loop do\r\n      print a.peek\r\n      a.next\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThe code outputs `abcde`. (It also transparently raises and rescues `StopIteration`.)\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to simply ignore the `StopIteration` exception when you try to peek past the end, just use `loop`. \r\n\r\nOf course, once you peek past the end, you&#39;ll get dumped out of the loop. If you don&#39;t want that, you can use `while` and `rescue` to customize behavior. For example, if you want to avoid exiting if you peek past the end, and exit when you iterate past the end using `next`, you could do something like this:\r\n\r\n    a = %w(a b c d e).to_enum\r\n\r\n    while true\r\n      begin  \r\n        print a.peek\r\n      rescue StopIteration\r\n        print &quot;\\nTried to peek past the end of the enum.\\nWe&#39;re gonna overlook that.\\n&quot;\r\n      end\r\n      x = a.next rescue $!\r\n      break if x.class == StopIteration\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    p &#39;All done!&#39;\r\n\r\nThe last two lines in the loop do the same thing as this, which you could use instead:\r\n\r\n    begin\r\n      a.next\r\n    rescue StopIteration\r\n      break\r\n    end\r\n\r\nA point to make is that handling `StopIteration` is Ruby&#39;s intended way of dealing with getting to the end of an iterator. Quoting from Matz&#39;s book *The Ruby Programming Language*:\r\n\r\n&gt;External iterators are quite simple to use: just call `next` each time you want another\r\nelement. When there are no more elements left, `next` will raise a `StopIteration` exception.\r\nThis may seem unusual—an exception is raised for an expected termination\r\ncondition rather than an unexpected and exceptional event. (`StopIteration` is a descendant\r\nof `StandardError` and `IndexError`; note that it is one of the only exception\r\nclasses that does not have the word “error” in its name.) Ruby follows Python in this\r\nexternal iteration technique. By treating loop termination as an exception, it makes\r\nyour looping logic extremely simple; there is no need to check the return value of\r\n`next` for a special end-of-iteration value, and there is no need to call some kind of\r\n`next?` predicate before calling `next`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963765/is-there-a-built-in-way-to-check-if-next-or-peek-will-raise-stopiteration/57966958#57966958","title":"Is there a built-in way to check if #next or #peek will raise StopIteration?"}],"owner":{"reputation":5020,"user_id":5021321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29f10a1b457e63d44e3a221e89e32c17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eli Sadoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5021321/eli-sadoff"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57966958,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568692055,"creation_date":1568664491,"question_id":57963765,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963765","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working with a few iterators where I have to do something along these lines (`enum` is an enumerator)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nenums_with_zero &lt;&lt; enum.rewind if enum.peek == 0\r\n```\r\nwhich normally works fine, but this is after there&#39;s already been `#next` called on the enum a few times.

say, I have around 10 kernels, which I encode in an `MTLComputeCommandEncoder` and these 10 kernels, run on a set of data under consideration.\r\n\r\nI have multiple sets of these data, let&#39;s say 5, and I want to execute these 10 kernels on all the separate sets of data. And NO! I cannot combine these data sets into a single data.\r\n\r\nA naive approach would be to loop around all the data sets and execute all the 10 kernels on each data set, one after another.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m looking for is a way that I can tell `Metal`, that these are separate data sets and they can be executed in parallel. That is, instead of encoding 10 kernels, 5 times sequently, I want to run all of them concurrently on the GPU.\r\n\r\nCUDA provides `Streams` to achieve this behaviour. Is there anything similar the Metal provides?\r\n\r\nI know there exists `MTLDispatchType`, setting it to `MTLDispatchTypeConcurrent`, would mean running my 10 kernels concurrently, but that is not the requirement.\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963757/concurrent-execution-of-metal-compute-kernels","title":"Concurrent execution of metal compute

first, items, which is a list of a lists where each list counts the frequency of a term in a document\r\n\r\nThis is not actually the case; your code builds one of the intended inner lists each time through the loop, but does not put them into a list of lists. As seen here:\r\n\r\n        d = dict(currFrequencies)\r\n        items = list(d.items())\r\n        print(items) # the list is printed, but not stored. It&#39;s overwritten each time.\r\n        id_num += 1 # Nothing in the code actually uses this value!\r\n\r\nIn fact, the existing `currFrequencies` is a much more appropriate data structure for the next step, because it lets us directly answer the question, &quot;given the histogram for a specific document, and a word, how many times does the word appear?&quot;.\r\n\r\nYou should try to build a dict of these `collections.Counter` instances, mapping from the ID key (you can read this from the original HTML as well) to the Counter. Once you have that, the next step is to get the pairs of (id, count) values, something like:\r\n\r\n    def counts_in_each_paragraph(per_paragraph_counts, word):\r\n        return [\r\n            # the id and the looked-up frequency\r\n            (id, counter[word])\r\n            # of each per-paragraph Counter\r\n            for id, counter in per_paragraph_counts.items()\r\n            # that contains a (non-zero) count for the word\r\n            if word in counter\r\n        ]\r\n\r\nwhich you can then build into the final result, something like:\r\n\r\n    def full_histogram(per_paragraph_counts, overall_counts):\r\n        return {\r\n            # map the word to its overall count plus per-paragraph count pairs\r\n            word: (count, (counts_in_each_paragraph(per_paragraph_counts, word))\r\n            # across all of the overall-count data\r\n            for word, count in overall_counts.items()\r\n        }\r\n            ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963753/create-new-data-structure-by-combining-list-and-dict/57964174#57964174","title":"Create new data structure by combining list and dict"}],"owner":{"reputation":2137,"user_id":4876561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LrLr2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jerry M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4876561/jerry-m"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2137,"user_id":4876561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LrLr2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jerry M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4876561/jerry-m"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57964174,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568666663,"creation_date":1568664426,"last_edit_date":1568666013,"question_id":57963753,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963753","body_markdown":"I have two objects, the first, `items`, which is a list of a lists where each list counts the frequency of a term in a document\r\n\r\n    [(&#39;lorem&#39;, 1), (&#39;ipsum&#39;, 1), (&#39;dolor&#39;, 1), (&#39;sit&#39;, 1), (&#39;amet&#39;, 1)]\r\n    [(&#39;consectetur&#39;, 1), (&#39;adipiscing&#39;, 1), (&#39;elit&#39;, 1), (&#39;sed&#39;, 1), (&#39;eiusmod&#39;, 1), (&#39;tempor&#39;, 1), (&#39;incididunt&#39;, 1), (&#39;ut&#39;, 3), (&#39;labore&#39;, 1), (&#39;et&#39;, 1), (&#39;dolore&#39;, 1), (&#39;magna&#39;, 1), (&#39;aliqua&#39;, 1), (&#39;enim&#39;, 1), (&#39;ad&#39;, 1), (&#39;minim&#39;, 1), (&#39;veniam&#39;, 1), (&#39;quis&#39;, 1), (&#39;nostrud&#39;, 1), (&#39;exercitation&#39;, 1), (&#39;ullamco&#39;, 1), (&#39;laboris&#39;, 1), (&#39;nisi&#39;, 1), (&#39;aliquip&#39;, 1), (&#39;ex&#39;, 1), (&#39;ea&#39;, 1), (&#39;commodo&#39;, 1), (&#39;consequat&#39;, 1)]\r\n    [(&#39;duis&#39;, 1), (&#39;aute&#39;, 1), (&#39;irure&#39;, 1), (&#39;dolor&#39;, 1), (&#39;reprehenderit&#39;, 1), (&#39;voluptate&#39;, 1), (&#39;velit&#39;, 1), (&#39;esse&#39;, 1), (&#39;cillum&#39;, 1), (&#39;dolore&#39;, 1), (&#39;eu&#39;, 1), (&#39;fugiat&#39;, 1), (&#39;nulla&#39;, 1), (&#39;pariatur&#39;, 1)]\r\n    [(&#39;excepteur&#39;, 1), (&#39;sint&#39;, 1), (&#39;occaecat&#39;, 1), (&#39;cupidatat&#39;, 1), (&#39;non&#39;, 1), (&#39;proident&#39;, 1), (&#39;sunt&#39;, 1), (&#39;culpa&#39;, 1), (&#39;qui&#39;, 1), (&#39;officia&#39;, 1), (&#39;deserunt&#39;, 1), (&#39;mollit&#39;, 1), (&#39;anim&#39;, 1), (&#39;id&#39;, 1), (&#39;est&#39;, 1), (&#39;laborum&#39;, 1)]\r\n\r\nAnd the second, `document_frequency_dict`: which is a dictionary showing the total amount of documents one term shows up in\r\n\r\n    {&#39;sit&#39;: 1, &#39;amet&#39;: 1, &#39;dolor&#39;: 2, &#39;lorem&#39;: 1, &#39;ipsum&#39;: 1, &#39;nostrud&#39;: 1, &#39;tempor&#39;: 1, &#39;exercitation&#39;: 1, &#39;magna&#39;: 1, &#39;elit&#39;: 1, &#39;ut&#39;: 1, &#39;ex&#39;:\r\n    1, &#39;ad&#39;: 1, &#39;consequat&#39;: 1, &#39;incididunt&#39;: 1, &#39;sed&#39;: 1, &#39;laboris&#39;: 1, &#39;veniam&#39;: 1, &#39;et&#39;: 1, &#39;quis&#39;: 1, &#39;dolore&#39;: 2, &#39;labore&#39;: 1, &#39;minim&#39;: 1, &#39;ullamco&#39;: 1, &#39;eiusmod&#39;: 1, &#39;commodo&#39;: 1, &#39;adipiscing&#39;: 1, &#39;ea&#39;: 1, &#39;aliquip&#39;: 1, &#39;enim&#39;: 1, &#39;nisi&#39;: 1, &#39;consectetur&#39;: 1, &#39;aliqua&#39;: 1, &#39;voluptate&#39;: 1, &#39;reprehenderit&#39;: 1, &#39;eu&#39;: 1, &#39;aute&#39;: 1, &#39;cillum&#39;: 1, &#39;pariatur&#39;: 1, &#39;nulla&#39;: 1, &#39;duis&#39;: 1, &#39;velit&#39;: 1, &#39;fugiat&#39;: 1, &#39;irure&#39;: 1, &#39;esse&#39;: 1, &#39;proident&#39;: 1, &#39;sint&#39;: 1, &#39;officia&#39;: 1, &#39;sunt&#39;: 1, &#39;qui&#39;: 1, &#39;deserunt&#39;: 1, &#39;laborum&#39;: 1, &#39;excepteur&#39;: 1, &#39;anim&#39;: 1, &#39;cupidatat&#39;: 1, &#39;culpa&#39;: 1, &#39;id&#39;: 1, &#39;non&#39;: 1, &#39;mollit&#39;: 1, &#39;occaecat&#39;: 1, &#39;est&#39;: 1}\r\n\r\nI need to combine these two items into one dictionary with the following shape:\r\n`word: document_frequency, ((document_id, occurences in that document), (document_id, occurences in that document)), word: etc..`\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that `document_id` derives from the &lt;P ID=x&gt;&lt;/P&gt; tags in the input file, which will always exist.

The answers linked in the comments can help you with this further. However, since you are only concerned with the values, I would recommend to copy via an array.\r\n\r\n    Private Sub CopyValues(ByVal sourceRange As Excel.Range, ByVal targetRange As Excel.Range)\r\n        Dim copyArray as Variant\r\n        copyArray = sourceRange.Value\r\n        targetRange.Value = copyArray\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nTo get the name for the target sheet, you can use the VBA [atring functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/functions/string-functions); in particular `InstrRev` `Right` and `Split` could be usefult. I will leave it to you to figure out a way to define a function `Private Function TargetSheetName(ByVal sourceWorkbookName As String)`.\r\n\r\nUsing this information, you do the following.\r\n\r\n    Private Sub CopyFirstSheet(ByVal sourceWorkbook As Excel.Workbook, ByVal targetWorkbook As Excel.Workbook)\r\n        Dim sourceRange As Excel.Range\r\n        Set sourceRange = CopyRange(sourceWorkbook.Worksheets(1)\r\n        Dim targetSheetName As String\r\n        targetSheetName = TargetSheetName(targetWorkbook.Name)\r\n        Dim targetRange As Excel.Range\r\n        Set targetRange = targetWorkbook.Worksheets(targetSheetName).Range(&quot;A2&quot;)\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nHere `Private Function CopyRange(ByVal sourceWorksheet As Excle.WorkSheet) As Excel.Range` is a function describing how you determine the copy range given the source worksheet.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is the problem of finding the source workbooks. In the comments, it was suggested to use `Dir`. However, I would like to suggest a more readable approach. Unless you work on a Mac, you can refernce the library _Microsoft Scripting Runtime` under Tools-&gt;Refreences. This gives you access to the [Scripting.FileSystemObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/filesystemobject-object). You can use it as follows.\r\n\r\n    Private Sub CopyFromFolder(ByVal sourcePath As String, ByVal targetWorkbook As Excel.Workbook)\r\n        Dim fso As Scripting.FileSystemObject\r\n        Set fso = New Scripting.FileSystemObject\r\n        Dim file As Scripting.File\r\n        For Each file in fso.GetFolder(path).Files\r\n            Dim sourceWorkbook As Excel.Workbook\r\n            Set sourceWorkbook = Application.Workbooks.Open path &amp; file.Name\r\n            CopyFirstSheet sourceWorkbook, targetWorkbook \r\n            sourceWorkbook.Close SaveChanges:=False\r\n        Next\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nThis assumes that only the three workbooks are in the folder. Otherwise, some more logic will be required.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of help regarding the specific problem and in general on how to split such a problem into smaller problem that can be dealt with in separate procedures or functions.

From your reputation, you are probably a newbie and are just throwing out a bunch of technical terms you have heard without actually knowing what they are. Let me try to give you a quick tutorial, and then perhaps you will be able to better ask your question.\r\n\r\n**What Is the Singleton Pattern?**\r\nThe Singleton Pattern is a software design pattern that guarantees a class has one instance only and a global point of access to it is provided by that class. Anytime multiple classes or clients request for that class, they get the same instance of the class. This Singleton class may be responsible for instantiating itself, or you can delegate the object creation to a factory class.  \r\n\r\nSimple example using one of your classes\r\n\r\n    public class PaymentRepository {\r\n     \r\n        private static PaymentRepository INSTANCE = null;\r\n     \r\n        // other instance variables can be here\r\n         \r\n        private PaymentRepository() {};\r\n     \r\n        public static PaymentRepository getInstance() {\r\n            if (INSTANCE == null) {\r\n                INSTANCE = new PaymentRepository();\r\n            }\r\n            return(INSTANCE);\r\n        }\r\n         \r\n        // other instance methods can follow \r\n    }\r\n\r\nA couple notes, notice that the constructor is non-static and private, while the getInstance() method is static and public.\r\n\r\nRegarding Strategy pattern, this is used when a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at runtime.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**What Is the Strategy Pattern?**\r\nIn Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.\r\n\r\nStart by creating an interface\r\n\r\n    public interface OperationStrategy {\r\n       public int doOperation(int num1, int num2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nCreate concrete classes implementing that interface\r\n\r\n    public class OperationAddition implements OperationStrategy {\r\n       @Override\r\n       public int doOperation(int num1, int num2) {\r\n          return num1 + num2;\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nCreate Context class\r\n\r\n    public class Context {\r\n       private OperationStrategy strategy;\r\n    \r\n       public Context(OperationStrategy strategy){\r\n          this.strategy = strategy;\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       public int executeStrategy(int num1, int num2){\r\n          return strategy.doOperation(num1, num2);\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUse the Context to see change in behaviour when it changes its Strategy.\r\n\r\n    public class StrategyPatternDemo {\r\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n          Context context = new Context(new OperationAddition());\t\t\r\n          System.out.println(&quot;10 + 5 = &quot; + context.executeStrategy(10, 5));\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963707/singleton-using-strategy-design-pattern-android/57965189#57965189","title":"Singleton using Strategy Design Pattern - Android"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":5304620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PfICl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amir Raza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5304620/amir-raza"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":5304620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PfICl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amir Raza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5304620/amir-raza"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":8,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-8,"last_activity_date":1568715432,"creation_date":1568664195,"last_edit_date":1568715432,"question_id":57963707,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963707","body_markdown":"For instance,\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass AuthRepository\r\nclass SettingRepository\r\nclass PaymentRepository\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I create singleton of these classes using **Strategy Design Pattern?**\r\n\r\nI want to create instance (singleton) of a class at runtime having same family.\r\n\r\nP.S.

It works good when I deserialize `LocationOne` or `LocationTwo`.\r\n\r\nThis is the code I have written:\r\n\r\n    @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, \r\n            property = &quot;type&quot;, visible = true)\r\n    @JsonSubTypes(\r\n            JsonSubTypes.Type(value = LocationOne::class, name = &quot;ONE&quot;),\r\n            JsonSubTypes.Type(value = LocationTwo::class, name = &quot;TWO&quot;),\r\n            JsonSubTypes.Type(value = LocationGeneric::class, name = &quot;GENERIC_1&quot;),\r\n            JsonSubTypes.Type(value = LocationGeneric::class, name = &quot;GENERIC_2&quot;)\r\n    )\r\n    abstract class Location(\r\n            val type: String\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    class LocationGeneric(\r\n            type: String\r\n    ): Location(type)\r\n    \r\n    class LocationOne(\r\n            type: String,\r\n            val somethingSpecific: String\r\n    ): Location(type)\r\n    \r\n    class LocationAirport(\r\n            type: String,\r\n            val somethingElse: String\r\n    ): Location(type)\r\n\r\nThis is the error I am getting:\r\n\r\n&gt; Cannot construct instance of `Location` (although at least one Creator\r\n&gt; exists): cannot deserialize from Object value (no delegate- or\r\n&gt; property-based Creator)\r\n\r\nI tried changing the abstract class to an open class, but had no luck so far. I works for the other cases. Why doesn&#39;t it find the default Kotlin constructor in the `LocationGeneric` case? Any ideas?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963693/cannot-construct-instance-of-class-although-at-least-one-creator-exists","title":"Cannot construct instance of class although at

Since 6 and 21 are divisible by 3 (the greatest common divisor of 6 and 21), it is necessary that x is divisible by 3. Moreover, if x is less than 21, then it is necessary that x is divisible by 6.\r\n\r\nConversely, if x is divisible by 6, we can set a = x/6 and b = 0. If x is an odd multiple of 3, then x - 21 is divisible by 6; if x is at least 21, we can set a = (x - 21)/6 and b = 1.

He uses boxes with space for 6 bottles, 12 bottles, 18 bottles and 21 bottles. But he only wants to accept orders which fit exactly into these boxes. There must not be any empty space inside.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n - 33 is ok: 1x21 and 2x6\r\n - 48 is ok: 2x21 and 1x6 or 4x12\r\n - 26 or 35 or 61 are not ok\r\n\r\nFor my first try was an straight simple way. I produce an array containing a lot of valid numbers, remove duplicates and order them. \r\n\r\n    $numbers = [];\r\n    $end = (int) $bottles/6 + 1;\r\n    for ($i=1; $i&lt;=$end; $i++) {      \r\n      $numbers[] = $i * 6;\r\n      $numbers[] = $i * 21;\r\n      $numbers[] = $i * 21 + 6;\r\n      $numbers[] = $i * 21 + 6 + 6;\r\n      $numbers[] = $i * 21 + 6 + 6 + 6;\r\n    }\r\n    $numbers = array_unique($numbers);\r\n    sort($numbers);\r\n\r\nIt looks like this:\r\n\r\n    Array\r\n    (\r\n        [0] =&gt; 6\r\n        [1] =&gt; 12\r\n        [2] =&gt; 18\r\n        [3] =&gt; 21\r\n        [4] =&gt; 24\r\n        [5] =&gt; 27\r\n        [6] =&gt; 30\r\n        [7] =&gt; 33\r\n        [8] =&gt; 36\r\n        [9] =&gt; 39\r\n        [10] =&gt; 42\r\n        [11] =&gt; 48\r\n        [12] =&gt; 54\r\n        [13] =&gt; 60\r\n        [14] =&gt; 63\r\n        ....\r\n\r\nI can check against my list. ok, fine!\r\n\r\nBut I want to make a &quot;perfekt&quot; solution fitting for all possible numbers, e.g. I want to know if 123456 is possible. You see, that the array must be very huge for getting this :-)\r\n\r\nI tried an equation with 2 unknowns. Why only 2? Because 18 and 12 can be divided by 6. So my approch was:\r\n\r\n    bottles = 6a + 21b\r\n\r\n&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; must be integer values and may contain zero. &quot;bottles&quot; is an integer value, too. I transformed it to:\r\n\r\n     bottles / 6 - 3,5b = a\r\n\r\nBut this doesn&#39;t help me to make a good algorithm... I think I&#39;m on the right way, but how can I solve this quite elegant?

The rest work fine.\r\n\r\nIf I just do a `SELECT * FROM `customers` WHERE id = 0` in MySQL it returns just fine.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/LvhnX.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963680/does-php-7-1-consider-0-to-be-undefined","title":"Does PHP 7.1 consider 0 to be Undefined?"},{"tags":["c","if-statement"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":48585,"user_id":10077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be4e820c7af6f3b79cf055d984cda7ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Fred Larson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10077/fred-larson"},"edited":false,"score":8,"creation_date":1568664172,"post_id":57963679,"comment_id":102338440,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963679/is-my-negation-of-this-if-statement-correct#comment102338440_57963679"},{"owner":{"reputation":7123,"user_id":2293156,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/800e791e8e13500e516c9ae77299160a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amadeus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2293156/amadeus"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3916,"user_id":2706707,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BoAxS.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"D&#250;thomhas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2706707/d%c3%bathomhas"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1568664381,"post_id":57963679,"comment_id":102338524,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963679/is-my-negation-of-this-if-statement-correct#comment102338524_57963679"},{"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":3369599,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/olfoW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Silasvb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3369599/silasvb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568664698,"post_id":57963679,"comment_id":102338637,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963679/is-my-negation-of-this-if-statement-correct#comment102338637_57963679"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568665679,"last_edit_date":1568665679,"creation_date":1568664320,"answer_id":57963734,"question_id":57963679,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57963734","body_markdown":"This will work.

The only downside is that you&#39;d have to add debugging code to all of your existing components (which also works less well if they&#39;re third-party code). But if you know that the offending code is part of your codebase, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to wrap each pipeline component in a function that logs the timestamp and whatever else you need and returns `pipe(doc)`. You can then overwrite `nlp.pipeline` with those wrapped components:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef wrap_pipe(name, pipe):\r\n    def wrapped(doc):\r\n        print(f&quot;Started &#39;{name}&#39;&quot;, datetime.datetime.now())\r\n        return pipe(doc)\r\n    return wrapped\r\n\r\ndef debug_wrap_pipeline(nlp):\r\n    nlp.pipeline = [(name, wrap_pipe(name, pipe)) for name, pipe in nlp.pipeline]\r\n    return nlp\r\n\r\ndebug_nlp = debug_wrap_pipeline(nlp)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the downside here is that you&#39;d also need to wrap each component&#39;s `.pipe` method (if available) so you can run and debug `nlp.pipe` under the same conditions. If you&#39;re benchmarking, you often want to do this at a larger scale and process a stream of texts with `nlp.pipe`.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, a slightly more verbose option could be to add a &quot;debug component&quot; before each existing component in the pipeline. Basically, something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef make_debug_component(name):\r\n    def debug_component(doc):\r\n        print(f&quot;Before &#39;{name}&#39;&quot;, datetime.datetime.now())\r\n        return doc\r\n    return debug_component\r\n\r\ndef debug_wrap_pipeline(nlp):\r\n    pipeline = list(nlp.pipeline)  # we don&#39;t want to modify this while we&#39;re looping over it\r\n    for name, pipe in pipeline:\r\n        debug_component = make_debug_component(name)\r\n        nlp.add_pipe(debug_component, before=name, name=f&quot;debug_{name}&quot;)\r\n    return nlp\r\n```\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I only just hacked those ideas together and haven&#39;t tested them extensively yet. But they did seem to work. If you end up exploring this, I&#39;d be very curious to hear what worked best. It might also be a feature that spaCy could ship with out-of-the-box, and it&#39;d pair well with the proposed [static analysis for pipeline components](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/3943).\r\n\r\nAlso, just to add for completeness: When debugging text processing pipelines like this, always benchmark things on a larger scale with a single corpus that you process *once* (rather than looping over a single example 1000 times or something like that). There are caching effects (both within spaCy, but also the CPU), differences in memory allocation and so on that can all have an impact and make the small-scale tests less reliable. Of course, in a scenario like this where you&#39;re experiencing drastic differences, even processing a single text can probably give you enough clues and everything you need to debug your code further.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963657/what-is-the-best-way-to-benchmark-custom-components-in-a-spacy-pipeline/57964354#57964354","title":"What is the best way to benchmark custom components in a spaCy pipeline?"}],"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":4351612,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6e1c8ab4f5545ecd003904d0760749d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tw0000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4351612/tw0000"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57964354,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568667602,"creation_date":1568663963,"question_id":57963657,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963657","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve recently refactored some of the components in my spaCy pipeline, and as a result, the pipeline runs 7x slower than it did previous to the refactor.

first layer : conv1 = Conv2D(8, 4, padding = &quot;same&quot;, strides = 2, ***input_shape = (6,8,8,)***)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut that didnt work so instead you have to delete the input shape thing and create an input layer here is the fixed code\r\n\r\n\r\n    inputs = Input(shape=(6,8,8,))\r\n    conv1 = Conv2D(8, 4, padding = &quot;same&quot;, strides = 2, input_shape = (6,8,8,))\r\n    conv2 = Conv2D(16 ,4, padding = &quot;same&quot;, strides = 2)(conv1)\r\n    flat = Flatten()(conv2)\r\n    dense1 = Dense(32)(flat)\r\n\r\n    dense2 = Dense(32)(dense1)\r\n    first_output = Dense(64)(dense2)\r\n    merged = concatenate([flat,first_output])\r\n    second_output_dense1 = Dense(32)(merged)\r\n    second_output_dense2 = Dense(32)(second_output_dense1)\r\n    second_output =

&quot;common table expression&quot; or CTE) prevents your query from running the same sub-query multiple times. Since there&#39;s nothing to `JOIN` with, I didn&#39;t do one, but you can `JOIN` on a CTE just like any other table, view, etc.\r\n\r\nFurther readin on CTEs:  \r\nhttps://www.essentialsql.com/introduction-common-table-expressions-ctes/  \r\nand  \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/4740748/when-to-use-common-table-expression-cte\r\n\r\nIt queries the `Orders` table based on the &quot;largest&quot; `Date`, gets the data from 3 columns of that row, and sums the values of a 4th column based on the same criteria as the outer query.\r\n\r\n*In my example, the data is just there for an example and doesn&#39;t mean anything useful. &lt;s&gt;Also, I simplified the date selection, since the data I used didn&#39;t actually include a `Date` column.&lt;/s&gt; Turns out, it is a `Date` column.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963646/querying-data-with-different-conditions-on-multiple-columns/57964261#57964261","title":"Querying data with different conditions on multiple columns"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":11079738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kk4Ezy96TuE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNzSp13F_Opd9h585wKNPpm3zz50Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"chawky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11079738/chawky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568669685,"post_id":57964610,"comment_id":102340321,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963646/querying-data-with-different-conditions-on-multiple-columns/57964610#comment102340321_57964610"},{"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":11079738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kk4Ezy96TuE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNzSp13F_Opd9h585wKNPpm3zz50Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"chawky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11079738/chawky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568669869,"post_id":57964610,"comment_id":102340384,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963646/querying-data-with-different-conditions-on-multiple-columns/57964610#comment102340384_57964610"},{"owner":{"reputation":991,"user_id":11914761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57d7b6b8760a0c295890d89842626278?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Neeraj Agarwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11914761/neeraj-agarwal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":31,"user_id":11079738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kk4Ezy96TuE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNzSp13F_Opd9h585wKNPpm3zz50Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"chawky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11079738/chawky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568671448,"post_id":57964610,"comment_id":102340748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963646/querying-data-with-different-conditions-on-multiple-columns/57964610#comment102340748_57964610"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":991,"user_id":11914761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57d7b6b8760a0c295890d89842626278?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Neeraj Agarwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11914761/neeraj-agarwal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":991,"user_id":11914761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57d7b6b8760a0c295890d89842626278?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Neeraj Agarwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11914761/neeraj-agarwal"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568671257,"last_edit_date":1568671257,"creation_date":1568669140,"answer_id":57964610,"question_id":57963646,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57964610","body_markdown":"This checks for last month.

\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s how I want the the result:\r\n\r\n    date       | X | Y | Z  \r\n    -----------+---+---+---  \r\n    2019-08-01 | 8 | 8 | 14

One example would be for enumerations. They can be stored as Integers or Strings. Things like `HasDefaultValueSql(&quot;(getdate())&quot;);` isn&#39;t needed if the database is already set up for default. Column types for Db First will default based on their time. If you&#39;re using Code-First you will want to tell EF how big a string column should be, and whether it should store Unicode or ASCII, but for Db First it just cares that the two data types are compatible. (C# object &amp; database)\r\n\r\nThat said, most properties on the entity don&#39;t need any attributes. EF can infer them and ensure they are compatible. The only attributes I use somewhat regularly in the entity are Property Name for cases where I want a more descriptive name in my entity, and property type in the few cases I need explicit casting. For PKs you will want to leverage DatabaseGeneratedOption for Identity (or defaulting) columns. I use `[TableName]` where my tables may not follow EF&#39;s default naming convention expectations. Basically I default to adding no explicit column configuration at all (other than for the PK and navigation properties), then add only what is needed. I&#39;ve seen a few projects that used Db First where every property in every entity is mapped out.  IMO it may be thorough, but a bit excessive.\r\n\r\nAttributes or config won&#39;t hurt. About the only thing you need to worry about ensuring EF doesn&#39;t perform a migration or attempt to initialize a DB. With EF6 you had to explicitly turn this off via `Database.SetInitializer&lt;TDbContext&gt;(null)`; At least with EF Core you don&#39;t need to worry about it since you have to explicitly call it.

If the client will never perform any migrations is it a right thing to ignore that attribute and not specify it at all?

Notice that the the original string must be passed explicitly to the function.  (There is no automatic context in which it gets the original string.)  Secondly, if you want to ensure the original string matches a particular pattern, for example that you don&#39;t make the replacement in some other possible match, you need a WHERE clause to limit the selection.  Just like the original string parameter, there is no automatic condition applied based on the parameters... you must use the WHERE clause to properly limit the update:\r\n\r\n    UPDATE tv_shows \r\n    SET location = replace(location, &#39;/media/tv&#39;, &#39;/media/TV/tv&#39;)\r\n    WHERE location LIKE &#39;/media/tv%&#39;\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Note*:  Since a failed match for `replace()` returns the original string there may be no apparent negative side effects of just executing this for every row, especially if you expect that the only matches will occur at the beginning of the path string.  However, it is always best to include a proper WHERE clause to make the command more efficient (only updating what is necessary) and limiting the negative effect of buggy code (no need to corrupt every row in the table if you get the expression wrong, at least it would only be limited to a subset).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963636/trying-to-change-partial-value-in-a-field-in-sqlite-databse/57963993#57963993","title":"Trying to change partial value in a field in sqlite databse"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":2059446,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hxdbl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"b0red","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2059446/b0red"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57963993,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568666151,"creation_date":1568663876,"question_id":57963636,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963636","body_markdown":"\r\nI need to update parts of a value in a rather large sickbeard.db. \r\nA line in the db looks lite this:\r\n\r\n    &quot;66&quot;\t&quot;305288&quot;\t&quot;1&quot;\t&quot;Stranger Things&quot;\t&quot;/media/tv1/Stranger Thins&quot;\t&quot;Netflix&quot;\t&quot;|Adventure|Drama|Fantasy|Horror|Mystery|&quot;\t&quot;Scripted&quot;\t&quot;50&quot;\t&quot;3&quot;\t&quot;Friday 3:00 AM&quot;\t&quot;Continuing&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t&quot;2016&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t&quot;en&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t\t&quot;tt4574334&quot;\t&quot;737297&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t\t&quot;&quot;\t&quot;&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t&quot;0&quot;\t&quot;3&quot;\t\r\n\r\nIn the location field the data I need to change is &quot;/media/tv1/Some tv show&quot; but I need to change it to &quot;/media/**TV**/tv1/Some tv show&quot;.

mMessageList;\r\n\r\n    public MessageListAdapter(Activity context, ArrayList&lt;Message&gt; messageList) {\r\n        mContext = context;\r\n        mMessageList = messageList;\r\n}\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int getItemCount() {\r\n        return mMessageList.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Determines the appropriate ViewType according to the sender of the message.\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int getItemViewType(int position) {\r\n        Message message = (Message) mMessageList.get(position);\r\n\r\n        if (message.isOther() == &quot;2&quot;) {\r\n            // If the current user is the sender of the message\r\n            return VIEW_TYPE_MESSAGE_SENT;\r\n        } else {\r\n            // If some other user sent the message\r\n            return VIEW_TYPE_MESSAGE_RECEIVED;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Inflates the appropriate layout according to the ViewType.\r\n    @Override\r\n    public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\r\n        View view;\r\n\r\n        if (viewType == VIEW_TYPE_MESSAGE_SENT) {\r\n            view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())\r\n                    .inflate(R.layout.item_message_sent, parent, false);\r\n            return new SentMessageHolder(view);\r\n        } else if (viewType == VIEW_TYPE_MESSAGE_RECEIVED) {\r\n            view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())\r\n                    .inflate(R.layout.item_message_received, parent, false);\r\n            return new ReceivedMessageHolder(view);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Passes the message object to a ViewHolder so that the contents can be bound to UI.\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder, int position) {\r\n        Message message = mMessageList.get(position);\r\n\r\n        switch (holder.getItemViewType()) {\r\n            case VIEW_TYPE_MESSAGE_SENT:\r\n                ((SentMessageHolder) holder).bind(message);\r\n                break;\r\n            case VIEW_TYPE_MESSAGE_RECEIVED:\r\n                ((ReceivedMessageHolder) holder).bind(message);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private class SentMessageHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\r\n        TextView messageText, timeText;\r\n\r\n        SentMessageHolder(View itemView) {\r\n            super(itemView);\r\n\r\n            messageText = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.text_message_body);\r\n            timeText = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.text_message_time);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        void bind(Message message) {\r\n            messageText.setText(message.getMessage());\r\n\r\n            // Format the stored timestamp into a readable String using method.\r\n            timeText.setText(message.getCreatedAt());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private class ReceivedMessageHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\r\n        TextView messageText, timeText, nameText;\r\n        ImageView profileImage;\r\n\r\n        ReceivedMessageHolder(View itemView) {\r\n            super(itemView);\r\n\r\n            messageText = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.text_message_body);\r\n            timeText = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.text_message_time);\r\n            nameText = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.text_message_name);\r\n            profileImage = (ImageView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.image_message_profile);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        void bind(Message message) {\r\n            messageText.setText(message.getMessage());\r\n\r\n            // Format the stored timestamp into a readable String using method.\r\n            timeText.setText(message.getCreatedAt());\r\n\r\n            nameText.setText(message.getSender());\r\n\r\n            Picasso.get().load(message.getProfile())\r\n                    .transform(new RoundedCornersTransformation(150, 0)).into(profileImage);\r\n            // Insert the profile image from the URL into the ImageView.\r\n//            Utils.displayRoundImageFromUrl(mContext, message.getSender().getProfileUrl(), profileImage);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\nI create the adapter and pair it to the recyclerview in a background worker during postExecute()\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n\r\n        JSONArray messages = new JSONArray(s);\r\n        ArrayList&lt;Message&gt; messageList = new ArrayList&lt;Message&gt;();\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; messages.length(); i++) {\r\n            String currentMessage = (String) messages.get(i);\r\n            String[] fields = currentMessage.split(&quot;,&quot;, 0);\r\n\r\n            if (fields.length == 5) {\r\n                String isOther = fields[0];\r\n                String messageText = fields[1];\r\n                String dateTime = fields[2];\r\n                String author = fields[3];\r\n                String pictureLocation = fields[4];\r\n                Message newMessage = new Message(isOther, messageText, dateTime, author, pictureLocation);\r\n                messageList.add(newMessage);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        mMessageRecycler = (RecyclerView) ha.findViewById(R.id.reyclerview_message_list);\r\n        mMessageRecycler.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(ha.getApplicationContext()));\r\n\r\n        mMessageAdapter = new MessageListAdapter(ha, messageList);\r\n\r\n        mMessageRecycler.setAdapter(mMessageAdapter);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried adding alert dialogs to debug within the OnCreateViewHolder, but can&#39;t get them to appear. I&#39;ve tried using ha, ha.getApplicationContext() on every field. There must be something that&#39;s just staring me in the face. I&#39;ve used this pattern before and it works for another section of my app.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963631/trouble-getting-recyclerview-to-load-elements","title":"Trouble getting recyclerview to load elements"},{"tags":["azure-devops","synchronization","tfs-workitem","ticket-system"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":75295,"user_id":736079,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujKFa.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jessehouwing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/736079/jessehouwing"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568668599,"post_id":57963629,"comment_id":102340000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963629/connectwise-tfs-synchronization#comment102340000_57963629"},{"owner":{"reputation":514,"user_id":208272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/935dac22d86889f008a58ad355b43bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/208272/alexander"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":75295,"user_id":736079,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujKFa.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jessehouwing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/736079/jessehouwing"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568822702,"post_id":57963629,"comment_id":102400150,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963629/connectwise-tfs-synchronization#comment102400150_57963629"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":514,"user_id":208272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/935dac22d86889f008a58ad355b43bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/208272/alexander"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568703849,"post_id":57967935,"comment_id":102348115,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963629/connectwise-tfs-synchronization/57967935#comment102348115_57967935"},{"owner":{"reputation":2478,"user_id":11508192,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/irXPM.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hugh Lin - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11508192/hugh-lin-msft"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":514,"user_id":208272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/935dac22d86889f008a58ad355b43bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/208272/alexander"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569203264,"post_id":57967935,"comment_id":102507281,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963629/connectwise-tfs-synchronization/57967935#comment102507281_57967935"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2478,"user_id":11508192,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/irXPM.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hugh Lin - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11508192/hugh-lin-msft"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2478,"user_id":11508192,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/irXPM.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hugh Lin - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11508192/hugh-lin-msft"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569203356,"last_edit_date":1569203356,"creation_date":1568698781,"answer_id":57967935,"question_id":57963629,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57967935","body_markdown":"I found a way to integrate Azure devops with ConnectWise Manage.
