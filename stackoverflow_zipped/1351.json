On the other hand, we all know that in a ANN model weights are learnt in such a way that less important features produce very less responses and prominent/interesting features contributing towards decision produce high responses. Now you can understand that our subtracted features vector is just in the opposite direction because when two examples are from different class then they produce high responses and opposite for examples from same class. Furthermore with a single node in the output layer (no additional hidden layer before output layer) its quite difficult to learn for model to generate high response from zero values when two samples are of same class. This might be an important point to solve your problem.\r\n\r\nBased on the above discussion, you may want to try following ideas:\r\n\r\n - transforming subtracted feature vector to ensure when there is similarity you get high responses, may be by doing subtraction from 1 or reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) followed by normalization.\r\n - Adding more Dense layer before output layer.\r\n\r\nI wont be surprised if convolutional neural net instead of stacked Dense layer for feature extraction (as you are thinking) does not improve your accuracy much as it&#39;s just another way of doing the same (feature extraction).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220747/siamese-network-lower-part-uses-a-dense-layer-instead-of-a-euclidean-distance-l/58222947#58222947","title":"Siamese network, lower part uses a dense layer instead of a euclidean distance layer"}],"owner":{"reputation":164,"user_id":1745048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efc27c2c05875b8112d940a84f4ca4b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bookmonkie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1745048/bookmonkie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":164,"user_id":1745048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efc27c2c05875b8112d940a84f4ca4b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bookmonkie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1745048/bookmonkie"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58222947,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570121150,"creation_date":1570111096,"last_edit_date":1570112646,"question_id":58220747,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58220747","body_markdown":"This is a rather interesting question for Siamese network\r\n\r\nI am following the example from https://keras.io/examples/mnist_siamese/.\r\nMy modified version of the code is in this [google colab](   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15wVnKzyQwWUD8xIpAstGx8N1ySnnmRvM)\r\n\r\nThe siamese network takes in 2 inputs (2 handwritten digits) and output whether they are of the same digit (1) or not (0). \r\n\r\nEach of the two inputs are first processed by a shared base_network (3 Dense layers with 2 Dropout layers in between). The input_a is extracted into processed_a, input_b into processed_b.\r\n\r\nThe last layer of the siamese network is an euclidean distance layer between the two extracted tensors:\r\n```\r\ndistance = Lambda(euclidean_distance,\r\n                  output_shape=eucl_dist_output_shape)([processed_a, processed_b])\r\n\r\nmodel = Model([input_a, input_b], distance)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**I understand the reasoning behind using an euclidean distance layer for the lower part of the network: if the features are extracted nicely, then similar inputs should have similar features.** \r\n\r\nI am thinking, why not use a normal Dense layer for the lower part, as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# distance = Lambda(euclidean_distance,\r\n#                   output_shape=eucl_dist_output_shape)([processed_a, processed_b])\r\n\r\n# model = Model([input_a, input_b], distance)\r\n\r\n#my model\r\nsubtracted = Subtract()([processed_a, processed_b])\r\nout = Dense(1, activation=&quot;sigmoid&quot;)(subtracted)\r\nmodel = Model([input_a,input_b], out)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**My reasoning is that if the extracted features are similar, then the Subtract layer should produce a small tensor, as the difference between the extracted features. The next layer, Dense layer, can learn that if the input is small, output 1, otherwise 0**.\r\n\r\nBecause the euclidean distance layer outputs close to 0 value when two inputs are similar and 1 otherwise, I also need to invert the accuracy and loss function, as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# the version of loss and accuracy for Euclidean distance layer\r\n# def contrastive_loss(y_true, y_pred):\r\n#     &#39;&#39;&#39;Contrastive loss from Hadsell-et-al.&#39;06\r\n#     http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/hadsell-chopra-lecun-06.pdf\r\n#     &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n#     margin = 1\r\n#     square_pred = K.square(y_pred)\r\n#     margin_square = K.square(K.maximum(margin - y_pred, 0))\r\n#     return K.mean(y_true * square_pred + (1 - y_true) * margin_square)\r\n\r\n# def compute_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):\r\n#     &#39;&#39;&#39;Compute classification accuracy with a fixed threshold on distances.\r\n#     &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n#     pred = y_pred.ravel() &lt; 0.5\r\n#     return np.mean(pred == y_true)\r\n\r\n# def accuracy(y_true, y_pred):\r\n#     &#39;&#39;&#39;Compute classification accuracy with a fixed threshold on distances.\r\n#     &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n#     return K.mean(K.equal(y_true, K.cast(y_pred &lt; 0.5, y_true.dtype)))\r\n\r\n### my version, loss and accuracy\r\ndef contrastive_loss(y_true, y_pred):\r\n  margin = 1\r\n  square_pred = K.square(y_pred)\r\n  margin_square = K.square(K.maximum(margin - y_pred, 0))\r\n#   return K.mean(y_true * square_pred + (1-y_true) * margin_square)\r\n  return K.mean(y_true * margin_square + (1-y_true) * square_pred)\r\n\r\ndef compute_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):\r\n  &#39;&#39;&#39;Compute classification accuracy with a fixed threshold on distances.\r\n  &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n  pred = y_pred.ravel() &gt; 0.5\r\n  return np.mean(pred == y_true)\r\n\r\ndef accuracy(y_true, y_pred):\r\n  &#39;&#39;&#39;Compute classification accuracy with a fixed threshold on distances.\r\n  &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n  return K.mean(K.equal(y_true, K.cast(y_pred &gt; 0.5, y_true.dtype)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe accuracy for the old model:\r\n* Accuracy on training set: 99.55%\r\n* Accuracy on test set: 97.42%\r\nThis slight change leads to a model that not learning anything:\r\n* Accuracy on training set: 48.64%\r\n* Accuracy on test set: 48.29%\r\n\r\n**So my question is:** \r\n\r\n**1. What is wrong with my reasoning of using Substract + Dense for the lower part of the Siamese network?** \r\n\r\n**2. Can we fix this?** I have two potential solution in mind but I am not confident, (1) convoluted neural net for feature extraction (2) more dense layers for the lower part of the siamese network. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220747/siamese-network-lower-part-uses-a-dense-layer-instead-of-a-euclidean-distance-l","title":"Siamese network, lower part uses a dense layer instead of a euclidean distance layer"},{"tags":["angular"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":627,"user_id":4925564,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6QYN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rinktacular","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4925564/rinktacular"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570111229,"post_id":58220744,"comment_id":102817331,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220744/fill-cell-in-mat-table-with-ngfor-and-number#comment102817331_58220744"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12159502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c69cb068df2eb61a1990e2554100a099?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12159502/paul"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":627,"user_id":4925564,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6QYN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rinktacular","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4925564/rinktacular"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570116832,"post_id":58220744,"comment_id":102820405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220744/fill-cell-in-mat-table-with-ngfor-and-number#comment102820405_58220744"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12159502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c69cb068df2eb61a1990e2554100a099?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12159502/paul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570116731,"post_id":58221503,"comment_id":102820354,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220744/fill-cell-in-mat-table-with-ngfor-and-number/58221503#comment102820354_58221503"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1664,"user_id":10036039,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6525d104fc1903b759afa7a7ff40cf22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zerocewl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10036039/zerocewl"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1664,"user_id":10036039,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6525d104fc1903b759afa7a7ff40cf22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zerocewl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10036039/zerocewl"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570177753,"last_edit_date":1570177753,"creation_date":1570113640,"answer_id":58221503,"question_id":58220744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58221503","body_markdown":"If element.score is an array you can just iterate over the elements:\r\n\r\n    &lt;span *ngFor=&quot;let item of element.score; index as i;&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;mat-icon&gt;star&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\r\n    &lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nIf you have only a number you can create your array in the component\r\n\r\n      public createArray(length: number): number[]\r\n        return Array(length).fill(0); // [0,0,0]\r\n      }\r\n\r\nand use this array in your template:\r\n\r\n    &lt;span *ngFor=&quot;let item of createArray(element.score)&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;mat-icon&gt;star&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\r\n    &lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also: [Angular Api for NgFor][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220744/fill-cell-in-mat-table-with-ngfor-and-number/58221503#58221503","title":"fill cell in mat-table with ngfor and number"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12159502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c69cb068df2eb61a1990e2554100a099?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12159502/paul"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570182493,"creation_date":1570111089,"question_id":58220744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58220744","body_markdown":"I have a problem to fill a cell.

HTML, you do superscripts using things like `&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;`, and subscripts using `&lt;sub&gt;-3&lt;/sub&gt;`.  However, if you put these into a cell in your table, you&#39;ll see the full text displayed, it won&#39;t be interpreted as HTML, because `flextable` escapes the angle brackets.\r\n\r\nThe `kable()` function has an argument `escape = FALSE` that can turn this off, but `flextable` doesn&#39;t:  see https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable/issues/156.  However, there&#39;s a hackish way to get around this limitation:  replace the `htmlEscape()` function with a function that does nothing.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n    ```{r}\r\n    library(flextable)\r\n    env &lt;- parent.env(loadNamespace(&quot;flextable&quot;)) # The imports\r\n    unlockBinding(&quot;htmlEscape&quot;, env)\r\n    assign(&quot;htmlEscape&quot;, function(text, attribute = FALSE) text, envir=env)\r\n    lockBinding(&quot;htmlEscape&quot;, env)\r\n    bab = data.frame(x = &quot;10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;)\r\n    flextable(bab)\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\nThis will display the table as\r\n\r\n[![screenshot][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nBe careful if you do this:  there may be cases in your real tables where you really do want HTML escapes, and this code will disable that for the rest of the document.  If you execute this code in an R session, it will disable escaping for the rest of the session.\r\n\r\nAnd if you were thinking of using a document like this in a package you submit to CRAN, forget it.  You shouldn&#39;t be messing with bindings like this in code that you expect other people to use.\r\n\r\n**Edited to add:**\r\n\r\nIn fact, there&#39;s a way to do this without the hack given above.  It&#39;s described in this article:  https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/articles/display.html#sugar-functions-for-complex-formatting.  The idea is to replace the entries that need superscripts or subscripts with calls to `as_paragraph`, `as_sup`, `as_sub`, etc.:\r\n\r\n    ```{r}\r\n    library(flextable)\r\n    bab &lt;- data.frame(x = &quot;dummy&quot;)\r\n    bab &lt;- flextable(bab)\r\n    bab &lt;- compose(bab, part = &quot;body&quot;, i = 1, j = 1,\r\n             value = as_paragraph(&quot;10&quot;,\r\n                                  as_sup(&quot;-3&quot;)))\r\n    bab\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThis is definitely safer than the method I gave.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/0n13V.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220735/flextable-using-superscript-in-the-dataframe/58234369#58234369","title":"Flextable : using superscript in the dataframe"}],"owner":{"reputation":302,"user_id":8119110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/06dQ9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Flora Grappelli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8119110/flora-grappelli"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58234369,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570212035,"creation_date":1570111071,"question_id":58220735,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58220735","body_markdown":"This question was asked few times, but surprinsingly, no answer was given.\r\n\r\nI want some numbers in my dataframe to appear in superscript.\r\nThe functions `compose` and `display` are not suitable here since I don&#39;t know yet which values in my dataframe will appear in superscript (my tables are generated automatically).\r\n\r\nI tried to use `^8^`like for `kable`, `$$10^-3$$`, `paste(expression(10^2))`,  `&quot;H\\\\textsubscript{123}&quot;`, etc.\r\n\r\nNothing works !!

understanding is correct. For example, a function that takes `Predicate&lt;? super Employee&gt;` (as in your `ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt;` example) can also accept a `Predicate&lt;Object&gt;` like [`Objects::nonNull`][1]. Conceptually, this makes sense for the following reason: &quot;We (the class) take a `Predicate` that operates on us, or on any of the (transitive) superclasses of ourself, because we have an *is-a* relationship with those superclasses.&quot; That is to say, a function that takes any `Object` and returns a `boolean` is equivalently applicable to `Employee` because `Employee` *is-a* `Object`, and so it is valid to apply this function to `Employee`. The derived class is not the exact same as the base class, but the predicate (logical test) still applies to the derived class, because it makes sense to talk about the derived class as-a base class.  \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s go through an example: `Employees` could be derived from `Person`. If \r\n`Person` can be tested with a `Predicate&lt;Person&gt;` called `hasJob`, then it is logically sound to be able to test `Employees` for `hasJob` as well. The ability of that function to take `Predicate&lt;? super Employee&gt;` instead of just `Predicate&lt;Employee&gt;` is required to maintain the ability of the function to take a logically sound predicate. On the other hand, if you only expect for `Employee`s to be tested for some property, you might accept only a `Predicate&lt;Employee&gt;` instead, because that corresponds to the logical soundness of only `Employee` and its derived classes possessing the ability to be tested for that property.\r\n\r\nTo be 100% clear about what is going on here:  \r\n\r\n* `Predicate&lt;? super Employee&gt;` accepts `Predicate` that `test`s `Employee` and *any superclass* of `Employee`, **including** `Object`\r\n* `Predicate&lt;Employee&gt;` accepts `Predicate` that `test`s `Employee` and *any subclass* of `Employee`, which **excludes** `Object`\r\n\r\nGiven this class hierarchy: `SalariedEmployee is-a Employee is-a Person`, here&#39;s what happens (P is shorthand for `Predicate`):\r\n```\r\n╔══════════════════╦═══════════╦═══════════════════╦═════════════╦═════════════════════╦═════════════════════╦═════════════════════════════╗\r\n║       Type       ║ P&lt;Person&gt; ║ P&lt;? super Person&gt; ║ P&lt;Employee&gt; ║ P&lt;? super Employee&gt; ║ P&lt;SalariedEmployee&gt; ║ P&lt;? super SalariedEmployee&gt; ║\r\n╠══════════════════╬═══════════╬═══════════════════╬═════════════╬═════════════════════╬═════════════════════╬═════════════════════════════╣\r\n║ Person           ║ Accept    ║ Accept            ║ Reject      ║ Accept              ║ Reject              ║ Accept                      ║\r\n║ Employee         ║ Accept    ║ Reject            ║ Accept      ║ Accept              ║ Reject              ║ Accept                      ║\r\n║ SalariedEmployee ║ Accept    ║ Reject            ║ Accept      ║ Reject              ║ Accept              ║ Accept                      ║\r\n║ Object           ║ Reject    ║ Accept            ║ Reject      ║ Accept              ║ Reject              ║ Accept                      ║\r\n╚══════════════════╩═══════════╩═══════════════════╩═════════════╩═════════════════════╩═════════════════════╩═════════════════════════════╝\r\n```\r\nNote that `Accept/Reject` denote the types that can be fed into the `Predicate`, not the actual result of the `Predicate`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Objects.html#nonNull(java.lang.Object)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220717/types-of-argument-to-be-passed-to-super-t-in-java/58220900#58220900","title":"Types of argument to be passed to &lt;? super T&gt; in Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10661805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TpNCg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Holmes Queen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10661805/holmes-queen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10661805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TpNCg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Holmes Queen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10661805/holmes-queen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58220900,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570200587,"creation_date":1570110969,"last_edit_date":1570200587,"question_id":58220717,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58220717","body_markdown":"In Chapter 8 of Generic Types from Core Java Volume I Edition 10, \r\n\r\n&gt; \r\nNOTE: Another common use for supertype bounds is an argument type of a\r\nfunctional interface.

is not just some stupid preprocessor macro. It will not simply paste the contents of one file into another. It is a language construct, which will &quot;move into&quot; the other file, process it as it was a file of it&#39;s own, while maintaining the context of the parent file. \r\n\r\n&gt; When a file is included, parsing drops out of PHP mode and into HTML\r\n&gt; mode at the beginning of the target file, and resumes again at the\r\n&gt; end. For this reason, any code inside the target file which should be\r\n&gt; executed as PHP code must be enclosed within valid PHP start and end\r\n&gt; tags. - https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php\r\n\r\nThis is also a reason, why you can catch parse errors in the outer file, if the inner file cannot be parsed properly. \r\n\r\nAnother important nuance is this:\r\n&gt;It is possible to execute a return statement inside an included file in order to terminate processing in that file and return to the script which called it. Also, it&#39;s possible to return values from included files. You can take the value of the include call as you would for a normal function.\r\n\r\nThis however does not apply to function definitions, which will be processed irregardless of any `return` statements.\r\n\r\nThe closing PHP tag is only needed if you want to exit PHP mode into HTML in the same file. PHP will exit the PHP mode automatically at the end of every file, even the included ones.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220706/if-you-cant-use-html-inside-of-php-then-why-can-you-call-an-open-ended-html-sc/58220929#58220929","title":"If you can&#39;t use html inside of php, then why can you call an open ended html script within php tags?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3648,"user_id":5260982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yZtIq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5260982/dave"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570117337,"creation_date":1570117337,"answer_id":58222624,"question_id":58220706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58222624","body_markdown":"You need to &quot;turn off&quot; PHP when you want to simply output HTML otherwise PHP is going to try and treat it as PHP code and it will fail as you&#39;ve seen.

Currently when I deploy the site I do the following:\r\n\r\n- Create a production build of the Vue app (`npm run build`)\r\n- Copy the Vue `dist` folder into a specific folder within the Django app\r\n- One of the Django urls is setup as a `TemplateView` which serves up the Vue `index.html`\r\n\r\nBy doing the above, `Nginx` in production simply serves up the Django app using `gunicorn` and everything works.\r\n\r\nHowever I would prefer to have Nginx serve up the Vue `index.html` and static files. For example `/` will serve the Django app and `/spa` will serve the Vue app which will itself call the api.\r\n\r\nHere is my current `Nginx` config:\r\n\r\n```nginx\r\nupstream appserver_wsgi_app {\r\n  server localhost:8000 fail_timeout=0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nserver {\r\n  listen 80;\r\n  server_name www.example.com;\r\n  rewrite ^(.*) https://$server_name$1 permanent;\r\n}\r\n\r\nserver {\r\n    server_name www.example.com;\r\n    listen 443 ssl;\r\n    ...\r\n    ...\r\n    ...\r\n    location /static {\r\n        autoindex on;\r\n        alias /home/user/static_django_files/;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location /media {\r\n        autoindex on;\r\n        alias /home/user/media_django_files/;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location / {\r\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\r\n            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\r\n            proxy_redirect off;\r\n            if (!-f $request-filename) {\r\n                proxy_pass http://appserver_wsgi_app;\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be changed in `Nginx` so that it will serve the `Vue index.html` and `static files` as well as the `Django` app?

assume that by &quot;symmetric&quot; you mean that the left side of the tree is a mirror image of the right side of the tree. In other words, all the values on the left side are mirrored by the same values on the right side.  Here is an example of such a tree:\r\n\r\n        1\r\n       / \\\r\n      2   2\r\n     /\\   /\\\r\n    3  4 4  3\r\n\r\nBecause the nodes to be compared could be widely separated in the tree, this necessitates passing two node pointers to the recursive checking function.  However, you could call that function from a function that takes a single pointer to the root of the tree:\r\n\r\n    // Helper function to recursively check if two branches are mirror images\r\n    static bool areMirrored(TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) {\r\n        if (left == NULL)\r\n            return (right == NULL);\r\n        if (right == NULL)\r\n            return false;\r\n        if (left-&gt;value != right-&gt;value)\r\n            return false;\r\n        return (areMirrored(left-&gt;left, right-&gt;right) &amp;&amp;\r\n                areMirrored(left-&gt;right, right-&gt;left));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Check if tree is symmetric (left and right branches are mirror images)\r\n    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {\r\n        return (root == NULL || areMirrored(root-&gt;left, root-&gt;right));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here is a version that uses a &quot;fake&quot; root node at each step of the recursion. It has the disadvantage of using extra storage to store the fake node at each level of recursion:\r\n\r\n    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {\r\n        TreeNode fake;\r\n\r\n        if (root == NULL)\r\n            return true;\r\n        if (root-&gt;left == NULL)\r\n            return (root-&gt;right == NULL);\r\n        if (root-&gt;right == NULL)\r\n            return false;\r\n        if (root-&gt;left-&gt;value != root-&gt;right-&gt;value)\r\n            return false;\r\n\r\n        fake.value = 0; // fake value isn&#39;t used\r\n        fake.left = root-&gt;left-&gt;left;\r\n        fake.right = root-&gt;right-&gt;right;\r\n        if (!isSymmetric(&amp;fake))\r\n            return false;\r\n\r\n        fake.left = root-&gt;left-&gt;right;\r\n        fake.right = root-&gt;right-&gt;left;\r\n        return isSymmetric(&amp;fake);\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220660/algorithm-for-symmetric-tree-check-using-recursion-with-only-one-function-parame/58221993#58221993","title":"algorithm for symmetric tree check using recursion with only one function parameter"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9075503,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t5NfiQYTkV8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/hxLfw-AyGXI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shikhin Dahikar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9075503/shikhin-dahikar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9075503,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t5NfiQYTkV8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/hxLfw-AyGXI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shikhin Dahikar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9075503/shikhin-dahikar"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570131709,"creation_date":1570110782,"last_edit_date":1570125295,"question_id":58220660,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58220660","body_markdown":"I am looking for an algorithm to check if a tree is symmetric or not using recursion on function with only a single parameter which is root node.

I want to create a subset of a DataFrame (eclipse dataset) by using specific column names. However, since there are 212 columns in total, and I need 41 of them, writing every single of the column names as a list would be too long (and not a nice way to code I suppose). So instead I decided to get the columns by specifying the beginning of the column names (which decreases the list to 15 elements). I have column names that start with specific letters such as &quot;NOF&quot;, &quot;NOM&quot;, &quot;NSF&quot;, etc. and I want to extract the columns starting with these strings to create my new subset. I tried to run the code below:\r\n\r\n``` eclipse_train &lt;- subset(eclipse, select = starts_with(predictors)) ```\r\n\r\nWhere the *predictors* is a list of words that I want the columns to start with. But of course, it gave the error:\r\n&gt;Error in starts_with(predictors) : is_string(match) is not TRUE\r\n\r\nI could not come up with anything else to filter the columns that start with specific strings I wanted to create a subset.

You can add other country matches and have the default set the variable to the original JSON\r\n 5. Returned the &#39;Output Data&#39; variable as the reponse to the request.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the JSON schema for the app. I used and input data variable as well as an output, but you should be able to

of all, [`std::thread::join`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/join) does not *kill* a thread - it waits for the thread to finish.\r\n\r\nYou have 3 producer threads (each producing 100 items), but only 2 consumer threads (each consuming 100 items). This means there&#39;s a surplus of 100 items being produced. Add to that a buffer with a capacity of only 10 items, and your **producers will never finish on their own before the consumers have finished**.\r\n\r\nThis means you need a mechanism to end the producer loops early (ie. as soon as the consumer loops have ended).\r\n\r\nYour attempt to address this has however left you open to a **infinitely blocked thread** (similar to a deadlock, but not quite). The scenario that jumps out at me (which doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s the only one), is when one or more producer threads are blocked on `cond.wait(locker);` (in `Buffer::put`), but all consumer threads have ended (meaning the `cond.notify_one();` in `Buffer::get` will no longer happen). Those producer thread(s) will thus wait forever, and the corresponding `join`(s) won&#39;t return.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this situation, you can consider using [`std::condition_variable::wait_for`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable/wait_for) instead of `std::condition_variable::wait` to avoid the blocking wait. Every time the timeout happens, you have a chance to check if the consumers have ended, and end the producer thread when that&#39;s the case.\r\n\r\nThe way you check if the consumer threads have ended could also be improved. One option would be to first `join` the 2 consumer threads. When both consumer threads are joined, signal all producer threads that they should end as well, then `join` the producer threads. The signal in question could be eg. a [`std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic) that is checked in each iteration of the producer. This will work best if the `BufferPtr-&gt;put();` is changed to a `BufferPtr-&gt;try_put();`, which either inserts an item in the buffer, or returns immediately (or after a timeout if you prefer) when the buffer is full.\r\n\r\nNote that there are more issues in your code (not least of which is that you use the same `condition_variable` to signal both &quot;not empty&quot; and &quot;not full&quot;), but they&#39;re not in the scope of this question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220599/is-it-a-deadlock-how-to-avoid-it-in-multithreading/58231434#58231434","title":"Is it a &quot;deadlock&quot;?

However, the code doesn&#39;t finish running.\r\n\r\nMy environment:\r\n\r\nSystem: Windows 10\r\n\r\nCompiler: mingw-w64x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\r\n\r\nUpdate: \r\n\r\nI thought that &quot;join&quot; could end a thread. Thank to those nice guys who commented the question, I understood that &quot;join&quot; won&#39;t &quot;kill&quot; the thread. It is the function returns when the thread execution has completed. Also, the problem in my code is possibly about deadlock. I have tried some ways to solve this problem. However, it neither work.\r\n\r\nWhat I have tried:\r\nAdding \r\n\r\n    if(ConsumerPtr-&gt;isConsumerDead()){\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\nin the ```void Producer::prods();``` function. That doesn&#39;t work.\r\nLater I edit some more. I added a new global variable to check if the consumer has stopped working. Also, I have added more if statement to check consumer around ```void Buffer::put();```. After that, I found the code rarely worked, but failed in most time. I tried to edit the \r\n```std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(60));``` code of sleep time after single consume/produce operation. I have enlarged 10 ms to 60 ms. Then, the code works much better. Now, it rarely fail. \r\n\r\nI think the code doesn&#39;t finish, because there is a deadlock during running. I found a reason which could make deadlock on Wiki:a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. If a process is unable to change its state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used by another waiting process, then the system is said to be in a deadlock.\r\n\r\nSo, the question becomes: Is it really a deadlock?

clear-cut like in the previous examples.\r\n\r\nTo do so in CSS, it *should have been* just a matter of adding an inner element on which we would set the backdrop-filter with half of the blurring along with some margin, and then add a `blur` on the element with the other half of the blur as a simple `filter` rule.  \r\nHowever, it seems there is a bug in current Blink where `backdrop-filter` will simply be discarded if one of the ancestors already had a `blur()` applied to it...\r\n\r\n**So this will currently only work in Safari:**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console:

that the canvas version becomes way simpler.  \r\nWhat we&#39;ll do is to simply draw the video on the canvas, and then apply a CSS `filter:blur()` on the canvas element directly from CSS.  \r\nSince we don&#39;t need to account for the spread, the calculations for drawImage are easier, but since we don&#39;t apply any filter, we can even use the lazy version that was in the comments of the second

You could run the command above in a loop to delete a bunch of layer versions in bulk, perhaps in combination with a call to [list-layer-versions][2].  You can also delete layer versions via the console.  Once you remove all the versions of a layer, the layer itself is removed.

I have lambda functions that call methods from homemade python packages, which are stored in [**layers**](https://medium.com/consulner/speedup-aws-lambda-deployments-with-layers-12f8f24c7d0). The goal being to avoid having too much code in the lambdas and easily reuse features among them. \r\n\r\nNow, I have found how to remove old versions of my lambda functions (I too am using the Serverless framework, which offers a nice plugin for automatically pruning them upon deployment of the stack). However, I don&#39;t know whether old layers are automatically deleted by AWS: I have yet to find a dashboard that summarizes the total code size of all my layer versions, and I couldn&#39;t find a plugin that automatically removes them. \r\n\r\nAre old AWS Lambda layers automatically removed?

Debugging the Hibernate code, the number it&#39;s the `typeCode` and the problem is that this number could not be &quot;random&quot;, because the Hibernate try to find the correspondent SQL type looking for this number on `org.hibernate.dialect.TypeNames#get(int)`\r\n\r\nThe curious case is that **if I map the column directly to `LocalDateTime` it works**!

An `html` function that takes a tag name and child nodes and returns `&lt;tag&gt;...childNodes&lt;/tag&gt;`\r\n2. A `row` function that accepts a string array and returns `&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;str1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;str2&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst table = (headers = [], rows = []) =&gt;\r\n  html\r\n    ( &#39;table&#39;\r\n    , html(&#39;thead&#39;, row(headers))\r\n    , html(&#39;tbody&#39;, ...rows.map(row))\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe continue writing our program this way, imagining then implementing as we go. Writing `row` imagines `cell`. Writing `cell` imagines `text` -\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst html = (tag, ...children) =&gt;\r\n{ const e = document.createElement(tag)\r\n  children.forEach(c =&gt; e.appendChild(c))\r\n  return e\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst row = (cells = []) =&gt;\r\n  html(&#39;tr&#39;, ...cells.map(cell))\r\n\r\nconst cell = (s = &quot;&quot;) =&gt;\r\n  html(&#39;td&#39;, text(s))\r\n\r\nconst text = (s = &quot;&quot;) =&gt;\r\n  document.createTextNode(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt some point we are finally done.

This means `duration` will always be 0 since it only changes in the destructor and you can&#39;t access the object after it gets destructed.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to fix this.  The first is to just move the timing code into the function.  Secondly you could modify `BenchmarkTimer` to take a function object in the constructor that will be the code to run and then do your calculations in the constructor.  That would look like\r\n\r\n\tclass BenchmarkTimer\r\n\t{\r\n\tpublic:\r\n\t\tstd::chrono::time_point&lt;std::chrono::high_resolution_clock&gt; startpt;\r\n\t\tfloat ms;\r\n\t\tlong long duration;\r\n\t\ttemplate&lt;typename Func&gt;\r\n\t\tBenchmarkTimer(Func func) : ms(0), duration(0)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tstartpt = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\r\n\t\t\tfunc();\r\n\t\t\tauto endpt = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\r\n\t\t\tauto diff = end-start;\r\n\t\t\tduration = diff.count();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n\t\r\n\tvoid SelectionSort(int Array[])\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tBenchmarkTimer timer([&amp;]()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tint temp, smallest, position, j;\r\n\t\t\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; size - 1; i++)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tsmallest = Array[i];\r\n\t\t\t\tposition = i;\r\n\t\t\t\tfor (j = i + 1; j &lt; size; j++)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif (Array[j] &lt; smallest)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmallest = Array[j];\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition = j;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\ttemp = Array[i];\r\n\t\t\t\tArray[i] = Array[position];\r\n\t\t\t\tArray[position] = temp;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\tDisplayArray(Array);\r\n\t\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\nTime taken to sort the array: &quot; &lt;&lt; timer.duration &lt;&lt; &quot; ms&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nAnother option would be to add another function to `BenchmarkTimer` that you call once you want it to do the calculations, and move your destructor code into there.

This means I don&#39;t know how many of them will be created (depends on input file). Also, select name cannot be used since its autogenerated in a specific way, so I guess in jQuery I&#39;d have to go with either class or ID.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve already tried few options I found on stackoverflow etc, and the best of what I could get to was my code below. It actually validates if there is at least one option selected, but across all of presented multiselect fields. So if I have 10 fields, in one of them one was selected, thats enough for submit button to work, which is not what I want.\r\n\r\nTheres the jQuery part:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n            &lt;script&gt;\r\n                $(function () {\r\n                    $(&#39;#myForm&#39;).submit(function () {\r\n                        var isValid = true;\r\n                        var form = this;\r\n                        isValid = isValid &amp;&amp; validateMultipleSelect($(&#39;select.required&#39;, form));\r\n                        return isValid;\r\n                    });\r\n                });\r\n                function validateMultipleSelect(select) {\r\n                    var number = $(&#39;option:selected&#39;, select).size();\r\n                    alert(&quot;Select at least one option in each column per Vendor&quot;)\r\n                    return (number &gt; 0);\r\n                }\r\n            &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nNow this is the Form part:\r\n\r\n    &lt;form action=&quot;{% url &#39;index&#39; %}&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;myForm&quot;&gt;\r\n                {% csrf_token %}\r\n            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n            &lt;hr&gt;\r\n    ​\r\n            {% for vendor in vendor_list %}\r\n                 {{ vendor.vendor_name }} \r\n       ​\r\n                        {% for columns in vendor.option_list %}\r\n    ​\r\n                            &lt;select class=&quot;required&quot; multiple id=&quot;required&quot; name = &#39;{{ columns.column_name }} {{ vendor.vendor_id }}&#39;&gt;\r\n                                &lt;option value = {{ columns.column_name }} disabled&gt; {{ columns.column_name }}&lt;/option&gt;\r\n                                    {% for option in columns.column_options %}\r\n                                    &lt;option value= &quot;{{ option }}&quot;&gt; {{ option }} &lt;/option&gt;\r\n                                    {% endfor %}\r\n                                &lt;br&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/select&gt;\r\n    ​\r\n    ​\r\n                         {% endfor %}\r\n                &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n    ​\r\n            {% endfor %}\r\n\r\n\r\nI did try to pull the length of how many multiple select fields I have, so if I have 10 select fields, then the condition could be &#39;at least 10 options selected&#39;. But if from multiple select fields one of them has 10 options, 10 could be selected in that select field and zero options can be selected in any other select field, that would still let the submit button work (since 10 options were selected), which is not what I want.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is to validate each of select fields for at least ONE selected option. So in all of those select fields at least one option have to be selected in order to make submit button work.\r\n\r\nSo this shouldn&#39;t work (since last row&#39;s country isnt selected):\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this should work:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hVjEx.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OuUSr.png\r\n\r\nthank you in advance for any help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220509/jquery-validate-with-many-select-multiple-fields-with-django","title":"jQuery validate with many select-multiple fields (with Django)"},{"tags":["reactjs","formik","yup"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":11888358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ba4MeY2UlPU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/80V6bKqTWY4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jumar Juaton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11888358/jumar-juaton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570154540,"post_id":58220632,"comment_id":102832658,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220507/typeerror-cannot-read-property-object-of-undefined-in-yup/58220632#comment102832658_58220632"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1646,"user_id":11528064,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51d3bc1df95dc38b6cbbf9e8b75a9bbf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"adel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11528064/adel"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570110725,"creation_date":1570110725,"answer_id":58220632,"question_id":58220507,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58220632","body_markdown":"try this:\r\n\r\n    import * as Yup from &#39;yup&#39;;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58220507/typeerror-cannot-read-property-object-of-undefined-in-yup/58220632#58220632","title":"TypeError: Cannot read property &#39;object&#39; of undefined in Yup"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":11888358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ba4MeY2UlPU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/80V6bKqTWY4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jumar Juaton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11888358/jumar-juaton"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4773,"user_id":93812,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T5fjc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Will Jenkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/93812/will-jenkins"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58220632,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570111167,"creation_date":1570110351,"last_edit_date":1570111167,"question_id":58220507,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58220507","body_markdown":"My form is made in Formik and Yup.
