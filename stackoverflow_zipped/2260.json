Normally you work taking as a base another random number generator, and try to apply a function that from that generator of know properties you get numbers distributed in the new fashion.\r\n\r\nFor your approach I&#39;ve used several times the standar random generator (a flat number generator between [0..1), as source)  if I apply a function to it, let&#39;s say (just a guess) the `log(x)` function you will get a graph approx like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n|-&gt;    x\r\n|-&gt;      x\r\n|-&gt;         x\r\n|-&gt;              x\r\n|-&gt;                         x\r\n|-&gt;                                                            x\r\n+====================================================================\r\n```\r\nand it seems to match approximately the accumulation of points desired (indeed, it **is** the right approach)\r\n\r\nThe integral to this function (that gives you the probability of having X &lt;= a)\r\nis given by the function represented below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|-&gt;                                                            X\r\n|-&gt;                         X\r\n|-&gt;              x\r\n|-&gt;         X     \r\n|-&gt;      X                   \r\n|-&gt;    X                                                        \r\n+====================================================================\r\n       0\r\n```\r\nand it&#39;s inverse (a logarithm function is given below, mirrored on the XY bisectrix):\r\n\r\n```\r\n|          |\r\n|    X     |\r\n|          |\r\n|  X       |\r\n|X         |\r\n+=============\r\n 0         1\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is `-log(1-x)` (but `-log(x)` will suffice, as x is random between 0 and 1).\r\n\r\n```\r\ndouble y = -A * log(unit_random());\r\n```\r\n\r\nin which A is some constant specific to produce a larger or smaller average.  `y` will have the expected response, always the `unit_random()` is a flat distribution with equally probability distribution in the unit interval.\r\n\r\nBelow is a complete sample of a little program to generate points with the requested distribution.

**`Get-Member` operates on the _individual objects_ received via the pipelin**e and returns information about the _distinct_ types among them.\r\n\r\n  * Therefore, with the output from a `Get-ChildItem` command targeting the file-system, you&#39;ll see information about types `System.IO.DirectoryInfo` and/or `System.IO.FileInfo` - and these types have no `.Count` property.\r\n\r\n  * In order to inspect a collection-like type itself (rather than its elements), pass it to &lt;br&gt;`Get-Member`&#39;s `-InputObject` parameter instead of using the pipeline; e.g, &lt;br&gt;`Get-Member -InputObject (Get-ChildItem)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **`(...)` around a command that outputs _multiple_ objects implicitly collects these objects in an `[object[]]` array**, and any array has a `.Count` property, by virtue of the `IList` interface it implements.\r\n\r\n  * That said, **PowerShell (since v3) *implicitly* provides a `.Count` property even on _scalars_, in an effort to unify the handling of scalars and  collections**; e.g., `(Get-Date).Count` yields `1`, as do `&#39;foo&#39;.Count` and `(42).Count` (sic) - however, &lt;br&gt;\r\n**`Get-Member` does _not_ show this implicit `.Count` property.**\r\n\r\n     * You can even use _indexing_ (`[...]`) with scalars so as to treat them as a _single-element array_; e.g., `(42)[0]` is the same as `42` - see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44035802/45375) for more information (a notable exception is `[string]`, because that type itself defines indexing as accessing the individual _characters_ in the string; e.g, `&#39;foo&#39;[0]` is `&#39;f&#39;`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Notable pitfalls** :\r\n\r\n* **Using the *implicit* `.Count` property _fails_ when `Set-StrictMode -Version 2` or higher is in effect**:\r\n\r\n  * e.g., `Set-StrictMode -Version 2; (42).Count` fails with `The property &#39;Count&#39; cannot be found on this object.`\r\n\r\n  * This problematic behavior is discussed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2798).\r\n\r\n* **A collection-like type that doesn&#39;t itself have a `.Count` property, e.g. a lazy enumerable, results in `.Count` being called _on each individual element_**, due to [member enumeration](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44620191/45375):\r\n\r\n  * e.g.,`[System.IO.Directory]::EnumerateFiles(&#39;.&#39;).Count` - because `EnumerateFiles()` returns a lazily enumerated `[System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable[string]]` instance that therefore cannot have a `.Count` property - calls `.Count` _on each path_ that is enumerated, resulting in an _array of `1`s_, because each individual path - as a scalar - has a count of `1`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002622/properties-not-appearing-in-the-get-member-cmdlet-and-registering-values-when-pu/58002892#58002892","title":"Properties not appearing in the

Most are short.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, I need to use an expression index here as some of my values are too long for a B-tree entry. According to the Postgres 11 release notes:\r\n\r\n&quot;Allow creation of indexes that can be used by LIKE comparisons on citext columns (Alexey Chernyshov)\r\nTo do this, the index must be created using the citext_pattern_ops operator class.&quot;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/release-11.html\r\n\r\nHere is such an index definition for my sample data:\r\n\r\n    CREATE INDEX record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_btree\r\n        ON record_changes_log_detail \r\n        USING btree ((substring(old_value,1,1024)::citext) citext_pattern_ops);\r\n\r\nIf I run this query analysis, I can see that the index *is* used:\r\n\r\n    set max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 0; -- Don&#39;t tempt the planner to run a sequential scan.\r\n    explain analyze\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail where substring(old_value,1,1024)::citext = &#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;;\r\n\r\nSo, the = search works as hoped for. However, this query does *not* use the index:\r\n\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail where substring(old_value,1,1024)::citext LIKE &#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro%&#39;;\r\n\r\nIs there some trick to getting citext indexes to work with LIKE queries that I&#39;ve missed, or is this more likely a bug? For comparison, a LIKE query **does** use the index if you build it with text_pattern_ops.

This allows multiple values to be used inside the `IN`, and is safe from SQL Injection.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nThe reason why:\r\n\r\n    sqliteCommand.CommandText = @&quot;delete from [test_table] where col1 in(@para1,@para2)&quot;;\r\n    sqliteCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter(&quot;@para1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;));\r\n    sqliteCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter(&quot;@para2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;));\r\n    sqliteCommand.ExecuteNonQuery();\r\n\r\nworks but:\r\n\r\n    sqliteCommand.CommandText = @&quot;delete from [test_table] where col1 in(@para1,@para2)&quot;;\r\n    sqliteCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter(&quot;@para1&quot;, &#39;1&#39;));\r\n    sqliteCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter(&quot;@para2&quot;, &#39;2&#39;));\r\n    sqliteCommand.ExecuteNonQuery();\r\n\r\ndoesn&#39;t is that with the latter you accidentally passed in the parameters as `char` instead of `string`.\r\n\r\nThe latter can _feel_ correct, since `&#39;` works fine in SQL normally. But SQL and C# are different - `&#39;` can be used around a string in SQL, but not in C# (C# uses `&#39;` for `char` and `&quot;` for `string).\r\n\r\n**As such, when passing string parameters in - be sure to pass them as `string` (using `&quot;`) rather than `char`.**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002596/how-do-i-pass-multiple-parameters-to-a-sqlite-in-clause-and-protect-against-sql/58003874#58003874","title":"How do I pass multiple parameters to a sqlite IN clause and protect against SQL injection?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7389,"user_id":6782612,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KuUfK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Xavier Xie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6782612/xavier-xie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":85,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58003874,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568871483,"creation_date":1568857103,"last_edit_date":1568871483,"question_id":58002596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002596","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using [The Microsoft.Data.Sqlite library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/data-access/sqlite-databases#sqlite-library) relevant sqlite APIs in UWP project.\r\n\r\nI found that if I use `IN` condition in my parameterized SQL statement, it doesn&#39;t return the correct result.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the SQL statement looks like the following:\r\n\r\n&lt;!--language：c#--&gt;\r\n\r\n    sqliteCommand.CommandText = @&quot;delete from [test_table] where col1 in(@para1,@para2)&quot;;\r\n    sqliteCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter(&quot;@para1&quot;, &#39;1&#39;));\r\n    sqliteCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter(&quot;@para2&quot;, &#39;2&#39;));\r\n    sqliteCommand.ExecuteNonQuery();\r\n\r\nIt would not delete the rows when the &#39;col1&#39;

So instead of &quot;**heights -&gt; ages**&quot;, I need &quot;**(heights, weights) -&gt; ages**&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo basically, something like this:\r\n\r\n    let heightsAndWeights: [Double] = [ \r\n        (20.0, 7.2),\r\n        (44.0, 58.0), \r\n        (66.0, 160.0) \r\n    ]\r\n    let ages: [Double] = [ 0.1, 6.5, 12.0 ]\r\n\r\nSo in the end, I want to take a **height** and a **weight**, and get back an **age**, in a way that&#39;s fit to my input data (**heightsAndWeights**, above).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been searching stackoverflow and google and have found a number of implementations in other languages, but they always depend on some library that does the magic.\r\n\r\nSwift 5, running on

with many, many things in programming, the answer is a rather disappointing &quot;it depends&quot;.\r\n\r\nYou want a `Function` procedure to take its dependencies in as (`ByVal`) parameters, and then use them to compute and return a result to the caller. And if a function does that without any side-effects on global state, you get to call it a *pure* function! In a `Sub` procedure, you will also take your *dependencies* as parameters as much as possible. [No need for a `Call` keyword](http://rubberduckvba.com/Inspections/Details/ObsoleteCallStatement) though: \r\n\r\n    foo = GetFoo(42)\r\n    MsgBox &quot;hello&quot;\r\n\r\n...on the other hand, let&#39;s say you have a procedure that creates a sheet and automates certain things in the page header &amp; footer: you&#39;re spawning an object (`wb.Worksheets.Add`) and capturing it into a local variable - `Set sheet = wb.Worksheets.Add`, ...where `wb` might as well be a parameter. Or perhaps you&#39;re writing some lookup or average function, and you need local variables to enhance the readability and overall abstraction level of your code. Bottom line might be, use locals for your procedure&#39;s *implementation details*, parameters for your *dependencies*. Locals good, globals evil =)\r\n\r\nAs for the &quot;security&quot; bullet...

Other kinds of functions are not *required* to do this, or even *encouraged* to.\r\n\r\nIt *might* make sense to have `print_squares()` return its `ostream` if it were used as part of a related `operator&lt;&lt;` implementation, eg:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;os, const vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; v)\r\n{\r\n    return print_squares(os, v);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, even without a return value, `print_squares()` could still be used:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;os, const vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; v)\r\n{\r\n    print_squares(os, v);\r\n    return os;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut either way, this is not the case in the *specific example* you have quoted.  The return value of `print_squares()` is completely ignored by the caller, so what the return value is declared as is irrelevant.  But, if `print_squares()` were to be used in other code projects, perhaps its return value might not be so irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWhether `print_squares()` (or any other function) needs to return its input `ostream` or not really depends on how the calling code wants to use that return value.  There is no fixed convention here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002581/is-it-mandatory-or-just-a-convention-for-a-function-to-return-an-iostream-while/58002986#58002986","title":"Is it mandatory or just a convention for a function to return an iostream while one of its arguments is also iostream"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":11741595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-czq5W_NZ2hA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/dvB0q9xH4V4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mingshi Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11741595/mingshi-li"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5,"user_id":11741595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-czq5W_NZ2hA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/dvB0q9xH4V4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mingshi Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11741595/mingshi-li"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58002986,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568861339,"creation_date":1568856917,"last_edit_date":1568861169,"question_id":58002581,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002581","body_markdown":"Recently I was reading Accelerated C++ and found this interesting code from exercise answers.　Here is the full code,\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &quot;stdafx.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;4_4.h&quot;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\r\nusing std::vector;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\nusing std::ostream;\r\nusing std::streamsize;\r\nusing std::cout;\r\nusing std::endl;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;exception&gt;\r\nusing std::domain_error;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;iomanip&gt;\r\nusing std::setw;\r\n\r\nvector&lt;double&gt; square_double(const unsigned int range) \r\n{\r\n  vector&lt;double&gt; squares;\r\n  if (range &gt; squares.max_size())\r\n    throw domain_error(&quot;Range argument exceeds vector limit.&quot;);\r\n\r\n  for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; range; i++)\r\n    squares.push_back(i * i);\r\n\r\n  return squares;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndouble GetNumberOfDigits(const double i)\r\n{\r\n  return i &gt; 0 ? log10(i) + 1 : 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nostream&amp; print_squares(ostream&amp; os, const vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; v)\r\n{\r\n  if (os)\r\n  {\r\n    streamsize digits_i = (streamsize) GetNumberOfDigits(v.size());\r\n    streamsize digits_v = (streamsize) GetNumberOfDigits(v.back());\r\n\r\n    for (vector&lt;double&gt;::size_type i = 0; i &lt; v.size(); i++) \r\n    {\r\n      streamsize s_size = os.width();\r\n      os &lt;&lt; setw(digits_i) &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; setw(digits_v) &lt;&lt; v[i] &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n      os.width(s_size);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return os;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint ex4_4()\r\n{\r\n  vector&lt;double&gt; v = square_double(500);\r\n  print_squares(cout, v);\r\n\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe purpose of this function is to calculate squares of values between a range with a fixed step size. What confuses me is the answer only used the ```print_square``` function **once**, the ```for``` loop inside this function has done all the work for printing, so why he uses ```ostream&amp;```? There is no **chained-ostream** output residing in this code block right?\r\n\r\nThe code itself is easy to understand but the return ```ostream&amp;``` of this function confused me. Why should I use ```ostream&amp;``` rather than just ```void``` ? Anyways, ```cout``` is just using its &quot;side-effect&quot; to print things out, So why bother return itself? Is it some sort of convention, because i saw no further following output using ```cout``` after this codeblock.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002581/is-it-mandatory-or-just-a-convention-for-a-function-to-return-an-iostream-while","title":"Is it mandatory or just a convention for a function to return an iostream while one of its arguments is also iostream"},{"tags":["java","arrays","integer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14784,"user_id":9959152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSjIJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Deadpool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9959152/deadpool"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568857087,"post_id":58002580,"comment_id":102410696,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002580/how-do-i-properly-compare-integers-of-an-array-in-an-if-statement#comment102410696_58002580"},{"owner":{"reputation":37331,"user_id":2310289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PO7Uz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scary Wombat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310289/scary-wombat"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568857152,"post_id":58002580,"comment_id":102410705,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002580/how-do-i-properly-compare-integers-of-an-array-in-an-if-statement#comment102410705_58002580"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087809,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17fb6ebfdbab6e2b574f79b7e24dfd4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"help_me","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087809/help-me"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":37331,"user_id":2310289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PO7Uz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scary Wombat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310289/scary-wombat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568857378,"post_id":58002580,"comment_id":102410755,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002580/how-do-i-properly-compare-integers-of-an-array-in-an-if-statement#comment102410755_58002580"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12087831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDqUdfnVPYi5-s3EpNsZxADFdLK1BmDBM8BXAh4jg=k-s128","display_name":"Pruthvi Puwar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087831/pruthvi-puwar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568857541,"creation_date":1568857541,"answer_id":58002625,"question_id":58002580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002625","body_markdown":"I think you are to compare the value of dice at index i with index i+1, and if it&#39;s equal it prints, correct?.\r\nIf that is so, here is the correction.\r\n\r\n     for(int i = 0; i &lt; dice.length - 1; i++) {\r\n    \t    if(dice[i] == dice[i+1]){\r\n    \t    System.out.println(&quot;The numbers are same at index &quot; + i + &quot; and &quot; + i+1);\r\n    }\r\n    \t    \t\t\r\n     }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002580/how-do-i-properly-compare-integers-of-an-array-in-an-if-statement/58002625#58002625","title":"How do I properly compare integers of an array in an if-statement?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087809,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17fb6ebfdbab6e2b574f79b7e24dfd4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"help_me","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087809/help-me"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58002625,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568857541,"creation_date":1568856899,"question_id":58002580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002580","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to compare a random array value with the next value, but java won&#39;t recognize the comparison in the if-statement.

just like you read from jjanes elsewhere: an expression index is only considered if the expression is matched in the query predicate exactly. The Postgres query planner is not an AI. It would quickly defeat the purpose of making queries fast if planning them takes too long.\r\n\r\nYou can optimize your index a bit, if that&#39;s any consolation. `left()` is simpler and faster than `substring()`:\r\n\r\n    CREATE INDEX record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_btree\r\n    ON record_changes_log_detail (left(old_value,1024) text_pattern_ops);\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a **maximum row size of 2704 bytes** for btree indexes, not a *&quot;2172 character limit on B-trees&quot;*.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, for only equality checks, like your question suggests, a btree index on a hash value using `md5(old_value)` or `hashtext(old_value)` would be *much* more efficient. If you do, remember to defend against **hash collisions** like so:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT *\r\nFROM   record_changes_log_detail \r\nWHERE  hashtext(old_value) = hashtext(&#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;)\r\n&lt;b&gt;AND    old_value = &#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;&lt;/b&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nThe first predicate gives you fast index access. The second excludes false positives. Collisions should be extremely rare. But possible. And the possibility grows with the size of the table.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n\r\n- [SELECT query with DISTINCT on a table-structure for graphs is very slow][1]\r\n- [What is the optimal data type for an MD5 field?][2]\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5285787/full-text-search-in-couchdb/8202007#8202007\r\n\r\nOr a [hash index][3] like you have been considering yourself already:\r\n\r\n- [Why is a Postgres 11 hash index so large?][4]\r\n\r\n(Here you don&#39;t need to worry about hash collisions; handled internally.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/83119/3684\r\n  [2]: https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/115316/3684\r\n  [3]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html\r\n  [4]: https://dba.stackexchange.com/q/249030/3684","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002565/searching-on-expression-indexes/58003327#58003327","title":"Searching on expression indexes"}],"owner":{"reputation":445,"user_id":11757024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UcnoN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Morris de Oryx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11757024/morris-de-oryx"},"last_editor":{"reputation":445,"user_id":11757024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UcnoN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Morris de Oryx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11757024/morris-de-oryx"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58003327,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568996378,"creation_date":1568856720,"last_edit_date":1568889384,"question_id":58002565,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002565","body_markdown":"Searching on expression indexes\r\n\r\nI&#39;m building an expression index that substrings a source field to avoid overflowing the 2172 character limit on B-trees:\r\n\r\n    CREATE INDEX record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_btree\r\n        ON record_changes_log_detail \r\n        USING btree ((substring(old_value,1,1024)::text) text_pattern_ops);\r\n\r\nFor the record:\r\n\r\n  -- Postgres 11.4 on RDS, 11.5 on macOS at home.  \r\n   -- The record_changes_log_detail table has about 8M in my test setup.  \r\n   -- The old_value field is of type citext.  \r\n   -- Values in the field range in length from 1 character to over 5,000. Most are short.  \r\n\r\nThis search uses the index specified above:\r\n\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail \r\n    where substring(old_value,1,1024) = &#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;;\r\n\r\nThis search does *not* use the index:\r\n\r\n    where old_value = &#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;;\r\n\r\nI found this surprising, and a real bummer. If I understand correctly a comment from jjanes on another question, the planner only recognizes that the index applies when your query statement uses *exactly* the same expression. In other words, anyone writing a query needs to know the details of the index definition or else the index won&#39;t be used. \r\n\r\nI had been assuming that when the expression index was constructed, the abbreviated/extracted/etc. value was stored and that the planner would check it. **Is there any way to hint the planner other than to recapitulate the entire expression?** The index has the right data, but the planner seems to skip over it.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m adding a bit of detail based on Erwin Brandstetter&#39;s answer:\r\n\r\nI have _lots_ of similar situations, which is why I&#39;m digging in here on the details. In this case, of my ~8M rows, only 6 have values longer than 2172 characters, and 99.93% of the values are 100 characters or less.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m hoping for is an approach that is easy for someone else to pick up. A shadow-field might well be the answer as having to know the **exact** details of index constructions strikes me as exactly the wrong sort of visibility. A shadow field doesn&#39;t suffer from that problem, once you know to use it. I could either populate it with LEFT(old_field,128) or some other length, or texthash(old_field), as you mentioned. I&#39;ll experiment with that. My data is so skewed to short values, that hashing seems to lead to a high collision rate.\r\n\r\nFor what it&#39;s worth, the team and I are coming from a system where text fields are silently trimmed to 1024 characters when indexed in a B-tree. It&#39;s completely transparent to the user and searches consult the index. Apples and spark plugs, I know. The point is that I&#39;m not expecting Postgres to be an AI, but I _am_ coming with inaccurate priors. So thanks to you and everyone else for helping me learn more about how Postgres actually works.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n# Follow-up #\r\nThis question has been answered, but I want to add some follow-up for the archives. I&#39;ve been learning a *lot* from old answers, some very old. So here&#39;s a bit of information for the future. I tried out four solutions:\r\n\r\n* B-tree on a portion of the citext field.\r\n* B-tree on a hash of the citext field.\r\n* Hash index of the citext field.\r\n* Tri-gram GIN index of the citext field.\r\n\r\nSince there doesn&#39;t appear to be any way to get LIKE-type queries on citext where the text may be too long, the goal is to create an index for =. Any of the three above will work okay, but they differ quite a bit. Here&#39;s some setup code for the test:\r\n\r\n    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_btree;\r\n    CREATE INDEX record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_btree\r\n        ON record_changes_log_detail\r\n        USING btree ((left(old_value,1024)::citext) citext_pattern_ops);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS record_changes_log_detail_old_value_hash_ix_btree;\r\n    CREATE INDEX record_changes_log_detail_old_value_hash_ix_btree\r\n        ON record_changes_log_detail\r\n        USING btree (hashtext(old_value));\r\n        \r\n    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_hash;\r\n    CREATE INDEX record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_hash\r\n        ON record_changes_log_detail\r\n        USING hash (old_value);    \r\n\r\n    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_tgrm;\r\n    CREATE INDEX record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_tgrm\r\n    \tON record_changes_log_detail \r\n    \tUSING gin (old_value gin_trgm_ops);\r\n        \r\n    VACUUM ANALYZE;\r\n    \r\nThese indexes each work to find a record, but with different syntax:\r\n\r\n    -- Uses the LEFT()::citext index\r\n    explain analyze\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail \r\n    where left(old_value,1024)::citext = &#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    -- Uses the HASH index\r\n    explain analyze\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail \r\n    where old_value = &#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    -- Uses the HASHTEXT() index\r\n    explain analyze\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail \r\n    where hashtext(old_value) = hashtext(&#39;Gold Kerrison Neuro&#39;);\r\n\r\n    -- Uses the tri-gram() index\r\n    explain analyze\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail \r\n    where old_value::text LIKE &#39;%Gold Kerrison Neuro%&#39;;\r\n    \r\nThe hash index provides the nicest syntax because it&#39;s transparent...but the hash index is the worst in every other way. Here&#39;s a size search and results. I&#39;ve added reported index building times manually here.\r\n\r\n    select\r\n    &#39;B-tree on LEFT(old_value,1024)::citext&#39; as index_description,\r\n    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size (&#39;record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_btree&#39;)) as pretty\r\n     \r\n    union all\r\n     \r\n    select\r\n    &#39;B-tree on HASHTEXT(old_value)&#39; as index_description,\r\n    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size (&#39;record_changes_log_detail_old_value_hash_ix_btree&#39;)) as pretty\r\n    \r\n    union all\r\n    \r\n    select\r\n    &#39;Hash index on old_value&#39; as index_description,\r\n    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size (&#39;record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_hash&#39;)) as pretty\r\n         \r\n    union all\r\n    \r\n    select\r\n    &#39;GIN tri-gram index on old_value&#39; as index_description,\r\n    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size (&#39;record_changes_log_detail_old_value_ix_tgrm&#39;)) as pretty;\r\n\r\n    \r\n    index_description\t                    pretty  seconds\r\n    B-tree on LEFT(old_value,1024)::citext\t238 MB       38\r\n    B-tree on HASHTEXT(old_value)\t        166 MB        7\r\n    Hash index on old_value\t                362 MB    3,802\r\n    GIN tri-gram index on old_value         106 MB       56\r\n\r\nI&#39;d say this data is a terrible match for a hash index, so please don&#39;t take those results as typical. Still, the time and size are pretty bad. The clear winner for = searches is Erwin Brandstetter&#39;s clever suggestion to B-tree a hash. Nice! The extra syntactic sugar needed for the search isn&#39;t as bad here as for the LEFT-based index. Looking forward, this will benefit from the B-tree improvements promised in PG 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd more good news, the *tri-gram index is awesome*. Laurenz Albe suggested trying it out, and I&#39;m happy I did. Instantaneous contains/like searches, perfect. That&#39;s just what I need. Here again, I doubt that the index size is typical...my data is weird. For those using citext, note that you have to cast the search condition to text for the index to be used:\r\n\r\n    select * from record_changes_log_detail \r\n    where old_value::text LIKE &#39;%Gold Kerrison Neuro%&#39;;\r\n\r\nFor those who don&#39;t know, tri-grams are an instance of n-grams with a length of 3. N-grams are sometimes called q-grams or k-grams. Whatever, it&#39;s the same thing. Of all of the naive (non-probabilistic or statistical) fuzzy text matching algorithms, it&#39;s probably the best. Robust over different data sets and languages, flexible, awesome. So I&#39;m super pleased at how well it works in Postgres.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002565/searching-on-expression-indexes","title":"Searching on expression indexes"},{"tags":["html","css","formatting"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":337,"user_id":11596448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hIJs39yPB34/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfD_7wUJBhRH2zib0LPMqUyBUrk3g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Robin Baby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11596448/robin-baby"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568856957,"post_id":58002564,"comment_id":102410674,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002564/learning-css-encountering-problems-with-vertical-borders#comment102410674_58002564"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12087760,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d806f19a7a5c273c42da83fbbf43417?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kabookieman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087760/kabookieman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568939778,"post_id":58002623,"comment_id":102444020,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002564/learning-css-encountering-problems-with-vertical-borders/58002623#comment102444020_58002623"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1781,"user_id":2495619,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d764123042edf1d10ff0b94b4046790?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thomas Byy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2495619/thomas-byy"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568857524,"creation_date":1568857524,"answer_id":58002623,"question_id":58002564,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002623","body_markdown":"I assume this is your page...You shouldn&#39;t try and combine multiple borders to make one long one.

The use case is that the namespace doing the overriding wants to make a var `nilable`.\r\n\r\nAs a simplified example, let&#39;s say that the core namespace has the following specs:\r\n\r\n    (ns ns-test.core\r\n      (:require [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]))\r\n\r\n    (s/def ::string-spec string?)\r\n\r\n    (s/def ::string-vec (s/coll-of ::string-spec))\r\n\r\nThen the override namespace wants to use the `::string-vec` spec but wants to make the individual elements nilable strings. When I implement it this way:\r\n\r\n    (ns ns-test.override\r\n      (:require [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\r\n                [ns-test.core       :as c]))\r\n\r\n    (prn &quot;1&quot; (s/valid? ::c/string-vec [&quot;s&quot;]))\r\n    (prn &quot;2&quot; (s/valid? ::c/string-vec [nil]))\r\n\r\n    (in-ns &#39;ns-test.core)\r\n\r\n    (s/def ::string-spec (s/nilable string?))\r\n\r\n    (in-ns &#39;ns-test.override)\r\n\r\n    (prn &quot;3&quot; (s/valid? ::c/string-vec [&quot;s&quot;]))\r\n    (prn &quot;4&quot; (s/valid? ::c/string-spec nil))\r\n    (prn &quot;5&quot; (s/valid? ::c/string-vec [nil]))\r\n\r\nIt changes the `::c/string-spec` but not the `::c/string-vec`, and I do not want to copy all the dependent specs and redefine them as they are not changing from the definition other than the single var that is used in many other places.\r\n\r\n    &quot;1&quot; true                                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\n    &quot;2&quot; false                                                                                                                                                                                                \r\n    #namespace[ns-test.core]\r\n    :ns-test.core/string-spec\r\n    #namespace[ns-test.override]\r\n    &quot;3&quot; true                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n    &quot;4&quot; true                                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n    &quot;5&quot; false                                                                                                                                                                                                \r\n\r\nIs there any way to accomplish this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002549/overriding-clojure-spec-in-a-different-namespace","title":"Overriding Clojure spec in a different namespace"},{"tags":["android","javadoc"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":677,"user_id":5146268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKNvl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carsten Hagemann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5146268/carsten-hagemann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568867505,"post_id":58003419,"comment_id":102412482,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002547/auto-generate-version-value-in-javadoc/58003419#comment102412482_58003419"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8052,"user_id":4326936,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71a107e53f14a27c4e83fb0adae2552c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alijandro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4326936/alijandro"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568864489,"creation_date":1568864489,"answer_id":58003419,"question_id":58002547,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58003419","body_markdown":"For the second form, you can put your custom tag at the beginning of a javadoc line.\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * This is a class of Foo&lt;br/&gt;\r\n     *\r\n     * @version\r\n     *\r\n     * @configVersion.\r\n     */\r\n\r\nThen use command `javadoc -version -tag configVersion.:a:&quot;2.2.2&quot;` to generate your javadoc, the custom tag should be handled in this way.

expression of this question is same as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47749160/what-is-uefis-boot-sequence, but it doesn&#39;t seem what I want. I&#39;d like to know UEFI sequence in instruction perspective.\r\n\r\nFor example, in case of BIOS boot mode, in simplified fashion,\r\n\r\n- Computer power is on.\r\n- Content of BIOS chip attached to motherboard performs the POST(Power On Self Test) process.\r\n- BIOS searches for MBR(Master Boot Record)s, which has boot signature in preset boot device order.\r\n- If MBR with boot signature is found, load the first sector (512 bytes) of the device to DRAM, address 0x7C00. This loaded sector (512 bytes) becomes the &quot;first stage bootloader&quot;.\r\n- BIOS transfers control to this first stage bootloader. In other words, opcode located at physical memory address 0x7C00 in DRAM is executed.\r\n\r\n[![Image][1]][1]\r\n\r\nRelated article:\r\nhttps://neosmart.net/wiki/mbr-boot-process/\r\n\r\nBut,\r\n\r\nin case of UEFI, I&#39;m having trouble grasping this sequence.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve already glanced UEFI spec documentation and OS Dev UEFI part.\r\n\r\nUEFI:\r\nhttps://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_8_final.pdf\r\n\r\nOS Dev:\r\nhttps://wiki.osdev.org/UEFI\r\n\r\nIt seems this efi_main() function works as the point equivalent to 0x7C00 in BIOS mode. But how?\r\n\r\nIs UEFI firmware doing something like\r\n\r\n`jmp efi_main`\r\n\r\nafter performing a series of jobs?\r\n\r\n**Q1. How is UEFI boot mode flows?**\r\n\r\n**Q2. Is there a good UEFI example or tutorial like brokenthorn that of BIOS based?**\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen the news (which years have passed already) that Intel removes BIOS support by 2020.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.anandtech.com/show/12068/intel-to-remove-bios-support-from-uefi-by-2020\r\n\r\nIt says\r\n\r\n`Once CSM is removed, the new platforms will be unable to run 32-bit operating systems, unable to use related software (at least natively), and unable to use older hardware, such as RAID HBAs (and therefore older hard drives that are connected to those HBAs), network cards, and even graphics cards that lack UEFI-compatible vBIOS (launched before 2012 – 2013)`\r\n\r\n**Q3. Doesn&#39;t it mean that everything related to BIOS booting (first stage bootloader at 0x7C00 and BIOS interrupts and etc) becomes deprecated?**\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/QIzyq.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002542/how-does-uefi-boot-mode-boot-flows","title":"How does UEFI boot mode boot flows?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","oop","sympy","python-object"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":894,"user_id":4179022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/061d08af68ac1d3a18b667fa43678bb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sother","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4179022/sother"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569001389,"post_id":58028416,"comment_id":102468108,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002540/how-to-add-a-generator-to-a-sympy-poly-object/58028416#comment102468108_58028416"},{"owner":{"reputation":4899,"user_id":1089161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e106a28e171b4407171702b182759f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"smichr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1089161/smichr"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":894,"user_id":4179022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/061d08af68ac1d3a18b667fa43678bb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sother","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4179022/sother"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569013778,"post_id":58028416,"comment_id":102472265,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002540/how-to-add-a-generator-to-a-sympy-poly-object/58028416#comment102472265_58028416"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4899,"user_id":1089161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e106a28e171b4407171702b182759f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"smichr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1089161/smichr"},"last_editor":{"reputation":894,"user_id":4179022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/061d08af68ac1d3a18b667fa43678bb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sother","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4179022/sother"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569003075,"last_edit_date":1569003075,"creation_date":1568982510,"answer_id":58028416,"question_id":58002540,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58028416","body_markdown":"If you convert the Polys in the matrices to expressions it would work. \r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; expected_matrix.applyfunc(lambda x:x.as_expr())==actual_matrix.applyfunc(lambda x:x.as_expr())\r\n    True\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002540/how-to-add-a-generator-to-a-sympy-poly-object/58028416#58028416","title":"How to add a generator to a Sympy Poly object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":894,"user_id":4179022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/061d08af68ac1d3a18b667fa43678bb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sother","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4179022/sother"},"last_editor":{"reputation":894,"user_id":4179022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/061d08af68ac1d3a18b667fa43678bb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sother","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4179022/sother"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569003075,"creation_date":1568856487,"last_edit_date":1569000406,"question_id":58002540,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002540","body_markdown":"I am writing some tests for my sympy code, and naturally I need to compare two sympy matrices.  Each matrix contains objects of type `Poly` as its entries (actually, it contains objects of a class that I created which extends the `Poly` class, but that shouldn&#39;t make a difference). \r\n\r\nThe problem is that when I try to compare these objects in the tests, the even though the expressions are the same, generators are different, yielding a failing test even though they are the same.   \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    from sympy.matrices import Matrix \r\n\r\n    expected_matrix = Matrix([[Poly(1.0*y1 + 2.0*x2 + 1.0*x1, y1, x2, x1, domain=&#39;RR&#39;)]])\r\n\r\n    actual_matrix = Matrix([[Poly(1.0*y1 + 1.0*x2, y2, y1, x2, x1, domain=&#39;RR&#39;) + Poly(1.0*x2 + 1.0*x1, y2, y1, x2, x1, domain=&#39;RR&#39;)]])\r\n\r\n    # however, when these get compared, they don&#39;t agree because notice that the `y2` generator does not appear in the `expected_matrix`.\r\n    \r\n\r\nMy question is how to make the generators equal.  How do I add generators to the actual output?  Or, take the generators away from the expected output?  \r\n\r\nSince the `gens` attribute is a tuple, it makes this difficult, because I cannot just add an element to the `gens` attribute:\r\n\r\n    actual_matrix.gens = expected_matrix.gens\r\n\r\nPerhaps I could compare the expressions alone, but that seems risky to me (unless someone with more experience with this can convince me otherwise).\r\n\r\nHow do I compare these two things?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002540/how-to-add-a-generator-to-a-sympy-poly-object","title":"How to add a generator to a Sympy Poly object?"},{"tags":["php","laravel","laravel-nova"],"owner":{"reputation":603,"user_id":5583517,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SM0eSV1ZHCY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKg/8rByRRu-3EY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5583517/mena"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2137,"user_id":6310593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95c8c1b1dd4a0e7235b6b885ce88b870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaartenDev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6310593/maartendev"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568881315,"creation_date":1568856484,"last_edit_date":1568881315,"question_id":58002539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002539","body_markdown":"I recently purchased a nova license and downloaded v2.3.0 and added it to a laravel API project.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to access nova via the default route `localhost:8000/nova` I get an **AuthenticationException** error but when I go to `localhost:8000/nova/login` I am able to reach the login page.

if this has been asked before but I can&#39;t seem to find the answer. I&#39;m super new to html/java/django but I feel like this shouldn&#39;t be this hard and is a stupid question but I&#39;m going crazy over it. I&#39;m making a web app that pulls json data from firebase so I&#39;m using python/pyrebase/django etc. and I simply need to access a json object from my database and put it into an html table. It all works great, except accessing the child that has spaces in it (unfortunately I need to keep the spaces in for my mobile app purposes). I assumed it would be the same at dot/bracket notation but this doesn&#39;t seem to work. I&#39;ve also tried declaring a variable `&lt;script&gt; var score = &#39;JUDGE A     RUN 1: &#39;; &lt;/script&gt;`  and using `result.score` with no luck but maybe I&#39;m putting it in the wrong spot or something silly. \r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            \r\n            &lt;table class=&quot;table table-striped&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;thead&gt;\r\n                &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                    &lt;th&gt;BIB&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                    &lt;th&gt;Ridername&lt;/th&gt; \r\n                    &lt;th&gt;Stance&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                    &lt;th&gt;Score&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n              &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n              &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n                {% for result in data%}\r\n                &lt;tr&gt; \r\n                    &lt;td&gt;{{ result.bib }}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;! works! &gt;\r\n                    &lt;td&gt;{{ result.ridername }}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;! works! &gt;\r\n                    &lt;td&gt;{{ result.stance}}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;! works! &gt;\r\n                    &lt;td&gt;{{ result[&#39;JUDGE A RUN 1: &#39;] }}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;! doesn&#39;t work :( &gt;\r\n                &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n                {% endfor %}\r\n              &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n            &lt;/table&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nThe data looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = [ \r\n    {\r\n        &#39;JUDGE A RUN 1: &#39;: &#39;10&#39;, \r\n        &#39;JUDGE A RUN 2: &#39;: &#39;11&#39;, \r\n        &#39;JUDGE A RUN 3: &#39;: &#39;13&#39;, \r\n        &#39;JUDGE B RUN 1: &#39;: &#39;13&#39;, \r\n        &#39;JUDGE B RUN 2: &#39;: &#39;14&#39;, \r\n        &#39;JUDGE B RUN 3: &#39;: &#39;15&#39;, \r\n        &#39;bib&#39;: &#39;01&#39;, \r\n        &#39;category&#39;: &#39;ProMen&#39;, \r\n        &#39;ridername&#39;: &#39;Test&#39;, \r\n        &#39;score&#39;: &#39;-&#39;, \r\n        &#39;stance&#39;: &#39;R&#39;\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n        &#39;JUDGE A RUN 1: &#39;: &#39;20&#39;,\r\n        &#39;bib&#39;: &#39;02&#39;, \r\n        &#39;category&#39;: &#39;ProMen&#39;, \r\n        &#39;ridername&#39;: &#39;Tester&#39;, \r\n        &#39;score&#39;: &#39;-&#39;, \r\n        &#39;stance&#39;: &#39;G&#39;\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any help.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002513/accessing-json-objects-with-spaces-in-html-table","title":"Accessing json objects with spaces in html table"},{"tags":["regex"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2253,"user_id":327544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YZVB.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"133794m3r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/327544/133794m3r"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568948333,"post_id":58002659,"comment_id":102445575,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002512/regex-pattern-that-matches-all-possible-variants-of-a-regex-pattern-that-matches/58002659#comment102445575_58002659"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19470,"user_id":6553328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9vHq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Emma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6553328/emma"},"last_editor":{"reputation":19470,"user_id":6553328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9vHq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Emma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6553328/emma"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568858312,"last_edit_date":1568858312,"creation_date":1568857895,"answer_id":58002659,"question_id":58002512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002659","body_markdown":"I&#39;m guessing that maybe you&#39;re trying to write some expression similar to:\r\n\r\n    ^\\/\\[([A-Za-z0-9])(?!\\1)([A-Za-z0-9])(?!\\2)([A-Za-z0-9])\\]\\/\r\n\r\n###[Demo](https://regex101.com/r/B1AU7p/1/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nIf you wish to simplify/modify/explore the expression, it&#39;s been explained on the top right panel of [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/r/YljSYx/1/).

I appreciate any help in identifying the underlying idea behind this macro.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#=\r\nexamples\r\nx =&gt; b =&gt; c  ==&gt; b = m[1](x) ; c = m[2](b)\r\nx =&gt; 3 ==&gt; x =&gt; a =&gt; a =&gt; a ==&gt; x = m[1](a); a = m[1](a); a = m[1](a)\r\n(x, m) =&gt; a =&gt; b =&gt; c ==&gt; a = m[1](x , m); b = m[2](b); c = m[3](b)\r\n((x, m) =&gt; x) =&gt; 3 ==&gt; (x = m[1](x, m)); (x = m[2](x, m)); (x = m[3](x, m))\r\n(((x, m) =&gt; x:(x, m)) =&gt; 3) ==&gt; (x = m[1](x,m)); (x = m[2](x,m)) ;(x = m[3](x,m))\r\n=#\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn example of macro use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst decoder = gpu(Stack(\r\n    @nntopo((e, m, mask):e → pe:(e, pe) → t → (t:(t, m, mask) → t:(t, m, mask)) → $N:t → c),\r\n    PositionEmbedding(512),\r\n    (e, pe) -&gt; e .+ pe,\r\n    Dropout(0.1),\r\n    [TransformerDecoder(512, 8, 64, 2048) for i = 1:N]...,\r\n    Positionwise(Dense(512, length(labels)), logsoftmax)\r\n))\r\n\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002496/need-help-understanding-nntopo-macro-in-julias-attention-mechanism-transformers","title":"Need help understanding nntopo macro in Julia&#39;s Attention mechanism Transformers.jl package"},{"tags":["excel","vba","copy","copy-paste"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":638,"user_id":11767140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Tbfr3YlhoOs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/4_25j9xubwc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Garc&#237;a Bodego","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11767140/david-garc%c3%ada-bodego"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568872099,"post_id":58002491,"comment_id":102413721,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002491/how-to-copy-a-sheet-and-then-add-a-name-plus-the-copied-sheet-name#comment102413721_58002491"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0fd126be92bf10f6c358e6817eba794?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shawn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087542/shawn"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":638,"user_id":11767140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Tbfr3YlhoOs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/4_25j9xubwc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Garc&#237;a Bodego","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11767140/david-garc%c3%ada-bodego"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568896660,"post_id":58002491,"comment_id":102426499,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002491/how-to-copy-a-sheet-and-then-add-a-name-plus-the-copied-sheet-name#comment102426499_58002491"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0fd126be92bf10f6c358e6817eba794?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shawn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087542/shawn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1958,"user_id":2463836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O1wDn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Caconde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2463836/caconde"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568862064,"creation_date":1568855956,"last_edit_date":1568862064,"question_id":58002491,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002491","body_markdown":"So i am trying to create a excel sheet with data for different app names that copy each time to the tab,but in front of it i want one tab to say contains (app name) and Equal to(app name). \r\n\r\nI cant seem to find a away to do that here i know how to copy but not how to copy and add to existing  name in the sheet.

New OAuth Certificates have recently been added in the Google API Console to handle each flavor of our app since each flavor has a different package name. Users are able to connect to Google Fit and upload our app&#39;s data to Google Fit, however, I&#39;ve ran into some strange issues with the OAuth Consent Screen.\r\n\r\nWhen requesting access to Google Fit, the user is prompted to pick an account to link to Google Fit. Once an account is picked, the OAuth Consent Screen is shown. I recently updated the OAuth Consent Screen info in the Google API Console to have the scopes match the scopes being requested in this particular app. I was surprised and excited that this was no longer one page of permissions but users can now pick and choose which &quot;scope&quot; permissions they want to allow - similar to Apple&#39;s Health Kit.\r\n\r\nIf the user accepts all of the permissions, they are able to connect to Google Fit just fine and data will upload. But if the user does not accept all of the permissions and hits accept, the OAuth Consent Screen will close and then reappear from the beginning and forces the user to go through accepting or denying each &quot;scope&quot; screen all over again. This doesn&#39;t happen EVERY time one scope is denied, but happens most of the time. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a way to fix this?

So it starts with N1-&gt;N2-&gt;N3-&gt;N4-&gt;N5-&gt;N6.\r\nThen when going to N1 realises that it has hit this point already, so moves out in its continuous line N1-&gt;N8, and then continues :\r\n\r\n -  N8-&gt;N15-&gt;N16-&gt;N9 (and also connects to N2)\r\n -  N9-&gt;N18-&gt;N17-&gt;N10 (and also connects to N3)\r\n -  ......\r\n -  ....N24-&gt;N7 (and also connects to N6)\r\n -  N7-&gt;N14-&gt;N13-&gt;N8 - where it realises that the node it should &quot;also connect to&quot; is one that it&#39;s already done (ie it&#39;s back where it started for this level), so moves back to N13 and creates the node for the next level out and then continues from there.\r\n\r\nSo this will require a bit of smarts to know which node to &quot;also connect to&quot;, etc, but it must follow a regular general pattern and so be straightforward to implement/maintain.\r\n\r\nOption 2) Both approaches (yours, and my option (1)) are great for an initial setup according to a fixed pattern, but what if you also need (now or in the future) at add new nodes on demand ?   eg, suppose you have a requirement to allow a graph to be built up by dropping nodes in a sequence (but always connecting to at least one pre-existing) : N1, N2, N6, N5, N8, N15, N16, N9\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s consider that last one, adding N9 to N16.  Looking at the graph, we can immediately see that it must also connect to N2 - but how can we program that ?   There are two options (again !! ) :\r\n\r\nOption 2a) When adding each node (such as N9 to N16), we recursively traverse the entire tree, accumulating offsets (how far up/down and left/right from N9 we are) until we find a matching node.   IMHO, complex and timeconsuming\r\n\r\nOption 2b) Once each node has been placed, it can calculate its coordinates in the graph from that of the node it is attached to - eg, our sequence becomes :\r\n\r\nN1(0,0) , N2(1,0) , N6(-1,-1),  N5(0,-2), N8(-1,1), N15(0,2), N16(1,2), N9(2,1)\r\n\r\nSo now, when adding node N9, we can obviously calculate the coordinates of any nodes that it should be attached to - (1,0) and (3,1) - and so simply iterate straight across the list looking for any existing nodes at those coordinates (and thus immediately finding N2).   Coordinates could also be handy for other uses (displaying, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58002470/how-can-i-create-a-honeycomb-network-topology-by-representing-a-graph-as-an-adja/58019942#58019942","title":"How can I create a Honeycomb network topology by representing a graph as an adjacency list"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":3331389,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6737bfb1f8fd8786a0d98d0856942cff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kaushikf9t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3331389/kaushikf9t"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58019942,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568935409,"creation_date":1568855787,"question_id":58002470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58002470","body_markdown":"Given N nodes, I want to build a graph of honeycomb network out of it. It can be a complete one like an SMn where number of nodes is given by 6n^2 or can have more than a strict SMn, say 50 nodes, which has 26 nodes more than an SM2. Goal is to build an adjacency list where each node can have a maximum degree of 3. \r\n\r\nGiven 50 nodes to create a honeycomb network out of, I pick the first 6 nodes from a queue and treat it as a bipartite graph. N1, N3 and N5 are black nodes, N2, N4 and N6 are white. Build the initial adjacency list creating a cycle N1-&gt;N2-&gt;N3-&gt;N4-&gt;N5-&gt;N6 -&gt;N1, call it layer 1 nodes.  \r\n\r\nThere is room to add 6 new nodes, one to each vertex of the hexagon, so I get 6 more nodes from the queue, 3 black and 3 white and connect the opposites and call them layer 2.

   property &quot;sonar.java.test.binaries&quot;, &quot;build/classes/java/test&quot;\r\n\r\nLastly, as the [documentation][1] explains, the best place to configure `sonar.login` is not in

I&#39;m actually going to have it count 4 times on a page, but so far what I have is taking too long. \r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/tony-blackford/pen/wvwYQqx\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction animateValue(id, start, end, duration) {\r\n  var range = end - start;\r\n  var current = start;\r\n  var increment = end &gt; start? 1 : -1;\r\n  var stepTime = Math.abs(Math.floor(duration / range));\r\n  var obj = document.getElementById(id);\r\n  var timer = setInterval(function() {\r\n    current += increment;\r\n    obj.innerHTML = current;\r\n    if (current == end) {\r\n      clearInterval(timer);\r\n    }\r\n  }, stepTime);\r\n   }\r\n\r\nanimateValue(&#39;value&#39;, 0, 1004945, 3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will do the count, I found the code online somewhere I don&#39;t recall, but given that the number is so large it is taking way too long. So I&#39;m hoping someone can either help me with this code, or point me to a better option.
