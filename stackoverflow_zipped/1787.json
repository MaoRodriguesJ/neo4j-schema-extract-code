Is there any way I can make EF core store the current value of Volume in its own column when i persist the entity?\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s my core question. I&#39;m not allowed to share my actual code, but here&#39;s some more in-depth information about my real-world entity(let&#39;s call it &quot;Box&quot;):\r\n\r\n- My Box has 18 properties of which 6 are collections of sub entities, defining one-to-many relationships with these, so you could call it an aggregate root. \r\n- Every property, including the sub-entity collections contribute to a &quot;grand total&quot;, let&#39;s call it &quot;volume&quot;, that&#39;s exposed as a public property. Whenever a property is changed or a sub-entity is added or removed, the volume will change.\r\n- In my view I need to list out every Box, but I only need to show 5 properties, one of them being the volume, which is why I&#39;d like to store it in a database field every time i persist an entity.\r\n\r\nSome ideas on how to solve this:\r\n\r\n1. Completely hydrate every Box, and calculate the volume for each and THEN project this to a summary. This includes joining all seven tables for each box with sub-entities, doing the calculation for each box and projecting to simplified view models. To me this just seems like a lot of overhead to get a number i knew at the time of persisting.\r\n2. Create a &quot;persistence DTO&quot; for Box and all sub-entities and then just map the result of Volume to a volume auto-property on the dto when storing. This also seems like a lot of overhead for just storing one number, and It also seems to be in complete discord with how EF is supposed to work. I just want to persist my entities.\r\n3. I could go proper OO on Box and create private fields and proper setters for every property, that updates a private volume field whenever a setter is called. This would also include writing methods on Box for manipulating all collections of sub-entities, and presenting these as read-only collections. This would lead to a lot of overhead private fields and code duplication on every setter, but does seem more &quot;prudent&quot; than the above alternatives.\r\n4. I could turn Volume in to a CalculateVolume() method and create a Volume-property using fluent API, and then populate that property in a SaveChanges() override on the context. But overriding SaveChanges is the kind of EF gung-ho I&#39;m not comfortable doing.\r\n5. I Could to something like this:\r\n```\r\npublic class Box\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n    public int Height { get; set; }\r\n    public int Width { get; set; }\r\n    public int Depth { get; set; }\r\n    public int Volume {\r\n        get =&gt; CalculateVolume(); \r\n        private set =&gt; _volume = value; }\r\n    private int _volume;\r\n    private int CalculateVolume() =&gt; Height * Width * Depth;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhich does seem to do what I want, but for some reason feels like cheating, and polluting my domain entity. Also I&#39;m unsure this actually works in all cases, but this is my preferred solution at the time of writing.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d prefer to be able to just configure this using fluent API. I noticed the PropertyBuilder.ValueGeneratedOnAdd()-method description says &quot;The value may be generated by a client-side value generator or may be generated by the database as part of saving the entity.&quot;, but I can&#39;t find any examples of client-side value-generation.\r\n\r\nAny and all reasonable feedback welcome.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nJust to clarify: The actual calculation is pretty complex and uses values from 7 different tables. There&#39;s also a weighting of each property involved. The Box example at the start is over simplified and for explanation purposes only. Suffice to say, I need to keep the calculation in my code. I just want to store the result.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116856/store-computed-property-with-entity-framework-core","title":"Store computed property with Entity Framework Core"},{"tags":["c#",".net","model-view-controller","summernote","viewbag"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":505,"user_id":5855884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62579b796ab87602b4bbafd4e8e27b63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jishan siddique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855884/jishan-siddique"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569501810,"post_id":58116852,"comment_id":102623157,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116852/put-value-of-viewbag-in-summernote-editor#comment102623157_58116852"},{"owner":{"reputation":505,"user_id":5855884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62579b796ab87602b4bbafd4e8e27b63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jishan siddique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855884/jishan-siddique"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569501970,"post_id":58116852,"comment_id":102623245,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116852/put-value-of-viewbag-in-summernote-editor#comment102623245_58116852"},{"owner":{"reputation":1061,"user_id":1955268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNvCE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Priyank Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1955268/priyank-panchal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569502963,"post_id":58116852,"comment_id":102623804,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116852/put-value-of-viewbag-in-summernote-editor#comment102623804_58116852"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12124977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDOvwFDDyohko37_KOyZKLfeNgq1yt_Pz-qGW2U=k-s128","display_name":"Bilal khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12124977/bilal-khan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":505,"user_id":5855884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62579b796ab87602b4bbafd4e8e27b63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jishan siddique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855884/jishan-siddique"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569556324,"post_id":58116852,"comment_id":102642657,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116852/put-value-of-viewbag-in-summernote-editor#comment102642657_58116852"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12124977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDOvwFDDyohko37_KOyZKLfeNgq1yt_Pz-qGW2U=k-s128","display_name":"Bilal khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12124977/bilal-khan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1061,"user_id":1955268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNvCE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Priyank Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1955268/priyank-panchal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569556799,"post_id":58116852,"comment_id":102642745,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116852/put-value-of-viewbag-in-summernote-editor#comment102642745_58116852"},{"owner":{"reputation":1061,"user_id":1955268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNvCE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Priyank Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1955268/priyank-panchal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569564953,"post_id":58116852,"comment_id":102644784,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116852/put-value-of-viewbag-in-summernote-editor#comment102644784_58116852"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12124977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDOvwFDDyohko37_KOyZKLfeNgq1yt_Pz-qGW2U=k-s128","display_name":"Bilal khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12124977/bilal-khan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2874,"user_id":3987854,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OV64v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"squareskittles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3987854/squareskittles"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569502059,"creation_date":1569501041,"last_edit_date":1569502059,"question_id":58116852,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116852","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve tried many solutions but nothing is working.

An element that has `position: fixed` will have the default `left`,`right`,`top`, and `bottom` styles set as `auto`. This will position `.d3` to the top-left of `.d2`, and then the `left: 83px` style will push it to the left from there. \r\n\r\n## Making up the additional space.. ##\r\nHowever, to get that additional movement to the right as the original markup, you will need to add `margin-left: 8px`, which will make-up the additional ~8px needed to replicate the original. Further adjustments to the position of `.d3` will need to be done by setting the `margin` style (*see below*).\r\n\r\n## Your updated code should look like this.. ##\r\n ```\r\n.d1 {\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    background-color: yellow;\r\n    height: 50px;\r\n    width: 100px;\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.d2 {\r\n   position: absolute;\r\n   background-color: green;\r\n   height: 25px;\r\n   width: 50px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.d3 {\r\n  position: fixed;\r\n  margin-left: 8px;\r\n  left: 83px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Some considerations and caveats.. ##\r\nAs a previous commenter mentioned, best practice would be to fix your html markup because this solution could cause issues if you ever need to move the position of `.d3`. For example, setting `left`,`right`,`top`, or `bottom` will cause the default setting of this style, `auto`, from being unset, and the element will be positioned relative to the viewport rather than the parent `relative` or `absolute` element.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116831/absolute-div-inside-absolute-div-cuts-off-with-respect-to-relative-position/58117547#58117547","title":"absolute div inside absolute div cuts off with respect to relative position"}],"owner":{"reputation":322,"user_id":4380823,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100008283973173/picture?type=large","display_name":"Imam Bux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4380823/imam-bux"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569503363,"creation_date":1569500968,"question_id":58116831,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116831","body_markdown":"I have 3 divs on top of each other having following css.\r\n\r\n    .d1 {\r\n    \tposition: relative;\r\n    \tbackground-color: yellow;\r\n    \theight: 50px;\r\n    \twidth: 100px;\r\n    \toverflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .d2 {\r\n    \tposition: absolute;\r\n    \tbackground-color: green;\r\n    \theight: 25px;\r\n    \twidth: 50px;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .d3 {\r\n    \tposition: absolute;\r\n    \tleft: 83px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nand the divs that have classes are as follows:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;d1&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;d2&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;d3&quot;&gt;text&lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nand as a result I see content of d3 cut off because of overflow:hidden in d1.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I avoid cut off content of d3 without modifying d1?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/IdUqM.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116831/absolute-div-inside-absolute-div-cuts-off-with-respect-to-relative-position","title":"absolute div inside absolute div cuts off with respect to relative position"},{"tags":["reactjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1539,"user_id":11126534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0edb5159d7bad3d2fe37a313b340684?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mgarcia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11126534/mgarcia"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569509255,"post_id":58116830,"comment_id":102627759,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116830/when-i-submit-the-for-it-show-the-error-and-says-please-include-a-valid-email#comment102627759_58116830"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11814140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YcAv9OOZbnY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/p7szOO-hG5Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kirtan patel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11814140/kirtan-patel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1539,"user_id":11126534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0edb5159d7bad3d2fe37a313b340684?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mgarcia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11126534/mgarcia"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569515041,"creation_date":1569500957,"last_edit_date":1569515041,"question_id":58116830,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116830","body_markdown":"I am getting error repeatedly for entering in valid email.

After the upgrade, our applications running in Docker containers fail to connect to SQL Server 2016 running on a standalone machine in our domain network. Reviewing the packet trace, we see that the connection hangs at the Pre-Login handshake, and eventually times out. Switching back to .NET Core 2.2 resolves the issue immediately, and our containers can again connect to our databases.\r\n\r\nWe have obviously verified that there are no DNS issues, since these containers are running in production with .NET Core 2.2. .NET Core 3.0 breaks them as they cannot connect to SQL Server over the network, so we are rolling back to 2.2 for now and terminating the upgrade until we can determine why .NET Core 2.2 containers connect to our SQL Servers but .NET Core 3.0 containers do not.\r\n\r\nWe have also created new .NET Core 3.0 projects from scratch to test the connection. The result is the same: the containers time out during Pre-Login to SQL Server. Changing the project back to .NET Core 2.2, along with EF Core back to 2.2.6, and the issue is immediately resolved.\r\n\r\nAs we are using EF Core for data access, we have also tried leaving EF Core at 2.2.6 but upgrading the project to .NET Core 3.0, but the connection still times out.\r\n\r\nIf we do not add Docker support and run the apps as Console or Web apps (not containerized), then there are no issues with .NET Core 3.0. It is only when we containerize them that .NET Core 3.0 apps fail to connect to SQL Server.\r\n\r\nPer Dan&#39;s suggestion in the comments below, I changed the data access in the test project to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient using hand-written SQL and a DataReader. I then recreated the Dockerfile for .net core 3.0 and verified that the correct container image was referenced. Same behavior: hung at PreLogin handshake with SQL Server.

catch (IOException e) {\r\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Scanner also works for csv , Scanner code :-\r\n\r\n    Scanner br;\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tbr = new Scanner(new

urlParams.get(&quot;openSidebar&quot;) == true) {\r\n          console.log(&quot;redirection happening....&quot;);\r\n    \r\n          component.set(&quot;v.showFeed&quot;, true);\r\n          component.set(&quot;v.isSidebarOpen&quot;, true);\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\nfor some reason seems that I cannot use this line **var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);** and I dont know why.\r\n\r\nAre there any alternative or salesforce way hwo to get the query string parameters from url?\r\n\r\nI am basically getting nothing, the execution seems to stop at the line where I am using **URLSearchParams**!\r\n\r\nAlso curious to know why does lightning does not let plain javascript to execute in this case?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116800/how-do-i-get-the-query-string-parameters-in-lightning-component-salesforce","title":"how do I get the query string parameters in lightning

The package contains a C++ extension, wrapped using pybind11, which links to some other libraries. \r\n\r\nI am able to compile and link the extension libraries *manually* without issue, however I am unable to configure my `setup.py` file properly such that the extension module installs when invoking `pip3 install my_package`.\r\n\r\nI have been following [this code][1] (which is linked to by the pybind11 documentation) to configure my `setup.py` file, which is included below.\r\n\r\n# Description of the Problem\r\n\r\nFor completeness, my package directory looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_package\r\n    |-setup.py\r\n    |-my_package\r\n        |-__init__.py\r\n        |-some_code.py\r\n        |-src\r\n            | my_extension.cpp\r\n            | some_header.h\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI invoke pip3 install as follows:\r\n\r\n`pip3 install --user --upgrade --disable-pip-version-check . -vvv`\r\n\r\n*(the version check is disabled as the machine does not have access to the internet)*.\r\n\r\nI can see from the output to the console that gcc appears to be invoked, but I do not know enough about the output to understand if it is invoked correctly. `my_extension` *appears* to be built without any errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuilding &#39;my_extension&#39; extension\r\n    creating build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7\r\n    creating build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/my_package\r\n    creating build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/my_package/src\r\n    gcc -pthread -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DDYNAMIC_ANNOTATIONS_ENABLED=1 -DNDEBUG -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong -grecord-gcc-switches -m64 -mtune=generic -fasynchronous-unwind-tables -fstack-clash-protection -fcf-protection -D_GNU_SOURCE -fPIC -fwrapv -fPIC -I/usr/local/include/python3.7m -I/home/&lt;my_user&gt;/.local/include/python3.7m -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I/usr/include/python3.7m -c my_package/src/my_extension.cpp -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/my_package/src/my_extension.o -O3 -fPIC -march=native -DVERSION_INFO=&quot;0.0.1&quot; -std=c++14 -fvisibility=hidden\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/pybind/python_example/blob/master/setup.py\r\n\r\nHowever, for whatever reason, `my_extension` cannot be found by the python interpreter.

That&#39;s why we set the FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS in all other activities. This prevents the other activities from appearing in the list of recent activities - as long the activity is not the current one. However, if an activity (let&#39;s call it Activity_A) is in the foreground then it appears in the list of recent apps too next to the LauncherActivity. Unfortunately I haven&#39;t found a way to prevent this so far. This was not a big issue up to now.\r\n\r\nHowever with the new swipe gesture for quickly switching between apps in Android 10 this causes an issue: If our app is the one the user currently uses then there are two activities in the list: the LauncherActivity and Activity_A. With the quick switch gesture the user is returned from Activity_A to the LauncherActivity. The LauncherActivity then does its checks and sends the user to a proper activity - back to Activity_A in our case. Hence the user is stuck in our app and cannot switch quickly to the app that was used last before using our app.\r\n\r\nMy questions are now:\r\nIs it somehow possible to prevent an activity from appearing in the list of recent activities even when it is the current one?\r\n\r\nIf this is not possible is there a way so that the LauncherActivity can detect that the user actually wants to switch to the previous app so that we could prevent navigating back to Activity_A in this case?\r\n\r\nAny other ideas how to allow the user to switch to the previous app are very appreciated too!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116764/being-stuck-when-using-gestural-navigation-to-switch-quickly-between-apps","title":"Being stuck when using gestural navigation to switch quickly between apps"},{"tags":["prometheus","spring-boot-actuator","micrometer","spring-micrometer"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":200,"user_id":3279191,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5ade20e0c7142642e7ca10d19e145ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Safvan Kothawala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3279191/safvan-kothawala"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569926926,"creation_date":1569926926,"answer_id":58183241,"question_id":58116760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58183241","body_markdown":"Following are the required queries:\r\n\r\nAvg Response Time per 5 min:\r\n\r\n    rate(nb_api_responsetime_sum[5m])/rate(nb_api_responsetime_count[5m])\r\n\r\nRequest Count per Min:\r\n\r\n    round(rate(nb_api_responsetime_count[1m]) * 60)\r\n\r\nSLA Meet Per Min:\r\n\r\n    sum(rate(nb_api_responsetime_bucket{le=&quot;60.0&quot;}[1m])) by (job)\r\n    /\r\n    sum(rate(nb_api_responsetime_count[1m])) by (job)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116760/publish-micrometer-metrics-to-prometheus/58183241#58183241","title":"Publish Micrometer Metrics to Prometheus"}],"owner":{"reputation":200,"user_id":3279191,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5ade20e0c7142642e7ca10d19e145ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Safvan Kothawala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3279191/safvan-kothawala"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569926926,"creation_date":1569500726,"question_id":58116760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116760","body_markdown":"I am using Spring Boot v2.1.3 and Micrometer Registry for Prometheus v1.2.1.\r\n\r\nI have created a DistributionSummary in my code and added it to PrometheusRegistry.

Yuji&#39;s excellent answer first, but I think `tar` is also a good option here:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd oridir; find . -name &quot;*.xls&quot; | xargs tar c | (cd ../newdir; tar x)\r\n```\r\nYou may need to adjust `oridir` and/or `../newdir` depending on the precise paths of your directories.\r\n\r\nPossible improvement: Here is a version that may be better in that it will handle files (and paths) with spaces (or other strange characters) in their names, and that uses `tar`&#39;s own options instead of `xargs` and `cd`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd oridir; find . -print0 -name &quot;*.xls&quot; | tar -c --null -T- | tar -C ../newdir -x\r\n```\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe `-print0` and the `--null` cause the respective commands to separate filenames by the null (ASCII 0) character only.\r\n\r\n`-T-` causes `tar` to read filenames from standard input.\r\n\r\n`-C` causes `tar` to `cd` before extracting.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116759/how-to-copy-folders-and-subfolders-which-have-selected-files/58117215#58117215","title":"How to copy folders and subfolders which have

Is the solution of returning a raw pointer to Bar the preferred option?\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a solution and not necessarily a bad one. Returning a reference would be preferable in cases where the object always exists (not in this case since `Foo`&#39;s default constructor doesn&#39;t create a `Bar`).\r\n\r\nSome programmers prefer to use a wrapper for bare pointers (such as `observer_ptr`, which has been proposed to the standard) to distinguish it from a pointer whose purpose is to iterate an array, or from owning bare pointers (latter of which should be avoided).\r\n\r\n&gt;  I have the feeling, that this brakes the encapsulation\r\n\r\nYour whole premise is to break the encapsulation since you want to *&quot;modify internal objects&quot;*. If you want to avoid breakage of encapsulation, then you may need to change the design further up so that you don&#39;t need to modify internal objects (externally).\r\n\r\nA solution that doesn&#39;t break encapsulation is to provide a specific interface to `Foo` for modification, such as:\r\n\r\n       \r\n    void Foo::transmogrify_bar(int gadgets) {\r\n        bar-&gt;transmofgrify(gadgets);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhether this encapsulation is useful for your API is another matter. In some cases it is essential, in others it doesn&#39;t matter much.\r\n\r\n&gt; if Bar would be stored in a container in Foo. Would I return a pointer to the whole container, an iterator for the container ...?\r\n\r\nWould you want the client to be able to modify the container (add, remove elements)?\r\n\r\nThis is breaking the encapsulation further. Instead, you could have `begin` and `end` iterators that don&#39;t allow modification of the container itself, which brings you to an equivalent encapsulation of the pointer return in the case of single object.\r\n\r\nYou could provide only const iterators, and add iterator as an argument to `transmogrify` to keep encapsulation of modifying `Bar`.\r\n\r\nFinally, for full encapsulation, you would need to use PIMPL pattern to hide `Bar` completely.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116728/c-api-modifing-internal-objects/58117026#58117026","title":"C++ API: Modifing internal

you worry about `getBar` breaking the encapsulation, then you should also see `void setBar(std::unique_ptr&lt;Bar&gt; newBar) ` as such a breakage.\r\n\r\nBecause allowing to set `bar` from outside does make the knowledge about `bar` possibly none exclusive to `Foo` and the one passing `Bar` to `Foo` might have still the possibility to modify the `bar` so `Foo` can no do any assumptions about the state of `Bar`, as it could change anytime.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you only want to have reading access to `Bar` trough `Foo` then a `const Bar* getBar()` or `const Bar&amp; getBar()` would

example:\r\n```\r\nclass Bar\r\n{\r\n\tpublic:\r\n\t\tBar(int x) : num(x){}\r\n\r\n\t\tvoid setNum(int x)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tnum = x;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tint getNum()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\treturn

ownership of `Bar`, however, `Bar` must be able to be modified.\r\nHere, `Foo` is the main class the user would interact with.\r\nWhilst `Bar` could be considered more as a data type, which changes the output of `Foo`. \r\n\r\nIs the solution of returning a raw pointer to `Bar` the preferred option?\r\nI have the feeling, that this brakes the encapsulation which is a no-go for API design.\r\nMy googling efforts haven&#39;t given me a concrete answer to exactly this problem yet.\r\nBut I might just be looking with the wrong search terms.\r\n\r\nThe second part to this question is, how this example would change, if `Bar` would be stored in a container in `Foo`.\r\nWould I return a pointer to the whole container, an iterator for the container

ability to include a hosted service along with the actual application is just like anything else in Core. You can use all of MVC, API and Razor Pages, all in the same project if you want, for example. However, at a certain point, it&#39;s better to break out things into separate apps, and that&#39;s the case here as well. If you only want one instance of your hosted service, you should break it out into a separate project and deploy one instance of that. If you deploy it inside your app, there will be an instance per instance of your app; there&#39;s no way around that.\r\n\r\nFWIW, if you can make the jump, ASP.NET Core 3.0 now has a worker service template that would fit the bill nicely. You don&#39;t have to upgrade to deploy the hosted service on its own, but it will make your life easier. You can also just go 3.0 for that one project; just because you&#39;re using 3.0 on one thing, doesn&#39;t mean every project has to be upgraded as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116722/how-to-ensure-only-one-instance-of-ihostedservice-is-running-within-a-net-core/58117349#58117349","title":"How to ensure only one instance of IHostedService is running within a .NET core 2.2 Web API"}],"owner":{"reputation":541,"user_id":7596217,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d19202c0c69e378ad5f6fbe1fa12edb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Geekn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7596217/geekn"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58117349,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569502758,"creation_date":1569500544,"question_id":58116722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116722","body_markdown":"I have a .NET Core 2.2 web API that can be scaled out to several instances based on demand.

Instead I excountered an error ````__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_8_jquery___default(…)(…).selectpicker is not a function````.\r\nAfter struggling for days literally, I was able to fix the issue using the answer from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52464915/react-error-webpack-imported-module-4-jquery-default-modal-is-no/52464960.\r\n\r\nThe import ````import $ from &#39;jquery&#39;```` creates a local variable named ```$``` inside your module, which then gets used by ````$(&#39;.selectpicker&#39;).selectpicker()```` (instead of the global $ you wanted).\r\n\r\nThe quickest fix would be to explicitly use the jQuery ````$```` from the global context (which has been extended with your ````$.selectpicker()```` because you referenced that in your script tag.\r\n\r\n````window.$(&#39;.selectpicker&#39;).selectpicker()````","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116697/bootstrap-select-element-not-rendered-with-react-router/58339270#58339270","title":"Bootstrap select element not rendered with react-router"}],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":10460777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UXXbo5MKi8I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DXM4Z3X-ch5HkmSd_-OkDtvtluSmA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abhinandan Madaan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10460777/abhinandan-madaan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":50,"user_id":10460777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UXXbo5MKi8I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DXM4Z3X-ch5HkmSd_-OkDtvtluSmA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abhinandan Madaan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10460777/abhinandan-madaan"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":148,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58339270,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1570789507,"creation_date":1569500417,"last_edit_date":1569841743,"question_id":58116697,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116697","body_markdown":"I am making a basic app in reactjs.

How they do that though is completely different.\r\n\r\n`std::map` uses a tree structure for its implementation.    Typically this is an RBTree but any tree that can guarantee worst case `O(logN)` operations will work.  This means it only needs to have a comparison operator for the key type since you can get total ordering and check for equality with a comparator that implements a strict weak ordering.  This means you&#39;ll never have a hash collision since you aren&#39;t using a hash.\r\n\r\n`std::unordered_map` is based on a hash table implementation.  Since it hashes the key, you need a hash operator.  You also need a comparison operator since two values could hash to the same value (hash collision).  Without the comparison operator you would not be able to tell if the duplicate hash is really a duplicate item.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58116660/why-do-we-dont-have-hash-and-pred-functors-for-a-map/58116769#58116769","title":"Why do we don&#39;t have hash and pred functors for a map?"}],"owner":{"reputation":256,"user_id":10344290,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oqLgxl4yEpk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbB95Y1eDvfGVfr9XfAdgvRogaj00A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Navjot Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10344290/navjot-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":119164,"user_id":4342498,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3j88.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NathanOliver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4342498/nathanoliver"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58116769,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569502067,"creation_date":1569500288,"last_edit_date":1569502067,"question_id":58116660,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58116660","body_markdown":"In case of `unordered_map` we define the `hash` and `pred` functors whenever we are using `user-defined` keys.\r\n\r\nThe template syntax for a map is as follows:\r\n\r\n    template &lt; class Key,                                     // map::key_type\r\n           class T,                                           // map::mapped_type\r\n           class Compare = less&lt;Key&gt;,                         // map::key_compare\r\n           class Alloc = allocator&lt;pair&lt;const Key,T&gt; &gt;       // map::allocator_type\r\n           &gt; class map;\r\n\r\nIn case of map there is no `hash` and `pred` functors option.
