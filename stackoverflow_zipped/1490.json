This however is not a full answer.\r\n\r\nThe `expand` is just a regular Python function defined in Snakemake. That means that you can use it everywhere when you can use Python. It is just an utility that takes a string and parameters for substitution, and returns the list of strings where each string is a result of a single substitution. This utility can be handy in many places. Below I&#39;m providing a fancy example that illustrates the idea. Let&#39;s imagine that you need to take a text file as an input and substitute some characters (the list should be provided from config). Let&#39;s imagine that you know the only way to do it: as a pipeline of `sed` scripts. Like that:\r\n```\r\ncat input.txt | sed &#39;s/A/a/g&#39; | sed &#39;s/B/b/g&#39; | sed &#39;s/C/c/g&#39; &gt; output.txt\r\n```\r\nYou come to the conclusion that you need to pipeline a chain of sed commands that differ in two symbols: sed &#39;s/**X**/**x**/g&#39;. Here is a solution using the `expand` function:\r\n```\r\nrule substitute:\r\n    input: &quot;input.txt&quot;\r\n    output: &quot;output.txt&quot;\r\n    params:\r\n       from = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;],\r\n       to = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]\r\n    shell: &quot;cat {input} | &quot; + &quot; | &quot;.join(expand(&quot;sed &#39;s/{from}/{to}/g&#39;&quot;, zip, from=params.from, to=params.to)) + &quot; &gt; {output}&quot;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187715/using-the-expand-function-in-snakemake-to-perform-a-shell-command-multiple-tim/58192958#58192958","title":"Using the expand() function in snakemake to perform a shell command multiple times"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":6692690,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/27790e8d64fa771f6fef7b508522a0fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wald3n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6692690/wald3n"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58188328,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569968610,"creation_date":1569942435,"question_id":58187715,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187715","body_markdown":"I would like to perform an R script multiple times on different input files with the help of snakemake.

Displaying a new set of items would use the same component, but with different data. In this case, I don&#39;t want the transition animation to occur.

Just allow survey-list to be its own block if it has its own elements. It prevents long confusing classes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187636/animating-div-enter-and-exit-in-react/58187934#58187934","title":"Animating div (enter and exit) in React"}],"owner":{"reputation":159,"user_id":9973163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mkhNwjRHEB4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2cfCzCzCiX6nrPEkNdywqrFl7rWA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Otto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9973163/otto"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569947519,"creation_date":1569942186,"question_id":58187636,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187636","body_markdown":"I want to build a simple &quot;carousel&quot; in React.

I have tried using count inside vpc_config but it is not possible to use a count statement there. Per the documentation for the resource, if you pass in empty lists as follows, the vpc_config portion is ignored:\r\n\r\n      vpc_config {\r\n        subnet_ids = []\r\n        security_group_ids = []\r\n      }\r\n\r\nI can confirm that this does work as expected (no VPC configuration is attempted). \r\n\r\nI have therefore tried using conditionals for subnet_ids and security_group_ids - something along the lines of &quot;var.vpc_function ? var.subnet_ids : [] &quot; - but you cannot pass in a list in a conditional statement. The closest I have got to a solution is the below hacky number, which joins then splits the lists:\r\n\r\n      resource &quot;aws_lambda_function&quot; &quot;lambda_function&quot; {\r\n      ...\r\n      vpc_config {\r\n        subnet_ids = [&quot;${split(&quot;,&quot;, var.vpc_function ? join(&quot;,&quot;, var.subnet_ids) : join(&quot;,&quot;, var.empty_array))}&quot;]\r\n        security_group_ids = [&quot;${split(&quot;,&quot;, var.vpc_function ? join(&quot;,&quot;, aws_security_group.lambda_security_group.*.id) : join(&quot;,&quot;, var.empty_array))}&quot;]\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    variable &quot;vpc_function&quot; {\r\n      default = &quot;false&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    variable &quot;subnet_ids&quot; {\r\n      type = &quot;list&quot;\r\n      default = [&quot;subnet-a&quot;, &quot;subnet-b&quot;]\r\n    }\r\n    variable &quot;empty_array&quot; {\r\n      type = &quot;list&quot;\r\n      default = []\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis applies fine the first time both where vpc_function is true or false, which is great, but where vpc_function is false, terraform always sees the above as a change on each reapply:\r\n\r\n      vpc_config.#:                      &quot;0&quot; =&gt; &quot;1&quot;\r\n      vpc_config.0.security_group_ids.#: &quot;0&quot; =&gt; &quot;1&quot;\r\n      vpc_config.0.security_group_ids.0: &quot;&quot; =&gt; &quot;&quot;\r\n      vpc_config.0.subnet_ids.#:         &quot;0&quot; =&gt; &quot;1&quot;\r\n      vpc_config.0.subnet_ids.0:         &quot;&quot; =&gt; &quot;&quot;\r\n\r\nI guess the problem is that my joined-then-split list is not seen as [], but rather as a list with some (blank) content. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone else have a solution for this?

refer to active workbooks...\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSub ImportOvWeb()\r\n\r\n    Dim wb1 As Workbook\r\n    Dim wb2 As Workbook\r\n    Dim PasteStart As Range\r\n    Dim sPath As String, sFile As String\r\n\r\n    Set wb1 = ActiveWorkbook\r\n    Set PasteStart = Sheets(4).Range(&quot;A2&quot;)\r\n\r\n    wb1.Sheets(4).Unprotect\r\n    \r\n    &#39; Delete all entrees from previous import\r\n    \r\n    Application.Goto (wb1.Sheets(4).Range(&quot;A2:AX500&quot;))\r\n    Selection.ClearContents\r\n    Range(&quot;A2&quot;).Select\r\n    \r\n    &#39; Import data from &#39;export.xlsm&#39;\r\n    \r\n    Application.Goto Workbooks(&quot;Export (1).XLSX&quot;&quot;).Sheets(1).Range(&quot;A2:AX500&quot;)\r\n    Selection.Copy\r\n    Application.Goto PasteStart\r\n    ActiveSheet.Paste\r\n    Range(&quot;A2&quot;).Select   \r\n    \r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187616/vba-how-to-reference-an-active-file-with-a-variable-filename","title":"VBA How to reference an active

Signature generation for RSA requires modular exponentiation using the values of the *private key*, not the public key. Modular exponentiation is also used for *encryption* with the public key. But although the same mathematical formula is used - at least on the surface - doesn&#39;t mean that signature generation is *encryption with the private key* because such a thing [*does not exist*](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/15997/1172). Current PKCS#1 standards go out of their way to explain this fact, even though *earlier* PKCS#1 standards used to identify signature generation with RSA encryption.\r\n\r\nWhat you are trying to do is to *verify* the message. That&#39;s the function you would expect rather than *sign*. Verification is performed by a *trusted public key*, not by a private key. You are not trying to decode the message, you are trying to verify that the bytes of the message are indeed signed by the private key that belongs to the same key pair as the trusted public key. Generally, the message is *not* recovered, not even partially. PKCS#1 is called signature generation with appendix, which contrasts with other schemes called signature generation *giving message recovery*. The appendix *is the signature value*, it needs to be appended (included with) the message to be of any use.\r\n\r\nActually, the fact that you can at least recover the hash *over* the message is specific to some schemes like PKCS#1 signature generation (officially called `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5` in [the standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017#section-8.2)). Other schemes such as PSS in the same standard may not even recover the hash. This is OK as long the verification (which can take place *given* the data and therefore hash) can succeed or fail. In other words, the verification should at least result in a boolean true / false, but it doesn&#39;t need to generate any other information.\r\n\r\nOr, in simplified pseudo-code:\r\n\r\n    ciphertext = encrypt(publicKey, plaintext)\r\n    (recovered) plaintext = decrypt(privateKey, ciphertext)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    signature = sign(privateKey, data)\r\n    verificationResult = verify(publicKey, data, signature)\r\n\r\nwhere the data hashing algorithm is *a configuration parameter* for the signature generation &amp; verification algorithm. If you want to include it you could e.g. include it as initial parameter:\r\n\r\n    signature = sign(SHA256alg, privateKey, data)\r\n    verificationResult = verify(SHA256alg, publicKey, data, signature)\r\n\r\n---\r\nFinally, you are talking about &quot;decoding&quot;. You decode messages that have been *encoded* using an encoding scheme. Encoding/decoding does not presume the presence of a key. We&#39;re talking about encryption / decryption and signature generation / verification instead. Examples of encoding are hexadecimals / base 64 that convert binary to text. *Character encoding* such as UTF-8 is about converting text to binary.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187594/how-to-use-decrypt-with-rsa-private-key-and-sha256-on-python/58188546#58188546","title":"How to use decrypt with RSA private key and SHA256 on python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5913,"user_id":2196561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac22ef3edb7836c3af11f5511f7942f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ebbe M.

In your case you get a `&quot;public key ≠ not private key error&quot;` as you try to use a public key in a `sign(..)` call.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen signing you don&#39;t use the full message as input to **RSA**, but instead calculates a hash (you use SHA256).

Now don&#39;t I just provide GET calls but I will also provide the possibility to add or change the data. Since my data has relations I&#39;ve resources and sub-resources, as usual, I think. Following REST to the letter I probably should create a GET, POST, PUT &amp; PATCH for every sub-resource, but since some sub-resources are so small (only few fields) I want to present these as shown here in their parent resource.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t&quot;mainResourceField1&quot;: &quot;some data&quot;,\r\n\t&quot;mainResourceField2&quot;: &quot;some other data&quot;,\r\n\t&quot;subResource&quot;: {\r\n\t\t&quot;keyField1&quot;: {\r\n\t\t\t&quot;field1&quot;: 2,\r\n\t\t\t&quot;field2&quot;: 3\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t&quot;keyField2&quot;: {\r\n\t\t\t&quot;field1&quot;: 20,\r\n\t\t\t&quot;field2&quot;: 30\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhere keyFieldn is represented by the data as stored in our db. E.g. &quot;parent&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;grandfather&quot;, or something alike. I don&#39;t want to use a list for my sub-resource, because then I can&#39;t use json-patch in my PATCH calls. This because json-patch then would look like this if field1 in sub-resource 2 had to change.\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;op&quot;: &quot;replace&quot;,\r\n        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/subResource/1/field1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: 25\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nWhile in case of the above representation it will look like:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;op&quot;: &quot;replace&quot;,\r\n        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/subResource/keyField2/field1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: 25\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nSince a REST API is stateless the first json-patch might give a wrong result because server side the second (1) list item might be different from the one the client sees. An new sub-resource might be added by someone else. Or do I make a mistake here?\r\n\r\nBut my main question is now: Using dotNet core v2.2, how can I generate the above json without creating a class per keyFieldn of the sub-resource? \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187576/how-to-use-json-patch-with-ordered-list-changes-in-a-rest-api","title":"How to use json-patch with ordered list changes in a rest api?"},{"tags":["r","tidyverse","tidyr","unnest","hoist"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569942368,"post_id":58187575,"comment_id":102755091,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187575/naming-columns-from-a-hoisted-vector-after-unnest-wider#comment102755091_58187575"},{"owner":{"reputation":16178,"user_id":6762755,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RjWGL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IceCreamToucan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6762755/icecreamtoucan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569944755,"post_id":58187575,"comment_id":102756369,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187575/naming-columns-from-a-hoisted-vector-after-unnest-wider#comment102756369_58187575"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":706,"user_id":11167644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10154948928647103/picture?type=large","display_name":"tomasu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11167644/tomasu"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569947121,"post_id":58188805,"comment_id":102757495,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187575/naming-columns-from-a-hoisted-vector-after-unnest-wider/58188805#comment102757495_58188805"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569946621,"creation_date":1569946621,"answer_id":58188805,"question_id":58187575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58188805","body_markdown":"We can convert to a `list` and set the names\r\n\r\n    library(tidyverse)\r\n    iris %&gt;%\r\n       group_by(Species) %&gt;% \r\n       nest %&gt;%\r\n       mutate(box = map(data, ~ boxplot.stats(.x[[&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;]]))) %&gt;% \r\n       mutate(stats = map(box, ~ .x$stats %&gt;%\r\n                      as.list %&gt;% \r\n                      set_names(c(&quot;min&quot;, &quot;lwr&quot;, &quot;med&quot;, &quot;upr&quot;, &quot;max&quot;)))) %&gt;% \r\n       unnest_wider(stats)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58187575/naming-columns-from-a-hoisted-vector-after-unnest-wider/58188805#58188805","title":"Naming columns from a hoisted vector after unnest_wider"}],"owner":{"reputation":706,"user_id":11167644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10154948928647103/picture?type=large","display_name":"tomasu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11167644/tomasu"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58188805,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569946621,"creation_date":1569941983,"question_id":58187575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58187575","body_markdown":"Playing around with some of the new functionality of tidyr 1.0 and I&#39;ve come across a bit of a head scratcher. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used `boxplot.stats` to get a vector of boxplot values I&#39;d like to use to plot.

new to docker. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m setting up nginx server to serve static files inside a docker container. I&#39;d like to enable nginx to start automatically on every startup inside a docker container. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried changing ENTRYPOINT, CMD and crontab when building DockerImage. But these settings to run nginx on every startup works only the first time I &quot;run&quot; a container. When I &quot;stop&quot; the container and &quot;start&quot; it again, nginx does not start automatically inside the container. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m looking for a way to start nginx on every startup of a container and my first question is &quot;is it possible to do this?&quot;\r\n\r\nMy second question is about a container cycle. Given that there are not many discussions on this subject (all discussions are about automatically running a script or sth else at the moment of &quot;run&quot;), I wonder if it is more efficient to &quot;run&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; a container each time than just &quot;stopping&quot; and &quot;starting&quot; a container.\r\n\r\nHere are the lines of code I tried for DockerImage (with crontab), which was my first try. \r\n\r\n    RUN apt-get install -y cron\r\n    COPY run_server /etc/cron.d/run_server\r\n    RUN chmod 0644 /etc/cron.d/run_server\r\n    RUN crontab /etc/cron.d/run_server\r\n    RUN touch /var/log/cron.log\r\n    CMD cron &amp;&amp; tail -f /var/log/cron.log\r\n\r\n`run_server` is a simple crontab config file which includes: \r\n\r\n    @reboot service nginx start\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this was not the solution I was looking for (it worked only when I &quot;ran&quot; a conainer, not &quot;stopped&quot; and &quot;started&quot; a container) I tried with supervisor, too. \r\n\r\n    RUN apt-get -y install supervisor &amp;&amp; \\\r\n      mkdir -p /var/log/supervisor &amp;&amp; \\\r\n      mkdir -p /etc/supervisor/conf.d\r\n    ADD supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor.conf\r\n    CMD [&quot;supervisord&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;/etc/supervisor.conf&quot;]\r\n\r\n`supervisor.confg` contains: \r\n\r\n    [supervisord]\r\n    nodaemon=true\r\n    \r\n    [program:run_server]\r\n    command=/usr/bin/python3.6 /home/server.py\r\n    autostart=true\r\n    directory=/home\r\n    redirect_stderr=true\r\n\r\n\r\nBut neither of them worked the way I wanted ..

you add an `ObservedObject` to a View, SwiftUI adds a receiver for the `objectWillChange` publisher and you need to do the same. As `objectWillChange` is sent before `isLoggedIn` changes it might be an idea to add a publisher that sends in its `didSet`. As you are interested in the initial value as well as changes a `CurrentValueSubject&lt;Bool, Never&gt;` is probably best. In your `HostViewModel` you then need to subscribe to `AppState`&#39;s new publisher and update `containedView` using the published value. Using `assign` can cause reference cycles so `sink` with a weak reference to `self` is best.\r\n\r\nNo code but it is very straight forward.
