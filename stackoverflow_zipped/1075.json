[This answer][1] contains more details on this.\r\n\r\nYou probably want someting like:\r\n\r\n - `Driver = &#39;ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server&#39;` (from @Zaynul&#39;s comment)\r\n - `Driver = &#39;ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server&#39;` (from my own context)\r\n\r\n# Database\r\n\r\nThe default database you want to connect to. Roughly equivalent to starting an SQL script with \r\n```\r\nUSE my_database\r\nGO\r\n```\r\nIf all your work will be within a single database then puts its name here.\r\n\r\nIn some contexts you should be able to leave this blank, but you then have to use the `in_schema` command to add the database name every time you connect to a table.\r\n\r\nIf you are working across multiple databases, I recommend putting the name of one database in, and then using the `in_schema` command to specify the database at every point of connection.\r\n\r\nExample using the `in_schema` command ([more details][2]):\r\n```\r\ndf = tbl(con, from = in_schema(&#39;database.schema&#39;, &#39;table&#39;))\r\n```\r\nThough I have not tried it, if you do not have a schema then\r\n```\r\ndf = tbl(con, from = in_schema(&#39;database&#39;, &#39;table&#39;))\r\n```\r\nShould also work (I&#39;ve been using this hack without issue for a while).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39440008/differences-between-drivers-for-odbc-drivers\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289494/how-do-i-access-nested-sql-tables-in-r/58293276#58293276","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286764/how-to-connect-to-sql-from-r-studio/58293846#58293846","title":"How to Connect to SQL from R Studio"}],"owner":{"reputation":758,"user_id":6661426,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PCrOF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jason Hunter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6661426/jason-hunter"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58293846,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570567429,"creation_date":1570539217,"question_id":58286764,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58286764","body_markdown":"I use _Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio_ on Windows 10 to connect to the following database and this is what the login screen looks like:\r\n\r\n    Server Type:      Database Engine\r\n    Server Name:      sqlmiprod.b298745190e.database.windows.net\r\n    Authentication:   SQL Server Authentication\r\n    Login:            my_user_id\r\n    Password:         my_password\r\n\r\n[This recent R Studio article][1] offers an easy way to connect to SQL Servers from R Studio using the following:\r\n\r\n    con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),\r\n                          Driver   = &quot;[your driver&#39;s name]&quot;,\r\n                          Server   = &quot;[your server&#39;s path]&quot;,\r\n                          Database = &quot;[your database&#39;s name]&quot;,\r\n                          UID      = rstudioapi::askForPassword(&quot;Database user&quot;),\r\n                          PWD      = rstudioapi::askForPassword(&quot;Database password&quot;),\r\n                          Port     = 1433)\r\n\r\nI have two questions\r\n\r\n1.

setNationalite(Nationalite $nationale) \r\n   {\r\n      $this-&gt;nationalite = $nationalite\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Form creation object method**\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$person = new Person();\r\n$person-&gt;setNationalite($repo-&gt;getNationaliteParDefaut());\r\n// lets say personType is your form, that also has field nationalite\r\n$form = $this-&gt;createForm(PersonType:class, $person);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this setup the form will be prepopulated with default data, from the object, including nationalite, and the user can still easilily change it.\r\n\r\n**Non object method**\r\nAnother way of doing what you want is using form events.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// in your form definition\r\n$builder-&gt;addEventListener(FormEvents::PRE_SET_DATA, function(FormEvent $event) {\r\n   $form = $event-&gt;getForm();\r\n   $data = $event-&gt;getData();\r\n   $form-&gt;add(&#39;nationalite&#39;, EntityType::class, array(\r\n       &#39;class&#39; =&gt; &#39;AppBundle:Nationalite&#39;,\r\n       &#39;choice_label&#39; =&gt; &#39;libelle&#39;,\r\n       &#39;required&#39; =&gt; false,\r\n       &#39;data&#39; =&gt; $repo-&gt;getNationaliteParDefaut()\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**About `empty_data`**\r\nEmpty data only works if the the form field is empty, eg. the user didn&#39;t select anything so the value from empty data will be used\r\nref:

build instructions provided by FMINUIT ask you to manually adapt the Makefile to your setup.  I&#39;m guessing you did one of those steps incorrectly.  I&#39;m running Octave 6.0.0 (current development sources) and worked fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ wget http://www.fis.unipr.it/~giuseppe.allodi/Fminuit/fminuit-src.tar.gz\r\n$ tar xzf fminuit-src.tar.gz\r\n$ cd fminuit-2011.05.31/fminuit/\r\n# modify Makefile.f2c_lnx.Octave\r\n$ make -f Makefile.f2c_lnx.Octave\r\n$ make -f Makefile.f2c_lnx.Octave install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tricky part is knowing what to modify on the Makefile.  For my case, these were the lines (you need to know the exact Octave version and where you installed it):\r\n\r\n```\r\n #Octave prefix directory (typically /usr or /usr/local): modify if needed\r\n-PREFIX=/usr\r\n+PREFIX=/usr/local\r\n #major version number\r\n-OCTAVE_MAJOR=2\r\n+OCTAVE_MAJOR=6\r\n #minor-release version number\r\n-OCTAVE_MINOR=9.12\r\n+OCTAVE_MINOR=0.0\r\n OBJS= mnintr_wrkrnd.o intrac.o WrapIO_Matlab.o doflush.o\r\n MINUIT=Minuit_.o\r\n INSTDIR=../bin/linux_$(ARCH)/octave$(OCTAVE_MAJOR)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fminuit Makefile will &quot;install&quot; inside the fminuit source directory. You may also want to adjust its `INSTDIR` value. You need to adjust your Octave path to use it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt; addpath(&#39;/wherever/you/build/fmunuit/fminuit-2011.05.31/bin/linux_x86_64/octave6&#39;)\r\n&gt;&gt; fminuit # you probably can figure out how to call this function \r\nerror: fminuit: Too few input arguments\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286728/building-fminuit-from-source-for-octave/58289279#58289279","title":"Building FMINUIT from source for Octave"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":5612259,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c76051a10cb3ee96f293f282ad3b576c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"damir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5612259/damir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11338,"user_id":1609556,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6fa53133932b5d2a4536232c9429d39?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"carandraug","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1609556/carandraug"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58289279,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570617709,"creation_date":1570539085,"last_edit_date":1570547159,"question_id":58286728,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58286728","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to install a package called fminuit http://www.fis.unipr.it/~giuseppe.allodi/Fminuit/Fminuit_building.html\r\non ubuntu 18.04 machine using Octave.

The version posted is as I would expect things to work, based on this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18073861/r-matching-coordinates-from-one-large-data-frame-into-grid-cells-from-another/18083544#18083544, but I get an error message. I can fix this error by removing the points of the grid from the data, but that is not what I&#39;m aiming at, and also doesn&#39;t produce the desired output (see check in the last line).  \r\n\r\n```R\r\ndata = data.table(CJ(\r\n  x = seq(0,10,0.1),\r\n  y = seq(0,10,0.1)\r\n))\r\n\r\ngrid = data.table(CJ(\r\n  x = seq(0,10,1),\r\n  y = seq(0,10,1)\r\n))\r\n\r\ngrid[, label := x*y]\r\n\r\nsetkey(data, x)\r\nsetkey(grid, x)\r\nintermediate = grid[data, roll = Inf][, list(x,y = i.y,label)]\r\n\r\nsetkey(intermediate, y)\r\nsetkey(grid, y)\r\nresult = grid[intermediate, roll = Inf][, list(x = i.x, y, label)]\r\nunique(result$label == floor(result$x)*floor(result$y))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that in this example, I could simply do \r\n```R\r\ndata[, label := floor(x)*floor(y)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut in the setting I want to use the roll, the label is computed by a difficult process on the grid that can&#39;t be easily applied to the data itself.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could tell me how to get the desired result, and maybe also point out where I went wrong in trying to apply the answer linked above, that would really be great.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286727/r-data-table-roll-points-to-a-grid","title":"R data.table: roll points to a grid"},{"tags":["multithreading","ssl-certificate","port","connector","server.xml"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8752305,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/080a69338e7e6ab08a3d1233c51e797d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Priya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8752305/priya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570539197,"post_id":58286726,"comment_id":102938240,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286726/installing-multiple-ssl-certificates-with-multiple-domains-on-single-server#comment102938240_58286726"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8752305,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/080a69338e7e6ab08a3d1233c51e797d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Priya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8752305/priya"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570539083,"creation_date":1570539083,"question_id":58286726,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58286726","body_markdown":"If I install more SSL certificates what configuration changes are to be included in server.xml ?\r\n\r\nI am using Windows Server 2012 and Apache tomcat 7\r\n\r\n&lt;Connector port=&quot;443&quot; protocol=&quot;org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol&quot; keystoreType=&quot;PKCS12&quot; keystorePass=&quot;##&quot; keystoreFile=&quot;conf/##.pfx&quot; sslProtocol=&quot;TLS&quot; clientAuth=&quot;false&quot; SSLEnabled=&quot;true&quot; secure=&quot;true&quot; scheme=&quot;https&quot; acceptCount=&quot;100&quot; disableUploadTimeout=&quot;true&quot; enableLookups=&quot;false&quot; maxSpareThreads=&quot;75&quot; minSpareThreads=&quot;25&quot; maxThreads=&quot;150&quot; maxHttpHeaderSize=&quot;8192&quot;/&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286726/installing-multiple-ssl-certificates-with-multiple-domains-on-single-server","title":"Installing multiple SSL certificates with multiple domains on single Server"},{"tags":["jquery","html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":266712,"user_id":519413,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7839089cd91dc5cc5eb1e0cdbf3312ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rory McCrossan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/519413/rory-mccrossan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570539138,"post_id":58286723,"comment_id":102938207,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286723/using-this-in-jquery#comment102938207_58286723"}],"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":11697371,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MinAbuS7WFQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACk/iyD9jlETn6Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Felipe Endlich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11697371/felipe-endlich"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570539104,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570539078,"creation_date":1570539078,"question_id":58286723,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58286723","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to change the svg path when the menu is expanded.

have a problem with Unit testing a Vue component.\r\n\r\nI need to override the `$root` thats created by the `shallowMount` function.\r\n\r\nI have a plugin component which is assigning its `$root`s

this.$root._pluginSetting.reverseHistory,\r\n  };\r\n},\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSince this plugin is used in multiple repositories, with different components and use cases, I need to be able to access its wrapper to get some data from it.\r\n\r\nThe plugin works fine but the unit test for it is not working as I would expect, but it makes sense why its not working.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote, I need to access

this doesnt work, because the `shallowMount` method creates a wrapper with its own unique `$root`, which overrides mine.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to override its `$root` to my specification before the

Things you can check and see where you got it wrong:\r\n\r\n - In the MSP folder you used for configtx.yaml (/data/orgs/org1/msp and /data/orgs/org2/msp) this folder is a folder on your computer (actually the computer/container that is running the configtxgen command), the first thing you have to check is if the folder is being created correctly.\r\n - Is there a certificate on `admincerts` folder inside the MSP folder? If you do not have it, then the MSP does not have a admin.\r\n - Another thing to be kept in mind is to use the persistent volume to &quot;pass&quot; the certificates generated either by the Fabric CA, cryptogen or any other CA\r\n - I know for a fact that the MSPDir works with a relative path to configtx.yaml. I do not know if it works using the absolute path you are using.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you can do to check which certificate is being used for each MSP is to fetch the last config block `peer channel fetch config` and `configtxlator proto_decode --input &lt;channel name&gt;_config.block --type common.Block --output config.json` and then checking this JSON file","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286678/implicit-policy-evaluation-failed-when-creating-a-new-channel/58291826#58291826","title":"Implicit policy evaluation failed when creating a new channel"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9756730,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ba2302e3d8a849752b5b21569a17f2b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"msolefonte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9756730/msolefonte"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58291826,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570557970,"creation_date":1570538901,"question_id":58286678,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58286678","body_markdown":"I am running a custom Hyperledger Fabric network over Kubernetes and now I am trying to automate the creation and joining of channels. The error I am getting right now is related to the creation of the channel itself.\r\n\r\nThe order I am following, related to the creation of the channels, is the following one (the example channel is named global):\r\n\r\n1. Create `genesis.block` using `configtx.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nconfigtxgen -profile OrgsOrdererGenesis -configPath /data/config -outputBlock /data/genesis.block --channelID orderersglobal\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Create `channel.tx` using the previously created `genesis.block`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nconfigtxgen -profile OrgsChannel -configPath /data/config -outputCreateChannelTx /data/global.tx -channelID global\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Copy the `channel.tx` to each CLI and org\r\n\r\n1. On each CLI, I enroll as admin and run the following command to create the channel block:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npeer channel create -o orderer0.org1:7050 --channelID global -f /data/global.tx\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I get this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-10-08 12:25:51.089 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory -&gt; INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized\r\nError: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error validating channel creation transaction for new channel &#39;global&#39;, could not successfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  /Channel/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the &#39;Admins&#39; sub-policies to be satisfied\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, I can not continue testing the network. I initially used the same `channelID` for `genesis.block` and `channel.block`, but I have changed it. I have read some posts about this but nothing seems to solve my problem.

I make make a decoupled front end admin system. So website owners never have to log into the backend. Which trust me has saved numerous headaches and mistakes by users that mess with things they shouldn&#39;t. So here is how I have solved this:\r\n\r\n 1. Install plugin [Content Type](https://octobercms.com/plugin/xeor-contenttype) by Sozonov Alexey\r\n 2. Make a CMS Page and make sure it has .csv at the end of the url. You\r\n    should see that the content type plugin added a content type tab in\r\n    the page settings. You can leave the html selection alone but add\r\n    text/csv as your own to the right of it.\r\n    \r\n    [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n 3. Here is an example on how the template of the page looks like.\r\n    \r\n        {% spaceless %}\r\n        NAME,EMAIL\r\n        {% for row in csv %}\r\n        {{ row.name }},{{ row.email }}\r\n        {% endfor %}\r\n        {% endspaceless %}\r\n 4. Here is how the CMS Page PHP Code section would look. This can allow you to do queries on the list and filter as desired. You could then check to see if the client is logged into the backend or is logged in as a user and maybe is an admin or moderator. Of course you can make a plugin and component then attach it to this page.\r\n    \r\n        use Rainlab\\User\\Models\\User;\r\n        \r\n        function onStart() {\r\n            $users = User::all();\r\n            $this[&#39;csv&#39;] = $users;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSide note I have used this same technique to create dynamic css, javascript, or rss feeds. I make the site map using this as well.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Bzxg.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286673/export-a-list-of-users-in-octobercms-to-csv/58292711#58292711","title":"Export a list of users in OctoberCMS to CSV"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12182278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fe6dbbffd728177990e86bc1c7e9273?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Strij","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182278/strij"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570782251,"post_id":58319654,"comment_id":103030429,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286673/export-a-list-of-users-in-octobercms-to-csv/58319654#comment103030429_58319654"},{"owner":{"reputation":5960,"user_id":3076866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad0a52ea7adeffa391ea3daea9983540?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hardik Satasiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3076866/hardik-satasiya"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12182278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fe6dbbffd728177990e86bc1c7e9273?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Strij","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182278/strij"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570782409,"post_id":58319654,"comment_id":103030506,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286673/export-a-list-of-users-in-octobercms-to-csv/58319654#comment103030506_58319654"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5960,"user_id":3076866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad0a52ea7adeffa391ea3daea9983540?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hardik Satasiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3076866/hardik-satasiya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5960,"user_id":3076866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad0a52ea7adeffa391ea3daea9983540?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hardik Satasiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3076866/hardik-satasiya"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571035752,"last_edit_date":1571035752,"creation_date":1570699573,"answer_id":58319654,"question_id":58286673,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58319654","body_markdown":"I think its little difficult as we are not having access to user plugin toolbar to add button so.\r\n\r\nBut **YES** we can do it, we need to try little harder :) lets start\r\n\r\n&gt; End result\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; To add export button we need to Extend `rainlab.user` plugin. So from your own plugin you need to it.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n&gt; **1. Adding Extension code to your plugin&#39;s Boot method**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: php --&gt;\r\n\r\n    class Plugin extends PluginBase\r\n    {\r\n        use \\System\\Traits\\ConfigMaker; // trait to read config\r\n\r\n        public function boot() {   \r\n\r\n          \\RainLab\\Users\\Controllers\\Users::extend(function($controller) {\r\n              // we only extend if its not already extended with ImportExport Behavior\r\n              if(!$controller-&gt;isClassExtendedWith(&#39;Backend.Behaviors.ImportExportController&#39;)) {\r\n\r\n                $controller-&gt;implement[] = &#39;Backend.Behaviors.ImportExportController&#39;;\r\n                // make sure you replace this path to your plugin directory\r\n                $extensionPath = &#39;$/hardiksatasiya/stackdemo/user_extension_files/&#39;;\r\n                $controller-&gt;addDynamicProperty(\r\n                  &#39;importExportConfig&#39;,\r\n                  $extensionPath . &#39;config_import_export.yaml&#39;\r\n                );\r\n                $newListConfig = $this-&gt;makeConfig(\r\n                  &#39;$/rainlab/user/controllers/users/config_list.yaml&#39;\r\n                );\r\n                $newListConfig-&gt;toolbar[&#39;buttons&#39;] =\r\n                  $extensionPath . &#39;_new_list_toolbar.htm&#39;;\r\n\r\n                $controller-&gt;listConfig = $newListConfig;\r\n              }\r\n          });\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ....\r\n\r\n&gt; **2. Creating folder and files**\r\n\r\nCreate folder inside your plugin&#39;s root directory and name it `user_extension_files`\r\n\r\nInside that directory \r\n\r\nAdd `config_import_export.yaml` with content\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: yaml --&gt;\r\n\r\n    export:\r\n      useList: true\r\n\r\nAdd `_new_list_toolbar.htm` with content [ It will be just copy of `plugins/rainlab/user/controllers/users/_list_toolbar.htm` with slight modification] \r\n\r\nWith adding `Our Brand New Shiny Export button` not pasting whole code it will be too long so just pasting fragment of it.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div data-control=&quot;toolbar&quot;&gt;\r\n        ... copied code ...\r\n    \r\n        &lt;!-- our export button --&gt;\r\n        &lt;a\r\n            href=&quot;&lt;?= Backend::url(&#39;rainlab/user/users/export&#39;) ?&gt;&quot;\r\n            class=&quot;btn btn-primary oc-icon-sign-out&quot;&gt;\r\n            Export\r\n        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; **Now, when you click on export button it should export records and It will also \r\n respect all the applied filters.**\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; **@NOTE:** we are copying code to `_new_list_toolbar.htm`, So in future if user plugin is getting updated and they decide to add new buttons in tool-bar then we are not able to have that changes. So in that time we just need to copy &amp; paste code from `plugins/rainlab/user/controllers/users/_list_toolbar.htm` to our file `_new_list_toolbar.htm` again.

   ||     ...        ||       ...      |\r\n\r\nHow can I do this? I need that to be appended to the same dataframe for simplicity so I guess I will also have to cast the first column from int to str, or drop the &quot;Total&quot; to the `str_col3`?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286615/how-to-sum-columns-and-append-the-result-as-a-row-in-the-same-dataframe","title":"How to sum columns and append the

All elements of the K-1 vectors are known. For example:\r\n\r\n    v1,v2,...vk,...,vK\r\n\r\nand all elememts of all vectors, except vk, are known, and only two neighboring elements of vk are parameters. For example:\r\n\r\n    v1=[p1 p2 4 5];\r\n    v2=[1 4 2 3 2 1];\r\n    v3=[1 1 1 2];\r\n    v4=[2 2 1 3 4];\r\n\r\nThe question is the following:\r\n\r\nLet &#39;&#39;v&#39;&#39; be the convolution of v1,v2,v3,v4, i.e.(assuming conv works for symbolically) \r\n\r\n    v=conv(v1,v2); \r\n    v=conv(v,v3);\r\n    v=conv(v,v4);\r\n\r\nThen, each element of v can be written as follows:\r\n\r\n    v(n)=a0(n)+a1(n)*p1+a2(n)*p2\r\n\r\n&gt;Example: Lets have two vectors \r\n\r\n    v1=[1, 1,1]\r\n    v2=[p1,p2,1]\r\n\r\nThen \r\n\r\n    v=[p1,p1+p2,p1+p2+1,p2+1,1]\r\n\r\nAs a result we have \r\n\r\n    a0=[0,0,1,1,1], a1=[1,1,1,0,0], a2=[0,1,1,1,0]\r\n\r\nSo a0 are the constants of each element of v, a1 are the multiplicants of p1 and a2 are the multiplicants of p2\r\n\r\nI want to have an efficient algorithm which can calculate a0(n), a1(n) and a2(n). In the next iteration I have shift of the parameters but the same problem. After one shift I will have \r\n\r\n    v1=[3 p1 p2 5];\r\n    v2=[1 4 2 3 2 1];\r\n    v3=[1 1 1 2];\r\n    v4=[2 2 1 3 4];\r\n\r\nafter two shifts:\r\n    \r\n    v1=[3 1 p1 p2];\r\n    v2=[1 4 2 3 2 1];\r\n    v3=[1 1 2 2];\r\n    v4=[2 2 1 3 4];\r\n\r\nafter three shifts:\r\n\r\n    v1=[3 1 4 5];\r\n    v2=[p1 p2 2 3 2 1];\r\n    v3=[1 1 1 2];\r\n    v4=[2 2 1 3 4];\r\n\r\nthis continues until \r\n\r\n    v1=[3 1 4 5];\r\n    v2=[1 4 2 3 2 1];\r\n    v3=[1 1 1 2];\r\n    v4=[2 2 1 p1 p2];\r\n\r\nat each iteration I need to obtain a0(n), a1(n) and a2(n). So in total there are 15 iterations and at each iteration I will obtain 3 vectors. Hence, in total I need to obtain a matrix which has 15 rows and 3xlength(a0) columns. \r\n\r\n     i=1 -&gt; a0_i,a1_i,a2_i, for i=1,...,15.\r\n\r\n&gt; My idea was to define all elements of all vectors as parameters p1,...pK. Then convolve all of them just one time symbolically. This gives v(p1,...,pN). Then at each iteration, except for the two neighboring parameters of interest, I can give all other values and I can evaluate v for example: \r\n\r\n    v(p1,p2,1,3 4,....,2)\r\n\r\n&gt;after this, I can check every element of v for \r\n\r\n&gt;v(n)=a0(n)+a1(n)*p1+a2(n)*p2\r\n\r\n&gt;and extract a0(n), a1(n) and a2(n).\r\n\r\n&gt;First of all I am not sure whether this is efficient or not. Because, at each iteration I must evaluate the whole symbolic thing v(p1,p2,1,3 4,....,2), which may be unnecessary since I have just simple iteration of the parameters. Second I dont know how one could do convolution of K vectors symbolically, or wheter it is a good or a bad idea.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is to see that apart from one vector, all vectors do not contain any parameter. So one can first convolve these vectors with conv function and obtain v*. Then, a1(n) and a2(n) seem to be just the elements of v*, just one is a shifted one of the other. Here is what I did on a paper as an example (p1, p2 are parameters, p3, p4 are known and a1,..,a13 are the result of convolution of known vectors):\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThis approach seems more clear but at each iteration, one must convolve K-1 vectors.

My goal is that the code consistently deletes every number that is not the max in a row.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t attach images, so I hope you can help me.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286559/code-for-deleting-max-of-a-row-not-working-consistently","title":"Code for deleting max of a row not working consistently"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4046,"user_id":1712135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cErYR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"deHaar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1712135/dehaar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570538568,"post_id":58286558,"comment_id":102937886,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286558/is-there-any-better-way-to-but-all-of-this-in-an-array#comment102937886_58286558"},{"owner":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570538658,"post_id":58286558,"comment_id":102937932,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286558/is-there-any-better-way-to-but-all-of-this-in-an-array#comment102937932_58286558"},{"owner":{"reputation":7424,"user_id":669576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mRhrB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Johnny Mopp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/669576/johnny-mopp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570540308,"post_id":58286558,"comment_id":102938838,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286558/is-there-any-better-way-to-but-all-of-this-in-an-array#comment102938838_58286558"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12096924,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA9bD1hIVWrQhgfeRU5dcKseRQEDNke-dlJKoE9Gg=k-s128","display_name":"B&#225;lint Magyar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096924/b%c3%a1lint-magyar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570540521,"creation_date":1570540521,"answer_id":58287142,"question_id":58286558,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58287142","body_markdown":"You should learn OO principles first, then you are good to go.

They are cut off.\r\n\r\nThe plot I want to get is a stacked bar chart and a line chart with 2 y axis. The values of the bar layers should be displayed in the layer.\r\n\r\nI created a `pd.DataFrame` which contains the following:\r\n\r\n           1.0  1.3  1.7  2.0   2.3   2.7   3.0  3.3  3.7   4.0   5.0\r\n    SS 15  2.0  0.0  1.0  1.0   4.0   8.0   5.0  6.0  6.0  10.0  19.0\r\n    SS 16  1.0  1.0  5.0  2.0  11.0  16.0  11.0  8.0  7.0   6.0  12.0\r\n    SS 17  1.0  5.0  3.0  3.0   5.0   6.0   5.0  9.0  8.0   9.0  13.0\r\n\r\nEvery row (`SS 15`-`SS 17`) should be one stacked bar, where the value is one layer of the bar.\r\nThe line chart just contains 3 points which should be connected with a line.\r\n\r\nThe code I use to plot is:\r\n```python\r\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots()\r\nax1 = df.plot(kind=&#39;bar&#39;,\r\n              stacked=True,\r\n              figsize=(20,15), \r\n              fontsize=20, \r\n              grid=True, \r\n              rot=45, \r\n              align=&#39;center&#39;, \r\n              edgecolor=&#39;#000000&#39;, \r\n              colormap=&#39;Paired&#39;)\r\nax2 = ax1.twinx()\r\nax1.set_xlabel(&#39;X-LABEL&#39;, fontsize=25)\r\nax1.set_ylabel(&#39;1st Y-LABLE&#39;, fontsize=25)\r\nax1.set_title(name, fontsize=35)\r\nax1.legend(fontsize=15, loc=&#39;upper left&#39;)\r\nax1.grid(True, axis=&#39;y&#39;)\r\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(medi) #medi is just a dict with 3 pais\r\ndf2.plot(ax=ax2, \r\n         color=&#39;red&#39;, \r\n         marker=&#39;o&#39;,\r\n         linewidth=&#39;2&#39;, \r\n         fontsize=20)\r\nax2.legend([&quot;2nd LEGEND&quot;], fontsize=15, loc=&#39;upper right&#39;)\r\nax2.set_ylim(1,5)\r\nax2.set_ylabel(&#39;2nd Y-LABEL&#39;, fontsize=25)\r\nax2.grid(True,axis=&#39;y&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAs you can see the first and last bar are right on the edges of the graph and cut off. I tried to override the `xticks` but it didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nSecond problem that I have is to display the values in the bars.
