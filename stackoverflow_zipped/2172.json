of all it&#39;s not a good idea to join these entities through a model of the `car` - each `man` can have any cars so this join is not representative. The best way is to add a `r_man_id` into a `Car` table. It&#39;ll allow you to identify a car&#39;s owner.\r\nAfter that you can add a unidirectional `@OneToMany` relation between them:\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    @Table\r\n    @Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor \r\n    class ManRecord{\r\n    \r\n    \t@JoinColumn(name = &quot;r_man_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;manId&quot;)\r\n    \tprivate List&lt;CarRecord&gt;

Please provide a code sample or instruction in C#.\r\n\r\nHere is the generation of the PDF from the report viewer:\r\n``` c#\r\npublic void CreatePdfFromList(string fileName, string reportpath, ArrayList dsNameArray, ArrayList DTArray)\r\n{\r\n    ReportViewer viewer = new ReportViewer();\r\n    Warning[] warnings = null;\r\n    string[] streamIds = null;\r\n    string mimeType = string.Empty;\r\n    string encoding = string.Empty;\r\n    string extension = string.Empty;\r\n    string filetype = string.Empty;\r\n\r\n    viewer.SizeToReportContent = true;\r\n    viewer.LocalReport.ReportPath = reportpath;\r\n    viewer.ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.Local;\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; dsNameArray.Count; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        ReportDataSource rds1 = new ReportDataSource((string)dsNameArray[i], (IEnumerable)DTArray[i]);\r\n        viewer.LocalReport.DataSources.Add(rds1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    viewer.LocalReport.Refresh();\r\n\r\n    byte[] pdfContent = viewer.LocalReport.Render(&quot;PDF&quot;, null, out mimeType, out encoding, out extension, out streamIds, out warnings);\r\n\r\n    Response.Buffer = true;\r\n    Response.Clear();\r\n    Response.ContentType = mimeType;\r\n    //Response.AddHeader(&quot;content-disposition&quot;, &quot;attachment; filename=&quot; + fileName + &quot;.&quot; + extension);\r\n    Response.BinaryWrite(pdfContent);\r\n    //Response.Flush(); // send it to the client to download\r\n    Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);\r\n    Response.End();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand here is the ajax:\r\n``` javascript\r\n$.ajax({\r\n        type: &quot;GET&quot;,\r\n        url: &quot;/.../&quot;,\r\n         data: {...},\r\n         success: function (json) {\r\n         //window.open(json);\r\n         //open file i think...\r\n         }\r\n         })\r\n```\r\nWhen trying to show pdf content I use console.log(json). It shows me the string but the content appears like this:\r\n```\r\n�~�\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024267/how-to-open-pdf-report-from-report-viewer-using-ajax-in-asp-net-mvc","title":"How to open PDF report (from report viewer) using ajax in asp.net mvc"},{"tags":["python","string","similarity"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":795,"user_id":858675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c51db176e8886a2afbc18edd2233c18b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gelonida","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/858675/gelonida"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568966746,"post_id":58024262,"comment_id":102451098,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024262/to-make-two-strings-similar#comment102451098_58024262"},{"owner":{"reputation":795,"user_id":858675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c51db176e8886a2afbc18edd2233c18b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gelonida","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/858675/gelonida"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568968091,"post_id":58024262,"comment_id":102451694,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024262/to-make-two-strings-similar#comment102451694_58024262"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":79,"user_id":6498727,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-amqHQMGns2g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAvo/xpE4nBh8rcM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andr&#233; M&#252;ller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6498727/andr%c3%a9-m%c3%bcller"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568967728,"creation_date":1568967728,"answer_id":58024567,"question_id":58024262,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58024567","body_markdown":"I think you want a variant of the so called *edit distance* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance.

I&#39;ve seen a lot of code for onClickListener, but i decided to use this pattern, as described in the Android doc.\r\n\r\nI have a class, named Recipe(), which contains 3 elements : an ID, a Title and an URL.

I have an url which looks like this structurally speaking:\r\n\r\n`http://www.my-site.com/topic1/topic2/topic3/topic4/topic5`\r\n\r\nand I want to do 2 things to it:\r\n\r\n    1. check the structure and validate it\r\n    2. replace both topic3 and topic4 with a new parameters called topic6\r\n\r\nThis is my solution for now but I am interested to build something more optimize.\r\n\r\n    if ((url.match(/\\//g) || []).length === 7) {\r\n        const arr = url.split(&#39;/&#39;);\r\n        const topic5 = arr.pop();\r\n        arr.pop();\r\n        arr.pop();\r\n        arr.push(&#39;topic6&#39;, topic5);\r\n        return arr.join(&#39;/&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, for the fact that I am not very good at regular expressions I have used another approach which doesn&#39;t look that good. I basically check for the number of `/` in the string, if tey are 7 it means that the structure of the url is good and that on this type of url I should apply the next steps. After that I grab the last param of the url and also remove it and next after that I remove the last 2 parameters and add the new one instead along with the `topic5`.\r\n\r\nIn case you you have a better approach, please let me know. I think that it can be done by writing less number of lines of code but as I said, I am not very familiar with regular expressions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024245/manipulate-urls-with-regular-expressions-instead-of-the-slip-approach","title":"Manipulate urls with regular expressions instead of the slip approach"},{"tags":["javascript","typescript","graphql","apollo","resolver"],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":1805908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14668193c376ebb537004e408e2432a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"riemerio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1805908/riemerio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568966412,"creation_date":1568966412,"question_id":58024242,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58024242","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to search, filter, order over an in memory result which is aggregated from data of a local database and data from an external api.\r\n\r\nThis is my example resolver.\r\n```typescript\r\nconst resolver = {\r\n    Query: {\r\n        allDevices: (_, args: QueryArgs, context: CustomContext) =&gt;\r\n            readAllDevices() // from local database\r\n                .then(searchFilterOrderAndPaginate([&quot;name&quot;], args)) \r\n                // additionalDataFromOtherMicroservice is not yet resolved\r\n                // -&gt; no search possible over all properties\r\n    }, \r\n    Mutation: {},\r\n    Device: {\r\n        additionalDataFromOtherMicroservice: () =&gt; Promise.resolve(&quot;&quot; + Math.random())\r\n        // simulates an http request to another microservice api\r\n    }\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis is my example schema.\r\n```\r\nconst schema = gql`\r\n\r\n    type Device {\r\n        id: ID\r\n        number: ID\r\n        name: String\r\n        additionalDataFromOtherMicroservice: String\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    type Query {\r\n        allDevices(\r\n            search: String\r\n            filterParams: [FilterParam]\r\n            orderParams: [OrderParam]\r\n            pagination: Pagination\r\n        ): [Device]\r\n`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that grapqhl resolves the fields as a cascade.

Meanwhile, you should not use container&#39;s ip from your host&#39;s browser to visit it as it&#39;s in a private network which setup by docker, what you could do is use `-p` to publish your internal network service to external.\r\n\r\nAnd, when you visit `localhost`, it in fact just visit host&#39;s network, and docker use iptables to pass your network traffic to container&#39;s port through `docker0` bridge. So, for your case, if you do not want to use `localhost`, then you could use host&#39;s ip instead, that is `192.168.65.3` in your case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/IoFjk.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024165/connect-to-docker-using-ip-instead-of-localhost/58049746#58049746","title":"Connect to docker using IP instead of localhost"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":7470694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8db47e5b6c8ff6a989f2137401bd71e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Massimiliano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7470694/massimiliano"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58049746,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569159503,"creation_date":1568966134,"question_id":58024165,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58024165","body_markdown":"I&#39;m running a docker container (running a cloudera image in which I can&#39;t modify the networks settings) in my windows 10 pc and I want to connect to it from my browser using the assigned IP (i.e. 172.17.0.2) instead of localhost.\r\nIs there a way to do it?

options, based on what you showed, would be :\r\n\r\n1. mock the two methods which set these values, \r\n2. break `_settings` and `config` or even the two methods which provide the results into a separate class ( like a configuration kind of thing ) and inject the interface of that class as a dependency at whatever level it makes sense. You can then mock those values. \r\n\r\nI would pursue one of these options.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the View values, I would try to separate that. There are  number of issues with this code.\r\n\r\n1. you have a `OnFileNameChanged` metho and you probably can&#39;t change its signature and doesn&#39;t return anything. So, I would separate the code even more. Take the code out of it and create another method that you control. Do not add any View setting in that one. The purpose ifs to cover the logic and return an object with some calculated values. \r\nThen, in the `OnFileNameChanged` you assign what you need for the view stuff. In short, take the logic part out and deal with it somewhere else and test that.\r\n\r\nYou have 3 values that you are assigning to the View object, so make your new method return either one value, or an object with three values, covering each possibility.\r\n\r\n    public void OnFileNameChanged(string fileName)\r\n    {\r\n       var calculatedValues = CalculateValues(//might need some params here)\r\n                                  \r\n       _view.A = calculatedValues.A;\r\n       _view.B = calculatedValues.B;\r\n       _view.C = calculatedValues.C;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public MyReturnType CalculateValues()\r\n    {\r\n         var result = new MyReturnType();\r\n         var config = FirstPrivateOperation();\r\n         if ( config == null ) { return result;

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/linked/7414187?lq=1\r\n\r\nIn general: to start your script on the `Loaded` event, you might do something like this:\r\n\r\n    Function DISM {\r\n    \t$Result =

}\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024103/move-code-to-other-class-while-keeping-api","title":"Move code to other class while keeping API"},{"tags":["logging","jdbc","log4j"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568972936,"post_id":58024098,"comment_id":102454207,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024098/jdbc-manager-cannot-connect-to-the-database-during-peak-load#comment102454207_58024098"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11740220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0hB8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yadav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11740220/yadav"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568982381,"post_id":58024098,"comment_id":102458975,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024098/jdbc-manager-cannot-connect-to-the-database-during-peak-load#comment102458975_58024098"},{"owner":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568985232,"post_id":58024098,"comment_id":102460524,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024098/jdbc-manager-cannot-connect-to-the-database-during-peak-load#comment102460524_58024098"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11740220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0hB8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yadav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11740220/yadav"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568989371,"post_id":58024098,"comment_id":102462860,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024098/jdbc-manager-cannot-connect-to-the-database-during-peak-load#comment102462860_58024098"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11740220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0hB8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yadav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11740220/yadav"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11740220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0hB8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yadav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11740220/yadav"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568989269,"creation_date":1568965878,"last_edit_date":1568989269,"question_id":58024098,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58024098","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using log4j appender to log some data to the database using JDBC and DataSource, it works perfectly up to certain load but some time when load peaks I get an error saying &quot;JDBC manager cannot connect to the database&quot;\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the logs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n&gt;

FirstName + Last Name)`. My team has started using `IQueryables` a lot more to retrieve data from our context layer and a common issue is accidentally using one of these computed properties in a where clause that will be converted to SQL. Is there an easy way to apply a warning or attribute to these properties so that they either don&#39;t show up as an option in an `IQueryable` Where or they throw a warning?

Put a breakpoint when the request start, and go step by step until you see that there&#39;s a `data` property in your response object, analyzing all the variables involved in this part of the code. You will notice that the problem is your `utils.requestResponse.success` object.\r\n\r\nThis way you will notice that `Object.assign` will modify the object passed as the first argument, so when the `show` endpoint is called, you notice that `utils.requestResponse.success` is modified and a `data` property is added to it. Is the same as doing:\r\n\r\n    utils.requestResponse.success.data = data;\r\n\r\nYou must pass an empty object `{}` as the first argument, `utils.requestResponse.success` as the second and `{data: data}` as the third. This way the object modified is the first empty object just created.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024085/unnecessary-data-returned-by-express-js/58024191#58024191","title":"Unnecessary data returned by express.js"}],"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":10024800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b11caf1a692f6bca0548f72a70de42a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Skipm3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10024800/skipm3"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568966234,"creation_date":1568965842,"question_id":58024085,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58024085","body_markdown":"I just made simple REST API using Express.js but there is an unnecessary data being returned by express.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the response data:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    &quot;code&quot;: 200,\r\n    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,\r\n    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Success&quot;,\r\n    &quot;device_code&quot;: &quot;2F1E6DB930&quot;,\r\n    &quot;data&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;5d84801cd3906f1e5cbec0c4&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;5d848032d3906f1e5cbec0c6&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;5d8480bbd3906f1e5cbec0ca&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe &quot;data&quot; object is not needed because I didn&#39;t return it on my code\r\n```javascript\r\nexports.register = async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  if (utils.checkBody(req.body, utils.authBody)) {\r\n    let User = services.db.collection(&#39;users&#39;)\r\n \r\n    let deviceCode = Math.random().toString(16).substr(2, 10).toUpperCase()\r\n \r\n    await User.insertOne({\r\n      username: req.body.username,\r\n      password: md5(req.body.password + process.env.SECRET_KEY),\r\n      kode_device: deviceCode\r\n    })\r\n \r\n    response = Object.assign(utils.requestResponse.success, { device_code: deviceCode })\r\n  } else {\r\n    response = utils.requestResponse.incomplete_body\r\n  }\r\n \r\n  res.status(response.code).json(response)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// request response success\r\n \r\nconst requestResponse = {\r\n  success: {\r\n    code: 200,\r\n    status: &#39;success&#39;,\r\n    message: &#39;Success&#39;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only &quot;data&quot; object I returned to is in another endpoint (let&#39;s say &#39;show data&#39;) and here&#39;s the code\r\n```javascript\r\nexports.show = async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  if (req.params.device_code) {\r\n    let General = services.db.collection(req.params.device_code)\r\n    let query = undefined\r\n   \r\n    if (req.query.last_id === undefined || req.query.last_id === &#39;&#39;) {\r\n      query = {}\r\n    } else {\r\n      query = { _id: { &#39;$gt&#39;:  ObjectId(req.query.last_id) } }\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    let data = await General.find(query).limit(10).toArray()\r\n \r\n    response = Object.assign(utils.requestResponse.success, { data: data })\r\n  } else {\r\n    response = utils.requestResponse.incomplete_body\r\n  }\r\n \r\n  res.status(response.code).json(response)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI made an script to cluster the app server code and run through `nodemon`\r\n```javascript\r\nrequire(&#39;dotenv&#39;).config()\r\nconst cluster = require(&#39;cluster&#39;)\r\nconst AppServer = require(&#39;./app&#39;)\r\n\r\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\r\n  let cpuCount = require(&#39;os&#39;).cpus().length\r\n\r\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; cpuCount; i += 1) {\r\n    cluster.fork()\r\n  }\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log(`Server is running on ${process.env.PORT}`)\r\n  AppServer.listen(process.env.PORT)\r\n}\r\ncluster.on(&#39;exit&#39;, (worker) =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(&#39;server&#39;,`Worker %d die ${worker.id}`);\r\n  cluster.fork();\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any solution?

        return (num === excludedIndex) ? this.generateRandom(min, max, excludedIndex) : num;\r\n         }\r\n    \r\n         changeBackground() {\r\n              var x = this.generateRandom(0, document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.grid-item&quot;).length, this.prevIndex);\r\n              this.prevIndex = x;\r\n\r\n              if (this.items[x].backgroundImage != &quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; this.items[x].backgroundImage != null) {\r\n                  document.querySelector(&quot;.container&quot;).style.backgroundImage = `url(&#39;${this.items[x].backgroundImage}&#39;)`;\r\n              }\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024083/i-want-to-generate-random-number-in-method-once-which-are-not-same-with-previous/58024828#58024828","title":"I want to

The error you are seeing is related to the plugin being unable to load `libcef.dll`, you could resolve this issue, only to be faced with `Cannot pass a GCHandle across AppDomains`.\r\n\r\nYou can run `CefSharp` out of process, for which there is an example. It&#39;s a little outdated, the fundamentals should still be relevant. See https://github.com/stever/AppHostCefSharp\r\n\r\nMy personal recommendation is to use [CefGlue][1] or [ChromiumFx][2]. Both are `P/Invoke` based so use a fundamentally different approach to interacting with the unmanaged `libcef.dll`.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n\r\n - https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/issues/1191\r\n - https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/issues/351\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51710822/cefsharp-in-exceldna\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24118047/cannot-pass-a-gchandle-across-appdomains-solution-without-delegates\r\n - https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/169359/ccli-dll-is-initialized-in-wrong-appdomain.html\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://gitlab.com/xiliumhq/chromiumembedded/cefglue\r\n  [2]: https://bitbucket.org/chromiumfx/chromiumfx/src","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024079/cefsharp-in-vsto-addin/58077862#58077862","title":"CefSharp in VSTO Addin"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":4225855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/081fefeb76c7582debe13eab42408ff5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bikramjit Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4225855/bikramjit-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2001,"user_id":4583726,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7b1e6a85e93097f34b96ee94173d332?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"amaitland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4583726/amaitland"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":119,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569324271,"creation_date":1568965824,"last_edit_date":1569324271,"question_id":58024079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58024079","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use CefSharp WindowForm Control in the VSTO Excel Addin.

If you are either saving to multiple data stores in multiple transactions or saving to the same data store in several transactions, then you face the likely possibility of data corruption. If you are using a distributed transaction across multiple data stores, well then God help you. \r\n\r\nSaveChanges should therefore be sufficient, so why create your own?\r\n\r\n**But what about abstraction?**\r\n\r\nIf SaveChanges is sufficient, then how do we abstract out our dependency on EF? You can introduce an **IUnitOfWork** interface with a single method, **Commit**, which you can implement by calling DbContext.SaveChanges. \r\n\r\n**And repositories?**\r\n\r\nI am not sure I understand not creating Repositories as a hard rule. As part of abstracting out your persistence layer, it is helpful to have a layer such as IRepository to provide that separation. That said, **you should not be creating a repository per table**. A repository per Aggregate is more appropriate. Each repository will load the entire Aggregate to ensure consistency within the boundary of the Aggregate. \r\n\r\n**...**\r\n\r\nIn general, I would caution against following advice that speaks in absolutes if you don&#39;t understand the reasoning behind that advice. You should be able to formulate the same conclusion given the same starting information for yourself. Otherwise, you are just applying rote memorization to a pattern that does not always benefit from that approach.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024077/ddd-cqrs-onion-architecture-ef-core-for-enterprise-level-app/58034546#58034546","title":"DDD, CQRS, onion architecture, ef core for enterprise level app"}],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":1448545,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JaBSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JohnnyBzz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1448545/johnnybzz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":157,"user_id":1448545,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JaBSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JohnnyBzz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1448545/johnnybzz"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":83,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569009962,"creation_date":1568965814,"last_edit_date":1568977516,"question_id":58024077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58024077","body_markdown":"Recently I have found that following approach works great for many projects that I have worked on.\r\nThe issue however is, that I read that ef core DbContext is a UoW by itself, and I should NOT create my own UoW and repositories.

If an extra element appeared somewhere, there would be a comparison with `None` (thanks to `zip_longest`), and again a `False` would have been in `okay`.\r\n\r\nThis can be improved by use of sets to speed up the membership lookup.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58024076/check-if-a-list-is-in-a-custom-order/58025878#58025878","title":"Check if a list is in a custom order"}],"owner":{"reputation":89,"user_id":4228864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3565bc735bc895fe7bbd468d53f98ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fer-de-lance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4228864/fer-de-lance"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569623585,"creation_date":1568965813,"last_edit_date":1569623585,"question_id":58024076,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58024076","body_markdown":"I am trying to validate a list say:\r\n\r\n`X = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;c&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;d&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;d&#39;]`\r\n\r\nagainst a custom ordered list:\r\n\r\n`Y = [&#39;a&#39;,b&#39;,&#39;d&#39;]`\r\n\r\nIn this case X validated against Y should return `True` regardless of the extra elements and duplicates in it as long as it goes with the order in `Y` and contains at least two elements.\r\n\r\nCase Examples:\r\n\r\n    X = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;] # Returns True\r\n    X = [&#39;d&#39;,&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;,&#39;b&#39;] # Returns False\r\n    X = [&#39;c&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;] # Returns True\r\n\r\nThe most I can do right now is remove the duplicates and extra elements.
