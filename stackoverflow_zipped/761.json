Its output contains first LDAXR == LL+acquire, then STXR == SC  \r\n&gt; (without barrier in it, so, there is no guarantee other threads will see it?)\r\n\r\nHuh?  Stores always become visible to other threads; the store buffer always drains itself as fast as possible.  The question is only whether to block later loads/stores in *this* thread until the store buffer is empty.  (That&#39;s required for seq-cst pure stores, for example).\r\n\r\nSTXR is exclusive and tied to the LL.  **So it and the load are indivisible in the global order of operations,** as the load and store side of an atomic RMW operation, just like x86 does in one instruction with `lock cmpxchg`.\r\n\r\nThe atomic RMW can move earlier (because acquire loads can do that, and so can relaxed stores).  But it can&#39;t move later (because acquire-loads *can&#39;t* do that).  **Therefore the atomic RMW appears in the global order before any operations in the critical section, and is sufficient for taking a lock.**  It doesn&#39;t have to wait for earlier operations like cache-miss stores; it can let them move into the critical section.  But that&#39;s not a problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you *had* used an acq_rel CAS, it couldn&#39;t take the lock until after finishing all earlier loads/stores (because of the release semantics of the store side).\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any asm difference between acq_rel and seq_cst for an atomic RMW.  Possibly on PowerPC?  Not on x86, all RMWs are seq_cst.  Not on AArch64: it only has relaxed and sequential-release.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLDAR + STR would be like x86 `cmpxchg` *without* a lock prefix: acquire load and separate store.  (Except that the store side of x86 cmpxchg is still a release-store (but not sequential-release) because of the x86 memory model.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther confirmation of my reasoning that `mo_acquire` for the &quot;success&quot; side of a CAS is sufficient for taking a lock:\r\n\r\n* https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order says &quot;The lock() operation on a Mutex is also an acquire operation&quot;\r\n* Glibc&#39;s `pthread_spin_trylock` uses the GCC builtin `__atomic_compare_exchange_n` on the mutex with only acquire, not acq_rel or seq_cst.  We know many smart people have looked at glibc.  And on platforms where it&#39;s not effectively strengthened to seq-cst asm, bug bugs probably would have been noticed if there were any.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; what prevents CPU against reordering (2) and (3), with result that other threads won&#39;t see mutex is locked?\r\n\r\nThat would require other threads see the LL and SC as separate operations, not as an atomic RMW.  The whole point of LL/SC is to prevent that.  Weaker ordering lets it move around as a unit, not split apart.\r\n\r\n&gt; SQ2: Is there a design factor that suggests having acquire semantics only on loads?\r\n\r\nYes, consider pure loads and pure stores, not RMWs.     [Jeff Preshing on acq and rel semantics](https://preshing.com/20120913/acquire-and-release-semantics/).\r\n\r\nThe one-way barrier of a release-store naturally works well with the store buffer on real CPUs.  **CPUs &quot;want&quot; to load early and store late.**  Perhaps Jeff Preshing&#39;s article [Memory Barriers Are Like Source Control Operations](https://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations/) is a helpful analogy for how CPUs interact with coherent cache.\r\n\r\nA store that could only appear earlier, not later, would basically require flushing the store buffer.  i.e. relaxed store followed by a full barrier (like `atomic_thread_fence(seq_cst)`, e.g. ARM `dsb ish` or x86 `mfence` or locked operation).  **This is what you get from a seq-cst store.**  So we more or less already have a name for it, and it&#39;s very expensive.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361491/why-is-acquire-semantics-only-for-reads-not-writes-how-can-an-ll-sc-acquire-ca/58378657#58378657","title":"Why is acquire semantics only for reads, not writes?

If a data set is protected with a spinlock (mutex, etc. - no matters what exact implementation is used; for now, assume 0 means it&#39;s free and 1 - busy). After changing of the data set, a thread stores 0 to spinlock address. To force visibility of all previous actions before storing 0 to spinlock address, storing is executed with release semantics, that means all previous reads and writes shall be made visible to other threads before this storing. It is implementation detail whether this is done with full barrier, or release mark of the single store operation. That is (I hope) clear without any doubt.\r\n\r\nThen, consider them moment when spinlock ownership is being taken. To protect against race, this is any kind of compare-and-set operation. With single-instruction CAS implementation (X86, Sparc...), this is combined reading and writing. The same for X86 atomic XCHG. With [LL/SC][1] (most RISCs), this falls to:\r\n\r\n1. Read (LL) the spinlock location until it shows free state. (Can be optimized with a kind of CPU stall.)\r\n1. Write (SC) the value &quot;occupied&quot; (1 in our case). CPU exposes whether the operation was successful (condition flag, output register, etc.)\r\n1. Check the write (SC) result and, if failed, go to step 1.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the operation that shall be visible to other threads to show that spinlock is occupied, is writing of 1 to its location, and barrier shall be committed between this writing and following manipulations on the data set protected with the spinlock. Reading of this spinlock gives nothing to protection scheme, except permit of CAS or LL/SC operation.\r\n\r\nBut all really implemented schemes allow acquire semantics modification on reads (or CAS), not writes. As result, LL/SC scheme would require additional final read-with-acquire operation on the spinlock to commit the required barrier. But there is no such instruction in typical output. For example, if compile on ARM:\r\n\r\n      for(;;) {\r\n        int e{0};\r\n        int d{1};\r\n        if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(p, &amp;e, d,\r\n              std::memory_order_acquire,\r\n              std::memory_order_relaxed)) {\r\n          return;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\nits output contains first LDAXR == LL+acquire, then STXR == SC (without barrier in it, so, there is no guarantee other threads will see it?) This is likely not my artifact but is generated e.g. in glibc: `pthread_spin_trylock` calls `__atomic_compare_exchange_weak_acquire` (and no more barriers), that falls into GCC builtin `__atomic_compare_exchange_n` with acquire on mutex reading and no release on mutex writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems Iʼve missed some principal detail in this consideration. Would anybody correct it?\r\n\r\nThis also could fall into 2 sub-questions:\r\n\r\nSQ1: In instruction sequence like:\r\n\r\n    (1) load_linked+acquire mutex_address     ; found it is free\r\n    (2) store_conditional mutex_address       ; succeeded\r\n    (3) read or write of mutex-protected area\r\n\r\nwhat prevents CPU against reordering (2) and (3), with result that other threads won&#39;t see mutex is locked?\r\n\r\nSQ2: Is there a design factor that suggests having acquire semantics only on loads?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen that some examples of lock-free code, such as:\r\n\r\nthread 1:\r\n\r\n    var = value;\r\n    flag.store(true, std::memory_order_release);\r\n\r\nthread 2:\r\n\r\n    if (flag.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {\r\n       // We already can access it!!!\r\n       value = var;\r\n       ... do something with value ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nbut this should have been made working _after_ the mutex-protected style gets working stably.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load-link/store-conditional","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361491/why-is-acquire-semantics-only-for-reads-not-writes-how-can-an-ll-sc-acquire-ca","title":"Why is acquire semantics only for reads, not writes?

To make life simpler I&#39;m using a module to handle this ([read-more-react](https://github.com/alexandersmanning/read-more-react/)). read-more-react requires a few fields to be filled out including the text itself, and a few other fields like min and max characters before truncating.\r\n\r\nThe suggested way from Gatsby to parse raw HTML data is to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, but I&#39;m having some issues with including my component. I tried using the read-more-react module without `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. It works, but only outputs the raw HTML &quot;`&lt;h1&gt;A title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some copy...&lt;/p&gt;` etc) without actually parsing it.\r\n\r\nInstead, I tried this;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    &lt;div\r\n      className=&quot;md container&quot;\r\n      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\r\n        __html: `\r\n          &lt;ReadMoreReact\r\n            text=${htmlContent}\r\n            min=&quot;180&quot;\r\n            ideal=&quot;190&quot;\r\n            max=&quot;200&quot;\r\n            readMoreText=&quot;Read more&quot;\r\n          /&gt;\r\n        `,\r\n      }}\r\n    /&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I get a weird output;\r\n\r\n&gt; **A title**\r\n\r\n&gt; Some copy\r\n\r\n&gt; `min=&quot;180&quot; ideal=&quot;190&quot; max=&quot;200&quot; readMoreText=&quot;Read more&quot; /&gt;`\r\n\r\nSo this clearly isn&#39;t working.

The value in the date input must be a valid date. So when clicking the x button on the date picker, it should go to the current date and not be blank.\r\n\r\nThis is the html:\r\n\r\n    &lt;input class=&quot;form-control input-sm&quot; type=&quot;date&quot; name=&quot;endDate&quot; \r\n    \t\t[ngModel]=&quot;endDate | date:&#39;yyyy-MM-dd&#39;&quot; (ngModelChange)=&quot;setEndDate($event);&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nand the following code in the Component TS file:\r\n\r\n    endDate = new Date();\r\n\r\n    setEndDate(newValue) {\r\n    \r\n      if(newValue) {\r\n        this.endDate = newValue;\r\n        return;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      this.endDate = new Date();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhat I can&#39;t get my head around is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Specifically, when the date in the picker *is not* the current date, clicking the x results in it becoming the current date as intended. When the date in the picker *is* the current date, it goes blank and shows ```mm/dd/yyyy```.

Is it download first, get url, then share via intent, or can you directly share via a URL?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361463/save-and-share-a-video-from-url-android","title":"Save and Share a video from URL (Android)"},{"tags":["excel","vba"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":229,"user_id":7131122,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VRUK1MTcgY4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA_8/VlNsZARthCY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christofer Weber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7131122/christofer-weber"},"last_editor":{"reputation":229,"user_id":7131122,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VRUK1MTcgY4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA_8/VlNsZARthCY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christofer Weber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7131122/christofer-weber"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571031258,"last_edit_date":1571031258,"creation_date":1570960852,"answer_id":58362484,"question_id":58361459,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58362484","body_markdown":"You could have the code determine the amount of columns used, and loop through them, or set them manually.\r\n\r\nThis is an example, where excel will automatically count the columns.  \r\nThen it will count the amount of people, assuming that you want the totals on the same row.  \r\nIf you want to count the rows of every column individually, just move the `RowLenght` to the first part of the loop, and change the `1` to `i`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried to incorporate your original idea as much as possible, and we have two variables that we can set manually `StartRow` and `StartColumn`.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-vb --&gt;\r\n\r\n    Sub Button1_Click()\r\n    Dim ColumnLenght As Long, RowLenght As Long, i As Long, ColumnLetter As String, StartRow As Long, StartColumn As Long\r\n    \r\n    ColumnLenght = ActiveSheet.Cells(1, Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column\r\n    RowLenght = ActiveSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row\r\n    StartRow = 2\r\n    StartColumn = 2\r\n    \r\n    For i = StartColumn To ColumnLenght\r\n        ColumnLetter = Split(Cells(1, i).Address, &quot;$&quot;)(1)\r\n        Cells(RowLenght + 1, i).Formula = &quot;=sum(&quot;

When a note is created, a corresponding text file is also created. When a user opens the application, the application reads the directory of note files, retrieves the content of each note file, and then displays it in the grid.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe idea is to make the grid of notes rearrangeable via drag-and-drop.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve never done anything this before, so I&#39;m struggling to devise an efficient way to cache or remember the order in which the user has arranged the notes. I thought of storing the position of each note in the filename itself.\r\n\r\n`1_note3.txt`\r\n`2_note7.txt`\r\n`3_note4.txt`\r\n`4_note2.txt`\r\n`5_note6.txt`\r\n`6_note8.txt`\r\n`7_note5.txt`\r\n`8_note1.txt`\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t seem like a good approach since, anytime the the notes are rearranged, I&#39;ll have to rename a bunch of the files. For example, say the user creates a new note &amp;mdash; which would be inserted as the first child of the grid for the sake of user experience &amp;mdash; all of the filenames would have to be renamed.\r\n\r\n***`1_note9.txt`***\r\n`2_note3.txt`\r\n`3_note7.txt`\r\n`4_note4.txt`\r\n`5_note2.txt`\r\n`6_note6.txt`\r\n`7_note8.txt`\r\n`8_note5.txt`\r\n`9_note1.txt`\r\n\r\nFurther, say a user now rearranges the notes by moving the first note to the fourth position in the top row. I&#39;d now have to rename that file and all of the following files.\r\n\r\n`2_note3.txt`\r\n`3_note7.txt`\r\n`4_note4.txt`\r\n***`5_note9.txt`***\r\n`6_note2.txt`\r\n`7_note6.txt`\r\n`8_note8.txt`\r\n`9_note5.txt`\r\n`10_note1.txt`\r\n\r\nI could also store the order or arrangement in a separate file, and exclusively manipulate the content of this file instead of the actual filenames.\r\n\r\n`arrangement.txt`\r\n\r\n    note3.txt\r\n    note7.txt\r\n    note4.txt\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nAlthough this may be superior to the last approach, it also doesn&#39;t seem that great since there is still additional overhead. For instance, when the application is launched, I&#39;ll first have to read that file in order to obtain the user arrangement before sorting files accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Does anybody have any experience implementing something like this?

the utils.py file in the src folder, which I could solve by deprecating scipy to 1.1.0. Then tensorflow errors with using v1 attributes started popping up one after the other. Then I uninstalled and reinstalled tensorflow. Then it gave me an error report stating that operations of the program can&#39;t be done on the resources I have. \r\n\r\nSo I removed that environment and repeated the entire procedure all over again. And now this is the error report I am getting. Any help would be so great.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Tried running the command to execute the program again. Then the AttributeError with imread came up. So I deprecated scipy using:\r\n\r\n    pip install scipy==1.1.0\r\n\r\nThen when I try executing, this is the error report that comes up.

The number of the uniform is the binding point of the texture object and the sampler uniform. \r\n \r\nGet the resource (location) index of the uniform by [`glGetUniformLocation`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glGetUniformLocation.xhtml) and set the binding point by [`glUniform1i`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glUniform.xhtml). e.g.:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\nint loc_t1 = GLES20.glGetUniformLocation(program, &quot;inputImageTexture&quot;);\r\nint loc_t2 = GLES20.glGetUniformLocation(program, &quot;inputImageTexture2&quot;);\r\nint loc_t3 = GLES20.glGetUniformLocation(program, &quot;inputImageTexture3&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`program` is the shader program object.\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\nGLES20.glUniform1i(loc_t1, 0);\r\nGLES20.glUniform1i(loc_t2, 1);\r\nGLES20.glUniform1i(loc_t3, 2); \r\n```\r\n\r\n0, 1 and 2 are the binding points, which are the numbers of the texture units `GL_TEXTURE0`, `GL_TEXTURE1` and `GL_TEXTURE2`.

Is there any better way?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361393/how-to-handle-empty-response-in-swift-5-result","title":"How to handle empty response in Swift 5 Result"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","post"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":935,"user_id":1927583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc9a6c4f6d819f019db6d48264f47dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ba_ul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927583/ba-ul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570951335,"post_id":58361390,"comment_id":103074613,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361390/access-json-object-returned-from-post-request#comment103074613_58361390"},{"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":11077261,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JBopfR9W5Rw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNBv_vvpaf37l4pJiIw8dyxRLVASQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11077261/john"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":935,"user_id":1927583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc9a6c4f6d819f019db6d48264f47dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ba_ul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927583/ba-ul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570951376,"post_id":58361390,"comment_id":103074618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361390/access-json-object-returned-from-post-request#comment103074618_58361390"},{"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":11077261,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JBopfR9W5Rw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNBv_vvpaf37l4pJiIw8dyxRLVASQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11077261/john"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":935,"user_id":1927583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc9a6c4f6d819f019db6d48264f47dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ba_ul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927583/ba-ul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570951553,"post_id":58361390,"comment_id":103074645,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361390/access-json-object-returned-from-post-request#comment103074645_58361390"},{"owner":{"reputation":935,"user_id":1927583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc9a6c4f6d819f019db6d48264f47dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ba_ul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927583/ba-ul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570951684,"post_id":58361390,"comment_id":103074663,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361390/access-json-object-returned-from-post-request#comment103074663_58361390"},{"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":11077261,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JBopfR9W5Rw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNBv_vvpaf37l4pJiIw8dyxRLVASQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11077261/john"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":935,"user_id":1927583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc9a6c4f6d819f019db6d48264f47dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ba_ul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927583/ba-ul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570951832,"post_id":58361390,"comment_id":103074690,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361390/access-json-object-returned-from-post-request#comment103074690_58361390"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":8895405,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x6geG.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PW486","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895405/pw486"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570952364,"creation_date":1570952364,"answer_id":58361499,"question_id":58361390,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58361499","body_markdown":"Try this.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst axios = require(&#39;axios&#39;)\r\naxios.post(&#39;https://hastebin.com/documents&#39;, {\r\n    payload: &#39;test&#39;\r\n  })\r\n  .then((res) =&gt;

`countLines()` function you show  is stepping into several traps.\r\n\r\n1. [`fgetc()`][1] returns `int` not `char` by intention. It does this to be able to return the End-of-File state, aside all other possible character values. A simple `char` cannot do this.\r\n\r\n2. The use of `feof()` to identify the End-of-File fails as the EOF indicator is set only after the last read hitting the end of the file has been completed. So a loop steered using `feof()` typically iterated one time to often. \r\n\r\n A detailed discussion on this is [here][2].\r\n\r\n3. A text file&#39;s last line not necessarily carries an End-of-File indicator, but you mostly likely still want count that line. Special logic needs to be applied to cover this case.\r\n\r\nA possible implementation of a function taking care off all those issue mentioned above might look like this:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n\r\n    /* Returns the number of lines inside the file named file_name \r\n       or -1 on error. */\r\n    long count_lines(const char * file_name)\r\n    {\r\n      long lines = 0;\r\n      FILE * fp = fopen(file_name, &quot;r&quot;); /* Open file to read in text mode. */\r\n      if (NULL == fp)\r\n      {\r\n        lines = -1;\r\n      }\r\n      else\r\n      {\r\n        int previous = EOF;\r\n   \r\n        for (int current; (EOF != (current = fgetc(fp)));)\r\n        {\r\n          if (&#39;\\n&#39; == current)\r\n          {\r\n            ++lines;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          previous = current;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (ferror(fp)) /* fgetc() returns EOF as well if an error occurred.\r\n                           This call identifies that case. */\r\n        {\r\n          lines = -1;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (EOF != previous &amp;&amp; &#39;\\n&#39; != previous)\r\n        {\r\n          ++lines; /* Last line missed trailing new-line! */\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        fclose(fp);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return lines;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nRegarding the discussion about different End-of-Line indicators inside the question&#39;s comment section:\r\n\r\nThe End-of-Line indicator for text files is implemented differently on different platforms (UNIX: `&#39;\\n&#39;` vs. Windows: `\\r\\n` vs. ... (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)).\r\n\r\n\r\nTo manoeuvre around this the C library function [`fopen()`][3] by default opens a file in so called &quot;text-mode&quot;. If opened this way the C implementation takes care that each line&#39;s end is returned as a single `&#39;\\n&#39;` character, the so called &quot;new-line&quot; character. Please note (as mentioned above under 3.) that for the last line there might be no End-of-Line indicator at all.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  [1]: http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#7.21.7.1\r\n  [2]: http://stackoverflow.com/q/5431941/694576\r\n  [3]: http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#7.21.5.3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361389/reading-files-with-the-same-extension-in-a-directory-and-count-their-lines/58362302#58362302","title":"Reading files with the same extension in a directory and count their lines"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12208476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c036d2994cef467bbfb8572850d91a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chromium98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12208476/chromium98"},"last_editor":{"reputation":61470,"user_id":694576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PpOGj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/694576/alk"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":88,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58362302,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570960991,"creation_date":1570951036,"last_edit_date":1570960991,"question_id":58361389,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58361389","body_markdown":"I am having this problem with my code.

(e.g. image viewers&#39; &quot;open with&quot; menu option).\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, input integration can not be implemented in a desktop agnostic way; i.e. I must install `.desktop` application files in XDG desktops or define appropriate keys under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Applications` in the windows registry before the desktop can suggest the applications to users.\r\n\r\n**Question:** Since my application will be responsible for providing the user with a list of applications to open the output, does Qt offer anything I can use to limit the amount of platform-specific code I need to write and test?\r\n\r\nI have already found many ways to get this information in a desktop-specific way (e.g. [Gnome](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GAppInfo.html), [KDE](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKOpenWithDialog.html), or even processing [XDG directories](https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-1.2.html) or [relevant windows registry entries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/app-registration) directly) but my hope here is to limit the the amount of time I need to spend on each desktop.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and apologies for the poor English.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361383/how-do-i-get-a-list-of-application-suggestions-for-a-given-file-type-in-qt5","title":"How do I get a list of application suggestions for a given file type in Qt5?"},{"tags":["r","igraph"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25964,"user_id":4752675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6PS6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"G5W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4752675/g5w"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570970288,"post_id":58361382,"comment_id":103078307,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361382/r-software-create-a-directed-and-weighted-graph-from-an-adjacency-matrix#comment103078307_58361382"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12208455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e04e74957d14b1e196e773611a70bb11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tiziano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12208455/tiziano"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25964,"user_id":4752675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6PS6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"G5W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4752675/g5w"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570984526,"post_id":58361382,"comment_id":103081623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361382/r-software-create-a-directed-and-weighted-graph-from-an-adjacency-matrix#comment103081623_58361382"},{"owner":{"reputation":25964,"user_id":4752675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6PS6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"G5W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4752675/g5w"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570984635,"post_id":58361382,"comment_id":103081660,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361382/r-software-create-a-directed-and-weighted-graph-from-an-adjacency-matrix#comment103081660_58361382"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12208455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e04e74957d14b1e196e773611a70bb11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tiziano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12208455/tiziano"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25964,"user_id":4752675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6PS6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"G5W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4752675/g5w"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570985390,"post_id":58361382,"comment_id":103081883,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361382/r-software-create-a-directed-and-weighted-graph-from-an-adjacency-matrix#comment103081883_58361382"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12208455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e04e74957d14b1e196e773611a70bb11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tiziano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12208455/tiziano"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570950933,"creation_date":1570950933,"question_id":58361382,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58361382","body_markdown":"#Introducing\r\nI am using igraph package on R.

Please help me to resolve what&#39;s wrong going on.\r\n\r\nBelow are the dependencies I have added in package.json.\r\n```\r\n&quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;@angular/common&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/compiler&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/compiler-cli&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/core&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/forms&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/platform-browser&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/platform-browser-dynamic&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@types/node&quot;: &quot;~8.9.4&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@angular/router&quot;: &quot;~8.1.2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@ionic/angular&quot;: &quot;^4.7.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;rxjs&quot;: &quot;~6.5.1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;typescript&quot;: &quot;~3.4.3&quot;,\r\n    &quot;zone.js&quot;: &quot;~0.9.1&quot;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel the problem is because of the different build folder structure with the Angular and Ionic newer version. Because I have already published a directive in Ionic 3 and it&#39;s working fine. Below is the build folder structure with earlier version.

Help would be appreciated\r\n\r\n![sub plot][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SbOTC.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361337/how-to-get-a-subset-from-a-shapefile-with-the-correct-outline","title":"How to get a subset from a shapefile with the correct outline?"},{"tags":["java","arrays","json"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1188,"user_id":6469772,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uAnFm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LHCHIN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6469772/lhchin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571015217,"post_id":58361338,"comment_id":103088069,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361338/how-to-get-the-required-array-set-from-json-string#comment103088069_58361338"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":4203387,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b58b00bf272020d5aa13140bd4b04baf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sachika Sandeepa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4203387/sachika-sandeepa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570984324,"creation_date":1570950470,"last_edit_date":1570984324,"question_id":58361338,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58361338","body_markdown":"From this Json string I want to get tags_result by giving id (id = b5f5e7e8-71af-45d6-b4ae-f154dcfc687e).\r\n\r\nHow can I get tag_result by providing id using Java code?\r\n\r\n   \r\n```json\r\n     {   &quot;meta&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;deal_state&quot;: &quot;PROCESSING&quot;,\r\n            &quot;start_timestamp&quot;: &quot;1569422781154&quot;,\r\n            &quot;start_datetime&quot;: &quot;Sep-25-2019 14:46:21.154 UTC(+0000)&quot;,\r\n            &quot;worker_last_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\r\n            &quot;original_destination&quot;: &quot;smb://icgdfs/&quot;,\r\n            &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;smb://&quot;,\r\n            &quot;bp_run_uuid&quot;: &quot;050743e4-38&quot;,\r\n            &quot;worker_first_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\r\n            &quot;deal_id&quot;: &quot;00888&quot;,\r\n            &quot;number_of_document&quot;: &quot;&quot;   },\r\n       &quot;id&quot;: &quot;b5f5e7e8-71af-45d6-b4ae-f154dcfc687e&quot;,   &quot;docs&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;meta&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;extract_status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,\r\n                &quot;tags_result&quot;: [\r\n                  {\r\n                    &quot;score&quot;: 0.7118798794239353,\r\n                    &quot;end&quot;: 32,\r\n                    &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;company_name&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;ORANG&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;estimatedAccuracy&quot;: 0.8947368421052632,\r\n                    &quot;begin&quot;: 7\r\n                  },\r\n                  {\r\n                    &quot;score&quot;: 0.7078500009092995,\r\n                    &quot;end&quot;: 70,\r\n                    &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;company_name&quot;,\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361338/how-to-get-the-required-array-set-from-json-string","title":"how to get the required array set from json string"},{"tags":["python","floating-point","format"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":784,"user_id":9874393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zd1Tp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bruno Vermeulen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9874393/bruno-vermeulen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":784,"user_id":9874393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zd1Tp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bruno Vermeulen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9874393/bruno-vermeulen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570955048,"last_edit_date":1570955048,"creation_date":1570954670,"answer_id":58361745,"question_id":58361333,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58361745","body_markdown":"I suppose this is the default output if you do not specify the number of decimals.

I think there is a collision here when you register the routes which makes one of the `ViewSet` inoperative.\r\n\r\nYou should merge all your logic in a single `ViewSet`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass UserViewSet(\r\n    mixins.CreateModelMixin,\r\n    mixins.ListModelMixin,\r\n    mixins.RetrieveModelMixin,\r\n    mixins.UpdateModelMixin,\r\n    mixins.DestroyModelMixin,\r\n    viewsets.GenericViewSet,\r\n):\r\n    queryset = User.objects.all()\r\n    permission_classes = (AllowAny,)\r\n\r\n    def get_serializer_class(self):\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the serializer class given the action&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        action = self.action\r\n        if self.action == &#39;create&#39; or self.action == &#39;list&#39;:\r\n            return CreateUserSerializer\r\n        else:\r\n            return UserSerializer\r\n\r\n    def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        email = self.request.query_params.get(&#39;email&#39;, None)\r\n        phone_no = self.request.query_params.get(&#39;phone_no&#39;, None)\r\n\r\n        if email is not None:\r\n            queryset = User.objects.filter(email=email)\r\n        elif phone_no is not None:\r\n            queryset = User.objects.filter(phone_no=phone_no)\r\n        else:\r\n            queryset = User.objects.all()\r\n        return super().list(request, *args, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few comments about my example:\r\n\r\n* I overrided `get_serializer_class` because I saw you had two different serializers on your viewsets. However, I&#39;m quite sure you can do what you want by using [`read_only`/`write_only` options](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/#core-arguments) of the `Serializer` fields.\r\n* In your `list` view, you are implementing some filtering logic. You can do this more easily with [`django-filter`](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#djangofilterbackend), without having to overload the `list` method.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361329/drf-get-not-allowed-on-a-generic-view-set-with-listmodel-mixin/58373903#58373903","title":"DRF: &quot;GET Not Allowed&quot;, on a generic view set with ListModel mixin"}],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":8420068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c11f5b3ca3637f63ca8725a47ce2c923?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Goutam B Seervi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8420068/goutam-b-seervi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58373903,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571045508,"creation_date":1570950372,"question_id":58361329,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58361329","body_markdown":"I have 2 viewsets on the same url, one for Create and List the other one for retrieve update and destroy.

Here is the method - \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void handleButtonPressed(int buttonTag) {\r\n    Log.d(&quot;card view - &quot;, &quot;inside handleButtonPressed&quot;);\r\n    TinderStackLayout tinderStackLayout = ((TinderStackLayout) this.getParent());\r\n    TinderCardView topCard = (TinderCardView) tinderStackLayout.getChildAt(tinderStackLayout.getChildCount() - 1);\r\n    if (isCardAnimating) {\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    switch (buttonTag) {\r\n      case DELETE_BUTTON_PRESSED:\r\n        isCardAnimating = true;\r\n        deleteCard(topCard);\r\n        break;\r\n      case PASS_BUTTON_PRESSED:\r\n        Log.d(&quot;card view - &quot;, &quot;inside pass button pressed&quot;);\r\n        isCardAnimating = true;\r\n        passCard(topCard);\r\n        Log.d(&quot;card view - &quot;, &quot;top card Value before pass - &quot; + topCard.displayNameTextView.getText());\r\n        Log.d(&quot;card view - &quot;, &quot;child count - &quot; + tinderStackLayout.getChildCount());\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; tinderStackLayout.getChildCount(); i++) {\r\n          View childAt = tinderStackLayout.getChildAt(i);\r\n          if (childAt instanceof TinderCardView)\r\n            Log.d(&quot;card view - &quot;, &quot;child cards before deletion - &quot; + (((TinderCardView) childAt).usernameTextView.getText()));\r\n        }\r\n        break;\r\n      case APPROVE_BUTTON_PRESSED:\r\n        showLawyerContactDetailsFragment(topCard);\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am trying to do `TinderCardView topCard = (TinderCardView) tinderStackLayout.getChildAt(tinderStackLayout.getChildCount() - 1)` in order to get the top card in my stack, which would be correct if I delete the cards and not re-add them to my stack but that is not the case when re-adding them. What should be the solution for always getting the top card when I am adding new views all the time? \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jf2Fc.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lcgFj.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361324/deleting-child-view-from-first-position-and-adding-it-to-last-position","title":"Deleting child view from first position and adding it to last position"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","python-pptx"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13149,"user_id":1902513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dde51d04370847170ede2450660334ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"scanny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902513/scanny"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571077252,"creation_date":1571077252,"answer_id":58382145,"question_id":58361320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58382145","body_markdown":"There is no guarantee that a given word will begin and end in a single run; any given word may be split across multiple runs and its runs may contain prior and trailing text. PowerPoint will split runs wherever it pleases, perhaps to highlight a misspelled word or just if you pause in typing or go in to fix a typo or something.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that can be said for sure about a run is that all the characters it contains share the same character formatting.\r\n\r\nSo to do what you want requires a substantially more sophisticated algorithm and some low-level features `python-pptx` doesn&#39;t have yet.\r\n\r\nThe general approach would be something like this:\r\n\r\n* find a paragraph that contains the search word\r\n* from that paragraph, find the subsequence of runs that contain that word. In general this is a sequence (list) and can include text before the word starts and after it ends.\r\n* divide the first of these runs into two at the word start (unless it starts on an even run boundary)\r\n* break the last of these runs into two at the word end (unless it ends on an even run boundary)\r\n* set the formatting of all the (middle) runs that contain all or part of the word to your desired settings\r\n\r\nThere is currently no API support for the run-splitting bit and it would require working with the underlying XML objects in `python-pptx` which is something of an advanced topic. If you want to pursue that, searching Google on &quot;python-pptx workaround function&quot; will give you a place to start.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361320/how-to-change-specific-words-font-color-of-pptx-file/58382145#58382145","title":"How to change specific words&#39; font color of .pptx file?"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10351001,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-T_L_D0IxGSo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJc/RtFw-bWZrJQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"maratom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10351001/maratom"},"last_editor":{"reputation":911,"user_id":11090395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H_c1BGk5xxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/GlG4239SjSs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Smack Alpha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11090395/smack-alpha"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58382145,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571077252,"creation_date":1570950284,"last_edit_date":1570950965,"question_id":58361320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58361320","body_markdown":"```\r\nsearchInput = &quot;chapter&quot;\r\ntry:\r\n    prs = Presentation(&quot;e:/test3/ch7.pptx&quot;)\r\n    for slide in prs.slides:\r\n        for shape in slide.shapes:\r\n            if hasattr(shape, &quot;text&quot;):\r\n                shape.text = shape.text.lower()\r\n                for paragraph in shape.text_frame.paragraphs:\r\n                    for run in paragraph.runs:\r\n                        if searchInput in run.text:\r\n                            print(run.text)\r\n                            #run.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(0, 0, 255)\r\n\r\n\r\nexcept PermissionError:\r\n    pass\r\nprs.save(&quot;e:/test3/ch7_modified1.pptx&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I can check whether this &quot;ch7.pptx&quot; file contains specific words I want to find.\r\n\r\nIf I print(run.text), It print out\r\n```\r\nchapter 7:  synchronization examples\r\nchapter 7: synchronization examples\r\nend of chapter 7\r\n```\r\nSo, I can see there are several words &quot;chapter&quot;. \r\nBut, I want to change the color of &quot;chapter&quot; to Yellow in my &quot;ch7.pptx&quot;, then I want to save to &quot;ch7_modified.pptx&quot;\r\n\r\nI keep tying to find how to change the color but it does not work properly.

Also provide more details about the repo where you got the model from and any other information that you think is relevant.\r\n\r\nBased on my past experience, I&#39;m pretty sure that you are using Matterplot&#39;s mask RCNN and your issue is due to class count mismatch. You are trying to load weight of a model that was trained on a different class count. You should exclude some layers such as &#39;mrcnn_bbox_fc&#39;,&#39;mrcnn_class_logits’. \r\n\r\nFix is to change `model.load_weights(COCO_MODEL_PATH, by_name=True)` to `model.load_weights(filepath,

you open at once a large file that needs to fit into your RAM. If you do not have a really good computer, this might be the first bottleneck for perfomance. Read each line separately, or try to use some IO buffer.\r\nWhat CPU do you have? If you have enough cores, you can get a lot of extra performance when parallelizing the program with an async Pool from Multiprocessing library because you really use the full power of all cores (choose the number of processes according to the thread number. With this method, I reduced a model on 2500 data sets from ~5 minutes to ~17 seconds on 12 threads). You would have to implement the processes to return a dict each, updating them after the processes have finished.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, there are machine learning approches for text summarization (sequence to sequence RNNs). With a tensorflow implementation, you can use a dedicated GPU on your local machine (even a decent 10xx or a 2060 from Nvidia will help) to speed up your model. \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html \r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023\r\n\r\nhope this helps\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361290/improve-efficiency-for-ranking-in-bag-of-words-model/58362455#58362455","title":"Improve efficiency for ranking in Bag of words model"}],"owner":{"reputation":73,"user_id":2154208,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fadc459460f208648fd509c935240e5f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shivi Bhatia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2154208/shivi-bhatia"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570960531,"creation_date":1570950039,"question_id":58361290,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58361290","body_markdown":"I am creating a text summarizer and using a basic model to work with using Bag of words approach.   \r\nthe code i am performing is using the nltk library. \r\nthe file read is a large file with over 2500000 words. \r\nbelow is the loop i am working on with but this takes over 2 hours to run and complete. is there a way to optimize this code    \r\n\r\n\r\n    f= open(&#39;Complaints.csv&#39;, &#39;r&#39;)\r\n    raw = f.read()\r\n    len(raw)\r\n    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(raw)\r\n    len(tokens)\r\n    freq = nltk.FreqDist(text)\r\n    top_words = [] # blank dictionary \r\n    top_words = freq.most_common(100)\r\n    print(top_words)\r\n    sentences = sent_tokenize(raw)\r\n    print(raw)\r\n    ranking = defaultdict(int)\r\n    for i, sent in enumerate(raw):\r\n    for word in word_tokenize(sent.lower()):\r\n        if word in freq:\r\n            ranking[i]+=freq[word]\r\n    top_sentences = nlargest(10, ranking, ranking.get)\r\n    print(top_sentences)\r\n\r\nThis is only one one file and the actual deployment has more than 10-15 files of similar size. \r\nHow we can improve this.    \r\nPlease note these are the text from a chat bot and are actual sentences hence there was no requirement to remove whitespaces, stemming and other text pre processing methods","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361290/improve-efficiency-for-ranking-in-bag-of-words-model","title":"Improve efficiency for ranking in Bag of words model"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","express"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":935,"user_id":1927583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc9a6c4f6d819f019db6d48264f47dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ba_ul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927583/ba-ul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570950797,"post_id":58361288,"comment_id":103074533,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361288/why-call-this-method-http-createserver#comment103074533_58361288"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11721140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b218a2165c86ca6ab5b008e792790b5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Роман Иванов","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11721140/%d0%a0%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd-%d0%98%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570952051,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570950030,"creation_date":1570950030,"question_id":58361288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58361288","body_markdown":"Why call this method http.createServer(app)?
