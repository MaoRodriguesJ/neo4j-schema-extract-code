Initial security identifiers (isid) are a special way to label entities. It is used to label entities in scenarios that could not otherwise be addressed. For example the scenario of fail-over, initialization and fixed objects.\r\n\r\nThe `unlabeled_t` type is associated with both the &quot;unlabeled&quot; as well as the &quot;file&quot; isid. The unlabeled isid is used to automatically associate the type (in this case `unlabeled_t`) with entities that have an invalid context, and the file isid is used to automatically associate the type associated with it (in this case `unlabeled_t`) with entities that have no label at all.\r\n\r\nThese two common (fail over) scenario&#39;s can happen for various reasons:\r\n\r\n1. SELinux is mutable at runtime in GNU/Linux, this means that one can add and remove contexts at runtime, and therefore validate and invalidate contexts. So if there is an entity in your system with a given context, and you decide to remove that context at runtime, then it gets invalidated and the unlabeled isid will automatically associate `unlabeled_t` with it.\r\n\r\n2. When you format a new partition, or when you share a partition with a system that does not use SELinux, then that filesystem has no labels by default. The file initial sid kicks in and associates `unlabeled_t` with objects that have no label.\r\n\r\nThe isid contexts are associated in memory.\r\nSELinux enforces integrity by default. So everything always needs a valid label.\r\nInitial security identifiers are used to address labeling challenges that can&#39;t otherwise be addressed.\r\n\r\nIf you see `unlabeled_t`, then the entity either has an invalid label or no label at all. You would want to address that by associating a valid label with the entity.\r\n\r\n`unconfined_t` is a &quot;normal&quot; type that just has a very broad set of permissions associated with it. Entities associated with the `unconfined_t` type are virtually unconfined by SELinux.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444157/unconfined-t-vs-unlabeled-t-in-selinux/58446619#58446619","title":"unconfined_t vs unlabeled_t in SELinux"}],"owner":{"reputation":79,"user_id":6481738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9t7bR-UyHNI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/j_Uq62KMqb0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raxesh Oriya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6481738/raxesh-oriya"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58446619,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571389318,"creation_date":1571374531,"question_id":58444157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444157","body_markdown":"I have come across two different SELinux types which are `unconfined_t` and `unlabeled_t`\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n&gt; Can anyone tell me what is difference between them?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444157/unconfined-t-vs-unlabeled-t-in-selinux","title":"unconfined_t vs unlabeled_t in SELinux"},{"tags":["windows","ansible"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8045671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-D5kMB8OH-Zc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAANX8/SoFLJdgo5Gk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ThePenguin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8045671/thepenguin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571374457,"creation_date":1571374457,"question_id":58444149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444149","body_markdown":"Currently trying to create a Windows 2019 image for deployment via the vm_guest module in Ansible Tower.

purpose: Analyze large amount of text content, approximately 90,000,000 rows stored in MySQL table. Tokenize each text, extract words and store them in table `words`.\r\nI stored the words in a list with it&#39;s frequency:\r\n\r\n    public class WordEntry{\r\n        public String word; \r\n        public int count = 1;\r\n    }\r\n    public void insertWord(WordEntry entry){\r\n        for(WordEntry e:mWordList){\r\n            if(e.word.equals(entry.word)){\r\n                e.count++;\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        list.add(entry);\r\n        if(mWordList.size() &gt; 1000){// in case of the sql cmd being too long\r\n            flushWords(mWordList);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void flushWords(List&lt;WordEntry&gt; list){\r\n        String sqlCmd =&quot;insert into words(word, frequency) values %s on duplicate key update frequency = frequency+values(frequency);&quot;\r\n        StringBuilder values = new StringBuilder();\r\n        for(WordEntry e:list){\r\n            values.append(&quot;(&quot;+e.word+&quot;,&quot;+e.count+&quot;),&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        values.deleteAt(values.length()-1);// remove the last comma\r\n        sqlCmd=String.format(sqlCmd, values.toString());\r\n        PreparedStatement ps = mConnection.prepareStatement(sqlCmd);\r\n        ps.executeUpdate();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nas to the function `flushWords(List&lt;WordEntry&gt; list)`, it is inside the `class Processor implements Runnable`.\r\nIf I do it in single thread way, handling 500 rows will take about 2 seconds, so it&#39;s going to take me up to 4 days to finish all 90,000,000 rows! Of course I can run my program slowly and wait for the result, but I really want to do it faster.\r\n\r\nSo I used `ThreadPoolExecutor` to run 8 thread concurrently. It did speed up the program, but it throws mysql deadlock exception sometimes! The behavior of my program is completely **unpredictable**.\r\n\r\nSo I thought it would be better to have one single thread that does the MySQL insertion, that way I can get rid of the deadlock problem. Instead of inserting to database from inside the thread, I published the SQL command string to a `LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;String&gt;` and `poll(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS)` from that queue and execute them one by one, so the `flushWords` function is now:\r\n\r\n    public void flushWords(List&lt;WordEntry&gt; list){  \r\n        ...  \r\n        sqlCmd=String.format(sqlCmd, values.toString());\r\n        try{\r\n            mSqlQueue.put(sqlCmd);\r\n        }catch(InterruptedException e){\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class DBWorker implements Runnable{\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void run(){\r\n            while(true){\r\n                String cmd = mQueue.poll(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n                PreparedStatement ps = mConnection.prepareStatement(sqlCmd);\r\n                ps.executeUpdate();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nNow, 8 threads push SQL command into the queue, only one thread to execute them one by one, if the limit of the queue is reached, all other threads will have to wait for available space from queue to push the SQL command in. The `DBWorker` thread slows down the entire program. If I don&#39;t limit the capacity of the queue, I&#39;m afraid those 8 thread will fill up my entire memory space.\r\n\r\nSo, what is the best way to insert data into MySQL database with multiple thread concurrently in java?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444103/java-multithreading-mysql-insert","title":"Java multithreading mysql insert"},{"tags":["javascript","html","swipe","hammer"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11334533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IPj2jZHiI-0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/rFhXxq_R7J0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Van Dominic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11334533/van-dominic"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1041,"user_id":4481000,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukkoc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jainil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4481000/jainil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571380543,"creation_date":1571374118,"last_edit_date":1571380543,"question_id":58444102,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444102","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to some kind of pattern for my web app,\r\nso if the user swipes up and left, respectively it will trigger an event\r\n\r\nHow to do that with hammer js?

have three navigations in one page and I&#39;m trying to show the active links for each nav. For some reason the third nav isn&#39;t working correctly. For example, if you click on &quot;chapter 2&quot; or &quot;chapter 3&quot; or &quot;chapter 4&quot;, &quot;chapter 1&quot; stays active. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because &quot;Chapter 1&quot; and &quot;sublink4&quot; from the middle nav have the same url. I tried removing the active class of the third nav, but it&#39;s not working. Unfortunately the snipping isn&#39;t working as it is on my computer. I only used target=&quot;_blank&quot; on the snippet, not only my local machine since you can&#39;t click on links on the snippet without restarting the snippet.Thanks\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n \r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fT0wd.png\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(window).on(&#39;load&#39;, function () {\r\n        $(&#39;body&#39;).setActiveMenuItem();\r\n        $(&#39;body&#39;).setActiveMenuItem2();\r\n        $(&#39;body&#39;).setActiveMenuItem3();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function () {\r\n\r\n        //first nav\r\n        $.fn.setActiveMenuItem2 = function () {\r\n\r\n            $.each($(&#39;.nav1&#39;).find(&#39;li&#39;), function () {\r\n                $(this).toggleClass(&#39;active&#39;,\r\n                    window.location.pathname.indexOf($(this).find(&#39;a&#39;).attr(&#39;href&#39;)) &gt;

Or is there a way to essentially copy text and numbers from a table visible on the screen using python and Selenium? (I’ve looked into xdotool but didn’t find enough documentation to help). I’m just learning Selenium so any suggestions will be much appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443994/how-to-get-visible-text-from-a-webpage-using-selenium-python","title":"How

Its version is `2.28.9000`.\r\n\r\nIn `glibc/time/bits/types/struct_tm.h` there is\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nstruct tm\r\n{\r\n  int tm_sec;\t\t\t/* Seconds.\t[0-60] (1 leap second) */\r\n  int tm_min;\t\t\t/* Minutes.\t[0-59] */\r\n  int tm_hour;\t\t\t/* Hours.\t[0-23] */\r\n  int tm_mday;\t\t\t/* Day.\t\t[1-31] */\r\n  int tm_mon;\t\t\t/* Month.\t[0-11] */\r\n  int tm_year;\t\t\t/* Year\t- 1900.  */\r\n  int tm_wday;\t\t\t/* Day of week.\t[0-6] */\r\n  int tm_yday;\t\t\t/* Days in year.[0-365]\t*/\r\n  int tm_isdst;\t\t\t/* DST.\t\t[-1/0/1]*/\r\n\r\n# ifdef\t__USE_MISC\r\n  long int tm_gmtoff;\t\t/* Seconds east of UTC.  */\r\n  const char *tm_zone;\t\t/* Timezone abbreviation.  */\r\n# else\r\n  long int __tm_gmtoff;\t\t/* Seconds east of UTC.  */\r\n  const char *__tm_zone;\t/* Timezone abbreviation.  */\r\n# endif\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that `struct tm` does store time zone information, at least in this implementation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443953/does-struct-tm-store-time-zone-information-as-its-data-member/58444808#58444808","title":"Does struct tm store time zone information as its data member"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":153628,"user_id":576911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a2941970f141aad669d13375dc57c4f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Howard Hinnant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/576911/howard-hinnant"},"last_editor":{"reputation":153628,"user_id":576911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a2941970f141aad669d13375dc57c4f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Howard Hinnant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/576911/howard-hinnant"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1571445225,"last_edit_date":1571445225,"creation_date":1571408374,"answer_id":58452742,"question_id":58443953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452742","body_markdown":"The C standard says in 7.27.1 Components of time:\r\n\r\n&gt; The `tm` structure shall contain **at least** the following members, in\r\n&gt; any order. The semantics of the members and their normal ranges are\r\n&gt; expressed in the comments.&lt;sup&gt;318)&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     int tm_sec;    // seconds after the minute — [0, 60]\r\n&gt;     int tm_min;    // minutes after the hour — [0, 59]\r\n&gt;     int tm_hour;   // hours since midnight — [0, 23]\r\n&gt;     int tm_mday;   // day of the month — [1, 31]\r\n&gt;     int tm_mon;    // months since January — [0, 11]\r\n&gt;     int tm_year;   // years since 1900\r\n&gt;     int tm_wday;   // days since Sunday — [0, 6]\r\n&gt;     int tm_yday;   // days since January 1 — [0, 365]\r\n&gt;     int tm_isdst;  // Daylight Saving Time flag\r\n\r\n(emphasis is mine)\r\n\r\nThat is, implementations are allowed to add additional members to `tm`, as you found with `glibc/time/bits/types/struct_tm.h`.  The POSIX spec has nearly identical wording.\r\n\r\nThe result is that `%Z` (or even `%z`) can not be considered portable in `strftime`.  The spec for `%Z` reflects this:\r\n\r\n&gt; `%Z` is replaced by the locale’s time zone name or abbreviation, *or\r\n&gt; by no characters if no time zone is determinable.* `[tm_isdst]`\r\n\r\nThat is, vendors are allowed to throw up their hands and simply say: &quot;no time zone was determinable, so I&#39;m not outputting any characters at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nMy opinion:  The C timing API is a mess.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am attempting to improve things for the upcoming C++20 standard within the `&lt;chrono&gt;` library.\r\n\r\nThe draft C++20 spec changes this from &quot;no characters&quot; to an exception being thrown if the `time_zone` abbreviation is not available:\r\n\r\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/time.format#3\r\n\r\n&gt; Unless explicitly requested, the result of formatting a chrono type\r\n&gt; does not contain time zone abbreviation and time zone offset\r\n&gt; information. If the information is available, the conversion\r\n&gt; specifiers `%Z` and `%z` will format this information (respectively).\r\n&gt; [ *Note:* If the information is not available and a `%Z` or `%z`\r\n&gt; conversion specifier appears in the *chrono-format-spec*, an exception\r\n&gt; of type `format_&#173;error` is thrown, as described above. *— end note* ]\r\n\r\nExcept that the above paragraph is not describing C&#39;s `strftime`, but a new `format` function that operates on `std::chrono` types, not `tm`.  Additionally there is a new type:  `std::chrono::zoned_time` (http://eel.is/c++draft/time.zone.zonedtime) that *always* has the `time_zone` abbreviation (and offset) available and can be formatted with the afore mentioned `format` function.\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;chrono&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\n    int\r\n    main()\r\n    {\r\n        using namespace std;\r\n        using namespace std::chrono;\r\n        auto now = system_clock::now();\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time{current_zone(), now});   // HKT (or whatever)\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time{&quot;Asia/Hong_Kong&quot;, now}); // HKT or HKST\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time{&quot;Etc/UTC&quot;, now});        // UTC\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, now);                               // UTC\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer:  The final syntax of the formatting string in the `format` function is likely to be slightly different, but the functionality will be there.)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to experiment with a preview of this library, it is free and open source here:  https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date\r\n\r\nSome installation is required:  https://howardhinnant.github.io/date/tz.html#Installation\r\n\r\nIn this preview, you will need to use the header `&quot;date/tz.h&quot;`, and the contents of the library are in `namespace date` instead of `namespace std::chrono`.\r\n\r\nThe preview library can be used with C++11 or later.\r\n\r\n`zoned_time` is templated on a `std::chrono::duration` which specifies the precision of the time point, and is deduced in the example code above using [C++17&#39;s CTAD feature][1].  If you are using this preview library in C++11 or C++14, the syntax would look more like:\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time&lt;system_clock::duration&gt;{current_zone(), now});\r\n\r\nOr there is a non-proposed-for-standardization helper factory function which will do the deduction for you:\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, make_zoned(current_zone(), now));\r\n\r\n(#CTAD_eliminates_factory_functions)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template_argument_deduction","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443953/does-struct-tm-store-time-zone-information-as-its-data-member/58452742#58452742","title":"Does struct tm store time zone information as its data member"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571429999,"last_edit_date":1571429999,"creation_date":1571425428,"answer_id":58456796,"question_id":58443953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58456796","body_markdown":"One of the reasons date and time programming is so difficult is that it&#39;s fundamentally at least a somewhat difficult problem: &quot;Thirty days hath September&quot;, and [sexagesimal arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal), and time zones, and daylight saving time, and leap years, and let&#39;s not even talk about leap seconds.\r\n\r\nBut the other reason it&#39;s difficult is that all too many libraries and languages make a perfect mess of it, and C is unfortunately no exception.  (C++ is trying to do better, as Howard mentions in his answer.)\r\n\r\nEven though everybody knows global variables are Bad, C&#39;s date/time functions basically use a couple of them.  In effect, the concept of &quot;this system&#39;s current time zone&quot; is a global variable, and the global data which describes that time zone is shared willy-nilly between `localtime` and `strftime` and a number of other functions.\r\n\r\nSo `strftime` can fill in `%z` and `%Z` based on that global data, even if it isn&#39;t passed in as part of a `struct tm` value.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s obviously a suboptimal arrangement, and it would start causing real problems if there were a way for a program to dynamically *change* the time zone it wants to use for `localtime` and the rest.  (And this arrangement persists in part because there&#39;s *not* actually a good, portable, Standard way for a program to change the local time zone it&#39;s using.)\r\n\r\nOver the years there have been various half-hearted attempt to clean some of the mess up (while preserving backwards compatibility, of course).  One of those attempts involves the extended `tm_gmtoff` and `tm_zone` fields you&#39;ve discovered in some systems&#39; versions of `struct tm`.  Those additions are a *huge* improvement -- I can&#39;t imagine doing serious date/time programming on a system without them -- but they&#39;re still not Standard, and there are still plenty of systems that don&#39;t have them (not even with the &quot;hidden&quot; spellings `__tm_gmtoff` and `__tm_zone`).\r\n\r\nYou can read much more about the sordid history of date/time support in C in this paper: [*Time, Clock, and Calendar Programming In C*](http://www.catb.org/esr/time-programming/), by Eric Raymond.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443953/does-struct-tm-store-time-zone-information-as-its-data-member/58456796#58456796","title":"Does struct tm store time zone information as its data member"}],"owner":{"reputation":650,"user_id":9373509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee85b2e77da0aaa34e30c9cf7749f2e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"aafulei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9373509/aafulei"},"last_editor":{"reputation":650,"user_id":9373509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee85b2e77da0aaa34e30c9cf7749f2e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"aafulei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9373509/aafulei"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":91,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58452742,"answer_count":3,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571445225,"creation_date":1571372880,"last_edit_date":1571376755,"question_id":58443953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443953","body_markdown":"Consider the following C++ code\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;ctime&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::time_t now = std::time(nullptr);\r\n    struct tm local = *std::localtime(&amp;now);\r\n    struct tm gm = *std::gmtime(&amp;now);\r\n    char str[20];\r\n    std::strftime(str, 20, &quot;%Z&quot;, &amp;local);\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; std::endl;          // HKT\r\n    std::strftime(str, 20, &quot;%Z&quot;, &amp;gm);\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; std::endl;          // UTC\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo stored in `now` is an unambiguous integral value, while `local` and `gm` are `struct tm` that store human-readable date/time information.

I&#39;m using Haskell in production for 4 years already, and I&#39;m also struggling with understanding this definition of `foldM`. But that is mostly because it&#39;s poorly written. Please, don&#39;t take it as a personal fault if you can&#39;t understand some obscure code. Here is a more readable version of `foldlM`\r\n\r\n    foldlM\r\n        :: forall t m a b .\r\n           (Foldable t, Monad m)\r\n        =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b)  -- ^ Monadic action\r\n        -&gt; b                -- ^ Starting accumulator\r\n        -&gt; t a              -- ^ List of values\r\n        -&gt; m b              -- ^ Computation result inside a monad\r\n    foldlM f z xs = (foldr step pure xs) z\r\n      where\r\n        step :: a -&gt; (b -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; m b\r\n        step cur next acc = do\r\n            result &lt;- f acc cur\r\n            next result\r\n\r\nThis function is still not the easiest one. Mostly because it has non-typical usage of `foldr` where the intermediate accumulator is a function. But you can see a few mays that make such definition more readable:\r\n\r\n1. Comments about function arguments.\r\n2. Better argument names (still short and idiomatic, but they are at least more readable).\r\n3. The explicit type signature of the function inside `where` (so you know the shape of the arguments).\r\n\r\nAfter seeing such function, you can now perform _Equational reasoning technique_ to expand the definition step-by-step and see how it works. Ability to come up with such functions comes with experience. I don&#39;t have strong mathematician skills, and this function is not a typical Haskell function.

Below there&#39;s an implementation of `foldlM` using `foldl` instead of `foldr`. It is a good excercise, try it and come later to the solution I&#39;d suggest. The example explain all the reasoning I&#39;ve done to achieve it, which might be different from yours, and might be bias because I&#39;ve already knew about using a function accumulator.\r\n\r\n**Step 1**: Let&#39;s try to write `foldlM` in terms of `foldl`\r\n```\r\n-- this doesn&#39;t compile because f returning type is (m b) and not just (b) \r\nfoldlM :: (Foldable t, Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM f z0 xs = foldl f z0 xs \r\n\r\n-- So let substitute f by some undefined f&#39;\r\nfoldlM :: (Foldable t, Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM f z0 xs = foldl f&#39; z0 xs\r\n  where f&#39; = undefined\r\n\r\n-- cool, but f&#39; should use f somehow in order to get the monadic behaviour\r\nfoldlM :: (Foldable t, Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM f z0 xs = foldl f&#39; z0 xs\r\n  where f&#39; b a = f somethingIDontkNow \r\n```\r\nHere you realize that `f&#39;` is pure and you&#39;d need to extract the result of `f` to type match. The only way to &#39;extract&#39; a monadic value is with `&gt;&gt;=` operator, but such an operator needs to be wrap right after it is used.\r\n\r\nSo as a conclusion: Every time you end up with _I&#39;d like to fully unwrap this monad_, just give up. Is not the right way\r\n\r\n**Step 2**: Let&#39;s try to write `foldlM` in terms of `foldl` but first using `[]` as foldable, since it is easy to pattern match (i.e. we don&#39;t actually need to use `fold`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- This is not very hard. It is pretty standard recursion schema. :)\r\nfoldlM&#39; :: (Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM&#39; f z0 []     = return z0\r\nfoldlM&#39; f z0 (x:xs) = f z0 x &gt;&gt;= \\c -&gt; foldlM&#39; f c xs\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOk, that was easy. Let compare the definition with the usual `foldl` definition for lists\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoldlM&#39; :: (Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM&#39; f z0 []     = return z0\r\nfoldlM&#39; f z0 (x:xs) = f z0 x &gt;&gt;= \\c -&gt; foldlM&#39; f c xs\r\n\r\nmyfoldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b\r\nmyfoldl f z0 []     = z0\r\nmyfoldl f z0 (x:xs) = foldl f (f z0 x) xs\r\n```\r\nCool!! they are pretty much the same. The trivial case is about the exact same thing. The recursive case is a little bit different, you&#39;d like to write something more like: `foldlM&#39; f (f z0 x) xs`. But is doesn&#39;t compile as in step 1, so you might think _OK, I don&#39;t want to apply `f`, just to hold such a computation and compose it with `&gt;&gt;=`. I&#39;d like to write something more like_ `foldlM&#39; f (f z0 x &gt;&gt;=) xs` if it had sense...\r\n\r\n**Step 3** Realize that what you want to accumulate is a function composition and not a result. (_here I am probably bias by the fact that I already knew it because you&#39;ve posted it_).\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoldlM :: (Foldable t, Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM f z0 xs = foldl f&#39; initFunc xs\r\n  where initFunc = undefined :: b -&gt; m b\r\n        f&#39;       = undefined :: (b -&gt; m b) -&gt; a -&gt; (b -&gt; m b) -- This type signature can be deduce because f&#39; should be applied to initFunc and a&#39;s from t a. \r\n```\r\nBy the type of `initFunc` and using our knowledge from step 2 (the recursive definition) we can deduce that `initFunc = return`. The definition of `f&#39;` can be completed knowing that `f&#39;` should use `f` and `&gt;&gt;=`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoldlM :: (Foldable t, Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM f z0 xs = foldl f&#39; return xs z0\r\n--                        ^^^^^^\r\n--                        |- Initial value\r\n  where f&#39; b a = \\bvalue -&gt; b bvalue &gt;&gt;= \\bresult -&gt; f bresult a -- this is equivalent to (b &gt;=&gt; \\result -&gt; f result a) which captures the sequence behaviour of the implementation\r\n--         ^      ^^^^^^                  ^^^^^^^\r\n--         |      |                       |- This is the result of previous computation\r\n--         |      |- f&#39; should return a function b -&gt; m b.

The Haskell type system really offers me great help. For example, when I realised that I need some function of type\r\n```\r\nf :: (Foldable t, Monad m) =&gt; ( a-&gt; b -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; m b\r\n```\r\nThere are actually functions like ```foldM```, ```foldlM``` and ```foldrM```.\r\n\r\nHowever, what real shocked me is the definition of these functions, such as:\r\n```\r\nfoldlM :: (Foldable t, Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; m b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; m b\r\nfoldlM f z0 xs = foldr f&#39; return xs z0\r\n  where f&#39; x k z = f z x &gt;&gt;= k\r\n```\r\nso  function `f&#39;` must be of type:\r\n```\r\nf&#39; :: a -&gt; b -&gt; b\r\n```\r\nas required by `foldr`, then `b` must be of kind ` *-&gt; m *`, so the entire definition of `foldlM` could make sense. \r\n\r\nAnother example includes definitions of `liftA2` and `&lt;*&gt;`\r\n```\r\n(&lt;*&gt;) :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\r\n(&lt;*&gt;) = liftA2 id\r\n\r\nliftA2 :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c\r\nliftA2 f x = (&lt;*&gt;) (fmap f x)\r\n```\r\nI tried some of my own solutions before peeking into the source code. But the gap is so huge that I don&#39;t think I could ever come up with this solution, no matter how many lines of code I will write in future. \r\n\r\nSo my question is, what kind of knowledge or which specific mathematics branch is necessary for someone to reasoning on such a highly abstracted level. \r\n\r\nI know Category theory might offer some help and I&#39;ve been following [this great lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58&amp;list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) for a long time and still working on it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443912/what-kind-of-knowledge-or-training-is-necessary-for-someone-to-write-down-the-de","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"What kind of knowledge

have to use .Select() to create a new MessageTemplateDto and set each property you want to populate:\r\n\r\n    return context.MessageTemplates\r\n      .Where(m =&gt; m.NotifyEvent == notifyEvent &amp;&amp; m.SendVia == notifyVia.ToString())\r\n      .Select(r =&gt; new MessageTemplateDto() {\r\n          TemplateID = r.WhateverTheColumnNameForIdIsInYourMapping,\r\n          r.NotifyEvent //both column and dto property have same name so this can be simplified\r\n          r.SendVia //again, both dto and column seem to have the same name so this can simply be this\r\n          Template = r.WhateverYourColumnNameForTemplateIsInTheContext \r\n        }\r\n      .ToList();\r\n\r\nEtc\r\n\r\nInside the select the r represents the table row as delivered by the context so the column names in r will be whatever you set up in your mapping. You didn&#39;t show the mappin so I couldn&#39;t tell what some of your column names are\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t the only way to do throw, you can do things like provide a constructor in the Dto that takes an object of type that represents the entity, and then set the properties in the constructor. This is typically less often done because it binds your Dto suite of objects to be dependent on your entity domain and they should probably be separate. You can create a Map method in your repository class that is running this query; map takes a db entity and returns a dto; it depends how many times you&#39;ll do this - if this is the only place you&#39;ll ever query this table and create a list of template dto there&#39;s no point making a mapping method for it. \r\n\r\nUltimately the original problem was that your original query was returning a list of db entity objects and they cannot be directly assigned to a list declared to only have a list of dto objects because they&#39;re different objects. Like assigning a list of car type objects to a list&lt;person&gt; - instead you have to use Select to generate a Dto from the data entity. Dto are typically different, lighter, fewer properties, maybe some calculated properties that aren&#39;t in the db (like the dto has Age, the db has bitthdaye) and are used to move a small amount of data to some other place, perhaps even over a network hence why they&#39;re smaller ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444186/how-assign-ef-table-data-to-list/58444226#58444226","title":"How assign EF table data to List"}],"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":9509662,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bed30cd68c7147a5288dfb5e6b9cd42c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thomsan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9509662/thomsan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571375865,"creation_date":1571374721,"question_id":58444186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444186","body_markdown":"I need to get the specific raw column value from the table.

By the way, you can check the text for which my method returning null to figure out the issue,\r\n\r\n    public Message jsonToMessage(String json) {\r\n        if (!json.contains(&quot;{&quot;) || !json.contains(&quot;}&quot;)) {\r\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;onMessage: jsonToMessage: &quot; + json);\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        ...\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444185/parsing-json-string-by-using-gson-gives-me-error/58444839#58444839","title":"Parsing Json string by using Gson gives me error"}],"owner":{"reputation":110,"user_id":11110509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e71ed11f6e188a083fa62b3348c57b99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"david s.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11110509/david-s"},"last_editor":{"reputation":110,"user_id":11110509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e71ed11f6e188a083fa62b3348c57b99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"david s.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11110509/david-s"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58444839,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571383985,"creation_date":1571374720,"last_edit_date":1571381965,"question_id":58444185,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444185","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why I am getting \r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalStateException:\r\nExpected BEGIN_OBJECT but was STRING at line 1 column 1 path $\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have probably read through 15+ stackoverflow pages and tried a bunch of solutions for the entire day.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a simple websocket listener that returns a string everytime a message is sent from my websocket server.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override public void onMessage(WebSocket webSocket, String text) {\r\n           \r\n    Log.d(TAG, &quot;onMessage: Recieved: &quot; + text);\r\n            \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit returns the String:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{&#160;\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;camera_id&quot;:&quot;e9502c54-927c-4639-a94f-8d03149c9c62&quot;,\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;posted_by&quot;:&quot;14b07da5-1820-40db-8508&#160;cc81261458aa&quot;,\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;posted_by_user&quot;:&quot;david23&quot;,\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;message&quot;:&quot;hello&#160;world&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am successfully getting each item using my model class\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Message {\r\n\r\n    private String camera_id;\r\n    private String posted_by;\r\n    private String posted_by_user;\r\n    private String message;\r\n\r\n    public String getMessage() {\r\n        return message;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ... rest of methods\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd inside my onMessage listener...\r\n```\r\ntry{\r\n    Gson gson = new Gson();\r\n    Message message = gson.fromJson(text, Message.class);\r\n    Log.d(TAG, &quot;onMessage: &quot; + message.getMessage());\r\n}catch (Exception e){\r\n    Log.d(TAG, &quot;onMessage: Error: &quot; + e);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am successfully extracting the message key&#39;s string, but gson keeps throwing me this error and I CAN&#39;T FIGUREOUT why.\r\n\r\n```\r\nException: com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: \r\nExpected BEGIN_OBJECT but was STRING at line 1 column 1 path $\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome solutions have told me to confirm that the json sent from the server is a string.

(line 5, file &quot;Set Owner&quot;).\r\n\r\nI was hoping I would be able to run some script that will change the owner of the copied spreadsheet to myself once the document is opened so that all protections remain.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444176/how-to-change-the-owner-of-a-google-sheet-automatically-when-a-copy-of-the-docum","title":"How to change the Owner of a google sheet automatically when a copy of the document is made"},{"tags":["postgresql","join","jsonb"],"owner":{"reputation":445,"user_id":11757024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UcnoN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Morris de Oryx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11757024/morris-de-oryx"},"last_editor":{"reputation":445,"user_id":11757024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UcnoN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Morris de Oryx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11757024/morris-de-oryx"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571377859,"creation_date":1571374604,"last_edit_date":1571377859,"question_id":58444175,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444175","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to construct a query to embed in a view that starts from a table with normal columns, and a JSONB column:\r\n\r\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS data.domo_passthrough CASCADE;\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data.domo_passthrough (\r\n    \tid           uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT extensions.gen_random_uuid (),\r\n    \ttype_name    text NOT NULL DEFAULT NULL, \r\n    \treport_data  jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;{}&#39;,\r\n    \thsys_id       uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;00000000000000000000000000000000&#39;,\r\n    \tfacility_id   uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;00000000000000000000000000000000&#39;,\r\n    \r\n    CONSTRAINT domo_passthrough_id_pkey\r\n        PRIMARY KEY (id)\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThe JSON in my test case looks like this:\r\n\r\n    [\r\n    \t{&quot;table_name&quot;:&quot;Activity&quot;,&quot;record_count&quot;:0,&quot;table_number&quot;:214},\r\n    \t{&quot;table_name&quot;:&quot;Assembly&quot;,&quot;record_count&quot;:1,&quot;table_number&quot;:15},\r\n    \t{&quot;table_name&quot;:&quot;AssemblyProds&quot;,&quot;record_count&quot;:0,&quot;table_number&quot;:154}\r\n    ]                  \r\n\r\nFor the expansion, I can use `CREATE TYPE`, or add the type details in-line, like this:\r\n\r\n    select expanded_data.* \r\n    \r\n      from domo_passthrough,\r\n           jsonb_to_recordset(report_data) as expanded_data (\r\n               table_name text, \r\n               record_count integer,\r\n               table_number integer\r\n    \t\t) \r\n\r\nThat works fine, the JSONB is expanded properly to give me three columns:\r\n\r\n    table_name   record_count   table_number\r\n\r\n But now I want to add back in some columns from the parent table with lookups on related tables. Here&#39;s a simple query without the JSONB expansion:\r\n\r\n      select domo_passthrough.id as report_data_id,\r\n             coalesce(hsys.name_,&#39;&#39;) as hsys_name,\r\n             coalesce(facility.name_,&#39;&#39;) as facility_name\r\n          \t\t    \r\n         from domo_passthrough\r\n    left join facility on (domo_passthrough.facility_id = facility.id)\r\n    left join hsys     on (domo_passthrough.hsys_id = hsys.id)\r\n\r\nThis works fine to give me three columns:\r\n\r\n    report_data_id   hsys_name   facility_name\r\n\r\nWhat I do not know how to do is propery join together everything at once. Namely, a rowset like this:\r\n\r\n    report_data_id   hsys_name   facility_name   table_name   record_count   table_number\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve bashed around with putting the two queries into CTEs, trying a `CROSS JOIN`, and messing with syntax. The crux of the problem is that I&#39;m not getting the right conecpt in my head for how to join. If I&#39;ve got 10 rows in the parent `domo_passthrough` table, and each of them has 5 elements in their domo_passthrough.report_data JSONB, I&#39;m trying to get 50 rows with 6 columns each. The `report_data_id`, `hsys_name`, and `facility_name` values obviously repeat for each of the expanded JSONB values contained in the source row, if I do this right. I&#39;d be grateful for remedial help on this kind of join. It be really grateful for commentary. Is this a sensible way to go, or is there a more reasonable approach?\r\n\r\n# Is this a sensible solution? #\r\nI&#39;ve found a solution, but can&#39;t say I genuinely understand how it works. \r\n\r\n      select domo_passthrough.id as report_data_id,\r\n             coalesce(hsys.name_,&#39;&#39;) as hsys_name,\r\n             coalesce(facility.name_,&#39;&#39;) as facility_name,\r\n

Initial security identifiers (isid) are a special way to label entities. It is used to label entities in scenarios that could not otherwise be addressed. For example the scenario of fail-over, initialization and fixed objects.\r\n\r\nThe `unlabeled_t` type is associated with both the &quot;unlabeled&quot; as well as the &quot;file&quot; isid. The unlabeled isid is used to automatically associate the type (in this case `unlabeled_t`) with entities that have an invalid context, and the file isid is used to automatically associate the type associated with it (in this case `unlabeled_t`) with entities that have no label at all.\r\n\r\nThese two common (fail over) scenario&#39;s can happen for various reasons:\r\n\r\n1. SELinux is mutable at runtime in GNU/Linux, this means that one can add and remove contexts at runtime, and therefore validate and invalidate contexts. So if there is an entity in your system with a given context, and you decide to remove that context at runtime, then it gets invalidated and the unlabeled isid will automatically associate `unlabeled_t` with it.\r\n\r\n2. When you format a new partition, or when you share a partition with a system that does not use SELinux, then that filesystem has no labels by default. The file initial sid kicks in and associates `unlabeled_t` with objects that have no label.\r\n\r\nThe isid contexts are associated in memory.\r\nSELinux enforces integrity by default. So everything always needs a valid label.\r\nInitial security identifiers are used to address labeling challenges that can&#39;t otherwise be addressed.\r\n\r\nIf you see `unlabeled_t`, then the entity either has an invalid label or no label at all. You would want to address that by associating a valid label with the entity.\r\n\r\n`unconfined_t` is a &quot;normal&quot; type that just has a very broad set of permissions associated with it. Entities associated with the `unconfined_t` type are virtually unconfined by SELinux.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444157/unconfined-t-vs-unlabeled-t-in-selinux/58446619#58446619","title":"unconfined_t vs unlabeled_t in SELinux"}],"owner":{"reputation":79,"user_id":6481738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9t7bR-UyHNI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/j_Uq62KMqb0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raxesh Oriya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6481738/raxesh-oriya"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58446619,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571389318,"creation_date":1571374531,"question_id":58444157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444157","body_markdown":"I have come across two different SELinux types which are `unconfined_t` and `unlabeled_t`\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n&gt; Can anyone tell me what is difference between them?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444157/unconfined-t-vs-unlabeled-t-in-selinux","title":"unconfined_t vs unlabeled_t in SELinux"},{"tags":["windows","ansible"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8045671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-D5kMB8OH-Zc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAANX8/SoFLJdgo5Gk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ThePenguin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8045671/thepenguin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571374457,"creation_date":1571374457,"question_id":58444149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444149","body_markdown":"Currently trying to create a Windows 2019 image for deployment via the vm_guest module in Ansible Tower.

purpose: Analyze large amount of text content, approximately 90,000,000 rows stored in MySQL table. Tokenize each text, extract words and store them in table `words`.\r\nI stored the words in a list with it&#39;s frequency:\r\n\r\n    public class WordEntry{\r\n        public String word; \r\n        public int count = 1;\r\n    }\r\n    public void insertWord(WordEntry entry){\r\n        for(WordEntry e:mWordList){\r\n            if(e.word.equals(entry.word)){\r\n                e.count++;\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        list.add(entry);\r\n        if(mWordList.size() &gt; 1000){// in case of the sql cmd being too long\r\n            flushWords(mWordList);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void flushWords(List&lt;WordEntry&gt; list){\r\n        String sqlCmd =&quot;insert into words(word, frequency) values %s on duplicate key update frequency = frequency+values(frequency);&quot;\r\n        StringBuilder values = new StringBuilder();\r\n        for(WordEntry e:list){\r\n            values.append(&quot;(&quot;+e.word+&quot;,&quot;+e.count+&quot;),&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        values.deleteAt(values.length()-1);// remove the last comma\r\n        sqlCmd=String.format(sqlCmd, values.toString());\r\n        PreparedStatement ps = mConnection.prepareStatement(sqlCmd);\r\n        ps.executeUpdate();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nas to the function `flushWords(List&lt;WordEntry&gt; list)`, it is inside the `class Processor implements Runnable`.\r\nIf I do it in single thread way, handling 500 rows will take about 2 seconds, so it&#39;s going to take me up to 4 days to finish all 90,000,000 rows! Of course I can run my program slowly and wait for the result, but I really want to do it faster.\r\n\r\nSo I used `ThreadPoolExecutor` to run 8 thread concurrently. It did speed up the program, but it throws mysql deadlock exception sometimes! The behavior of my program is completely **unpredictable**.\r\n\r\nSo I thought it would be better to have one single thread that does the MySQL insertion, that way I can get rid of the deadlock problem. Instead of inserting to database from inside the thread, I published the SQL command string to a `LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;String&gt;` and `poll(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS)` from that queue and execute them one by one, so the `flushWords` function is now:\r\n\r\n    public void flushWords(List&lt;WordEntry&gt; list){  \r\n        ...  \r\n        sqlCmd=String.format(sqlCmd, values.toString());\r\n        try{\r\n            mSqlQueue.put(sqlCmd);\r\n        }catch(InterruptedException e){\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class DBWorker implements Runnable{\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void run(){\r\n            while(true){\r\n                String cmd = mQueue.poll(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n                PreparedStatement ps = mConnection.prepareStatement(sqlCmd);\r\n                ps.executeUpdate();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nNow, 8 threads push SQL command into the queue, only one thread to execute them one by one, if the limit of the queue is reached, all other threads will have to wait for available space from queue to push the SQL command in. The `DBWorker` thread slows down the entire program. If I don&#39;t limit the capacity of the queue, I&#39;m afraid those 8 thread will fill up my entire memory space.\r\n\r\nSo, what is the best way to insert data into MySQL database with multiple thread concurrently in java?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444103/java-multithreading-mysql-insert","title":"Java multithreading mysql insert"},{"tags":["javascript","html","swipe","hammer"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11334533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IPj2jZHiI-0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/rFhXxq_R7J0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Van Dominic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11334533/van-dominic"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1041,"user_id":4481000,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukkoc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jainil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4481000/jainil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571380543,"creation_date":1571374118,"last_edit_date":1571380543,"question_id":58444102,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58444102","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to some kind of pattern for my web app,\r\nso if the user swipes up and left, respectively it will trigger an event\r\n\r\nHow to do that with hammer js?

have three navigations in one page and I&#39;m trying to show the active links for each nav. For some reason the third nav isn&#39;t working correctly. For example, if you click on &quot;chapter 2&quot; or &quot;chapter 3&quot; or &quot;chapter 4&quot;, &quot;chapter 1&quot; stays active. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because &quot;Chapter 1&quot; and &quot;sublink4&quot; from the middle nav have the same url. I tried removing the active class of the third nav, but it&#39;s not working. Unfortunately the snipping isn&#39;t working as it is on my computer. I only used target=&quot;_blank&quot; on the snippet, not only my local machine since you can&#39;t click on links on the snippet without restarting the snippet.Thanks\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n \r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fT0wd.png\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(window).on(&#39;load&#39;, function () {\r\n        $(&#39;body&#39;).setActiveMenuItem();\r\n        $(&#39;body&#39;).setActiveMenuItem2();\r\n        $(&#39;body&#39;).setActiveMenuItem3();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function () {\r\n\r\n        //first nav\r\n        $.fn.setActiveMenuItem2 = function () {\r\n\r\n            $.each($(&#39;.nav1&#39;).find(&#39;li&#39;), function () {\r\n                $(this).toggleClass(&#39;active&#39;,\r\n                    window.location.pathname.indexOf($(this).find(&#39;a&#39;).attr(&#39;href&#39;)) &gt;

Or is there a way to essentially copy text and numbers from a table visible on the screen using python and Selenium? (I’ve looked into xdotool but didn’t find enough documentation to help). I’m just learning Selenium so any suggestions will be much appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443994/how-to-get-visible-text-from-a-webpage-using-selenium-python","title":"How

Its version is `2.28.9000`.\r\n\r\nIn `glibc/time/bits/types/struct_tm.h` there is\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nstruct tm\r\n{\r\n  int tm_sec;\t\t\t/* Seconds.\t[0-60] (1 leap second) */\r\n  int tm_min;\t\t\t/* Minutes.\t[0-59] */\r\n  int tm_hour;\t\t\t/* Hours.\t[0-23] */\r\n  int tm_mday;\t\t\t/* Day.\t\t[1-31] */\r\n  int tm_mon;\t\t\t/* Month.\t[0-11] */\r\n  int tm_year;\t\t\t/* Year\t- 1900.  */\r\n  int tm_wday;\t\t\t/* Day of week.\t[0-6] */\r\n  int tm_yday;\t\t\t/* Days in year.[0-365]\t*/\r\n  int tm_isdst;\t\t\t/* DST.\t\t[-1/0/1]*/\r\n\r\n# ifdef\t__USE_MISC\r\n  long int tm_gmtoff;\t\t/* Seconds east of UTC.  */\r\n  const char *tm_zone;\t\t/* Timezone abbreviation.  */\r\n# else\r\n  long int __tm_gmtoff;\t\t/* Seconds east of UTC.  */\r\n  const char *__tm_zone;\t/* Timezone abbreviation.  */\r\n# endif\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that `struct tm` does store time zone information, at least in this implementation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443953/does-struct-tm-store-time-zone-information-as-its-data-member/58444808#58444808","title":"Does struct tm store time zone information as its data member"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":153628,"user_id":576911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a2941970f141aad669d13375dc57c4f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Howard Hinnant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/576911/howard-hinnant"},"last_editor":{"reputation":153628,"user_id":576911,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a2941970f141aad669d13375dc57c4f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Howard Hinnant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/576911/howard-hinnant"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1571445225,"last_edit_date":1571445225,"creation_date":1571408374,"answer_id":58452742,"question_id":58443953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452742","body_markdown":"The C standard says in 7.27.1 Components of time:\r\n\r\n&gt; The `tm` structure shall contain **at least** the following members, in\r\n&gt; any order. The semantics of the members and their normal ranges are\r\n&gt; expressed in the comments.&lt;sup&gt;318)&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     int tm_sec;    // seconds after the minute — [0, 60]\r\n&gt;     int tm_min;    // minutes after the hour — [0, 59]\r\n&gt;     int tm_hour;   // hours since midnight — [0, 23]\r\n&gt;     int tm_mday;   // day of the month — [1, 31]\r\n&gt;     int tm_mon;    // months since January — [0, 11]\r\n&gt;     int tm_year;   // years since 1900\r\n&gt;     int tm_wday;   // days since Sunday — [0, 6]\r\n&gt;     int tm_yday;   // days since January 1 — [0, 365]\r\n&gt;     int tm_isdst;  // Daylight Saving Time flag\r\n\r\n(emphasis is mine)\r\n\r\nThat is, implementations are allowed to add additional members to `tm`, as you found with `glibc/time/bits/types/struct_tm.h`.  The POSIX spec has nearly identical wording.\r\n\r\nThe result is that `%Z` (or even `%z`) can not be considered portable in `strftime`.  The spec for `%Z` reflects this:\r\n\r\n&gt; `%Z` is replaced by the locale’s time zone name or abbreviation, *or\r\n&gt; by no characters if no time zone is determinable.* `[tm_isdst]`\r\n\r\nThat is, vendors are allowed to throw up their hands and simply say: &quot;no time zone was determinable, so I&#39;m not outputting any characters at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nMy opinion:  The C timing API is a mess.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am attempting to improve things for the upcoming C++20 standard within the `&lt;chrono&gt;` library.\r\n\r\nThe draft C++20 spec changes this from &quot;no characters&quot; to an exception being thrown if the `time_zone` abbreviation is not available:\r\n\r\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/time.format#3\r\n\r\n&gt; Unless explicitly requested, the result of formatting a chrono type\r\n&gt; does not contain time zone abbreviation and time zone offset\r\n&gt; information. If the information is available, the conversion\r\n&gt; specifiers `%Z` and `%z` will format this information (respectively).\r\n&gt; [ *Note:* If the information is not available and a `%Z` or `%z`\r\n&gt; conversion specifier appears in the *chrono-format-spec*, an exception\r\n&gt; of type `format_&#173;error` is thrown, as described above. *— end note* ]\r\n\r\nExcept that the above paragraph is not describing C&#39;s `strftime`, but a new `format` function that operates on `std::chrono` types, not `tm`.  Additionally there is a new type:  `std::chrono::zoned_time` (http://eel.is/c++draft/time.zone.zonedtime) that *always* has the `time_zone` abbreviation (and offset) available and can be formatted with the afore mentioned `format` function.\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;chrono&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\n    int\r\n    main()\r\n    {\r\n        using namespace std;\r\n        using namespace std::chrono;\r\n        auto now = system_clock::now();\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time{current_zone(), now});   // HKT (or whatever)\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time{&quot;Asia/Hong_Kong&quot;, now}); // HKT or HKST\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time{&quot;Etc/UTC&quot;, now});        // UTC\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, now);                               // UTC\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer:  The final syntax of the formatting string in the `format` function is likely to be slightly different, but the functionality will be there.)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to experiment with a preview of this library, it is free and open source here:  https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date\r\n\r\nSome installation is required:  https://howardhinnant.github.io/date/tz.html#Installation\r\n\r\nIn this preview, you will need to use the header `&quot;date/tz.h&quot;`, and the contents of the library are in `namespace date` instead of `namespace std::chrono`.\r\n\r\nThe preview library can be used with C++11 or later.\r\n\r\n`zoned_time` is templated on a `std::chrono::duration` which specifies the precision of the time point, and is deduced in the example code above using [C++17&#39;s CTAD feature][1].  If you are using this preview library in C++11 or C++14, the syntax would look more like:\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, zoned_time&lt;system_clock::duration&gt;{current_zone(), now});\r\n\r\nOr there is a non-proposed-for-standardization helper factory function which will do the deduction for you:\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; format(&quot;%Z\\n&quot;, make_zoned(current_zone(), now));\r\n\r\n(#CTAD_eliminates_factory_functions)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template_argument_deduction","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443953/does-struct-tm-store-time-zone-information-as-its-data-member/58452742#58452742","title":"Does struct tm store time zone information as its data member"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571429999,"last_edit_date":1571429999,"creation_date":1571425428,"answer_id":58456796,"question_id":58443953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58456796","body_markdown":"One of the reasons date and time programming is so difficult is that it&#39;s fundamentally at least a somewhat difficult problem: &quot;Thirty days hath September&quot;, and [sexagesimal arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal), and time zones, and daylight saving time, and leap years, and let&#39;s not even talk about leap seconds.\r\n\r\nBut the other reason it&#39;s difficult is that all too many libraries and languages make a perfect mess of it, and C is unfortunately no exception.  (C++ is trying to do better, as Howard mentions in his answer.)\r\n\r\nEven though everybody knows global variables are Bad, C&#39;s date/time functions basically use a couple of them.  In effect, the concept of &quot;this system&#39;s current time zone&quot; is a global variable, and the global data which describes that time zone is shared willy-nilly between `localtime` and `strftime` and a number of other functions.\r\n\r\nSo `strftime` can fill in `%z` and `%Z` based on that global data, even if it isn&#39;t passed in as part of a `struct tm` value.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s obviously a suboptimal arrangement, and it would start causing real problems if there were a way for a program to dynamically *change* the time zone it wants to use for `localtime` and the rest.  (And this arrangement persists in part because there&#39;s *not* actually a good, portable, Standard way for a program to change the local time zone it&#39;s using.)\r\n\r\nOver the years there have been various half-hearted attempt to clean some of the mess up (while preserving backwards compatibility, of course).  One of those attempts involves the extended `tm_gmtoff` and `tm_zone` fields you&#39;ve discovered in some systems&#39; versions of `struct tm`.  Those additions are a *huge* improvement -- I can&#39;t imagine doing serious date/time programming on a system without them -- but they&#39;re still not Standard, and there are still plenty of systems that don&#39;t have them (not even with the &quot;hidden&quot; spellings `__tm_gmtoff` and `__tm_zone`).\r\n\r\nYou can read much more about the sordid history of date/time support in C in this paper: [*Time, Clock, and Calendar Programming In C*](http://www.catb.org/esr/time-programming/), by Eric Raymond.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443953/does-struct-tm-store-time-zone-information-as-its-data-member/58456796#58456796","title":"Does struct tm store time zone information as its data member"}],"owner":{"reputation":650,"user_id":9373509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee85b2e77da0aaa34e30c9cf7749f2e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"aafulei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9373509/aafulei"},"last_editor":{"reputation":650,"user_id":9373509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee85b2e77da0aaa34e30c9cf7749f2e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"aafulei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9373509/aafulei"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":91,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58452742,"answer_count":3,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571445225,"creation_date":1571372880,"last_edit_date":1571376755,"question_id":58443953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443953","body_markdown":"Consider the following C++ code\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;ctime&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::time_t now = std::time(nullptr);\r\n    struct tm local = *std::localtime(&amp;now);\r\n    struct tm gm = *std::gmtime(&amp;now);\r\n    char str[20];\r\n    std::strftime(str, 20, &quot;%Z&quot;, &amp;local);\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; std::endl;          // HKT\r\n    std::strftime(str, 20, &quot;%Z&quot;, &amp;gm);\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; std::endl;          // UTC\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo stored in `now` is an unambiguous integral value, while `local` and `gm` are `struct tm` that store human-readable date/time information.
