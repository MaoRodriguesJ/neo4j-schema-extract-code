If it&#39;s async you have to work with a promise.\r\n\r\nBut in case that it&#39;s synchron, I would recommend that you reduce it into results and errors.\r\n\r\nIn my case, `geocodeAddress` returns undefined if not successful.\r\n\r\n    const results = addresses.reduce( (acc, address) =&gt; {\r\n      const result = geocodeAddress(address);\r\n      if(result) {\r\n        acc.success.push(result);\r\n      } else { \r\n        acc.errors.push(&quot;Error at geocoding: &quot; + address);\r\n      }\r\n      return acc;\r\n    }, {success: [], errors: []});\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will result in an object with two properties which stores the geocoded addresses and the errors. \r\nIt takes all addresses and for each entry it geocodes it.

I want to cycle through the data with a timeout between each point so the data is in the map for approximately 2 seconds, then transitions to the next data set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently I have a &#39;hacky&#39; approach that is triggered by a button onClick to try to get some sort of MVP.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n\tdataStateChange = () =&gt; {\r\n\t\tconst toJan00 = () =&gt;\r\n\t\t\tthis.setState({\r\n\t\t\t\tlocation: jan00\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\tconst toJan05 = () =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\tthis.setState({\r\n\t\t\t\tlocation: jan05\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t};\r\n\t\tconst toJan95 = () =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\tthis.setState({\r\n\t\t\t\tlocation: jan95\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t};\r\n\r\n\t\tconsole.log(&quot;this.state selected date change&quot;, this.state);\r\n\t\tsetTimeout(toJan00, setTimeout(toJan05, 2000), 2000);\r\n\t\tif (this.state.location === jan05) {\r\n\t\t\tsetTimeout(toJan95, 2000);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like a play bar, that transitions through data sets and then animates from one to the next.\r\n\r\nSimilar to various implementations here.\r\nhttps://mcvs.thesunstirade.com/\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been looking at: https://easings.net/en\r\n\r\nI see all the components, I see the various methods.

There is the context method ```PostFormMap(key string)```, however as far as I can tell from the example given here (https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#another-example-query--post-form), this method requires the values correspond to to the argument key in the request body.

am currently working on a warehouse datasheet and looking to capture information from it. I need help with either a formula or VBA code. \r\n\r\n               A          B              C\r\n    Row 1 - product - batch number - expiry date\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are 3 columns from multiple within the sheet, however, the focus is on them. I am trying to find a formula or VBA code to allow me to do the following: \r\n\r\nThe word &quot;cake&quot; used as a product reference. \r\n\r\nIf a cell within the product column has the value &quot;cake&quot;, return the value of the cell from the expiry date column which is on the same row as the initial cell found.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process, but skip the previously found cell.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, I tried this formula: \r\n\r\n   ` =IF(A:A=&quot;Cake&quot;,C1,&quot;&quot;)`\r\n\r\nThis is what I started with and don&#39;t have a clue after it. Whatever I search for in Google I can&#39;t adjust it to what I want. I tried Vlookup too. \r\n\r\nTo me this seems like I need a VBA code that can do that on a loop and return the values automatically for me. \r\n\r\nI know my attempt is pathetic, but I&#39;ve been searching online for 2 days with no progress. Can you suggest something? Thank you\r\n\r\nI am expecting to have a separate sheet, from all the input sheets, collecting a list of products, their batch number and the expiry date related to them, to apply conditional formatting to be warned if a batch is due to be expired.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977526/data-picking-from-different-cells-within-sheet","title":"Data picking from different cells within sheet"},{"tags":["javascript","recursion","depth-first-search"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3029,"user_id":417866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/958d07f426a20a9bc1bb7db75086f9d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Arash Motamedi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/417866/arash-motamedi"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568734140,"post_id":57977525,"comment_id":102364686,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977525/who-does-the-method-call-it-self-again-after-the-return#comment102364686_57977525"},{"owner":{"reputation":3253,"user_id":1882497,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/658a7779baf496a4d2251317a45561e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aioros","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1882497/aioros"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568734368,"post_id":57977525,"comment_id":102364792,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977525/who-does-the-method-call-it-self-again-after-the-return#comment102364792_57977525"},{"owner":{"reputation":745014,"user_id":157247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca3e484c121268e4c8302616b2395eb9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"T.J.

With TkAgg and Qt5Agg backends this works fine. With GTK3Agg and WxAgg the figure is frozen. I can&#39;t zoom, resize, close, etc. That&#39;s OK. I can limit myself to TkAgg and Qt5Agg in this instance...\r\n\r\nHowever, what I really want to do is update the plot every time the file changes. To that effect, I have written the following code, which replaces the final ```while True:``` statement in the above:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport threading\r\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\r\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\r\ncondition = threading.Condition()\r\nclass Handler(FileSystemEventHandler):\r\n    def on_modified(self, event):\r\n        if event.src_path == os.path.join(os.curdir, fileName):\r\n            with condition:\r\n                condition.notify()\r\nobserver = Observer()\r\nobserver.schedule(Handler(), os.curdir)\r\nobserver.start()\r\nplotData()\r\nwhile True:\r\n    with condition:\r\n        condition.wait()\r\n        plotData()\r\nobserver.join()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis successfully updates the plots when the file changes, but now the figure is completely frozen no matter what backend I use.\r\n\r\nCan I get around this? Is it possible to have this sort of dynamically-updating plot and maintain an interactive figure?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve noticed the same issue when using other sorts of &quot;wait&quot; conditions with Matplotlib. Anything of the form ```while condition is True: pass``` tends to result in a frozen window. Why does ```input(&#39;Press ENTER&#39;)``` work? Is there a corresponding condition that also works that can be driven by a change in another thread instead of keyboard input?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977488/maintaining-interactivity-with-dynamically-updated-matplotlib-figures","title":"Maintaining interactivity with dynamically updated Matplotlib figures"},{"tags":["python","os.walk"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3443,"user_id":8321664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LHA8u.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Black Thunder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8321664/black-thunder"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568734250,"post_id":57977486,"comment_id":102364748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977486/how-do-i-only-keep-files-in-a-directory-that-contain-a-specific-string#comment102364748_57977486"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4937644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf76b3590da09cfa39fe160faff4e86e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hy9fesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4937644/hy9fesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568738573,"post_id":57977999,"comment_id":102366745,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977486/how-do-i-only-keep-files-in-a-directory-that-contain-a-specific-string/57977999#comment102366745_57977999"},{"owner":{"reputation":8987,"user_id":7752296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7033ea69df1e9dddbee828dc92ac967a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chitown88","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7752296/chitown88"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4937644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf76b3590da09cfa39fe160faff4e86e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hy9fesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4937644/hy9fesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568795323,"post_id":57977999,"comment_id":102384252,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977486/how-do-i-only-keep-files-in-a-directory-that-contain-a-specific-string/57977999#comment102384252_57977999"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4937644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf76b3590da09cfa39fe160faff4e86e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hy9fesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4937644/hy9fesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569091979,"post_id":57977999,"comment_id":102486654,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977486/how-do-i-only-keep-files-in-a-directory-that-contain-a-specific-string/57977999#comment102486654_57977999"},{"owner":{"reputation":8987,"user_id":7752296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7033ea69df1e9dddbee828dc92ac967a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chitown88","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7752296/chitown88"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4937644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf76b3590da09cfa39fe160faff4e86e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hy9fesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4937644/hy9fesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569229780,"post_id":57977999,"comment_id":102515160,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977486/how-do-i-only-keep-files-in-a-directory-that-contain-a-specific-string/57977999#comment102515160_57977999"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8987,"user_id":7752296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7033ea69df1e9dddbee828dc92ac967a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chitown88","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7752296/chitown88"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8987,"user_id":7752296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7033ea69df1e9dddbee828dc92ac967a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chitown88","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7752296/chitown88"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568795470,"last_edit_date":1568795470,"creation_date":1568735886,"answer_id":57977999,"question_id":57977486,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57977999","body_markdown":"I belive the issue is you aren&#39;t actually reading in the file.

But the issue is that, the component waits 5sec to load the data for the first time also.\r\n\r\nHow can I conditionally set the auto refresh in this component to refresh every 5sec without waiting for the first time.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977483/angular-rxjs-autorefresh-component","title":"Angular RxJs AutoRefresh Component"},{"tags":["python","macos","sqlite"],"owner":{"reputation":1802,"user_id":1424739,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19d3c927744b5ad3b94afbf88e1c3844?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1424739","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1424739/user1424739"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568733875,"creation_date":1568733875,"question_id":57977481,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57977481","body_markdown":"I got the following error when I use `enable_load_extension()`?\r\n\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: &#39;sqlite3.Connection&#39; object has no attribute &#39;enable_load_extension&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also see this.

This layer adds a bunch of headers to the incoming requests to my spring-cloud-gateway app and when this number exceeds 30 headers. I get back a HTTP 400 response from the gateway. \r\n\r\nI have a custom filter in place that talks to a back-end user service in order to do enforce authorization. This filter adds more headers to the exchange&#39;s request.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nHttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();\r\nheaders.setContentType(APPLICATION_JSON);\r\nheaders.set(PRINCIPAL, userId);\r\nHttpEntity&lt;Void&gt; responseType = new HttpEntity&lt;Void&gt;(headers);\r\nResponseEntity&lt;UserDto&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(CURRENT_USER_ENDPOINT, HttpMethod.GET, responseType, UserDto.class);\r\naddUserDetailsToHeaders(exchange, response.getBody());\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason this filter is causing interference for any gateway requests with &gt; 30 headers\r\nThe response body I get from the gateway when &gt;30 headers is shown below.\r\n```\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;Bad Request&lt;/title&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Request&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    Error parsing headers: &amp;#x27;limit request headers fields&amp;#x27;\r\n  &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can simulate the issue when running my gateway locally by using curl. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl &#39;http://localhost:8080/my-api-app/&#39; -H &#39;Connection: keep-alive&#39; -H &#39;Cache-Control: max-age=0&#39; -H &#39;Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1&#39; -H &#39;User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11;

However, I do not know the size of the complete dataset and thus I&#160;cannot pass the right `steps_per_epoch` value.\r\n\r\nWhat is the right way to cache and use dataset of unknown size?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Edit ##\r\n\r\nWhile reading some TF&#160;code, I (re)discovered the [`make_initializable_iterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#make_initializable_iterator). It seems that it is what I am looking for, that is to say iterate multiple times through the same dataset (taking advantage of the cache after the first iteration). However, this is deprecated and no longer part of the main API in TF2.\r\n\r\nUpdating instruction is to manually iterate over the Dataset with `for ... in dataset`. Is it not what is done by the `keras.Model.fit` function? Have I to write the training loop manually to get cache advantages?\r\n\r\nKind.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977408/how-to-cache-and-iterate-through-a-dataset-of-unknown-size","title":"How to cache and iterate through a Dataset of unknown size?"},{"tags":["python","numpy"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5159,"user_id":4621513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCfJK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mkrieger1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4621513/mkrieger1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568733759,"post_id":57977407,"comment_id":102364475,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977407/cast-list-to-numpy-array-non-recursively#comment102364475_57977407"},{"owner":{"reputation":846,"user_id":6156397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CbAN8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jhansen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6156397/jhansen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5159,"user_id":4621513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCfJK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mkrieger1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4621513/mkrieger1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568733858,"post_id":57977407,"comment_id":102364523,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977407/cast-list-to-numpy-array-non-recursively#comment102364523_57977407"},{"owner":{"reputation":39821,"user_id":3483203,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/592wq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3483203","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3483203/user3483203"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568734556,"post_id":57977407,"comment_id":102364896,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977407/cast-list-to-numpy-array-non-recursively#comment102364896_57977407"},{"owner":{"reputation":846,"user_id":6156397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CbAN8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jhansen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6156397/jhansen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":39821,"user_id":3483203,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/592wq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3483203","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3483203/user3483203"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568734962,"post_id":57977407,"comment_id":102365105,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977407/cast-list-to-numpy-array-non-recursively#comment102365105_57977407"},{"owner":{"reputation":39821,"user_id":3483203,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/592wq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3483203","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3483203/user3483203"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568735019,"post_id":57977407,"comment_id":102365139,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977407/cast-list-to-numpy-array-non-recursively#comment102365139_57977407"},{"owner":{"reputation":846,"user_id":6156397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CbAN8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jhansen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6156397/jhansen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568735184,"post_id":57977407,"comment_id":102365219,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977407/cast-list-to-numpy-array-non-recursively#comment102365219_57977407"},{"owner":{"reputation":5742,"user_id":10426037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6723e3123b9a13d6360d1ee755f8728?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Valentino","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10426037/valentino"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568735602,"post_id":57977407,"comment_id":102365436,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977407/cast-list-to-numpy-array-non-recursively#comment102365436_57977407"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568735550,"creation_date":1568735550,"answer_id":57977922,"question_id":57977407,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57977922","body_markdown":"This cleanest, surest, way that I know of is -

This has been done with the `comments`.\r\n2. After that there is a more complicated step. To aggregate two different JSON objects into one object, you need to do this:\r\n\r\n[simplified demo:db&lt;&gt;fiddle][2]\r\n\r\nFirst you need to expand the elements into a `key` and a `value` column using `jsonb_each()`. Now you are able to aggregate these two columns using the aggregate function `jsonb_object_agg()`. [See also][3]\r\n\r\nThis is why the following steps look somewhat difficult. Every level of aggregation (`level` and `product_id`) need these steps because you want to merge the elements into single non-array JSON objects.\r\n\r\nBecause every single aggregation needs separate `GROUP BY` clauses, every step is done in its own subquery.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_11&amp;fiddle=624fed649d71fc05258d0225f60c6e65\r\n  [2]: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_11&amp;fiddle=811d9b79e457996eee127e4d3ec43f7e\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33403598/combine-two-json-objects-in-postgresql","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977375/postgres-sql-query-that-will-group-fields-in-nested-json-objects/57977914#57977914","title":"Postgres SQL query, that will group fields in nested JSON objects"}],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":992572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9abfc8ac5ae3ccbe2168849cd5f73a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"easteregg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/992572/easteregg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":119,"user_id":992572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9abfc8ac5ae3ccbe2168849cd5f73a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"easteregg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/992572/easteregg"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568735956,"creation_date":1568733524,"last_edit_date":1568733885,"question_id":57977375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57977375","body_markdown":"I need a SQL query in Postgres that produce a JSON with grouped/inherited data,\r\nsee example below.\r\n\r\nhaving a table &quot;issues&quot;

Students are to implement their own solution to the same problem in a separate &quot;student_answer.h&quot; file, in a class which we will call &quot;Student&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe .cpp file should then take the two class definitions, &quot;Solution&quot; (the class defined in solution.h) and &quot;Student&quot; (the class defined in student_answer.h), and run the two implementations to verify whether the student answer is correct, and it should provide detailed output in cases where the student answer has a bug. However, I want to be able to hide the contents of the solution.h file (or the &quot;Solution&quot; class) from the students while still providing them with the .cpp file that they can compile and run their own solution with.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I have something like this:\r\n\r\n    #include &quot;solution.h&quot;\r\n    #include &quot;student_answer.h&quot;\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n       Solution s;\r\n       Student a;\r\n       // run member functions of s and a, compare results to verify if student\r\n       // implementation is correct (and print helpful output if there is a bug)\r\n       ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do the same thing without having to reveal the solution.h file to the students? Is there a better approach to doing this?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977357/hiding-the-contents-of-a-header-file","title":"Hiding the Contents of a Header File"},{"tags":["javascript","arrays","reduce"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1583,"user_id":2570277,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0483cce5f2ea53671a36477fed79898b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2570277/nick"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568733680,"post_id":57977356,"comment_id":102364433,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977356/reduce-list-of-value-date-array-to-last-x-days-and-add-missing-days#comment102364433_57977356"},{"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":4178195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd08c7b58876e5d1fc85a5bd00936345?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gerd h&#252;bner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4178195/gerd-h%c3%bcbner"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1583,"user_id":2570277,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0483cce5f2ea53671a36477fed79898b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2570277/nick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568734371,"post_id":57977356,"comment_id":102364794,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977356/reduce-list-of-value-date-array-to-last-x-days-and-add-missing-days#comment102364794_57977356"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":4178195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd08c7b58876e5d1fc85a5bd00936345?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gerd h&#252;bner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4178195/gerd-h%c3%bcbner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568743407,"post_id":57977628,"comment_id":102368794,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977356/reduce-list-of-value-date-array-to-last-x-days-and-add-missing-days/57977628#comment102368794_57977628"},{"owner":{"reputation":3056,"user_id":2444210,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039aeeb3bbfafb7fc2d8e8d56e04fc14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"IceMetalPunk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2444210/icemetalpunk"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":145,"user_id":4178195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd08c7b58876e5d1fc85a5bd00936345?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gerd h&#252;bner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4178195/gerd-h%c3%bcbner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568744197,"post_id":57977628,"comment_id":102369132,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977356/reduce-list-of-value-date-array-to-last-x-days-and-add-missing-days/57977628#comment102369132_57977628"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3056,"user_id":2444210,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039aeeb3bbfafb7fc2d8e8d56e04fc14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"IceMetalPunk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2444210/icemetalpunk"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568734438,"creation_date":1568734438,"answer_id":57977628,"question_id":57977356,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57977628","body_markdown":"You can use filter to keep only the entries from the last x days (I&#39;m using x in this code as a variable to represent that number of days):\r\n\r\n    const lastXDays = data.filter(entry =&gt;

Based on my understanding of the horizontal options that can be specified on an object, I would expect the Cancel button to be at the start of my horizontal stack layout and my Done button to be at the end of the same stack layout.\r\n\r\nYou could use a **AbsoluteLayout** to make the buttons positioned anywhere within a view.\r\n     \r\n    &lt;AbsoluteLayout BackgroundColor=&quot;LightBlue&quot; HeightRequest=&quot;60&quot; VerticalOptions=&quot;EndAndExpand&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;Button Text=&quot;Cancel&quot; Margin=&quot;10,10&quot; BackgroundColor=&quot;DarkBlue&quot; TextColor=&quot;White&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;Button Text=&quot;Done&quot; Margin=&quot;10,10&quot; AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBounds=&quot;1, 0, AutoSize, AutoSize&quot; AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlags=&quot;PositionProportional&quot; BackgroundColor=&quot;DarkBlue&quot; TextColor=&quot;White&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/AbsoluteLayout&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd use the `VerticalOptions=&quot;EndAndExpand&quot;` to make it appears at the end of its parent and expands.\r\n\r\n**Updated:**\r\n\r\nI do not know what it was before, but for now, it doesn’t actually fill up the space in the StackLayout. It’s only when the fill option is used, that it will expand to that space.\r\n\r\nWhen you expect the Cancel button to be at the start and the Done button to be at the end of the same stack layout, fill option and expend need to be setted. I use simple example to display.\r\n\r\n    &lt;StackLayout Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot; HorizontalOptions=&quot;FillAndExpand&quot; VerticalOptions=&quot;EndAndExpand&quot; BackgroundColor=&quot;Aqua&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Button x:Name=&quot;btnCancel&quot; Text=&quot;Cancel&quot; HorizontalOptions=&quot;StartAndExpand&quot; Margin=&quot;8,0,4,0&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;Button x:Name=&quot;btnDone&quot; Text=&quot;Done&quot; HorizontalOptions=&quot;EndAndExpand&quot; Margin=&quot;4,0,8,0&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/StackLayout&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd if you do not want space between last two lines in the end, you need a nested stacklayout to do that without space.\r\n\r\n**Simple code:**\r\n\r\n     &lt;StackLayout BackgroundColor=&quot;LightGray&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;StackLayout&gt;\r\n            &lt;Entry  x:Name=&quot;pgHeader&quot;

HorizontalOptions=&quot;CenterAndExpand&quot; &gt;&lt;/Entry&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;/StackLayout&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;StackLayout  HorizontalOptions=&quot;FillAndExpand&quot; VerticalOptions=&quot;EndAndExpand&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;StackLayout Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;
