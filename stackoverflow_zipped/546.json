am trying to deploy a war file from my local filesystem using Jenkins on Tomcat.

My war is being built on a on a different drive altogether. .jenkins folder is on the C drive and WAR is on the H drive. \r\n\r\nThe path to my WAR is:\r\nH:\\Workspace\\tomcat_git\\releases\\my-type-controller\\lib\\MTC.war\r\n\r\nHow do make this a relative path?? Most of the tutorials I read are using something **/*.war and fancy stuff like git and maven, but I am not sure if that will work for me.

How can I debug the error further?\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CollectionContext &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  include Authority::Abilities\r\n  self.authorizer_name = &#39;ManagedContentAuthorizer&#39;\r\n\r\n  has_many :context_sets, inverse_of: :collection_context\r\n  has_many :museum_collections, through: :context_sets,\r\n                                source: :contextable,\r\n                                source_type: &#39;MuseumCollection&#39;\r\n\r\n  enum catalogue: %i[museum archive library]\r\n  enum vocabulary: {category: 10,\r\n                    collection: 20,\r\n                    concept: 30,\r\n                    event: 40,\r\n                    gallery: 50,\r\n                    material: 60,\r\n                    organisation: 70,\r\n                    people: 80,\r\n                    person: 90,\r\n                    place: 100,\r\n                    style: 110,\r\n                    technique: 120}\r\n\r\n  validate :check_multiple\r\n\r\n  def check_multiple\r\n    if [identifier, query, query_url].compact.count != 1\r\n      errors[:base] &lt;&lt; &quot; cannot set multiple context links&quot;\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve now discovered that if I run rake with my rails environment set to TEST, it doesn&#39;t show any problems in the console. So it is a development only problem. I have experimented with my gemfile and put all dev only gems into the dev and test group but I still get the error when running rake in dev.\r\n\r\nThis is my config/development.rb file\r\n\r\n```\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nRails.application.configure do\r\n  config.webpacker.check_yarn_integrity = false\r\n  config.cache_classes = false\r\n  config.eager_load = false\r\n  config.consider_all_requests_local = true\r\n  config.action_controller.perform_caching = false\r\n  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false\r\n  config.active_support.deprecation = :log\r\n  config.active_record.migration_error = :page_load\r\n  config.assets.debug = true\r\n  config.assets.digest = true\r\n  config.assets.raise_runtime_errors = true\r\n  config.web_console.whitelisted_ips = &#39;10.xxxx&#39;\r\nend\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410492/rails-error-instance-method-already-defined-by-another-enum-but-there-are-no-re","title":"Rails error: instance method already defined by another enum but there are no repeats"},{"tags":["java","jpa","criteria-api"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":4387510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/622492811/picture?type=large","display_name":"JamesOzzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4387510/jamesozzie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571290774,"post_id":58410491,"comment_id":103192744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410491/trying-to-get-a-result-set-from-a-table-with-a-joined-table-using-criteria-api-i#comment103192744_58410491"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":4387510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/622492811/picture?type=large","display_name":"JamesOzzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4387510/jamesozzie"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571291265,"creation_date":1571291265,"answer_id":58425693,"question_id":58410491,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58425693","body_markdown":"```java\r\npublic List&lt;Item&gt;

But for now, since we are not providing the enum with the error codes yet, you would have to do something like this in your code:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nenum PurchasesErrorCode {\r\n  UnknownError,\r\n  PurchaseCancelledError,\r\n  StoreProblemError,\r\n  PurchaseNotAllowedError,\r\n  PurchaseInvalidError,\r\n  ProductNotAvailableForPurchaseError,\r\n  ProductAlreadyPurchasedError,\r\n  ReceiptAlreadyInUseError,\r\n  InvalidReceiptError,\r\n  MissingReceiptFileError,\r\n  NetworkError,\r\n  InvalidCredentialsError,\r\n  UnexpectedBackendResponseError,\r\n  ReceiptInUseByOtherSubscriberError,\r\n  InvalidAppUserIdError,\r\n  OperationAlreadyInProgressError,\r\n  UnknownBackendError,\r\n  InsufficientPermissionsError\r\n}\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n} on PlatformException catch (e) {\r\n  PurchasesErrorCode errorCode = PurchasesErrorCode.values[int.parse(e.code)];\r\n  switch (errorCode) {\r\n    case PurchasesErrorCode.UnknownError:\r\n    case PurchasesErrorCode.PurchaseCancelledError:\r\n    case PurchasesErrorCode.StoreProblemError:\r\n    // Add rest of cases\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you do `e.details`, you also get access to a `readableErrorCode` containing the name of the error code; and an `underlyingErrorMessage`, that can hopefully help you debug any issue.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410482/exposing-all-revenuecat-purchaseserrorcode-codes-in-flutter/58419220#58419220","title":"Exposing all RevenueCat PurchasesErrorCode codes in flutter"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10530978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07a5a9db0a7d02178c4521ad914a9fd2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"liondog","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10530978/liondog"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58419220,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571249010,"creation_date":1571219465,"question_id":58410482,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410482","body_markdown":"I need to trap all of the listed PurchasesErrorCode error codes in my Flutter app so I can respond to them accordingly.\r\n\r\nCurrently I can only trap &quot;userCancelled&quot;, for everything else I can only report the information returned in the standard PlatformException code, message and details properties, without knowing what they will contain.\r\n\r\n````\r\ntry {\r\n\r\n  // Code to make purchase..\r\n\r\n} on PlatformException catch (e) {\r\n\r\n  if (!(e.details as Map)[&quot;userCancelled&quot;]) {\r\n\r\n    // Here I need a comprehensive switch statement so I can\r\n    // retry where appropriate/control what messages the user sees\r\n\r\n    String reason = &#39;&#39;;\r\n    (e.details as Map).forEach((k,v) =&gt; reason += &#39;$k =&gt; $v&#39;);\r\n    showError(context, &#39;Error&#39;, &#39;${e.code} : ${e.message}&#39;);\r\n\r\n  } else {\r\n\r\n    showError(context, &#39;Purchase Cancelled&#39;, &#39;Your purchase was not completed, you have not been charged.&#39;);\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThese codes are exposed in IOS/Swift and Android/Kotlin but I can&#39;t get them in Flutter/Dart - what am I missing?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410482/exposing-all-revenuecat-purchaseserrorcode-codes-in-flutter","title":"Exposing all RevenueCat PurchasesErrorCode codes in flutter"},{"tags":["java","memory-leaks","off-heap"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4933381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934e17a5ba6e5d5ec5e8e4cc9a97f43b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"angel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4933381/angel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4933381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934e17a5ba6e5d5ec5e8e4cc9a97f43b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"angel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4933381/angel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571304024,"creation_date":1571219462,"last_edit_date":1571304024,"question_id":58410480,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410480","body_markdown":"I am very new to Memory leak issue.

did this for a loading bar for an upload progress. I&#39;m using bootstrap so [I used their progress bar element](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/progress/):\r\n```HTML\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;progress-bar&quot; role=&quot;progressbar&quot; style=&quot;width: 25%&quot; aria-valuenow=&quot;25&quot; aria-valuemin=&quot;0&quot; aria-valuemax=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nBut as you mentioned, you wanted this to be dynamic. So what you want is for when the progress bar component loads, you want it to make the API call and pass a callback function to modify the state to that value which you can plug into the progress bar.\r\n\r\nSo using my Bootstrap example, the progress bar might now look like this:\r\n```HTML\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;progress-bar&quot; role=&quot;progressbar&quot; style={{width: uploadProgress + &quot;%&quot;}} aria-valuenow={uploadProgress} aria-valuemin=&quot;0&quot; aria-valuemax=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when you load in this component, run a function (when the component mounts) that makes your API call, but pass in a callback function to update `uploadProgress`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using React Hooks (I&#39;d highly recommend them) and here&#39;s how I set up `uploadProgress`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst uploadProgress = useSelector(state =&gt; state.uploadProgress);\r\n```\r\n\r\nso I&#39;m making a call to the state. This state is updated by the API function.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo to summarise:\r\n\r\n 1. Make your API results run a function (send an action to an actionCreator) to update the state.\r\n 2. Access this state in your progress bar component\r\n 3. Use that state value as the value for your progress bar(s)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you&#39;ve got any questions - I am new to this myself but that&#39;s how I manged to do it and it works pretty well!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410440/how-to-make-a-dynamic-progressbar-with-data-received-from-an-api/58410820#58410820","title":"How to make a dynamic progressbar with data received from an api"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":12085577,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fd38596fcd52ef9f45d040a649c1c25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"henrydoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12085577/henrydoe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571220570,"creation_date":1571219294,"question_id":58410440,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410440","body_markdown":"I have an api which sents score if someone does the math, chemistry or physics correct.

If the above is correct will it deprecate too?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410431/google-analytics-for-mobile-apps-deprecation","title":"Google analytics for mobile apps deprecation"},{"tags":["django","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":175,"user_id":10084728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68f4918ae2890b77de8caf36e8ece454?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sandeep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10084728/sandeep"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571230455,"post_id":58410430,"comment_id":103170538,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410430/how-to-make-a-forum-like-tag-system-for-images-in-django#comment103170538_58410430"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11605012,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d311cbbb0f9ab88943137e098dab1dbb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"A.

Not all forms will have radio buttons.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of my html layout:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;step-0&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;form id=&quot;step_0_form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; class=&quot;formateninput form-control&quot; name=&quot;aantal&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; min=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;step-1&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;form id=&quot;step_1_form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; class=&quot;formateninput form-control&quot; name=&quot;hoogte&quot; value=&quot;100&quot; min=&quot;60&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;step-2&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;form id=&quot;step_2_form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; id=&quot;Hout&quot; name=&quot;Materiaal&quot; value=&quot;Hout&quot; &gt;\r\n    \t  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; id=&quot;Debond&quot; name=&quot;Materiaal&quot; value=&quot;Debond&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd this is my jquery code at the moment:\r\n\r\n    var ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).on(&quot;leaveStep&quot;, function(e, anchorObject, stepNumber, stepDirection) {\r\n    \r\n      if(ajaxInvoke == false){\r\n    \tajaxInvoke = true;\r\n    \r\n    \tvar form_data = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;).serialize();\r\n    \r\n    \tvar formname = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t$.ajax({\r\n    \t  type:&#39;post&#39;,\r\n    \t  url:&quot;catalog/calcdiv.php&quot;,\r\n    \t  data:form_data,\r\n    \t  success:function(data){\r\n    \t\t // indicate the ajax has been done, release the next step\r\n    \t\t $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).smartWizard(&quot;next&quot;);\r\n    \t\t ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    \t  }\r\n    \t});\r\n    \t// Return false to cancel the `leaveStep` event\r\n    \treturn false;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nI tried the following:\r\n\r\n    var ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).on(&quot;leaveStep&quot;, function(e, anchorObject, stepNumber, stepDirection) {\r\n    \r\n      if(ajaxInvoke == false){\r\n    \tajaxInvoke = true;\r\n    \r\n    \tvar form_data = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;).serialize();\r\n    \r\n    \tvar formname = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t$(formname).on(&quot;change&quot; &quot;input[type=radio]:checked&quot;, function(e){\r\n    \t  var val = $(this).val();\r\n    \t  console.log(val);\r\n    \t});\r\n    \r\n    \t$.ajax({\r\n    \t  type:&#39;post&#39;,\r\n    \t  url:&quot;catalog/calcdiv.php&quot;,\r\n    \t  data:form_data,\r\n    \t  success:function(data){\r\n    \t\t // indicate the ajax has been done, release the next step\r\n    \t\t $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).smartWizard(&quot;next&quot;);\r\n    \t\t ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    \t  }\r\n    \t});\r\n    \t// Return false to cancel the `leaveStep` event\r\n    \treturn false;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nBut this doesn&#39;t show anything in my console. How can I get the value of the radio button clicked on the current step in the currently opened form? `$(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;);` is the corresponding form id.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410391/how-to-get-a-radio-button-value-of-one-form-when-multiple-forms-are-dynamically","title":"How to get a radio button value of one form when multiple forms are dynamically created"},{"tags":["arrays","laravel","pagination"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":7324136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c95e5ea596acdf96806eb9277bfca405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udhayan Nair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7324136/udhayan-nair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219211,"post_id":58410383,"comment_id":103164285,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel#comment103164285_58410383"},{"owner":{"reputation":431,"user_id":4097457,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9J46nzs-gPs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADk/TrNSLZe1Drg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shokouh Dareshiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4097457/shokouh-dareshiri"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":309,"user_id":7324136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c95e5ea596acdf96806eb9277bfca405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udhayan Nair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7324136/udhayan-nair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219235,"post_id":58410383,"comment_id":103164298,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel#comment103164298_58410383"},{"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":7324136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c95e5ea596acdf96806eb9277bfca405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udhayan Nair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7324136/udhayan-nair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219411,"post_id":58410383,"comment_id":103164389,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel#comment103164389_58410383"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1095,"user_id":10341554,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/btAHb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"party-ring","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10341554/party-ring"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571219381,"creation_date":1571219381,"answer_id":58410463,"question_id":58410383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410463","body_markdown":"You can only use `paginate` on an instance of [QueryBuilder or on an Eloquent query][1].\r\n\r\nInstead, if you need to &#39;paginate&#39; an array, you can use [PHP array_chunk][2].\r\n\r\n    array_chunk($result, 10, true);\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/pagination\r\n  [2]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel/58410463#58410463","title":"can not use pagination() for an array object in laravel"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":431,"user_id":4097457,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9J46nzs-gPs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADk/TrNSLZe1Drg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shokouh Dareshiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4097457/shokouh-dareshiri"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571820253,"creation_date":1571820253,"answer_id":58518867,"question_id":58410383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58518867","body_markdown":"I solved my problems using `make()` and `LengthAwarePaginator` as below:\r\n\r\n    if (!empty($_GET[&#39;page&#39;])) {\r\n\r\n         $per_page = !empty($_GET[&#39;per_page&#39;]) ?

I am sure I am following the correct steps..","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410368/db2-update-statement-not-working-using-jdbc","title":"DB2 Update statement not working using JDBC"},{"tags":["javascript","react-native","redux"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":325,"user_id":2661032,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/POx4v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Abhay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2661032/abhay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571221676,"post_id":58410365,"comment_id":103165552,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410365/react-component-why-can-dispatch-in-asyncapp-components#comment103165552_58410365"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":894,"user_id":1873027,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnNy7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Horst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1873027/horst"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571220425,"creation_date":1571220425,"answer_id":58410769,"question_id":58410365,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410769","body_markdown":"Welcome to SO.\r\n\r\nActually, `connect()` has provided the dispatch to your component already.(https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect#example-usage)\r\n\r\nYou can take `mapDispatchToProps` as a middleware for creating methods with dispatch.\r\n\r\nLets say we have a store with state counter.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    counter: 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin `mapDispatchToProps`, we can create methods using in this component :\r\n```\r\n{\r\n increment: ()=&gt;{dispatch({ type: &#39;EDIT&#39;, payload: 1 })},\r\n decrement: ()=&gt;{dispatch({ type: &#39;EDIT&#39;, payload: -1 })}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410365/react-component-why-can-dispatch-in-asyncapp-components/58410769#58410769","title":"React Component - Why can dispatch in AsyncApp Components"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9667103,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4b38dee0c72de21ca1e80b1f6ca1a25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raymond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9667103/raymond"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571220425,"creation_date":1571219056,"question_id":58410365,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410365","body_markdown":"Refer to this example\r\nhttps://redux.js.org/advanced/example-reddit-api\r\n    \r\n    import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;\r\n    import PropTypes from &#39;prop-types&#39;\r\n    import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;\r\n    import {\r\n      selectSubreddit,\r\n      fetchPostsIfNeeded,\r\n      invalidateSubreddit\r\n    } from &#39;../actions&#39;\r\n    import Picker from &#39;../components/Picker&#39;\r\n    import Posts from &#39;../components/Posts&#39;\r\n    \r\n    class AsyncApp extends Component {\r\n      constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props)\r\n        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)\r\n        this.handleRefreshClick = this.handleRefreshClick.bind(this)\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      componentDidMount() {\r\n        const { dispatch, selectedSubreddit } = this.props\r\n        dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(selectedSubreddit))\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\r\n        if (this.props.selectedSubreddit !== prevProps.selectedSubreddit) {\r\n          const { dispatch, selectedSubreddit } = this.props\r\n          dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(selectedSubreddit))\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      handleChange(nextSubreddit) {\r\n        this.props.dispatch(selectSubreddit(nextSubreddit))\r\n        this.props.dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(nextSubreddit))\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      handleRefreshClick(e) {\r\n        e.preventDefault()\r\n    \r\n        const { dispatch, selectedSubreddit } = this.props\r\n        dispatch(invalidateSubreddit(selectedSubreddit))\r\n        dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(selectedSubreddit))\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      render() {\r\n        const { selectedSubreddit, posts, isFetching, lastUpdated } = this.props\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;Picker\r\n              value={selectedSubreddit}\r\n              onChange={this.handleChange}\r\n              options={[&#39;reactjs&#39;, &#39;frontend&#39;]}\r\n            /&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;\r\n              {lastUpdated &amp;&amp;

To refresh two aspects of the data in parallel, simply make two calls instead of one:\r\n\r\n    refresh(&quot;meetingTypes&quot;);\r\n    refresh(&quot;exampleMeetingTypes&quot;);\r\n\r\nThe two ajax calls or whatever will run in parallel, each updating the component when it finishes. **But**: See the &quot;Side Note&quot; below, there&#39;s a problem with `fetchDataByName`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid updating the component twice, you&#39;ll have to update `fetchDataByName` to either accept multiple names or to return a promise of the result (or similar) rather than updating the component directly, so the caller can do multiple calls and wait for both results before doing the update.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSide note: This aspect of `fetchDataByName` looks suspect:\r\n\r\n    fetchDataByName = name =&gt; {\r\n      const { retrievedData } = this.state;  // &lt;=============================\r\n      const { fetcher } = this.props;\r\n      const fetch = _.find(fetcher, { name });\r\n\r\n      if (typeof fetch === &quot;undefined&quot;) {\r\n        throw new Error(`Fetch with ${name} cannot be found in fetcher`);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      this.fetchData(fetch, (error, data) =&gt; {\r\n        retrievedData[name] = data;          // &lt;=============================\r\n        this._isMounted &amp;&amp; this.setState({ retrievedData });\r\n      });\r\n    };\r\n\r\nTwo problems with that:\r\n\r\n1. It updates an object stored in your state **directly**, which is something you must never do with React.\r\n2. It replaces the entire `retrievedData` object with one that may well be stale.\r\n\r\nInstead:\r\n\r\n    fetchDataByName = name =&gt; {\r\n      // *** No `retrievedData` here\r\n      const { fetcher } = this.props;\r\n      const fetch = _.find(fetcher, { name });\r\n\r\n      if (typeof fetch === &quot;undefined&quot;) {\r\n        throw new Error(`Fetch with ${name} cannot be found in fetcher`);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      this.fetchData(fetch, (error, data) =&gt; {\r\n        if (this._isMounted) {                                  // ***\r\n          this.setState(({retrievedData}) =&gt; (                  // ***\r\n            { retrievedData: {...retrievedData, [name]: data} } // ***\r\n          );                                                    // ***\r\n        }                                                       // ***\r\n      });\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThat removes the in-place mutation of the object with spread, and uses an up-to-date version of `retrievedData` by using the callback version of `setState`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410354/perform-two-functions-simultaneously/58410485#58410485","title":"Perform two functions simultaneously"}],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":7603806,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uMsNZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Baspa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7603806/baspa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":154,"user_id":7603806,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uMsNZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Baspa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7603806/baspa"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571219805,"creation_date":1571219048,"last_edit_date":1571219651,"question_id":58410354,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410354","body_markdown":"I have a function that refreshes the data of my component when the function is called. At this moment it only works for one component at a time. But I want to refresh two components at once. This is my refresh function:\r\n\r\n       fetchDataByName = name =&gt; {\r\n            const { retrievedData } = this.state;\r\n            const { fetcher } = this.props;\r\n            const fetch = _.find(fetcher, { name });\r\n        \r\n            if (typeof fetch === &quot;undefined&quot;) {\r\n              throw new Error(`Fetch with ${name} cannot be found in fetcher`);\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            this.fetchData(fetch, (error, data) =&gt; {\r\n              retrievedData[name] = data;\r\n              this._isMounted &amp;&amp; this.setState({ retrievedData });\r\n            });\r\n          };\r\n\r\nMy function is called like this:\r\n\r\n    refresh(&quot;meetingTypes&quot;);\r\n\r\nAs it it passed as props to my component:\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n            &lt;Component\r\n              {...retrievedData}\r\n              {...componentProps}\r\n              refresh={this.fetchDataByName}\r\n            /&gt;\r\n          );\r\n\r\nI tried passing multiple component names as an array like this:\r\n\r\n    const args = [&#39;meetingTypes&#39;, &#39;exampleMeetingTypes&#39;];\r\n    refresh(args);\r\n\r\nAnd then check in my `fetchDataByName` function if `name` is an array and loop through the array to fetch the data. But then the function is still executed after each other instead of at the same time.

component props, they should be replaced.\r\n        _.each(params, param =&gt; {\r\n          if (componentProps[param]) {\r\n            route = route.replace(`:${param}`, componentProps[param]);\r\n          } else {\r\n            fetchData = false; // don&#39;t fetch data for this entry as the params are not given\r\n          }\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n        if

Is this a normal part of debugging views?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KOQKC.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUJAN.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlJRx.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLcVo.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410325/how-to-control-the-right-margin-of-my-uitextview","title":"How to control the right margin of my UITextView"},{"tags":["git","powershell","git-stash"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":494,"user_id":4177009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17c85e085e7e8690bb0ebcd33d054c69?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ture P&#229;lsson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4177009/ture-p%c3%a5lsson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219692,"post_id":58410321,"comment_id":103164510,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename#comment103164510_58410321"},{"owner":{"reputation":32047,"user_id":7976758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512cfbaf98d63ca4acd57b2df792aec6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"phd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7976758/phd"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571221893,"post_id":58410321,"comment_id":103165655,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename#comment103165655_58410321"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1497,"user_id":785535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2t9gS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"masiboo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/785535/masiboo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571220135,"post_id":58410574,"comment_id":103164771,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename/58410574#comment103164771_58410574"},{"owner":{"reputation":1497,"user_id":785535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2t9gS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"masiboo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/785535/masiboo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571220432,"post_id":58410574,"comment_id":103164933,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename/58410574#comment103164933_58410574"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15357,"user_id":86072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd41ab60469c4ee32c957c97fc101b9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LeGEC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/86072/legec"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15357,"user_id":86072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd41ab60469c4ee32c957c97fc101b9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LeGEC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/86072/legec"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571220259,"last_edit_date":1571220259,"creation_date":1571219766,"answer_id":58410574,"question_id":58410321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410574","body_markdown":"This is a shell issue : use quotes around `&#39;stash@{xx}&#39;`\r\n\r\n    git show &#39;stash@{1}&#39;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn Powershell for example : `{ cmd1; cmd2 }` defines a [script block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_script_blocks?view=powershell-7)\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what I get :\r\n\r\n    &gt; echo stash@{1}\r\n    stash@\r\n    1\r\n    &gt; echo &#39;stash@{1}&#39;\r\n    stash@{1}","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename/58410574#58410574","title":"How to see git stash modification when it was done by git stash push filename"}],"owner":{"reputation":1497,"user_id":785535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2t9gS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"masiboo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/785535/masiboo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15357,"user_id":86072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd41ab60469c4ee32c957c97fc101b9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LeGEC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/86072/legec"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58410574,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571220268,"creation_date":1571218948,"last_edit_date":1571220268,"question_id":58410321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410321","body_markdown":"I stash few files earlier by git stash push file_path.

My current understanding is something like: \r\n\r\nBackup\r\n\r\n1. Use scripts to create images and containers. Store/Backup scripts in your favorite Version Control System. Use version tags to pull docker images. [Don&#39;t use **latest** tag](https://www.docker.com/blog/intro-guide-to-dockerfile-best-practices/).\r\n2. Exclude `/var/lib/docker/overlay2` from backup (to prevent backing up dangling and temporary stuff)\r\n4. Use named volumes only. Volumes can be saved and restored from backup. For database stuff extra work has to be done. Eventually consider to tar volumes to extra folder [2].\r\n5. `docker prune` daily to remove dangling stuff\r\n\r\nRestore\r\n\r\n1. Make sure all named volumes are back in place. \r\n2. Fetch scripts from version control to recreate images as needed. Use `docker run` to recreate containers. \r\n3.

Why can&#39;t the same newly created option be added to both dropdowns?? \r\n\r\n[This fiddle I just made][1] has a test setup. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jsfiddle.net/vzf9t0or/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410298/unable-to-add-same-option-element-to-more-than-one-dropdown","title":"Unable to add same option element to more than one dropdown"},{"tags":["jquery","datatable"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":505,"user_id":5855884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62579b796ab87602b4bbafd4e8e27b63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jishan siddique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855884/jishan-siddique"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219115,"post_id":58410296,"comment_id":103164230,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410296/how-to-format-a-ajax-datatable-column-value#comment103164230_58410296"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":11042820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3703fd5964805e800b35272e29a33ce1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"techstack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11042820/techstack"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571220993,"post_id":58410459,"comment_id":103165230,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410296/how-to-format-a-ajax-datatable-column-value/58410459#comment103165230_58410459"},{"owner":{"reputation":505,"user_id":5855884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62579b796ab87602b4bbafd4e8e27b63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jishan siddique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855884/jishan-siddique"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":46,"user_id":11042820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3703fd5964805e800b35272e29a33ce1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"techstack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11042820/techstack"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571226302,"post_id":58410459,"comment_id":103168067,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410296/how-to-format-a-ajax-datatable-column-value/58410459#comment103168067_58410459"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":505,"user_id":5855884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62579b796ab87602b4bbafd4e8e27b63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jishan siddique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855884/jishan-siddique"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571219376,"creation_date":1571219376,"answer_id":58410459,"question_id":58410296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410459","body_markdown":"&gt; Jquery Code\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;data&quot;: &quot;ValueDate&quot;,\r\n        &quot;render&quot;: function (data) {\r\n            var date = new Date(data);\r\n    \t\treturn  date.getFullYear() + &quot;-&quot; + date.getMonth() + &quot;-&quot;+ date.getDate();\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410296/how-to-format-a-ajax-datatable-column-value/58410459#58410459","title":"How to format a Ajax datatable column value?"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":11042820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3703fd5964805e800b35272e29a33ce1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"techstack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11042820/techstack"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58410459,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571219376,"creation_date":1571218873,"question_id":58410296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410296","body_markdown":"I have a table that is generated with datatable plugin.

I&#39;ve implemented a DNN that detects the glasses on a given frame and the next step is to apply segmentation on this cropped part of the image.\r\n\r\nMy object detection is using OpenCV&#39;s own Object-Detection implementation, based on a Caffe Backend for models and weights, the goal was to use a fast single-shot detector reduce the overall background noise, while keeping the ROI for the next (heavier) task, Object-Segmentation. The DNN algorithm does not support Object-Segmentation (only Object-Detection), that&#39;s why I want to use a CNN (MASK-CNN) on my cropped image.\r\n\r\nMy cropped images all have the size 300x200 (padded with zeros to fit the 300x200 margin for the individual bounding boxes). This image only contains the glasses with a face as background and fills the individual missing pixels per detection with black padding to reach my target resolution (300x200).\r\n\r\nI wanted to use MASK-CNN but realised that it scales inputs to 800px on the smallest side, I don&#39;t really want that as I want to compute the algorithm on a Samsung Tablet, which is why I want to keep the overall resolution relatively small, which should reduce the CPU-Load.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\nI&#39;m asking if there is a way to directly change the scaling algorithm of the input image, at best completely disabling it (cause I already did the scaling myself) when using a MASK-CNN with OpenCV C++. Additionally I&#39;m wondering if 300x200 is a realistic size for an image to be computed on a Tablet CPU in a maximum of 2 seconds. I know that the latter question probably has to be tested by myself, but maybe someone has enough experience to answer it. I could easily reduce the target-resolution even further, by resizing it, would 100x50 be noticeably faster to compute?\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t really start my training as long as I&#39;m not aware how to solve the scaling issue, my object detection algorithm is currently cropping the detections individually to the 300x200 target resolution and hence my whole training dataset has this resolution. Labelling/Masking the data will take a long time, so I have to make sure that I can actually compute the CNN on this target resolution.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410295/implementing-mask-cnn-on-mobile-with-opencv","title":"Implementing MASK-CNN on Mobile with OpenCV"},{"tags":["html","css","scroll"],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":9416929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pzT_PVpCwQo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABP8/vg55BkjDz4s/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Afras Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9416929/afras-khan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1041,"user_id":4481000,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukkoc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jainil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4481000/jainil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571219454,"creation_date":1571218871,"last_edit_date":1571219454,"question_id":58410294,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410294","body_markdown":"I am trying to get a list of texts to scroll from top to bottom without any space after each loop.

I also have an extension, in which I run the stubs.\r\n\r\nI am relatively new to programming in general, and I am still having trouble understanding the auto-layout logic in Swift, so any help is appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410545/how-to-place-auto-layout-constraints-inside-uipageviewcontroller-programmaticall","title":"How to place auto layout constraints

How can I debug the error further?\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CollectionContext &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  include Authority::Abilities\r\n  self.authorizer_name = &#39;ManagedContentAuthorizer&#39;\r\n\r\n  has_many :context_sets, inverse_of: :collection_context\r\n  has_many :museum_collections, through: :context_sets,\r\n                                source: :contextable,\r\n                                source_type: &#39;MuseumCollection&#39;\r\n\r\n  enum catalogue: %i[museum archive library]\r\n  enum vocabulary: {category: 10,\r\n                    collection: 20,\r\n                    concept: 30,\r\n                    event: 40,\r\n                    gallery: 50,\r\n                    material: 60,\r\n                    organisation: 70,\r\n                    people: 80,\r\n                    person: 90,\r\n                    place: 100,\r\n                    style: 110,\r\n                    technique: 120}\r\n\r\n  validate :check_multiple\r\n\r\n  def check_multiple\r\n    if [identifier, query, query_url].compact.count != 1\r\n      errors[:base] &lt;&lt; &quot; cannot set multiple context links&quot;\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve now discovered that if I run rake with my rails environment set to TEST, it doesn&#39;t show any problems in the console. So it is a development only problem. I have experimented with my gemfile and put all dev only gems into the dev and test group but I still get the error when running rake in dev.\r\n\r\nThis is my config/development.rb file\r\n\r\n```\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nRails.application.configure do\r\n  config.webpacker.check_yarn_integrity = false\r\n  config.cache_classes = false\r\n  config.eager_load = false\r\n  config.consider_all_requests_local = true\r\n  config.action_controller.perform_caching = false\r\n  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false\r\n  config.active_support.deprecation = :log\r\n  config.active_record.migration_error = :page_load\r\n  config.assets.debug = true\r\n  config.assets.digest = true\r\n  config.assets.raise_runtime_errors = true\r\n  config.web_console.whitelisted_ips = &#39;10.xxxx&#39;\r\nend\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410492/rails-error-instance-method-already-defined-by-another-enum-but-there-are-no-re","title":"Rails error: instance method already defined by another enum but there are no repeats"},{"tags":["java","jpa","criteria-api"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":4387510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/622492811/picture?type=large","display_name":"JamesOzzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4387510/jamesozzie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571290774,"post_id":58410491,"comment_id":103192744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410491/trying-to-get-a-result-set-from-a-table-with-a-joined-table-using-criteria-api-i#comment103192744_58410491"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":4387510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/622492811/picture?type=large","display_name":"JamesOzzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4387510/jamesozzie"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571291265,"creation_date":1571291265,"answer_id":58425693,"question_id":58410491,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58425693","body_markdown":"```java\r\npublic List&lt;Item&gt;

But for now, since we are not providing the enum with the error codes yet, you would have to do something like this in your code:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nenum PurchasesErrorCode {\r\n  UnknownError,\r\n  PurchaseCancelledError,\r\n  StoreProblemError,\r\n  PurchaseNotAllowedError,\r\n  PurchaseInvalidError,\r\n  ProductNotAvailableForPurchaseError,\r\n  ProductAlreadyPurchasedError,\r\n  ReceiptAlreadyInUseError,\r\n  InvalidReceiptError,\r\n  MissingReceiptFileError,\r\n  NetworkError,\r\n  InvalidCredentialsError,\r\n  UnexpectedBackendResponseError,\r\n  ReceiptInUseByOtherSubscriberError,\r\n  InvalidAppUserIdError,\r\n  OperationAlreadyInProgressError,\r\n  UnknownBackendError,\r\n  InsufficientPermissionsError\r\n}\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n} on PlatformException catch (e) {\r\n  PurchasesErrorCode errorCode = PurchasesErrorCode.values[int.parse(e.code)];\r\n  switch (errorCode) {\r\n    case PurchasesErrorCode.UnknownError:\r\n    case PurchasesErrorCode.PurchaseCancelledError:\r\n    case PurchasesErrorCode.StoreProblemError:\r\n    // Add rest of cases\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you do `e.details`, you also get access to a `readableErrorCode` containing the name of the error code; and an `underlyingErrorMessage`, that can hopefully help you debug any issue.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410482/exposing-all-revenuecat-purchaseserrorcode-codes-in-flutter/58419220#58419220","title":"Exposing all RevenueCat PurchasesErrorCode codes in flutter"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10530978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07a5a9db0a7d02178c4521ad914a9fd2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"liondog","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10530978/liondog"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58419220,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571249010,"creation_date":1571219465,"question_id":58410482,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410482","body_markdown":"I need to trap all of the listed PurchasesErrorCode error codes in my Flutter app so I can respond to them accordingly.\r\n\r\nCurrently I can only trap &quot;userCancelled&quot;, for everything else I can only report the information returned in the standard PlatformException code, message and details properties, without knowing what they will contain.\r\n\r\n````\r\ntry {\r\n\r\n  // Code to make purchase..\r\n\r\n} on PlatformException catch (e) {\r\n\r\n  if (!(e.details as Map)[&quot;userCancelled&quot;]) {\r\n\r\n    // Here I need a comprehensive switch statement so I can\r\n    // retry where appropriate/control what messages the user sees\r\n\r\n    String reason = &#39;&#39;;\r\n    (e.details as Map).forEach((k,v) =&gt; reason += &#39;$k =&gt; $v&#39;);\r\n    showError(context, &#39;Error&#39;, &#39;${e.code} : ${e.message}&#39;);\r\n\r\n  } else {\r\n\r\n    showError(context, &#39;Purchase Cancelled&#39;, &#39;Your purchase was not completed, you have not been charged.&#39;);\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThese codes are exposed in IOS/Swift and Android/Kotlin but I can&#39;t get them in Flutter/Dart - what am I missing?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410482/exposing-all-revenuecat-purchaseserrorcode-codes-in-flutter","title":"Exposing all RevenueCat PurchasesErrorCode codes in flutter"},{"tags":["java","memory-leaks","off-heap"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4933381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934e17a5ba6e5d5ec5e8e4cc9a97f43b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"angel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4933381/angel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4933381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934e17a5ba6e5d5ec5e8e4cc9a97f43b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"angel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4933381/angel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571304024,"creation_date":1571219462,"last_edit_date":1571304024,"question_id":58410480,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410480","body_markdown":"I am very new to Memory leak issue.

did this for a loading bar for an upload progress. I&#39;m using bootstrap so [I used their progress bar element](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/progress/):\r\n```HTML\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;progress-bar&quot; role=&quot;progressbar&quot; style=&quot;width: 25%&quot; aria-valuenow=&quot;25&quot; aria-valuemin=&quot;0&quot; aria-valuemax=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nBut as you mentioned, you wanted this to be dynamic. So what you want is for when the progress bar component loads, you want it to make the API call and pass a callback function to modify the state to that value which you can plug into the progress bar.\r\n\r\nSo using my Bootstrap example, the progress bar might now look like this:\r\n```HTML\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;progress-bar&quot; role=&quot;progressbar&quot; style={{width: uploadProgress + &quot;%&quot;}} aria-valuenow={uploadProgress} aria-valuemin=&quot;0&quot; aria-valuemax=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when you load in this component, run a function (when the component mounts) that makes your API call, but pass in a callback function to update `uploadProgress`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using React Hooks (I&#39;d highly recommend them) and here&#39;s how I set up `uploadProgress`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst uploadProgress = useSelector(state =&gt; state.uploadProgress);\r\n```\r\n\r\nso I&#39;m making a call to the state. This state is updated by the API function.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo to summarise:\r\n\r\n 1. Make your API results run a function (send an action to an actionCreator) to update the state.\r\n 2. Access this state in your progress bar component\r\n 3. Use that state value as the value for your progress bar(s)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you&#39;ve got any questions - I am new to this myself but that&#39;s how I manged to do it and it works pretty well!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410440/how-to-make-a-dynamic-progressbar-with-data-received-from-an-api/58410820#58410820","title":"How to make a dynamic progressbar with data received from an api"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":12085577,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fd38596fcd52ef9f45d040a649c1c25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"henrydoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12085577/henrydoe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571220570,"creation_date":1571219294,"question_id":58410440,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410440","body_markdown":"I have an api which sents score if someone does the math, chemistry or physics correct.

If the above is correct will it deprecate too?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410431/google-analytics-for-mobile-apps-deprecation","title":"Google analytics for mobile apps deprecation"},{"tags":["django","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":175,"user_id":10084728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68f4918ae2890b77de8caf36e8ece454?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sandeep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10084728/sandeep"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571230455,"post_id":58410430,"comment_id":103170538,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410430/how-to-make-a-forum-like-tag-system-for-images-in-django#comment103170538_58410430"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11605012,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d311cbbb0f9ab88943137e098dab1dbb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"A.

Not all forms will have radio buttons.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of my html layout:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;step-0&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;form id=&quot;step_0_form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; class=&quot;formateninput form-control&quot; name=&quot;aantal&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; min=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;step-1&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;form id=&quot;step_1_form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; class=&quot;formateninput form-control&quot; name=&quot;hoogte&quot; value=&quot;100&quot; min=&quot;60&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;step-2&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;form id=&quot;step_2_form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; id=&quot;Hout&quot; name=&quot;Materiaal&quot; value=&quot;Hout&quot; &gt;\r\n    \t  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; id=&quot;Debond&quot; name=&quot;Materiaal&quot; value=&quot;Debond&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd this is my jquery code at the moment:\r\n\r\n    var ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).on(&quot;leaveStep&quot;, function(e, anchorObject, stepNumber, stepDirection) {\r\n    \r\n      if(ajaxInvoke == false){\r\n    \tajaxInvoke = true;\r\n    \r\n    \tvar form_data = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;).serialize();\r\n    \r\n    \tvar formname = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t$.ajax({\r\n    \t  type:&#39;post&#39;,\r\n    \t  url:&quot;catalog/calcdiv.php&quot;,\r\n    \t  data:form_data,\r\n    \t  success:function(data){\r\n    \t\t // indicate the ajax has been done, release the next step\r\n    \t\t $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).smartWizard(&quot;next&quot;);\r\n    \t\t ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    \t  }\r\n    \t});\r\n    \t// Return false to cancel the `leaveStep` event\r\n    \treturn false;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nI tried the following:\r\n\r\n    var ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).on(&quot;leaveStep&quot;, function(e, anchorObject, stepNumber, stepDirection) {\r\n    \r\n      if(ajaxInvoke == false){\r\n    \tajaxInvoke = true;\r\n    \r\n    \tvar form_data = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;).serialize();\r\n    \r\n    \tvar formname = $(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t$(formname).on(&quot;change&quot; &quot;input[type=radio]:checked&quot;, function(e){\r\n    \t  var val = $(this).val();\r\n    \t  console.log(val);\r\n    \t});\r\n    \r\n    \t$.ajax({\r\n    \t  type:&#39;post&#39;,\r\n    \t  url:&quot;catalog/calcdiv.php&quot;,\r\n    \t  data:form_data,\r\n    \t  success:function(data){\r\n    \t\t // indicate the ajax has been done, release the next step\r\n    \t\t $(&quot;#smartwizard&quot;).smartWizard(&quot;next&quot;);\r\n    \t\t ajaxInvoke = false;\r\n    \t  }\r\n    \t});\r\n    \t// Return false to cancel the `leaveStep` event\r\n    \treturn false;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nBut this doesn&#39;t show anything in my console. How can I get the value of the radio button clicked on the current step in the currently opened form? `$(&quot;#step_&quot;+ stepNumber +&quot;_form&quot;);` is the corresponding form id.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410391/how-to-get-a-radio-button-value-of-one-form-when-multiple-forms-are-dynamically","title":"How to get a radio button value of one form when multiple forms are dynamically created"},{"tags":["arrays","laravel","pagination"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":7324136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c95e5ea596acdf96806eb9277bfca405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udhayan Nair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7324136/udhayan-nair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219211,"post_id":58410383,"comment_id":103164285,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel#comment103164285_58410383"},{"owner":{"reputation":431,"user_id":4097457,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9J46nzs-gPs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADk/TrNSLZe1Drg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shokouh Dareshiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4097457/shokouh-dareshiri"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":309,"user_id":7324136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c95e5ea596acdf96806eb9277bfca405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udhayan Nair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7324136/udhayan-nair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219235,"post_id":58410383,"comment_id":103164298,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel#comment103164298_58410383"},{"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":7324136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c95e5ea596acdf96806eb9277bfca405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udhayan Nair","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7324136/udhayan-nair"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219411,"post_id":58410383,"comment_id":103164389,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel#comment103164389_58410383"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1095,"user_id":10341554,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/btAHb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"party-ring","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10341554/party-ring"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571219381,"creation_date":1571219381,"answer_id":58410463,"question_id":58410383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410463","body_markdown":"You can only use `paginate` on an instance of [QueryBuilder or on an Eloquent query][1].\r\n\r\nInstead, if you need to &#39;paginate&#39; an array, you can use [PHP array_chunk][2].\r\n\r\n    array_chunk($result, 10, true);\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/pagination\r\n  [2]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410383/can-not-use-pagination-for-an-array-object-in-laravel/58410463#58410463","title":"can not use pagination() for an array object in laravel"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":431,"user_id":4097457,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9J46nzs-gPs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADk/TrNSLZe1Drg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shokouh Dareshiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4097457/shokouh-dareshiri"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571820253,"creation_date":1571820253,"answer_id":58518867,"question_id":58410383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58518867","body_markdown":"I solved my problems using `make()` and `LengthAwarePaginator` as below:\r\n\r\n    if (!empty($_GET[&#39;page&#39;])) {\r\n\r\n         $per_page = !empty($_GET[&#39;per_page&#39;]) ?

I am sure I am following the correct steps..","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410368/db2-update-statement-not-working-using-jdbc","title":"DB2 Update statement not working using JDBC"},{"tags":["javascript","react-native","redux"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":325,"user_id":2661032,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/POx4v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Abhay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2661032/abhay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571221676,"post_id":58410365,"comment_id":103165552,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410365/react-component-why-can-dispatch-in-asyncapp-components#comment103165552_58410365"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":894,"user_id":1873027,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnNy7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Horst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1873027/horst"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571220425,"creation_date":1571220425,"answer_id":58410769,"question_id":58410365,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410769","body_markdown":"Welcome to SO.\r\n\r\nActually, `connect()` has provided the dispatch to your component already.(https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect#example-usage)\r\n\r\nYou can take `mapDispatchToProps` as a middleware for creating methods with dispatch.\r\n\r\nLets say we have a store with state counter.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    counter: 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin `mapDispatchToProps`, we can create methods using in this component :\r\n```\r\n{\r\n increment: ()=&gt;{dispatch({ type: &#39;EDIT&#39;, payload: 1 })},\r\n decrement: ()=&gt;{dispatch({ type: &#39;EDIT&#39;, payload: -1 })}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410365/react-component-why-can-dispatch-in-asyncapp-components/58410769#58410769","title":"React Component - Why can dispatch in AsyncApp Components"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9667103,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4b38dee0c72de21ca1e80b1f6ca1a25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raymond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9667103/raymond"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571220425,"creation_date":1571219056,"question_id":58410365,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410365","body_markdown":"Refer to this example\r\nhttps://redux.js.org/advanced/example-reddit-api\r\n    \r\n    import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;\r\n    import PropTypes from &#39;prop-types&#39;\r\n    import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;\r\n    import {\r\n      selectSubreddit,\r\n      fetchPostsIfNeeded,\r\n      invalidateSubreddit\r\n    } from &#39;../actions&#39;\r\n    import Picker from &#39;../components/Picker&#39;\r\n    import Posts from &#39;../components/Posts&#39;\r\n    \r\n    class AsyncApp extends Component {\r\n      constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props)\r\n        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)\r\n        this.handleRefreshClick = this.handleRefreshClick.bind(this)\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      componentDidMount() {\r\n        const { dispatch, selectedSubreddit } = this.props\r\n        dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(selectedSubreddit))\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\r\n        if (this.props.selectedSubreddit !== prevProps.selectedSubreddit) {\r\n          const { dispatch, selectedSubreddit } = this.props\r\n          dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(selectedSubreddit))\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      handleChange(nextSubreddit) {\r\n        this.props.dispatch(selectSubreddit(nextSubreddit))\r\n        this.props.dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(nextSubreddit))\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      handleRefreshClick(e) {\r\n        e.preventDefault()\r\n    \r\n        const { dispatch, selectedSubreddit } = this.props\r\n        dispatch(invalidateSubreddit(selectedSubreddit))\r\n        dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded(selectedSubreddit))\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      render() {\r\n        const { selectedSubreddit, posts, isFetching, lastUpdated } = this.props\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;Picker\r\n              value={selectedSubreddit}\r\n              onChange={this.handleChange}\r\n              options={[&#39;reactjs&#39;, &#39;frontend&#39;]}\r\n            /&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;\r\n              {lastUpdated &amp;&amp;

To refresh two aspects of the data in parallel, simply make two calls instead of one:\r\n\r\n    refresh(&quot;meetingTypes&quot;);\r\n    refresh(&quot;exampleMeetingTypes&quot;);\r\n\r\nThe two ajax calls or whatever will run in parallel, each updating the component when it finishes. **But**: See the &quot;Side Note&quot; below, there&#39;s a problem with `fetchDataByName`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid updating the component twice, you&#39;ll have to update `fetchDataByName` to either accept multiple names or to return a promise of the result (or similar) rather than updating the component directly, so the caller can do multiple calls and wait for both results before doing the update.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSide note: This aspect of `fetchDataByName` looks suspect:\r\n\r\n    fetchDataByName = name =&gt; {\r\n      const { retrievedData } = this.state;  // &lt;=============================\r\n      const { fetcher } = this.props;\r\n      const fetch = _.find(fetcher, { name });\r\n\r\n      if (typeof fetch === &quot;undefined&quot;) {\r\n        throw new Error(`Fetch with ${name} cannot be found in fetcher`);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      this.fetchData(fetch, (error, data) =&gt; {\r\n        retrievedData[name] = data;          // &lt;=============================\r\n        this._isMounted &amp;&amp; this.setState({ retrievedData });\r\n      });\r\n    };\r\n\r\nTwo problems with that:\r\n\r\n1. It updates an object stored in your state **directly**, which is something you must never do with React.\r\n2. It replaces the entire `retrievedData` object with one that may well be stale.\r\n\r\nInstead:\r\n\r\n    fetchDataByName = name =&gt; {\r\n      // *** No `retrievedData` here\r\n      const { fetcher } = this.props;\r\n      const fetch = _.find(fetcher, { name });\r\n\r\n      if (typeof fetch === &quot;undefined&quot;) {\r\n        throw new Error(`Fetch with ${name} cannot be found in fetcher`);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      this.fetchData(fetch, (error, data) =&gt; {\r\n        if (this._isMounted) {                                  // ***\r\n          this.setState(({retrievedData}) =&gt; (                  // ***\r\n            { retrievedData: {...retrievedData, [name]: data} } // ***\r\n          );                                                    // ***\r\n        }                                                       // ***\r\n      });\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThat removes the in-place mutation of the object with spread, and uses an up-to-date version of `retrievedData` by using the callback version of `setState`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410354/perform-two-functions-simultaneously/58410485#58410485","title":"Perform two functions simultaneously"}],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":7603806,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uMsNZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Baspa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7603806/baspa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":154,"user_id":7603806,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uMsNZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Baspa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7603806/baspa"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571219805,"creation_date":1571219048,"last_edit_date":1571219651,"question_id":58410354,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410354","body_markdown":"I have a function that refreshes the data of my component when the function is called. At this moment it only works for one component at a time. But I want to refresh two components at once. This is my refresh function:\r\n\r\n       fetchDataByName = name =&gt; {\r\n            const { retrievedData } = this.state;\r\n            const { fetcher } = this.props;\r\n            const fetch = _.find(fetcher, { name });\r\n        \r\n            if (typeof fetch === &quot;undefined&quot;) {\r\n              throw new Error(`Fetch with ${name} cannot be found in fetcher`);\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            this.fetchData(fetch, (error, data) =&gt; {\r\n              retrievedData[name] = data;\r\n              this._isMounted &amp;&amp; this.setState({ retrievedData });\r\n            });\r\n          };\r\n\r\nMy function is called like this:\r\n\r\n    refresh(&quot;meetingTypes&quot;);\r\n\r\nAs it it passed as props to my component:\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n            &lt;Component\r\n              {...retrievedData}\r\n              {...componentProps}\r\n              refresh={this.fetchDataByName}\r\n            /&gt;\r\n          );\r\n\r\nI tried passing multiple component names as an array like this:\r\n\r\n    const args = [&#39;meetingTypes&#39;, &#39;exampleMeetingTypes&#39;];\r\n    refresh(args);\r\n\r\nAnd then check in my `fetchDataByName` function if `name` is an array and loop through the array to fetch the data. But then the function is still executed after each other instead of at the same time.

component props, they should be replaced.\r\n        _.each(params, param =&gt; {\r\n          if (componentProps[param]) {\r\n            route = route.replace(`:${param}`, componentProps[param]);\r\n          } else {\r\n            fetchData = false; // don&#39;t fetch data for this entry as the params are not given\r\n          }\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n        if

Is this a normal part of debugging views?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KOQKC.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUJAN.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlJRx.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLcVo.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410325/how-to-control-the-right-margin-of-my-uitextview","title":"How to control the right margin of my UITextView"},{"tags":["git","powershell","git-stash"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":494,"user_id":4177009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17c85e085e7e8690bb0ebcd33d054c69?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ture P&#229;lsson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4177009/ture-p%c3%a5lsson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571219692,"post_id":58410321,"comment_id":103164510,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename#comment103164510_58410321"},{"owner":{"reputation":32047,"user_id":7976758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512cfbaf98d63ca4acd57b2df792aec6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"phd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7976758/phd"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571221893,"post_id":58410321,"comment_id":103165655,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename#comment103165655_58410321"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1497,"user_id":785535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2t9gS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"masiboo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/785535/masiboo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571220135,"post_id":58410574,"comment_id":103164771,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename/58410574#comment103164771_58410574"},{"owner":{"reputation":1497,"user_id":785535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2t9gS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"masiboo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/785535/masiboo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571220432,"post_id":58410574,"comment_id":103164933,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename/58410574#comment103164933_58410574"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15357,"user_id":86072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd41ab60469c4ee32c957c97fc101b9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LeGEC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/86072/legec"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15357,"user_id":86072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd41ab60469c4ee32c957c97fc101b9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LeGEC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/86072/legec"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571220259,"last_edit_date":1571220259,"creation_date":1571219766,"answer_id":58410574,"question_id":58410321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410574","body_markdown":"This is a shell issue : use quotes around `&#39;stash@{xx}&#39;`\r\n\r\n    git show &#39;stash@{1}&#39;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn Powershell for example : `{ cmd1; cmd2 }` defines a [script block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_script_blocks?view=powershell-7)\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what I get :\r\n\r\n    &gt; echo stash@{1}\r\n    stash@\r\n    1\r\n    &gt; echo &#39;stash@{1}&#39;\r\n    stash@{1}","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410321/how-to-see-git-stash-modification-when-it-was-done-by-git-stash-push-filename/58410574#58410574","title":"How to see git stash modification when it was done by git stash push filename"}],"owner":{"reputation":1497,"user_id":785535,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2t9gS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"masiboo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/785535/masiboo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15357,"user_id":86072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd41ab60469c4ee32c957c97fc101b9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LeGEC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/86072/legec"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58410574,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571220268,"creation_date":1571218948,"last_edit_date":1571220268,"question_id":58410321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58410321","body_markdown":"I stash few files earlier by git stash push file_path.

My code for creating the instance is the following (including the addition of tags at the end):\r\n\r\n    import boto3\r\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\n    import time\r\n    \r\n    today = datetime.utcnow().strftime(&#39;%Y%m%d&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    remove_on = (datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=3)).strftime(&#39;%Y%m%d&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    session = boto3.session.Session(region_name=&#39;eu-west-1&#39;)\r\n    client = session.client(&#39;ec2&#39;)\r\n    ec2 = session.resource(&#39;ec2&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    instance_info = client.describe_instances(Filters=[{&#39;Name&#39;: &#39;tag:Name&#39;, \r\n    &#39;Values&#39;: [&#39;Airflow&#39;]}]) #This filter DOES work\r\n    instance_id = instance_info[&#39;Reservations&#39;][0][&#39;Instances&#39;][0][&#39;InstanceId&#39;]\r\n    instance = ec2.Instance(instance_id)\r\n    \r\n    image = instance.create_image(InstanceId=instance_id, Name=f&quot;Airflow_{today}&quot;)\r\n    time.sleep(2)\r\n    image.create_tags(Tags=[{&#39;Key&#39;: &#39;RemoveOn&#39;, &#39;Value&#39;: remove_on},\r\n                            {&#39;Key&#39;: &#39;BackupOf&#39;, &#39;Value&#39;: &#39;Airflow&#39;}])\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to get the info of the recent created AMI, I get no data:\r\n\r\n    instances_to_delete = client.describe_instances(Filters=[{&#39;Name&#39;: &#39;tag:RemoveOn&#39;, \r\n                                                          &#39;Values&#39;:[remove_on]}])\r\nI have tried to explicitly put a string in Values but it does not work either. Also, even though it didn&#39;t make much sense (since I already had one filter working previously), I specified the region in client also (because of these answers https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47700089/boto3-ec2-describe-instances-always-returns-empty) and it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\nThe tag is there as we can see in the following screenshot\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zNRdh.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58410309/describe-instances-in-boto3-with-filters-is-not-working","title":"Describe_instances in boto3 with filters is not working"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8890}
