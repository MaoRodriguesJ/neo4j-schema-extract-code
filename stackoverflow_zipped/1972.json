Real big headache.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference in automatic naming of collections between PyMongo and Mongoose:\r\n\r\nex:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninserting to db using mongoose:\r\nbandcampDebugModel = db2.model(&#39;bandcamp_debug&#39;, bandcampDebugSchema);\r\n\r\nbecomes &#39;bandcamp_debugs&#39;\r\n\r\ninserting to db using PyMongo:\r\ndb2 = client[&#39;cryptoDebug&#39;]\r\ndebug = db2.crypto_debug\r\n\r\nremains &#39;crypto_debug&#39;\r\n\r\nThe solution was to add the explicit collection name:\r\n\r\nconst cryptoDebugModel = crypto_debug.model(&quot;crypto_debug&quot;,\r\n    {\r\n        name : String,\r\n        dateOfIssue: String,\r\n        error: String\r\n    }, &quot;crypto_debug&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI am having an issue where the graphQL query is returning an empty array and the query works fine in MongoDB.\r\n\r\nThis application has 5 scraper scripts running. 2 are made in Python and 3 are made in Javascript.\r\n\r\nIn total there are 11 collections in MongoDB that are being queried with graphQL. 9 out of the 11 work without an issue.\r\n\r\nThe 2 collections in question both reside in python scripts using pymongo.\r\nI will post code for one of the two as they both are similar in structure.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve really hit a wall at this point and have tried everything that I can think of and not sure where to debug to find the source of this issue.\r\n\r\nWhat I have tried:\r\n\r\n - typeof for the fields in mongodb are string, all looks normal there\r\n - different forms of cryptoDebugModel.find() query in the graphQL endpoint\r\n - removing date, dateOfIssue in the python script to see if there is an issue from pymongo / string (but if it is showing as string in mongoDB then that should not be an issue?)\r\n - renaming the db/collection to account for possible plural scenario\r\n\r\nLike I said, 9 out of the 11 are working without an issue, and all low hanging fruit ideas have been exhausted such as typos, duplicate names, etc.\r\n\r\nThe query appears fine in the mongoDB console but is returning an empty array in the graphQL query so any help would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI can supply full code if requested, trying to keep the issue concise as possible.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/iP3UA.png&quot;&gt;\r\nThis is an image of the mongoDB query of crypto_debug.\r\n&lt;/a&gt;

What I can&#39;t fully explain is why in some cases building a function using `+` within will not work. But I haven&#39;t had any issues with creating a `list()` of the layers.\r\n\r\nNote that you don&#39;t need the `...` in `function()` because you&#39;re not looking to pass any arguments when you call the function later.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072649/using-geoms-inside-a-function/58082345#58082345","title":"Using geoms inside a function"}],"owner":{"reputation":369,"user_id":6866511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10154577384656518/picture?type=large","display_name":"James Martherus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6866511/james-martherus"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58082345,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569334622,"creation_date":1569295422,"question_id":58072649,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58072649","body_markdown":"I want to write a function to plot shot location data.

The disadvantage here is that the index (`4: 3`) must be constant and can&#39;t be something like `1 + len(i)`. If you&#39;d want to preallocate the slice (e.g. `make([]int, 2+len(i))`), you can&#39;t combine that with a composite literal to list elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

@Jonathan Johx has mentioned its a multi tenant application, each tenant has its schema.\r\nTo provide some concrete directions, You can create a special data source that will act as a proxy for real data sources, each of those can be in charge for 1 schema connection.\r\n\r\nSpring already provides [AbstractRoutingDatSource][1] for this purpose or you can roll your own. Basically you should define some mapping method ([determineCurrentLookupKey][2]) and maintain the map of key to actual data source that can be updated in real time in case a new data source should be connected.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found [This SO post][3] that explains this approach more in-depth, so no reason to duplicate this information.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome points to consider based on your question:\r\n\r\n - Sometimes new data sources should be registered in runtime\r\n - Probably it worth to close connections and free up the resources both on your application side and RDBMS side by closing the data source upon some ttl if no-one uses it.\r\n - Since you&#39;ve mentioned spring boot, it might have an actuator health check that checks the database connectivity, so make sure it still answers the requirements. I mention this because if it will respond with non-200 code and you&#39;re running in some advanced environment that makes health-checks like this (like kubernetes, ecs and so forth), the microservice might not be considered healthy because of this, so your devops might be angry :)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/lookup/AbstractRoutingDataSource.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/lookup/AbstractRoutingDataSource.html#determineCurrentLookupKey--\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49759672/multi-tenancy-managing-multiple-datasources-with-spring-data-jpa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072631/how-to-connect-database-with-configuration-stored-in-main-database-at-run-time-i/58073364#58073364","title":"How to connect database with configuration stored in main database at run time in Spring Boot?"}],"owner":{"reputation":318,"user_id":2538699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yKmx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naveen Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2538699/naveen-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":318,"user_id":2538699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yKmx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naveen Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2538699/naveen-kumar"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58073364,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569301412,"creation_date":1569295279,"last_edit_date":1569297236,"question_id":58072631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58072631","body_markdown":"I have a requirement where I have one main DB which contains the configuration of different clients DB connections.

Select the option to add an existing item and in the file selection dialog box, rather than clicking the Add button, click the drop down arrow on it and select the Add as Link option (as shown below).\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot of Solution Explorer and add item dialog][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI think this is a possibility for your additional content.\r\n\r\nAs a next step you need to double click your e.g. `ContentLayout.content` file and edit the structure manually.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n**Additional Info quoted from Sandcastle Help File Builder Documentation:**\r\n\r\nIf you do not have Visual Studio, the only way to create linked items is by manually editing the project in a text editor. To do so, add a build item to an item group. This is done by adding an element named after the build action (i.e. Tokens for a token file). The Include attribute points to the relative path of the file which is typically outside of the current project&#39;s folder structure. Add a Link element nested within the build item and set its property value to the relative path of the item within the current help file builder project. For example:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Tokens Include=&quot;..\\SomeOtherProject\\Tokens\\SharedTokensFile.tokens&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;Link&gt;Tokens\\SharedTokens.tokens&lt;/Link&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Tokens&gt;\r\n\r\nThe example above creates a linked tokens file. Its physical location is one level up from the help file builder project folder in another project folder *(..\\SomeOtherProject\\Tokens)*. Its virtual location within the current project will be in a folder called .\\Tokens.\r\n\r\nLinked items will have a Remove option rather than a Delete option. This removes them from the project but leaves them on disk in their original location since they may belong to another project.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/nofhY.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3st9K.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Fe2V.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072601/is-there-any-way-to-import-an-external-project-or-topic-files-in-shfb/58104106#58104106","title":"Is there any way to import an external project or topic files in SHFB?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8834,"user_id":43534,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b36958661c789010d95b27325154828?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Miral","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/43534/miral"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569994568,"creation_date":1569994568,"answer_id":58195731,"question_id":58072601,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58195731","body_markdown":"Ok, there are a couple of tricks to get this to work as desired; thanks to [help-info.de&#39;s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58104106/43534) for inspiration on the `Link` elements.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in the common docs folder, create `CommonDoc.targets`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;Project xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003&quot; ToolsVersion=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n            &lt;Folder Include=&quot;common\\&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n        &lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n            &lt;ContentLayout Include=&quot;$(CommonContentDir)100-common.content&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Link&gt;common\\100-common.content&lt;/Link&gt;\r\n            &lt;/ContentLayout&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n        &lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n            &lt;None Include=&quot;$(CommonContentDir)performance.aml&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Link&gt;common\\performance.aml&lt;/Link&gt;\r\n            &lt;/None&gt;\r\n            &lt;None Include=&quot;$(CommonContentDir)security.aml&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Link&gt;common\\security.aml&lt;/Link&gt;\r\n            &lt;/None&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Project&gt;\r\n\r\nNext, edit the main shfbproj file and add the following below the existing `PropertyGroup` elements:\r\n\r\n    &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n        &lt;CommonContentDir&gt;..\\..\\Doc\\&lt;/CommonContentDir&gt;\r\n    &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is the relative path from the folder with the shfbproj to the common docs folder.\r\n\r\nAlso add the following just above the existing `Import` element:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Import Project=&quot;$(CommonContentDir)CommonDoc.targets&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd finally (this part you can do in the GUI), split the existing `.content` files up into multiple files such that anything you want to appear before the common content is named with a number lower than 100 and anything afterwards with a number higher than 100.  (Apparently multiple content files are sorted alphabetically before merging.)\r\n\r\n(You can use a different number for the common content if most of the content will normally be added before it, but for my case it was the other way around.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe `CommonContentDir` property is mildly annoying; I wanted to use `$(MSBuildThisProjectDir)`, but it appears that the SHFB build doesn&#39;t recognise this and tries to find the files in the main shfbproj&#39;s folder instead.\r\n\r\nAnother downside of this method is that when you want to add a new file to the common topics, you will have to edit the `CommonDoc.targets` file manually.  But once you do that, it will automatically appear in every help file that references that file, without having to update each shfbproj individually.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072601/is-there-any-way-to-import-an-external-project-or-topic-files-in-shfb/58195731#58195731","title":"Is there any way to import an external project or topic files in SHFB?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8834,"user_id":43534,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b36958661c789010d95b27325154828?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Miral","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/43534/miral"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4237,"user_id":1981088,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aWpj2.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"help-info.de","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1981088/help-info-de"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58195731,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569994568,"creation_date":1569295065,"last_edit_date":1569434342,"question_id":58072601,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58072601","body_markdown":"I want to produce a number of separate output CHM files (for separate libraries, so I have a separate `shfbproj` for each), but that have a number of conceptual topics in common.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to put the `.aml` files for these topics in one place and then import them into each of the projects, to avoid duplication.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I&#39;d like to have a common `.content` file in this central location as well, and import this as children of a specific parent topic node in the &quot;real&quot; project&#39;s `.content` file, to avoid duplicating that too.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to do this?

Here I am able to reproduce the problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072594/angular-appends-component-instead-of-replacing-whole-page-using-router-outlet","title":"Angular appends component instead of replacing whole page using router-outlet"},{"tags":["ssas","analysis","cube","dimensions","msbi"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1412,"user_id":1689226,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd71f9f43c5a587ef304196c5e667c3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Subbu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1689226/subbu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569318347,"post_id":58072593,"comment_id":102549484,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072593/dimension-is-not-getting-updated-when-deployed-after-renaming-the-dimensions-a#comment102549484_58072593"},{"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":10688863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87c65ad51f7156d0787ade9b443fe25b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ScriptSoft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10688863/scriptsoft"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1412,"user_id":1689226,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd71f9f43c5a587ef304196c5e667c3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Subbu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1689226/subbu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569380139,"post_id":58072593,"comment_id":102573977,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072593/dimension-is-not-getting-updated-when-deployed-after-renaming-the-dimensions-a#comment102573977_58072593"}],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":10688863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87c65ad51f7156d0787ade9b443fe25b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ScriptSoft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10688863/scriptsoft"},"last_editor":{"reputation":19,"user_id":10688863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87c65ad51f7156d0787ade9b443fe25b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ScriptSoft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10688863/scriptsoft"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569305222,"creation_date":1569294991,"last_edit_date":1569305222,"question_id":58072593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58072593","body_markdown":"I created 3 dimensions each with 3-5 attributes where one attribute having hierarchy. it worked perfectly.\r\n\r\nBut client came up with requirement that they want to rename  (let&#39;s say adding suffix as &#39;Structure&#39; making new name &#39;XYZ - Structure&#39;) all 3 dimensions and for attributes which has hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI renamed all 3 dimensions, respective attributes, taken care of relationship under dimensions usages, also renamed wherever it was defined under calculation tab, added into correct perspectives.\r\n\r\nAnd I also changed ID of dimensions ( right click--view code--replace old ID with current name) and then added DB dimension as cube dimension in the cube designer.\r\n\r\nbuilt successfully, deployed and processed.

better to use **singleton design pattern** rather than every time create an object of the same class. `Singleton design pattern` restricts the `instantiation` of a class to one `single instance`.\r\n\r\nYou can create a **singleton class** for **SharedPreference** and then you can access it from any `activity` or `fragment` you want.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class SharedPrefManager{\r\n  private static SessionManager jInstance;\r\n  private final SharedPreferences prefs;\r\n  private final SharedPreferences.Editor editor;\r\n\r\n  // private constructor to force use of \r\n  // getInstance() to create Singleton object \r\n  private SharedPrefManager(Context context) {\r\n      prefs = context.getSharedPreferences(&quot;Your_Preference_name&quot;, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);\r\n      editor = prefs.edit();\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // create the instance when it is accessed for the first time\r\n  public static synchronized SharedPrefManager getInstance(Context context) {\r\n      if (jInstance != null) {\r\n          return jInstance;\r\n      } else {\r\n          jInstance = new SharedPrefManager(context);\r\n          return

only 2 ways of finding out if a value&#39;s type has a indexer is to:\r\n\r\n1) Check if the `value is IList list` and then just do `return list[index]` if it is.\r\n\r\n2) Find a indexer via reflection, sins a type doesn&#39;t need to implement the `IList` interface to have one.\r\n\r\nLets take this class as a example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass IndexerClass\r\n{\r\n    public object this[int index]\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            return (index + 1);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    internal string this[bool index]\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            return index.ToString();\r\n        }  \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private int this[IList&lt;int&gt; list, bool defValueIfNone]\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            if ((list == null) || (list.Count == 0))\r\n            {\r\n                if (defValueIfNone)\r\n                {\r\n                    return 0;\r\n                }\r\n                throw new ArgumentException(&quot;Invalid list&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            return list[0];\r\n        }\r\n    }     \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe name which is used for indexers is `Item`, note that if a class has a indexer(s) it can&#39;t have a property named `Item` as it would conflict with them.\r\n\r\nTo find the indexer which accepts the `int index`, the only foolproof way of doing so is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar instance = new IndexerClass();\r\n\r\nvar type = typeof(IndexerClass); //sins you get a value just do: value.GetType();\r\n\r\nvar props = type.GetProperties(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.NonPublic);\r\n\r\nif (props.Length &gt; 0)\r\n{\r\n    foreach (var prop in props)\r\n    {\r\n        if (prop.Name == &quot;Item&quot;)\r\n        {\r\n            var i_param = prop.GetIndexParameters();\r\n\r\n            if (i_param.Length == 1)\r\n            {\r\n                if (i_param[0].ParameterType == typeof(int)) //you can also add `||` and check if the ParameterType is equal to typeof sbyte, byte, short, ushort, uint, long, ulong, float or double.\r\n                {\r\n                    return prop.GetValue(instance, new object[] { 0 });\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nreturn null;\r\n```

can do it with reflection.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of accessing a class with two indexers with different types of key, if you are always sure what type of indexer you have, it will be a bit less complicated. But I think it is worth noting that a class with multiple indexers or an indexer with multiple keys is possible.\r\n\r\n    public class IndexedClass\r\n    {\r\n        public string SomeProperty { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public int[] SomeArray { get; set; } = new int[] { 3, 4, 5 };\r\n        \r\n        Hashtable _items = new Hashtable();\r\n        public object this[object key]\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;object key&quot;);\r\n                return _items[key];\r\n            }\r\n            set\r\n            {\r\n                _items[key] = value;\r\n\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public object this[int key]\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;int key&quot;);\r\n                return _items[key];\r\n            }\r\n            set\r\n            {\r\n                _items[key] = value;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\naccessing the indexer normally:\r\n\r\n    IndexedClass ic = new IndexedClass();\r\n    ic[&quot;some string&quot;] = &quot;some string value&quot;;\r\n    Console.WriteLine(ic[&quot;some string&quot;]);\r\n    ic[1] = 10;\r\n    Console.WriteLine(ic[1]);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(ic[2]==null);\r\n\r\nchoosing and accessing the correct indexer via reflection:\r\n\r\n    object index = 1;\r\n    object myIndexedObject = ic;\r\n\r\n    Type myIndexType = index.GetType();\r\n    var myIndexerProperty = myIndexedObject.GetType().GetProperties().FirstOrDefault(a =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        var p = a.GetIndexParameters();    \r\n        \r\n        // this will choose the indexer with 1 key \r\n        // &lt;&lt;public object this[int key]&gt;&gt;, \r\n        // - of the EXACT type:\r\n        return p.Length == 1 \r\n            &amp;&amp; p.FirstOrDefault(b =&gt; b.ParameterType == myIndexType) != null;\r\n\r\n        // notice that if you call the code below instead,\r\n        // then the &lt;&lt;public object this[object key]&gt;&gt; indexer \r\n        // will be chosen instead, as it is first in the class,\r\n        // and an &lt;&lt;int&gt;&gt; is an &lt;&lt;object&gt;&gt;\r\n\r\n        //return p.Length == 1 \r\n        //    &amp;&amp; p.FirstOrDefault(b =&gt; b.ParameterType.IsAssignableFrom(myIndexType)) != null;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    if (myIndexerProperty != null)\r\n    {\r\n        object myValue = myIndexerProperty\r\n            .GetValue(myIndexedObject, new object[] { index });\r\n\r\n        Console.WriteLine(myValue);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you always have only one indexer with one key, you could do this instead to get your indexer, as the default name of an indexer property is `&quot;Item&quot;`:\r\n\r\n    var myIndexerProperty = myIndexedObject.GetType().GetProperty(&quot;Item&quot;);\r\n\r\nBeware though that theoretically there could be classes with a property called `Item` that is not an indexer, so you should check if `myIndexerProperty.GetIndexParameters().Length == 1` anyway.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072538/access-the-indexer-of-an-unknown-object-type/58077117#58077117","title":"Access the indexer of an unknown object

I&#39;d discourage using a model like that though, [counts generally want to be &quot;log transformed&quot;](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/08/21/you-should-usually-log-transform-your-positive-data/) and you&#39;d want to do lots of plots of your data using something like `matplotlib` maybe via `seaborn`\r\n\r\nhope that helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072536/how-to-web-scape-table-data-using-selenium-python-for-linear-regression/58085524#58085524","title":"How to web scape table data using selenium/python for linear regression?"}],"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":10244126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/85t0J.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Able Archer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10244126/able-archer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":124,"user_id":10244126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/85t0J.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Able Archer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10244126/able-archer"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58085524,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569346338,"creation_date":1569294301,"last_edit_date":1569294815,"question_id":58072536,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58072536","body_markdown":"Here is my code to scrape the table:\r\n \r\n\r\n    from selenium import webdriver \r\n        driver=webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\Administrator\\\\Downloads\\\\chromedriver_win32\\\\chromedriver.exe&quot;)\r\n        driver.get(&quot;https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2019-standard-pitching.shtml&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        table = driver.find_element_by_xpath(&#39;//*[@id=&quot;all_players_standard_pitching&quot;]/div[3]&#39;).text\r\n        print(table)\r\n        \r\n        driver.close()\r\n\r\nI would like to parse the player&#39;s NAME, their WIN total, and their STRIKEOUT total (Name, W, SO).\r\n\r\nI would like to use this info to run a linear regression to find out how much the variable Strikeouts influences a Pitcher&#39;s WINS.\r\n\r\nMy regression is Wins = B0 + SO(X)\r\n\r\nI have never run a regression using Python before.

So this has always worked, and I only see them change to **green** (the animation) when I update the reference to the property.\r\n\r\nNow, I am wondering if I am doing too much, (ie all this checking), and if Angular can actually do most of this for my. Also, I am considering starting to use `ngrx`, where the pattern is normally t change the whole reference to the list on any updates, and let Angular work out the DOM updates.\r\n\r\nTo test now I update the  `public data: Array&lt;T&gt;;` **reference**. Initially I could see (via the UI and via dev tools) that when I did this, the whole list DOM was being regenerated.\r\n\r\n    this.data = newState; // now replace reference\r\n\r\nI then found I could add a trackBy to do the comparisons... ie\r\n\r\n    &lt;div *ngFor=&quot;let item of daya;trackBy: trackByFunction&quot; \r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\n    public trackByFunction(index: number, item: MyItem) {\r\n      if (!item)\r\n        return null;\r\n    \r\n      return item.prop1.code;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nie `prop1` is the id of the whole item.\r\n\r\nNow, from what I could see, the items where no longer being replaced in the DOM, exactly what I was after - so Angular is doing the compare and determining the data data was the same, so not updating the main items.\r\n\r\nHowever, I DID still see the property animations firing, so I am assuming these &quot;child&quot; DOM elements wee still being replaced.\r\n\r\nFinally! \r\n\r\nMy question is, is there a way to also use some sort of &quot;trackBy&quot; for these &quot;child&quot; properties, so Angular knows they have the same values, and so does not update the DOM (and hence the animations do not fire)?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072461/angular-ngfor-how-to-stop-dom-updating-when-item-properties-have-new-references","title":"Angular ngFor: How to stop DOM updating when item properties have new references that have the same values"},{"tags":["haskell"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":940,"user_id":2956272,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fd2f2f3d934105cca1f8237cc3d6f11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dyukha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2956272/dyukha"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569293957,"post_id":58072458,"comment_id":102540294,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072458/finding-third-to-last-element-in-haskell#comment102540294_58072458"},{"owner":{"reputation":90,"user_id":10412159,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7782a6cbe4dca019ebe564903960341a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"larn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10412159/larn"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":940,"user_id":2956272,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fd2f2f3d934105cca1f8237cc3d6f11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dyukha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2956272/dyukha"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569294516,"post_id":58072458,"comment_id":102540377,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072458/finding-third-to-last-element-in-haskell#comment102540377_58072458"},{"owner":{"reputation":940,"user_id":2956272,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fd2f2f3d934105cca1f8237cc3d6f11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dyukha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2956272/dyukha"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569295711,"post_id":58072458,"comment_id":102540565,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072458/finding-third-to-last-element-in-haskell#comment102540565_58072458"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13030,"user_id":7128034,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T8aRg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dami&#225;n Rafael Lattenero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128034/dami%c3%a1n-rafael-lattenero"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13030,"user_id":7128034,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T8aRg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dami&#225;n Rafael Lattenero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128034/dami%c3%a1n-rafael-lattenero"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569307493,"last_edit_date":1569307493,"creation_date":1569295747,"answer_id":58072692,"question_id":58072458,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58072692","body_markdown":"You were somewhere close, but if you want to do it with pattern matching, make the patter with three elements, and in the recursion part, remove from the back:\r\n\r\n    msg = &quot;The list is empty.

It has the problem, though, that if you want some number other than 3rd-last, you have to rewrite your function; and furthermore the number of cases you write corresponds to how far from the back of the list you want to go. Imagine using this technique for the 100th-last element! It also does a lot of unnecessary work: once you make it past the first set of guards, you know they will never match again; but you&#39;re still constantly having to check &quot;Hey, is the rest of the list empty? Does it have one element? What about two?&quot; So as I say, a good solution for a beginner, but not ideal.\r\n\r\nduyue&#39;s answer addresses these problems, but at the cost of traversing the list twice: once to find its length, and then again to look up the right index. Very simple and clear, but problematic if the list is too large to hold in memory all at once.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if we could somehow traverse the list just once, keeping in mind at all times the element we saw three steps ago; then when the list ends we can just return the right element. An intermediate solution might be to write this recursion by hand:\r\n\r\n    antepenultimate [] = undefined\r\n    antepenultimate [_] = undefined\r\n    antepenultimate [_,_] = undefined\r\n    antepenultimate (a:b:c:xs) = go a b c xs\r\n      where go a _ _ [] = a\r\n            go a b c (x:xs) = go b c x xs\r\n\r\nA somewhat more advanced solution uses the well-known technique of zipping a list with an offset version of itself to have access to two items at once:\r\n\r\n    antepenultimate xs = last $ zipWith const xs (drop 2 xs)\r\n\r\nFinally, someone even more familiar with Haskell might recognize the `zipWith const xs (drop 2 xs)` pattern as being amenable to Applicative style, yielding:\r\n\r\n    antepenultimate = last . (zipWith const &lt;*&gt; drop 2)\r\n\r\nSome people will argue this is less readable than the previous version; I have no strong opinions on that, but I do think it is the most elegant/advanced even if another approach is more readable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072458/finding-third-to-last-element-in-haskell/58086935#58086935","title":"Finding third to last element in Haskell?"}],"owner":{"reputation":90,"user_id":10412159,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7782a6cbe4dca019ebe564903960341a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"larn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10412159/larn"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":82,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569480307,"creation_date":1569293660,"question_id":58072458,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58072458","body_markdown":"I am currently learning Haskell, but I am having some trouble figuring out how to tackle this problem.
