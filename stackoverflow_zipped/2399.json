build script loads everything correctly. The module that you&#39;re trying to load no longer exists. You&#39;re trying to use an old version of the Real World OCaml book together with a very new version of OCaml and Core. The Janestreet Core library has changed a lot since those times. You should either switch to a newer book or downgrade to an older version of OCaml and Core library.\r\n\r\n## Using modern Core\r\n\r\nSince the admission of Dune and module aliases, it is no longer needed to have an extra `Std` submodule, therefore Janestreet removed it (after a two-year-long deprecation). Therefore, now we&#39;re writing \r\n\r\n    open Core\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n  \r\n    open Core.Std (* no longer works *)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same is true with `Core_kernel` et alas.\r\n\r\nSince OCaml and Janesteet have moved since that time a lot, the [newer version][1] of RWO was created with updated examples. It is still a work in progress but looks quite close to be ready. So you can switch to it.\r\n\r\n# Sticking to older versions of OCaml\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use the first version of Real World OCaml, then you have to choose a version of OCaml and Janesteet&#39;s Core library which are known to be compatible. I failed to find any authoritative recommendations on which version it is better to use with the old book. So I would suggest using OCaml 4.02.3. Then you can install core as usual with `opam install core` (it should install version 113.33.03), and as far as I remember, it should work with the old book. If you or anyone else is having problems with this version please tell me in the comments section, and I will update this recommendation. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://dev.realworldocaml.org/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966719/ocaml-corebuild-cannot-link-to-core-std/57974060#57974060","title":"OCaml corebuild cannot link to Core.Std"}],"owner":{"reputation":628,"user_id":2779792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHE8l.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew James Briggs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2779792/matthew-james-briggs"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57974060,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568723426,"creation_date":1568688699,"question_id":57966719,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57966719","body_markdown":"\r\nMy problem is similar to [this][1], however, in my case `.ocamlinit` is set.\r\n\r\nHere is my ocaml version.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmymac:Desktop myusr$ ocaml --version\r\nThe OCaml toplevel, version 4.08.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my opam version.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmymac:Desktop myusr$ opam --version\r\n2.0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my opam switch.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmymac:Desktop myusr$ opam switch\r\n#  switch   compiler                    description\r\n→  4.08.1   ocaml-base-compiler.4.08.1  4.08.1\r\n   default  ocaml-base-compiler.4.08.1  default\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my `.ocamlinit`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmymac:Desktop myusr$ cat ~/.ocamlinit\r\n(* ## added by OPAM user-setup for ocamltop / base ## 3ec62baf6f9c219ae06d9814069da862 ## you can edit, but keep this line *)\r\n#use &quot;topfind&quot;;;\r\n(* ## end of OPAM user-setup addition for ocamltop / base ## keep this line *)\r\n#thread;;\r\n#require &quot;core.top&quot;;;\r\n#require &quot;core.syntax&quot;;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the evidence that I already have core installed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmymac:Desktop myusr$ opam install core utop\r\n[NOTE] Package utop is already installed (current version is 2.4.1).\r\n[NOTE] Package core is already installed (current version is v0.12.3).\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the `sum.ml` file from *Real World OCaml*: \r\n\r\n```ocaml\r\nopen Core.Std\r\n\r\nlet rev read_and_accumulate accum =\r\n      let line = In_channel.input_line In_channel.stdin in\r\n      match line with\r\n      | None -&gt; accum\r\n      | Some x -&gt; read_and_accumulate (accum +.

for pinging me over on the GitHub site for [Finbuckle.MultiTenant][1].\r\n\r\nThe reason the tenant information is lost is because the Redirect to Action redirects the user browser so its like an entirely new HTTP request which basically resets everything. The second approach you posts doesn&#39;t actually redirect the user browser so it doesn&#39;t lose the info. Finbuckle.MultiTenant should work with either approach--I&#39;ll try to clarify how it works below.\r\n\r\nIt looks like you are setting the tenant info yourself, but while this is possible it is not the intended flow. The library was designed so that its middleware would use a strategy, query the store, and set the tenant info before your controller code is ever hit. It would look something like this (where `WithStrategy` and `WithStore` are simplified for this example):\r\n\r\n```\r\n// In your services configuration in your Startup class:\r\nservices.AddMultiTenant().WithStrategy().WithStore();\r\n\r\n// In your app pipeline in your Startup class:\r\napp.UseMultiTenant(); // &lt;-- This sets the tenant info\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in normal situations you don&#39;t need to call `store.TryGetByIdentifierAsync(...)` or `HttpContext.SetTenantInfo(...)`.\r\n\r\nInstead you want to define a strategy that gets the organization ID from the cookie like you did. The middleware will use the strategy at the start of every request to set the tenant info. There is a `DelegateStrategy` that should work for your situation.

(In practice you could use [FFMPeg or something similar to split the MP4 into 1 second chunks][1])\r\n\r\nThen we form our RTP header, we set the Payload Type to something custom, as [there&#39;s no payload type for MP4 data assigned by IANA.][2] We&#39;d assign a starting sequence number, a Synchronization Source Identifier and a timestamp, and then we&#39;d fill the payload with the first 1 second of data.\r\n\r\n1 second after that we&#39;d increment the sequence number by 1, add 1 second to the timestamp, add the next 1 second of data to the payload and send the next RTP header.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;d then repeat this 8 more times until we&#39;ve sent 10 RTP packets containing our 10x 1 second MP4 payloads.\r\n\r\nIf you actually wanted to go about implementing this I wrote this [simple Python Library for creating RTP packets][3],\r\n\r\nTo learn more about RTP there&#39;s [obviously RFC 3550][4], for a really in depth look at RTP there&#39;s a [great book by Colin Perkins called &quot;RTP: Audio and Video for the Internet&quot;][5] and [I&#39;ve written a bit about all the RTP headers and their meaning.][6]\r\n\r\nIn practice if you want to get a pre-recorded MP4 file from point A to point B there&#39;s better protocols for it than RTP, RTP is focused on the *real time* transfer of media, as in live-streaming style, not transferring existing pre-recorded media files, FTP, HTTP or even some of the peer-to-peer protocols would be better suited at transferring this.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I already added internet permission to Androidmanifest.xml\r\n \r\nThe result appears nothing but it is supposed to get an entire JSON object. \r\n\r\nit says &quot;java.net.UnknownHostException: Unable to resolve host “api.github.com”: No address associated with hostname&quot; in the onFailure","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966668/okhttp-java-net-unknownhostexception-unable-to-resolve-host-api-github-com","title":"Okhttp java.net.UnknownHostException: Unable to resolve host “api.github.com”:"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6679,"user_id":548562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26587173d9156d8ec3114c8700d1b693?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Iain Shelvington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/548562/iain-shelvington"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568688310,"post_id":57966662,"comment_id":102344037,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966662/how-to-get-the-caller-script-full-path-in-python#comment102344037_57966662"},{"owner":{"reputation":28236,"user_id":24718,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0kiYe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"monkut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/24718/monkut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568688748,"post_id":57966662,"comment_id":102344112,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966662/how-to-get-the-caller-script-full-path-in-python#comment102344112_57966662"},{"owner":{"reputation":47918,"user_id":1467082,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPeMR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Zemens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1467082/david-zemens"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568688800,"post_id":57966662,"comment_id":102344127,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966662/how-to-get-the-caller-script-full-path-in-python#comment102344127_57966662"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":96,"user_id":5120812,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":22,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/869897239754598/picture?type=large","display_name":"Feiiiiiiiiiiiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5120812/feiiiiiiiiiiiii"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568725598,"post_id":57966807,"comment_id":102359436,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966662/how-to-get-the-caller-script-full-path-in-python/57966807#comment102359436_57966807"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6679,"user_id":548562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26587173d9156d8ec3114c8700d1b693?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Iain Shelvington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/548562/iain-shelvington"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568689544,"creation_date":1568689544,"answer_id":57966807,"question_id":57966662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57966807","body_markdown":"A very simplified version of what happens (for the CPython interpreter):\r\n\r\nEvery time a method is called in Python a &quot;frame&quot; is added to the stack, after a method returns something the interpreter pops the last frame from the stack and continues execution of the previous frame with the return value injected in place of the method call\r\n\r\nTo get the previous frame you can call [`sys._getframe(1)`][1] (0 would get the current frame, 1 gets the previous frame).

don&#39;t know what your code looks like that handles the terms/cookie setting, but ideally, you should trigger something for Launch to listen to, whenever the visitor accepts. \r\n\r\nFor example, whenever the visitor accepts the terms, add the following to your code at the appropriate place (e.g. the code that actually sets the cookie, if the cookie value is to allow)\r\n\r\n`_satellite.track(&quot;pageview_gdpr_accepted&quot;);` \r\n\r\nThen in Launch, create a rule of `Event Type` **Direct Call** :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can create and broadcast a javascript [custom event][2], e.g. \r\n\r\n    var event = new Event(&quot;pageview_gdpr_accepted&quot;);\r\n    document.body.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n\r\nYou should have this execute same as before (e.g. when the cookie with good value is set), and then in Launch, create a rule of `Event Type` **Custom Event**:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you go the **Custom Event** route, make sure you create/trigger on `document.body` or a decendant; Launch will not listen for custom events on `document` itself.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to add code to your site to explicitly trigger A **Direct Call** or **Custom Event** rule, another alternative is to create a **Data Element** that references the `sat_track` cookie: \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nThen make a rule of `Event Type` **Data Element Change**:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description

(I know you called it `K`, but the convention is that `K` and `P` are used for key types, whereas `T` and `U` are used for more general types... and since you&#39;re not constraining it to key types to something like `string | number | symbol` I will change the name.)\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n    const asFilterCustomSchemaField = &lt;T&gt;() =&gt; &lt;U&gt;(\r\n      x: FilterCustomSchemaField&lt;T, U&gt;\r\n    ) =&gt; x;\r\n    \r\nAnd here&#39;s how it&#39;s used:\r\n\r\n    const filterCustomSchemaField = asFilterCustomSchemaField&lt;MainType&gt;()({\r\n      type: &quot;custom&quot;,\r\n      source: () =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4], \r\n      filters: [\r\n        {\r\n          text: &quot;Is in one of&quot;,\r\n          value: &quot;iiof&quot;,\r\n          action: (v, k) =&gt; true // v is inferred as MainType, k as number[]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          text: &quot;Is not in one of&quot;,\r\n          value: &quot;!iiof&quot;,\r\n          action: (v, k) =&gt; true // v is inferred as MainType, k as number[]\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    });\r\n    // const filterCustomSchemaField: FilterCustomSchemaField&lt;MainType, number&gt;\r\n\r\nNote how the value is of type `FilterCustomSchemaFiled&lt;MainType, number&gt;` as desired, where `number` is just inferred from the value, and `MainType` is specified.  If you use IntelliSense and hover over `v` and `k` in the `action` properties, you will see they are inferred as `MainType` and `number[]` respectively, also as desired.\r\n\r\nOkay, hope that helps; good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play//#code/KYDwDg9gTgLgBDAnmYcBiBLANjYUDCArgM4wQC2AkuWFgDwAqANHAKoB8cAvHAN4BQcBKBgAuOKSgYAdgHMA3ILgA3AIZZCwcZJkKlqgMYwMEaeIAUy8cwnjWAbQC6ASm6cARhAhZgq6YoBfRX5QSFgEZFRMHDwiUgoAZQMAC2ByVUxgLAATRhZWbjg-RE4eASEkFHEAIgMSMnJqxSFsjGJaVUQAfm0YKTlmiQhCKAMtOHNXLk4HR0GAM2xcKGJxaOW4hupaPLZ2J0Dg0Oh4SqilvCTU9MycxlL0C4J6xJS0jIws3IZ2I-ATiIoR4xKBXd63bLEe6FXhwewybKgXr9WSONZPME3T53H5wIL8EL-cJnYHLTGqaFlJSI+aqQg4ADSwEQyN0C2xkPRIPJEKhP0OBJJAFlVDIGJEYXAQKy5HjggZTKQisR1rEXuQeRzCvdJm44HQOOYlNLSWr4hq3livrsOPwppwQPLFfBFiDNq9rh8voVVCqnu6LZ6IXQRWLIuxJuZyoDxrV1dUmEpiMNRuNddM4QBGFgAJhYAGYWAAWRwsJSu5arOFKITRoQVEQ1SjEOAyOCmVAQeYJmv1tQaWMYEzdxP1+uGYymCzKFgAa3tCCgmjgAHoVypWy2ZPM8FBgNllXBQ9JxSg54fpIRyO48E5ewFR-W6-XcCAxHBqs24NIIPA2x32xHXshH7TQagAQiHLsezHIQJxMMwJhnOB5z1PplzXDc2lbaQdygPcD19I9RRPSJzyIy9r1vRx7yUGiAmcRRMIVaQlQrM0Gk1L4uQ2dUuLuY9T2AFhKJvKB2H4IA)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966605/can-i-get-a-generic-type-from-an-implementation-of-a-property/57976485#57976485","title":"Can I get a generic type from an implementation of a property?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3754,"user_id":845704,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EtypH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James Hay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/845704/james-hay"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57976485,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568730515,"creation_date":1568687612,"question_id":57966605,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57966605","body_markdown":"I have the following object (for testing only):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      type: &#39;custom&#39;,\r\n      source: (): number[] =&gt; { return [1,2,3,4] },\r\n      filters: [\r\n        {\r\n          text: &#39;Is in one of&#39;,\r\n          value: &#39;iiof&#39;,\r\n          action: (v: MainType, k: number[]) =&gt; true\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          text: &#39;Is not in one of&#39;,\r\n          value: &#39;!iiof&#39;,\r\n          action: (v: MainType, k: number[]) =&gt; true\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd I&#39;m trying to build the types, so that the second parameter of any `filter.action` function, will be the return type of `source`. I can use `any`, but would prefer to have this typed if possible.\r\n\r\nMy current types are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    export type FilterCustomImpl&lt;T, K&gt; = {\r\n      text: string;\r\n      value: string;\r\n      action: (v: T, s: K[]) =&gt; boolean;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    export type FilterCustomSchemaField&lt;T, K = any&gt; = {\r\n      type: &#39;custom&#39;,\r\n      display?: string;\r\n      source: () =&gt; K[];\r\n      filters: FilterCustomImpl&lt;T, K&gt;[]\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    export type FilterSchemaField&lt;T&gt; = \r\n        FilterEnumSchemaField | \r\n        FilterNumericSchemaField | \r\n        FilterStringSchemaField | \r\n        FilterCustomSchemaField&lt;T&gt;;\r\n    \r\n    export type FilterSchemaFields&lt;T&gt; = { [index: string]: FilterSchemaField&lt;T&gt; };\r\n    \r\n    export type FilterSchema&lt;T&gt; = {\r\n      defaultKey: string;\r\n      fields: FilterSchemaFields&lt;T&gt;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\nSo the parent `FilterSchema` could have an infinite number of `FilterCustomSchemaField`s with different `K` types. \r\n\r\nCurrently when building the filter schema I can get around it by specifying the type on the field itself, so\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      type: &#39;custom&#39;,\r\n      source: (): number[] =&gt; { return [1,2,3,4] },\r\n      filters: [\r\n        {\r\n          text: &#39;Is in one of&#39;,\r\n          value: &#39;iiof&#39;,\r\n          action: (v: MainType, k: number[]) =&gt; true\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          text: &#39;Is not in one of&#39;,\r\n          value: &#39;!iiof&#39;,\r\n          action: (v: MainType, k: number[]) =&gt; true\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    } as FilterCustomSchemaField&lt;MainType, number&gt;\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not a great approach because it obviously requires extra typing, and has to rewrite the main `T` type each time.\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal if I could infer the `K` type from the return type of the `source` function, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s possible.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966605/can-i-get-a-generic-type-from-an-implementation-of-a-property","title":"Can I get a generic type

This is what I got so far, but it&#39;s not working:\r\n\r\n    function quadmin(f,[x1 x2 x3],epsilon,M)\r\n       disp(x1), disp(x2), disp(x3)\r\n\r\n       disp(f(x1))\r\n\r\n      !Determining the minimal value among the three points:\r\n\r\n      if f(x1)&lt;f(x2)&lt;f(x3)\r\n  \r\n          xs=x1\r\n    \r\n      else if f(x2)&lt;f(x1)&lt;f(x3)\r\n  \r\n          xs=x2\r\n    \r\n     else\r\n  \r\n         xs=x3\r\n    \r\n     endif\r\n\r\n\r\n     disp(f(xs))\r\n\r\n  \r\n    endfunction\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, after determining the smallest value, I still don&#39;t know which subinterval to consider in next iteration, that is, the NEXT three points\r\nx1, x2, x3 that will form the interval for the next iteration.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please give me a hand in this?\r\nThank you very much!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966596/how-to-write-and-call-a-code-that-minimizes-a-given-function-in-octave","title":"How to write and call a code that minimizes a given function in Octave?"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","data-structures"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":552699,"user_id":139985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/147c5a9cc1feec049c50da791ac7d144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/139985/stephen-c"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568688488,"post_id":57966594,"comment_id":102344073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966594/allocate-and-deallocate-number-for-a-particular-key#comment102344073_57966594"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18214,"user_id":3705127,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b03aedaddfa4dc1c2b331f318a724ec7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sprinter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3705127/sprinter"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568688722,"creation_date":1568688722,"answer_id":57966724,"question_id":57966594,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57966724","body_markdown":"A better approach would be to store the next number and a deallocated list for each key:\r\n\r\n    public class Allocator {\r\n        private final Map&lt;String,Value&gt; values = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        private class Value {\r\n            private int nextValue = 0;\r\n            private List&lt;Integer&gt; deallocatedValues = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n            public int allocate() {\r\n                if (deallocatedValues.isEmpty()) {\r\n                    return nextValue++;\r\n                else\r\n                    return deallocatedValues.remove();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public void deallocate(int value) {\r\n                assert value &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; value &lt; nextValue;\r\n                assert !deallocatedValues.contains(value);\r\n                deallocatedValues.add(value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public int allocate(String key) {\r\n            return values.computeIfAbsent(key, k -&gt; new Value()).allocate();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void deallocate(String key, int value) {\r\n            assert values.containsKey(key);\r\n            values.get(key).deallocate(value);\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966594/allocate-and-deallocate-number-for-a-particular-key/57966724#57966724","title":"allocate and deallocate number for a particular key"}],"owner":{"reputation":2454,"user_id":2809564,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dbbaaa9c03d7a256eef869bf1d635e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"john","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2809564/john"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568688722,"creation_date":1568687516,"question_id":57966594,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57966594","body_markdown":"I am working on below interview question:\r\n\r\nThere is a class `Allocator` in which I have two methods `allocate` and `deallocate`\r\n\r\n    class Allocator {\r\n        int allocate(String key);\r\n        boolean deallocate(String key, int number); \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n- `allocate` method will allocate number starting with `0` to a particular key. if we allocate same key again then increment the last number used.\r\n- `deallocate` method will deallocate that number for that particular key.

specifically, in this case, EF-Core would have accepted `_Bar`, `_bar`, `m_Bar`, or `m_bar` - but not `bar_`.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re amenable to changing library, you could *try* using protobuf-net; [`protogen`](https://protogen.marcgravell.com/) (protobuf-net&#39;s equivalent to `protoc`) generates:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\n    [global::ProtoBuf.ProtoMember(1, Name = @&quot;bar&quot;)]\r\n    public global::System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt;

Most ORMs and serializers understand the Roslyn patterns.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you&#39;ll need to look at the later parts of the documentation above, which describes ways of explicitly configuring the name of the backing field.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966591/protobuf-c-generated-class-usage-with-entity-framework-repeated-fields-not-sett/57986636#57986636","title":"Protobuf C# Generated Class usage with Entity Framework Repeated Fields not settable"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10942767,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N9LcReQnM14/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbVlztrTtEx2IfRHAt3U8ecqYiNBA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Callum","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10942767/callum"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10942767,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N9LcReQnM14/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbVlztrTtEx2IfRHAt3U8ecqYiNBA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Callum","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10942767/callum"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568789406,"creation_date":1568687468,"last_edit_date":1568772544,"question_id":57966591,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57966591","body_markdown":"I am having some issues integrating some Protobuf message generated C# classes with Entity Framework Core. I am able to use the protobuf generated classes in most cases to store information correctly into both sqlite and mysql databases. The issue comes when the protobuf message uses a repeated variable. I am able to store the repeated field into the database by serialising to a list of strings but when trying to read back from the database I get this error.\r\n\r\n    Unhandled Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: No backing field could be found for property &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; of entity type &#39;&lt;entityname&gt;&#39; and the property does not have a setter.\r\n\r\nFrom searching it seems that a design decision was made that when generating the protobuf class that repeated fields should not have a setter method only a get and this is causing issues when the Entity framework based functions are trying to write the parsed result back into the repeated field variable.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone has any ideas of potential ways to work around this issue of not having a setter within the Entity Framework or if there is a better way to achieve this type of functionality of storing Protobuf generated messages into databases.\r\n\r\nFor reference I have the entity property setup like this currently:\r\n\r\n    entity.Property(e =&gt; e.StationTypes)\r\n       .HasConversion(\r\n          types =&gt; types.ToString(),\r\n          column =&gt; ConvertToRepeatedField(column)\r\n       );\r\n\r\nWhere the data is written as a JSON style string into the database and then Converted back into a repeated field using the custom conversions.\r\n\r\nThanks For any help in advance.\r\n\r\nEdit: Currently using the Google.Protobuf (3.6.1)

appreciate your suggestion on using count for looping through the creation of multiple resources, I&#39;m familiar with count and it&#39;s useful...\r\n\r\nHowever as i stated in my initial post, I was getting an error message surrounding creds. I&#39;ve resolved the issue. I discovered by changing VS Code from PowerShell to PowerShell Integrated Console that loading your env variables there will allow you to use a module like the one I have posted. No clue why the first drop down doesn&#39;t work for multiple resources. \r\n\r\nShould anyone run into this issue just make certain you select the second PowerShell environment in the VS Code terminal drop down when you set your environment variables.

I&#39;ve tried adding them directly under the provider in addition to the environment variables, no dice.\r\n\r\nMy calling module looks like this and is in a folder by itself:\r\n```\r\n        module &quot;foo&quot; {\r\n            source   = &quot;../.&quot;\r\n            location = &quot;westus&quot;\r\n            prefix   = &quot;skachar&quot;\r\n        }\r\n        module &quot;bar&quot; {\r\n            source   = &quot;../.&quot;\r\n            prefix   = &quot;skachar2&quot;\r\n            location = &quot;eastus&quot;\r\n        }   \r\n```\r\nThe below code I added as requested by someone in the comment section. Its my main.tf file that resides in the folder below where my module is located. I&#39;m going to add my variable.tf file as well just for the sake of being thorough. It&#39;ll be down below the main.tf file which is the code you see right below this paragraph. I&#39;d really like to figure out why the second VM bombs out. I&#39;m providing it a unique prefix and the error message just doesn&#39;t make any sense. If there was no credentials then the first VM wouldn&#39;t provision. Anywho, if someone could point me in the right direction, perhaps there is some documentation I&#39;m missing somewhere.

`ViewModel`.\r\n\r\n#ViewModel\r\n```java\r\npublic class LoginViewModel extends AndroidViewModel {\r\n    ...\r\n    private MutableLiveData&lt;String&gt; _email = new MutableLiveData&lt;&gt;(); //

Instead we had parameters like window_size and window_offset. The way the methods were implemented, the execution date of Task Sensor was same as the actual execution date (which is not the default). That means if the DAG containing the TaskSensor triggered at 9/17 2 AM, the execution date of the sensor was set to 9/17 2 AM. However the execution date of the external task was set to previous execution date (which is the default Lakitu behaviour) i.e. if the external task runs at 9/17 4 AM then the execution date is set to 9/16 10 PM (which is the previous execution date). I had to define my window_size and window_offset parameters such that the execution date of the external task falls in the window calculated using the return_start_end_time function (where execution date refers to the execution date of the TaskSensor).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966490/create-an-airflow-externaltasksensor-for-a-specific-run-of-an-external-task-that/57996561#57996561","title":"Create an Airflow ExternalTaskSensor for a specific run of an external Task that runs multiple times in a day"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":10812096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/044db5cdf06b2b55d0a461ed7df4cb60?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vijayjain024","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10812096/vijayjain024"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568821679,"creation_date":1568686325,"question_id":57966490,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57966490","body_markdown":"I am trying to create an External Sensor (in DAG B) on a task in a different DAG (let&#39;s call this as DAG A) which runs at following intervals: &#39;schedule_interval&#39;: &#39;0 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22 * * *&#39;.\r\nDAG B is scheduled to run at 2AM daily.

I cannot think of any good reason for this. Complex models should be coming to your actions from form submits (or Ajax submits) or similar user actions, not from your own code of other actions. Redirects should be either parameter-less or with very few simple parameters. That&#39;s probably why the `RedirectionToAction()` is not bothered with serializing your list.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, if you insist on doing it that way, nothing stops you from doing the serialization by yourself. It&#39;s fairly simple.\r\n\r\nFirst, no double quotes around the values in the query string.\r\n\r\nSecond, for simple array properties, the syntax `property[0]=value&amp;property[1]=value` will work. Also for object propertied, the dot notation `property.property=value` will work too. But for a list of objects property like in your question, you can try using the dot notation `Shirts[0].Color=red` like you mentioned. I haven&#39;t tried it myself to see if the controller can bind to it successfully. I will continue this answer with the assumption that it can, because your question is about the serialization.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say the `Shirt` class has also an integer `Size` property. And let&#39;s say your model is an order with an integer `Id` and a decimal `Total` properties, in additions to the list `Shirts` property. You can serialize your model like this:\r\n\r\n    var qs = $&quot;?Id={model.Id}&quot;\r\n            + &quot;&amp;Total={model.Total}&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; model.Shirts.Count(); i++) {\r\n      var s = model.Shirts[i];\r\n      qs += $&quot;&amp;Shirts[{i}].Size={s.Size}&quot;\r\n           + &quot;&amp;Shirts[{i}].Color={HttpUtility.UrlEncode(s.Model)}&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t handle the case if `Shirts` can be `null`, you can do so if required.\r\n\r\nNow, you pass the query string to `Redirect()`. You can use `Url.Action()` to create the URL itself (i.e. before the query string):\r\n\r\n    Redirect(Url.Action(Action, Controller, model) + qs);\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966459/redirectiontoaction-with-model/57985127#57985127","title":"RedirectionToAction with

Not the best approach, but asking about it shows promise.

Once that function finishes, the returned value will be the value of the expression and execution of `max1` can resume. The stuff in the parentheses says that as we jump to `fnc`, assign `p_var1 = p_values[i]` and `p_size = 15` (the first parameter is assigned the first argument, and the second parameter is assigned the second argument).

The array you create in indexTranspose is a local variable, meaning it doesn&#39;t exist outside of the function. So, when `indexTranspose` finishes, and your program returns to `main`, transpose is gone. \r\n\r\nYou were on the right path trying to use pointers, but didn&#39;t get it quite right.\r\n\r\nYou need to have pointerTranspose accept a pointer to your 3x3 matrix. It looks like you were trying to make givenMatrix a pointer after you&#39;ve already created it, you can&#39;t do that. Here is an example of pointerTranspose that works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//Function to find the transpose using indices\r\nvoid pointerTranspose(int (*givenMatrix)[3][3])\r\n{\r\n    int transpose[3][3];\r\n    //Find the transpose of the matrix\r\n    for (int i=0; i &lt; 3; i++){\r\n        for (int j=0; j &lt; 3; j++){\r\n            transpose[i][j] = (*givenMatrix)[j][i];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //Set the values in the original matrix\r\n    for (int i=0; i &lt; 3; i++){\r\n        for (int j=0; j &lt; 3; j++){\r\n            (*givenMatrix)[i][j] = transpose[i][j];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen you would call it like this: `pointerTranspose(&amp;givenMatrix);`\r\n\r\nYou could also do this without creating the temporary `transpose` variable inside `pointerTranspose` by assigning `(*givenMatrix)[j][i]` directly to `(*givenMatrix)[i][j]` but I&#39;ll leave that as an exercise for you.

In essence it is the same as creating the transpose the matrix and then passing the transposed matrix as a single argument to `printMatrix`, but by being able to change the behavior of `printMatrix` by including another argument that does something to the matrix before it is printed has merit.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether you create the transpose first and pass that, or you pass the original matrix and the transpose function, you will need a second matrix to hold the transpose of the orginal so its values can be printed. The key difference will be within what scope the transpose matrix needs to be visible. From the point of your `indexTranspose` function it doesn&#39;t matter. You have two options (1) you leave the return type `void` and pass in a second matrix to be filled with the transpose of the original, or (2) you change the return type of the `indexTranspose` function and dynamically allocate for the matrix to hold the transpose and return a pointer to it. \r\n\r\n(**note:** as extensions to both you can pass a reference to an existing matrix, or declare and return a STL container, but those will be left for another day as you are using a 2D array of fundamental type `int`)\r\n\r\nThe simplest, is simply passing in another 3x3 2D array to hold the transpose values. You can simply add another parameter to your `indexTranspose` function to accomplish this, e.g.\r\n\r\n     /* Function to find the transpose using indices */     \r\n    void indexTranspose (int (*transpose)[3], int (*givenMatrix)[3])\r\n    {\r\n        //Find the transpose of the matrix\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\r\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\r\n                transpose[i][j] = givenMatrix[j][i];\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(**note:** whether you pass `int transpose[][3]` or `int (*transpose)[3]` they are equivalent. When you pass an array as an argument to a function, the first level of indirection is converted to a pointer to the first element -- in this case *a pointer to array of `int` [3]*. The second form above showing the explicit result of the conversion)\r\n\r\nIf you want to pass `indexTranspose` as an argument to `printMatrix`, you have to understand what the type for the function pointer would be. In its full form the type for `indexTranspose` is:\r\n\r\n    void (*f)(int (*)[3], int (*)[3]);\r\n\r\n(a function pointer `f` with return type `void` that takes two *pointer to array of `int` [3]*, e.g. two 3x3 2D arrays, as its arguments)\r\n\r\nSo adding the function pointer as an argument to your `printMatrix` function could be:\r\n\r\n    void printMatrix (int (*m)[3], void (*f)(int (*)[3], int (*)[3]))\r\n    {\r\n        int altered[3][3] = {{0}};\r\n        \r\n        f (altered, m);  /* apply function to original m, with results in altered */\r\n        \r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\r\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++)\r\n                std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; std::setw(3) &lt;&lt; altered[i][j];\r\n            std::cout.put (&#39;\\n&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Note:** here is where the scope of the second matrix to hold the results of applying the function to the first become important. Since you are only using the result to print, the second matrix (called `altered` above) can be declared local to your `printMatrix` function for the purpose of printing. So above, your `printMatrix` function now takes the original matrix `m` and a pointer to a function that returns `void` and accepts two 3x3 2D integer matrices as its parameters and it updates the value of the 1st 3x3 2D array with the result of the transpose operation (or whatever operation the function will perform)\r\n\r\nThen in your calling function (`main()` here), to pass the original matrix to `printMatrix` along with a pointer to `indexTranspose` and have the transpose occur in `printMatrix` and then output, all you would need to do is call:\r\n\r\n        printMatrix (givenMatrix, indexTranspose);\r\n\r\nRealistically, you would simply pass the altered matrix as the matrix parameter to `printMatrix` as you will presumably be using that matrix for more than printing, but it is a perfectly legitimate exercise to learn how to pass a function to provide the manipulation as well (as you will presumably be passing that function to something other than a print-function in the future)\r\n\r\nPutting it all together, you could do something similar to:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;\r\n    \r\n    /* Function to find the transpose using indices */     \r\n    void indexTranspose (int (*transpose)[3], int (*givenMatrix)[3])\r\n    {\r\n        //Find the transpose of the matrix\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\r\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\r\n                transpose[i][j] = givenMatrix[j][i];\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void printMatrix (int (*m)[3], void (*f)(int (*)[3], int (*)[3]))\r\n    {\r\n        int altered[3][3] = {{0}};\r\n        \r\n        f (altered, m);\r\n        \r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\r\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++)\r\n                std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; std::setw(3) &lt;&lt; altered[i][j];\r\n            std::cout.put (&#39;\\n&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int main (void) {\r\n        \r\n        int givenMatrix[3][3];\r\n        \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Please input matrix values in the order described &quot; &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Eneter Three Elements for Row: &quot; &lt;&lt; i + 1 &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n            for (int j=0; j &lt; 3; ++j){\r\n                if (!(std::cin &gt;&gt; givenMatrix[i][j])) {  /* always VALIDATE input */\r\n                    std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;error: invalid integer input.\\n&quot;;\r\n                    return 1;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        /* pass given &amp; pointer to function */\r\n        printMatrix (givenMatrix, indexTranspose); \r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Example Use/Output**\r\n\r\n    $ ./bin/prn_mtrx_by_fn\r\n    Please input matrix values in the order described\r\n    Eneter Three Elements for Row: 1\r\n    1 2 3\r\n    Eneter Three Elements for Row: 2\r\n    4 5 6\r\n    Eneter Three Elements for Row: 3\r\n    7 8 9\r\n       1   4   7\r\n       2   5   8\r\n       3   6   9\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any further questions about passing a function pointer as an argument, or if I misinterpreted your question, let me know as well, I&#39;m happy to help further.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966414/how-to-pass-the-result-of-a-function-that-calculates-the-transpose-of-a-matrix-t/57967380#57967380","title":"How to pass the result of a function that calculates the transpose of a matrix to another function that prints the matrix?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12076714,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7513414ec356c9aee45123a6457bfa0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ema Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076714/ema-li"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7264,"user_id":8873508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6KXjp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"p-a-o-l-o","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8873508/p-a-o-l-o"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57967380,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568706647,"creation_date":1568685662,"last_edit_date":1568706647,"question_id":57966414,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57966414","body_markdown":"I have created two functions, one that finds the transpose of a function and another that prints it.
