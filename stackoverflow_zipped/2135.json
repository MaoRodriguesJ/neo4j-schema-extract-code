So the second bit where I use -X doesn&#39;t seem to work (although this normally gives an error?) \r\n\r\nWhat I want is that the started screens actually all have started their own respective for-loop.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nPS I know there&#39;s plenty of other ways to do this, but for now I really want to solve this puzzle ;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033211/start-multiple-detached-screen-with-for-loop-each-with-a-command-with-also-a-fo","title":"Start multiple detached screen with for-loop, each with a command with also a for-loop"},{"tags":["mysql","node.js","json"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8960108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29c8f2eb06f8c147756a00424219491b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Saad Alifil Ma&#39;luf Jafar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8960108/saad-alifil-maluf-jafar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569002454,"creation_date":1569002454,"question_id":58033209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033209","body_markdown":"*\r\n    app.post(&#39;/register/&#39;,(req,res,next)=&gt;{\r\n    var post_data = req.body;\r\n\r\n    var uid = uuid.v4();\r\n    var plaint_password = post_data.password;\r\n    var hash_data = saltHashPassword(plaint_password);\r\n    var password = hash_data.passwordHash;\r\n    var salt = hash_data.salt;\r\n\r\n    var email = post_data.email;\r\n    var password = post_data.password;\r\n\r\n    con.query(&#39;SELECT * FROM `user` WHERE email=?&#39;, [email],function (err,result,fields) {\r\n        con.on(&#39;error&#39;,function(err){\r\n            console.log(&#39;[MySQL ERROR&#39;,err);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        if (result &amp;&amp; result.length)\r\n            res.json(&#39;NIM already exists&#39;)\r\n        else{\r\n            con.query(&#39;INSERT INTO `user`(unique_id`, `name`, `email`, `password_encryption`, `salt`, `created_at`, `update_at`)  &#39; +\r\n                &#39;VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,NOW(),NOW())&#39;,[uid,email,password,salt],function (err,result,fields) {\r\n                con.on(&#39;error&#39;,function (err) {\r\n                    console.log(&#39;[MySQL ERROR&#39;,err);\r\n                    res.json(&#39;Register error: &#39;,err);\r\n                });\r\n                res.json(&#39;Register Success&#39;);\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n})\r\n\r\n*\r\n[enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n[enter image description here][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gKLEn.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/oDv9a.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033209/kotlin-android-nodejs-and-mysql-my-database-is-not-updated-with-anything","title":"Kotlin Android.

When I switch to 64 client libs it starts to work.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@tsekmanrhel771 ~]# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/nz/lib64:/usr/local/unixODBC/lib\r\n[root@tsekmanrhel771 ~]# /usr/local/unixODBC/bin/isql -v NZSQL\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n| Connected!                            |\r\n|                                       |\r\n| sql-statement                         |\r\n| help [tablename]                      |\r\n| quit                                  |\r\n|                                       |\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n...\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033206/trying-to-execute-netezzasql-odbc-vi-aunixodbc/58097143#58097143","title":"trying to execute NetezzaSQL odbc vi aunixODBC"}],"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":1245659,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9116cc9a250e0990ae2b0395b28aa875?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"arcee123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1245659/arcee123"},"last_editor":{"reputation":398,"user_id":11945371,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c792f6fdd8f90c422011f66882821340?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tsekman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11945371/tsekman"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":88,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569486307,"creation_date":1569002450,"last_edit_date":1569486307,"question_id":58033206,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033206","body_markdown":"I am trying to execute Netezza connections using pyodbc thought presumably is unixODBC on a RedHat 7 box.\r\n\r\nI am unable to do so.\r\n\r\nI have netezza loaded on `/usr/local/nz` as normal.  when attempting to open a connection.\r\n\r\nhere&#39;s the connection string:\r\n```\r\nConnection=Driver={NetezzaSQL};servername=DEVDBSERVER01;port=5480;database=DEV;username=&lt;&lt;USER&gt;&gt;;password=&lt;&lt;PASSWORD&gt;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\ncontents of odbcinst.ini:\r\n\r\n    [NetezzaSQL]\r\n    Driver           = /usr/local/nz/lib/libnzsqlodbc3.so\r\n    Setup            = /usr/local/nz/lib/libnzsqlodbc3.so\r\n    APILevel         = 1\r\n    ConnectFunctions = YYN\r\n    Description      = IBM Netezza ODBC driver\r\n    DriverODBCVer    = 03.51\r\n    DebugLogging     = false\r\n    LogPath          = /tmp\r\n    UnicodeTranslationOption = utf8\r\n    CharacterTranslationOption = all\r\n    PreFetch         = 256\r\n    Socket           = 16384\r\n\r\nthe error is something I&quot;m not understanding:\r\n\r\n    pyodbc.Error: (&#39;01000&#39;, &quot;[01000] [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can&#39;t open lib &#39;/usr/local/nz/lib/libnzsqlodbc3.so&#39;

At that time I see in the database that all is good and this `course` items does indeed have a `week` item related, but `$course` shows 0 relations.\r\n\r\nSo something odd is happening where `$course-&gt;webinars` is not grabbing the `week` items related.\r\n\r\nIs there something that I am fundamentally doing wrong? Maybe it is because in the models I have these sorts of statements:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotected $table = &#39;Week&#39;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre these preventing the relations from being pulled? I always thought that is I had some function in a model that returns relations that those relations would always be available when I use syntax `$course-&gt;weeks`.\r\n\r\nIdeas?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033203/laravel-why-is-a-models-relations-not-being-loaded","title":"Laravel - why is a Model&#39;s relations not being loaded?"},{"tags":["postgresql","performance","postgres-fdw"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16258,"user_id":1029453,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x570w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Richard Huxton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1029453/richard-huxton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569009296,"post_id":58033198,"comment_id":102470908,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033198/select-from-postgresql-11-foreign-data-wrapper-to-pg-9-5-remote-15x-slower#comment102470908_58033198"},{"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":1082591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwYs7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"quickdraw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1082591/quickdraw"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":16258,"user_id":1029453,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x570w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Richard Huxton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1029453/richard-huxton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569009591,"post_id":58033198,"comment_id":102471010,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033198/select-from-postgresql-11-foreign-data-wrapper-to-pg-9-5-remote-15x-slower#comment102471010_58033198"},{"owner":{"reputation":16258,"user_id":1029453,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x570w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Richard Huxton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1029453/richard-huxton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569014747,"post_id":58033198,"comment_id":102472490,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033198/select-from-postgresql-11-foreign-data-wrapper-to-pg-9-5-remote-15x-slower#comment102472490_58033198"},{"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":1082591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwYs7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"quickdraw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1082591/quickdraw"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":16258,"user_id":1029453,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x570w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Richard Huxton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1029453/richard-huxton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569016398,"post_id":58033198,"comment_id":102472893,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033198/select-from-postgresql-11-foreign-data-wrapper-to-pg-9-5-remote-15x-slower#comment102472893_58033198"},{"owner":{"reputation":4916,"user_id":1721239,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50bb96fe6925fe9b4a821d4f2e160b9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jjanes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1721239/jjanes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569072310,"post_id":58033198,"comment_id":102481951,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033198/select-from-postgresql-11-foreign-data-wrapper-to-pg-9-5-remote-15x-slower#comment102481951_58033198"},{"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":1082591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwYs7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"quickdraw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1082591/quickdraw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569265437,"post_id":58033198,"comment_id":102533090,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033198/select-from-postgresql-11-foreign-data-wrapper-to-pg-9-5-remote-15x-slower#comment102533090_58033198"}],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":1082591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwYs7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"quickdraw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1082591/quickdraw"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39,"user_id":1082591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwYs7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"quickdraw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1082591/quickdraw"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569003815,"creation_date":1569002395,"last_edit_date":1569003815,"question_id":58033198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033198","body_markdown":"A select from a foreign wrapped view takes 15+ times longer to complete than the direct select on the source database.\r\n\r\nTried Adding USE_REMOTE_ESTIMATE &#39;true&#39; to the foreign server.

If I am using simple averaging, all the agents with exploration (`epsilon &gt; 0`) actually play worse than an agent without exploration. This is weird because the possibility of exploration should allow agents to leave the local optimum more often and reach out to better actions.\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, this is not the case for my implementation. Also note that I have added agents which use weighted-averaging.

Have only a single point, slow the interval down, step through to see what&#39;s happening. The mouse doesn&#39;t appear to be doing anything. Commenting out the line `grid.ApplyDirectedForce(new Vector3(0, 0, 5000), new Vector3(mouseX, mouseY, 0), 50);` doesn&#39;t change the output. It goes wrong in grid.Update(), for some reason grid.Update() does something even if there&#39;s no force applied, maybe that means the spring code has a bug. The bottom right point doesn&#39;t move frame one maybe that means something. The debugger is your friend. Add a breakpoint to grid.Update() and see what the code is actually doing. I know this isn&#39;t a direct answer but I hope this guides you in the right direction. \r\n\r\nI also want to point out that usually the whole point of Magnitude Squared is so that you can compare vectors or distances without having to do a square root operation.

I&#39;m following a tutorial written in `C#` over on [TutsPlus][2] that I used a long time ago to recreate it while learning XNA Framework. The tutorial is straight forward, and most of the code is self-explanatory, but I think my lack of superior education in mathematics is letting me down once again.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve successfully rendered the grid in a 300x300 `canvas` with no troubles, and even replicated all of the code in the tutorial, but since they&#39;re using the XNA Framework libraries, they have the advantage of not having to write the mathematical functions of the `Vector3` type. I&#39;ve implemented only what I need, but I believe I may have gotten my math incorrect or perhaps the implementation.\r\n\r\n[![Initial Grid][3]][3]\r\n\r\nThe initial grid (above) should look like this until I begin interacting with it, and it does, as long as I disable the `Update` function of my `Grid`. I&#39;ve stepped through the code and the issue seems to be related to my calculation for the magnitude of my vectors. The XNA Framework libraries always called it `Length` and `LengthSquared`, but each Google search I performed was returning results for calculating magnitude as:\r\n\r\n[![Magnitude of a 3D Vector][4]][4]\r\n\r\nNow, this is incredibly simple to recreate in code, and my `Vector3` class accounts for `Magnitude` and `MagnitudeSquared` since the tutorial calls for both. I&#39;ve compared the results of my magnitude calculation to that of [an online calculator][5] and the results were the same:\r\n\r\n&gt; V = (2, 3, 4)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; |V| = 5.385164807134504\r\n\r\nTo top this off, the URL for this calculator says that I&#39;m calculating the length of the vector. This is what leads me to believe that it may be my implementation here that is causing the whole thing to go crazy.

(How to convert &lt;code&gt;x + 0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in a AST?). It is about pattern matching on AST&#39;s, and once there is a match, a conversion of an equivalent expression. It is also called a term rewriting rule.\r\n\r\nNote that having a term rewriting rule is not the absolute or general solution of algebraic simplification. The general solution involves having many rewriting rules (you showed two of them), and apply them in a given AST repeatedly until no one success. \r\n\r\nThen, the general solution involves the process or coordination on the application of the rewriting rules. i.e. in order to avoid the re-application of a rule that has previously failed, as an example.\r\n\r\nThere is not a unique way to do it. There are several systems. For proprietary systems it is not known because they keeps it in secrecy, but there are open source systems too, for example [Mathomatica][1] is written in C.\r\n\r\nI recommend you to check the open system [Fōrmul&#230;][2]. In this, the process of coordination of rewriting rules (which is called &quot;the reduction engine&quot;) is relatively simple. It is written in Java. The advantage of this system is that rewriting rules are not hardwired/hardcoded in the system or the reduction engine (they are [hot pluggable][3]). Coding a rewriting rule involves the process of pattern matching and conversion, but no when or how it will be called (it follows the [Hollywood principle][4]).\r\n\r\nIn the specific case of [Fōrmul&#230;][2]:\r\n\r\n1. The reduction engine is based (in general terms) on the [post-order tree traversal algorithm][5]. so when a node is &quot;visited&quot;, its sub-nodes were already visited and (possibly) transformed, but it is possible to alter such that flow (i.e. to solve the unwanted referentiation of a variable in an assignment &lt;code&gt;x &lt;- 5&lt;/code&gt;). Note that it is not just a tree traversal, the AST is being actually changed in the process.\r\n\r\n2. In order to efficiently manage the (possibly hundred or thousand) of rewriting rules, every rule has a type of expression where it is applicable, and when a single node is &quot;visited&quot;, only the associated rules are checked for a match. For example, your 2 rules can only be applied to &quot;addition&quot; nodes of an AST.\r\n\r\nRewriting rules are not limited to algebraic simplification, they can be used in many other fields such as programming ([Fōrmul&#230;][2] is also its programming language, see [examples of Fōrmul&#230; programs][6], or in automatic or assisted theorem proving.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.mathomatic.org/\r\n  [2]: http://formulae.org/\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_swapping\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Post-order_(LRN)\r\n  [6]: https://wiki.formulae.org/Examples","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033177/algebraic-simplification-on-abstract-syntax-tree/58399512#58399512","title":"Algebraic Simplification on Abstract Syntax Tree"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11844411,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42f9822968c37c4a28afd8f549b8bcdb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arif Balik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11844411/arif-balik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11844411,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42f9822968c37c4a28afd8f549b8bcdb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arif Balik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11844411/arif-balik"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571159552,"creation_date":1569002308,"last_edit_date":1569002626,"question_id":58033177,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033177","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve designed a parser in C that is able to generate AST, but when I begin to implement simplifications it really got messed up.

It seems that the state of the component is not being updated, when I look at my react developer tools.

*However, the reverse doesn&#39;t really apply*\r\n\r\nOn a little endian system (least significant byte of a multi-byte value is at the lowest address), the `int` will correspond to the least significant bits of the mantissa of the `long double`. You have to print that `long double` with a great deal of precision to see the effect of that `int` on those insignificant digits.\r\n\r\nOn a big endian system, like a Power PC box, things would be different: the `int` part would line up with the most significant part of the `long double`, overlapping with the sign bit, exponent and most significant mantissa bits. Thus changes in `x` would have drastic effects on the observed floating-point value, even if only a few significant digits are printed. However, for small values of `x`, the value appears to be zero.\r\n\r\nOn a PPC64 system, the following version of the program:\r\n\r\n    int main(void)\r\n    {\r\n        union myUnion a;\r\n        a.y = 3.2;\r\n        int i;\r\n        for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {\r\n          a.x = i;\r\n          printf(&quot;%d -- %.2Lf\\n&quot;, a.x, a.y);\r\n        }\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprints nothing but\r\n\r\n    1 -- 0.0\r\n    2 -- 0.0\r\n    [...]\r\n    999 - 0.0\r\n\r\nThis is because we&#39;re creating an exponent field with all zeros, giving rise to values close to zero. However, the initial value 3.2 is completely clobbered; it doesn&#39;t just have its least significant bits ruffled.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033111/union-not-reinterpreting-values/58033170#58033170","title":"Union not reinterpreting values?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":69591,"user_id":4593267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e4b30c27c9d2a9b4c871ffdae9aecb6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chqrlie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4593267/chqrlie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569013276,"post_id":58033284,"comment_id":102472142,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033111/union-not-reinterpreting-values/58033284#comment102472142_58033284"},{"owner":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":69591,"user_id":4593267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e4b30c27c9d2a9b4c871ffdae9aecb6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chqrlie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4593267/chqrlie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569035312,"post_id":58033284,"comment_id":102475484,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033111/union-not-reinterpreting-values/58033284#comment102475484_58033284"},{"owner":{"reputation":69591,"user_id":4593267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e4b30c27c9d2a9b4c871ffdae9aecb6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chqrlie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4593267/chqrlie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569055499,"post_id":58033284,"comment_id":102478331,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033111/union-not-reinterpreting-values/58033284#comment102478331_58033284"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569003140,"last_edit_date":1569003140,"creation_date":1569002817,"answer_id":58033284,"question_id":58033111,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58033284","body_markdown":"This is only affecting the last half of the mantissa.

The value of a structure or union object is never a trap representation, even though the value of a member of the structure or union object may be a trap representation.\r\n\r\n&gt; 7 &amp;nbsp; When a value is stored in a member of an object of union type, the bytes of the object representation that do not correspond to that member but do correspond to other members take unspecified values.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the behavior described in the answers is not guaranteed as all the bytes of the `long double y` member could be modified by setting the `int x` member, including the bytes that are not part of the `int`. These bytes can take any value and the contents of `y` could even be a trap value, causing undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nAs commented by Kaz, gcc is more precise than the C Standard: [the documentation notes][1] it as a common practice: The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most recently written to (called *type-punning*) is common. Even with `-fstrict-aliasing`, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory is accessed through the union type. This practice is actually condoned in the C Standard since C11, as documented in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11996970/4593267 . Yet in my reading of this footnote there is still no guarantee about the bytes of `y` not part of `x`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-9.2.0/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Type-punning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033111/union-not-reinterpreting-values/58035451#58035451","title":"Union not reinterpreting values?"}],"owner":{"reputation":519,"user_id":10505778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d48a83c7fb094806cc998ecd3685e06?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DarkAtom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10505778/darkatom"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":120,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"accepted_answer_id":58033170,"answer_count":4,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1569141976,"creation_date":1569001991,"last_edit_date":1569003455,"question_id":58033111,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033111","body_markdown":"Consider this program:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    union myUnion\r\n    {\r\n        int x;\r\n        long double y;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        union myUnion a;\r\n        a.x = 5;\r\n        a.y = 3.2;\r\n        printf(&quot;%d\\n%.2Lf&quot;, a.x, a.y);\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    -858993459\r\n    3.20\r\n\r\nThis is fine, as the `int` member gets interpreted using some of the bits of the `long double` member.

If there are any solutions besides going through XACT, though, I&#39;d be happy to hear them out.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033099/how-do-i-import-xsb-and-xwb-files-into-xact","title":"How do I import .xsb and .xwb files into XACT?"},{"tags":["javascript","for-loop","async-await"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6925,"user_id":8475054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbf41c4b5aecb1a949936e06368a7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robin Zigmond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8475054/robin-zigmond"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569002145,"post_id":58033098,"comment_id":102468413,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033098/async-for-loop-behaviour-behaves-differently-between-map-and-push#comment102468413_58033098"},{"owner":{"reputation":13965,"user_id":440336,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a1d93f753d89c72c75d98acff867c54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jason Rogers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440336/jason-rogers"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6925,"user_id":8475054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbf41c4b5aecb1a949936e06368a7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robin Zigmond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8475054/robin-zigmond"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570191070,"post_id":58033098,"comment_id":102845229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033098/async-for-loop-behaviour-behaves-differently-between-map-and-push#comment102845229_58033098"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13965,"user_id":440336,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a1d93f753d89c72c75d98acff867c54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jason Rogers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440336/jason-rogers"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569002541,"post_id":58033173,"comment_id":102468563,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033098/async-for-loop-behaviour-behaves-differently-between-map-and-push/58033173#comment102468563_58033173"},{"owner":{"reputation":1024,"user_id":7619380,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a65ac8b0d03d302e9527fcfd0e9acf0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Josh Wilson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7619380/josh-wilson"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13965,"user_id":440336,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a1d93f753d89c72c75d98acff867c54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jason Rogers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440336/jason-rogers"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569003011,"post_id":58033173,"comment_id":102468744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033098/async-for-loop-behaviour-behaves-differently-between-map-and-push/58033173#comment102468744_58033173"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1024,"user_id":7619380,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a65ac8b0d03d302e9527fcfd0e9acf0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Josh Wilson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7619380/josh-wilson"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569002294,"creation_date":1569002294,"answer_id":58033173,"question_id":58033098,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58033173","body_markdown":"The difference you&#39;re seeing is the difference between `for ... of` and `for ... in`. \r\n\r\n`for ... of` iterates over the *values* in a collection like an Array.

When the app is brought back to foreground, it displays the previous `ViewController` or some other `ViewController` (which depends on a number of conditions, such as, for example, the duration the app was in the background, etc. - but these are not important here).\r\n\r\nOn iOS 12 and earlier, I use a very simple mechanism - on `applicationDidEnterBackground`, I set the current `ViewController` to a local variable on `AppDelegate` and display the launch screen.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsavedViewController = window?.rootViewController\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn `applicationWillEnterForeground`, I check whether all required conditions are met and set the `Window`&#39;s `ViewController` to the stored `ViewController`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwindow?.rootViewController = savedViewController\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis no longer works on iOS 13. When the app enters foreground, the initial story boars is displayed. Setting the `rootViewController` on the current `Window` has no affect at all.\r\n\r\nI tried to solve this issue by enabling scenes in my application, but that didn&#39;t work either.\r\n\r\nIn `SceneDelegate`, I&#39;m able to set a default `ViewController`in the `scene:willConnecTo` method like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nguard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }\r\n        \r\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: windowScene.coordinateSpace.bounds)\r\nwindow?.windowScene = windowScene\r\n        \r\nlet launchStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: &quot;LaunchScreenVersion&quot;, bundle: Bundle.main)\r\nlet launchViewController = launchStoryboard.instantiateInitialViewController()\r\n        \r\nwindow?.rootViewController = launchViewController\r\nwindow?.becomeKey()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code works, but the method is only called when the scene first loads. I then tried to move my code from from `applicationWillEnterForeground ` to `sceneWillEnterForeground`, but this didn&#39;t work either. When I set the `Window`&#39;s `ViewController` in this method, that doesn&#39;t have any effect and only the `ViewController` set initially loads.\r\n\r\nI also tried moving the code to `sceneDidBecomeActive`, but it had exactly the same effect.\r\n\r\nI know that iOS has built-in state restoration, but, due to security policies, we can&#39;t use them in the app as no user state can be saved if the app is no longer running.\r\n\r\nAny ideas how I can swap the `ViewController` with a splash screen when the app goes into background and set it back when the app goes into foreground?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033089/set-viewcontroller-when-app-scene-enters-foreground-in-ios-13","title":"Set ViewController when app/scene enters foreground in iOS 13"},{"tags":["bash","sh","telegraf"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":261,"user_id":12066801,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC_5EMzuHkbnesDAzBSRSG2QNd7my0t5STGLjK9EA=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Yuji","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12066801/yuji"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569053771,"creation_date":1569053771,"answer_id":58038461,"question_id":58033088,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58038461","body_markdown":"If your question is\r\n\r\n - if &quot;$response&quot; = &quot;error_msg&quot;, then execute &quot;service httpd restart&quot;\r\n - but, restarts are not more than 4 times.\r\n\r\nSo, \r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nfor n in $(seq 4)\r\ndo\r\n    response=$(curl -s --max-time 15 --header ‘Host: xyz.testurl.com’ &quot;https://localhost/login/creds.kcc?&amp;TARGET=https:xyz.testurl.com&quot; --insecure 2&gt;/dev/null)\r\n    if [ &quot;$response&quot; != &quot;error_msg&quot; ]; then\r\n        exit 0\r\n    fi\r\n    service httpd restart\r\n    sleep 10 # temporary solution                                               \r\ndone\r\nexit 1\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033088/avoid-multiple-restart-of-httpd-service-in-bash-script/58038461#58038461","title":"Avoid multiple restart of httpd service in bash script"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11358025,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vBA0EPFkYzg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfJWIgOwiCxUSF5YIVJFe2mKERCnQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user11358025","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11358025/user11358025"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569053771,"creation_date":1569001909,"question_id":58033088,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033088","body_markdown":"I have a shell script that checks for errors and returns a status &#39;0&#39; (all good) or &#39;1&#39; (needs remediation).

If `no`, then what is the best practice to solve this problem?\r\nIf `yes`, why am I wrong?\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance.\r\n\r\nP.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033059/how-to-prevent-react-native-flatlist-consumer-from-bloating-app-memory-due-to-st","title":"How to prevent React Native FlatList consumer from bloating app memory due to state data increase?"},{"tags":["ios","xcode"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":9051293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a88ae8d26aa1f2c5f33c305c0f4a8c48?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dave123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9051293/dave123"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569003464,"post_id":58033058,"comment_id":102468923,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033058/macincloud-xcode-quits-unexpectedly-10-3#comment102468923_58033058"},{"owner":{"reputation":509,"user_id":2695256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q06Bd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"topher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2695256/topher"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":157,"user_id":9051293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a88ae8d26aa1f2c5f33c305c0f4a8c48?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dave123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9051293/dave123"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569041117,"post_id":58033058,"comment_id":102476111,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033058/macincloud-xcode-quits-unexpectedly-10-3#comment102476111_58033058"},{"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":9051293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a88ae8d26aa1f2c5f33c305c0f4a8c48?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dave123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9051293/dave123"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569131204,"post_id":58033058,"comment_id":102492198,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033058/macincloud-xcode-quits-unexpectedly-10-3#comment102492198_58033058"}],"owner":{"reputation":509,"user_id":2695256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q06Bd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"topher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2695256/topher"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23205,"user_id":1033581,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8891617e36b8d1254eb3ce1a5662da4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Cœur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1033581/c%c5%93ur"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569305590,"creation_date":1569001757,"last_edit_date":1569305590,"question_id":58033058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033058","body_markdown":"Using MacInCloud&#39;s managed server.\r\n\r\nTried opening another example project downloaded on Github, doesn&#39;t work.  \r\nTried everything here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13600029/xcode-quits-unexpectedly-every-time-i-open-my-project  \r\nNone of them worked.\r\n\r\nFull stack trace on Gist: https://gist.github.com/topherseance/e733af8a420682b20d423a6bd57b3d5e  \r\nSnippet of the stack trace (omitted because it&#39;s too long to fit in SO question)\r\n\r\n````\r\nProcess:               Xcode [26214]\r\nPath:                  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode\r\nIdentifier:            com.apple.dt.Xcode\r\nVersion:               10.3 (14492.2)\r\nBuild Info:            IDEFrameworks-14492002000000000~2\r\nApp Item ID:           497799835\r\nApp External ID:       832020435\r\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\r\nParent Process:        ???

For example, if you have a file called `example.txt` then Terraform will track its instance as `aws_s3_bucket_object.example[&quot;example.txt&quot;]`, rather than an address like `aws_s3_bucket_object.example[3]` where 3 is its position in the list of files.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have written a Terraform module that builds on `fileset` to also support template rendering and detecting filetypes based on filename suffixes, which might make life easier in some more complicated situations: [`apparentlymart/dir/template`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/apparentlymart/dir/template). You can use its result with `aws_s3_bucket_object` in a similar way to the above, as shown in its README.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033043/iterate-through-map-for-file-function/58035839#58035839","title":"Iterate through map for file function"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10015905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8bd0149cd5bc0d4bda972573302ff7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TravelingLex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10015905/travelinglex"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58035839,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569264872,"creation_date":1569001689,"question_id":58033043,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033043","body_markdown":"I have a usecase for uploading multiple files to s3 using terraform.

I have my Rails project currently configured as a REST api only project. However, I&#39;m starting to convert it to using GraphQL. After running the graphql related generators, I currently have a `graphql_controller.rb` file and a `query_type.rb` file.\r\n\r\nFor my database model, I have a `SchoolCourse` model which describes a particular course taught in college. For this model, I&#39;ve defined a `school_course_type.rb`. In my `query_type.rb` file, I&#39;ve defined a field for the `schoolCourse` query.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are 2 types of users who can log into my application - teachers and students. If the user is a teacher, then accessing the application and querying for `schoolCourse` will return all the school courses that this particular instructor teachers. If the user is a student, then accessing the application and querying for `schoolCourse` will return all the school courses that this particular student attends. In both cases, the `schoolCourse` data is the same type (`school_course_type`).\r\n\r\nI currently have the `schoolCourse` query defined in `query_type.rb` to work for teachers. However, if I want to extend the `schoolCourse` query to work for students as well, it seems like I&#39;ll have to update the `schoolCourse` query to include `if / else` logic to look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This is how it currently looks like:\r\n\r\ndef schoolCourses\r\n  teacher_user = context[:current_user]\r\n  teacher_user.school_courses\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\n# This is how I think it would change:\r\n\r\ndef schoolCourses\r\n  user = context[:current_user]\r\n\r\n  if user.type == &#39;teacher&#39;\r\n    user.school_courses\r\n  else\r\n    # different way for students to retrieve school courses\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this may work, this isn&#39;t ideal. **The main problem I want to solve is to have multiple `schoolCourse` queries defined and have it so that teachers use one version and students use the other version.**\r\n\r\nIn my current application, I have 2 `schoolCourse` controllers - one for teachers and one for students, and by splitting it into two files, my API is much cleaner. **Is there any way to do something similar with the `query_type.rb` file where I have a query_type for teachers and another for students?** How have you dealt with this problem in your projects?\r\n\r\n**Adding more context - 9/20/2019 2:10pm PST**\r\n\r\n1. **How are school courses differentiated between student and teacher?** So school course objects are identical for both students and teachers. Currently in my RESTful backend, I have 2 separate controller files for getting student courses. One is for teachers and the other is for students. When the teacher&#39;s school course controller gets called, it&#39;s only returning the school courses for the logged in teacher. Similarly, when the student&#39;s school course controller gets called, it&#39;s only returning the school courses for the logged in student.\r\n\r\n2. **Can you elaborate on why you want to have multiple school course queries?** The reason why I&#39;m thinking I want multiple school course queries is because I don&#39;t want to have to add `if / else` logic inside the single school course query to do something for teachers and something else for students. I know it&#39;ll work but I probably have 50 other models and I don&#39;t have to put the same type of `if / else` logic inside each query.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033039/for-a-rails-and-graphql-project-how-do-you-define-multiple-queries-with-the-sam","title":"For a Rails and GraphQL project, how do you define multiple queries with the same name?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","multithreading","python-multithreading"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9615,"user_id":7414759,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b272ce66c7c245c6cbe9a830691daddc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stovfl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7414759/stovfl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569007012,"post_id":58033038,"comment_id":102470171,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033038/how-do-i-stop-threading-from-inside-of-thread-queue-python#comment102470171_58033038"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66178,"user_id":3185459,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0hBsk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RomanPerekhrest","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3185459/romanperekhrest"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569007274,"creation_date":1569007274,"answer_id":58034098,"question_id":58033038,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58034098","body_markdown":"In some cases threads may compete in terms &quot;who will race more quickly&quot;

You will have issues using string method `Contains()` as PowerShell is actually using the `Contains()` method of the Array class. For the Array class `Contains()` method to return `true`, you would have to match an ***entire line***.\r\n\r\n`Get-Content -Path $javafilepath -Raw` will produce better results because it produces a single string. Then the string class `Contains()` method will allow for a substring match. Keep in mind the string class method ***is case-sensitive***.\r\n\r\n    $javafilecontents = Get-Content -Path $javafilepath -Raw\r\n    $mybool = $javafilecontents.Contains(&quot;main&quot;)\r\n\r\nThe other option is to continue without the `-Raw` switch and loop through each line. Then you can use the string class `Contains()` against each line, which will be a single string. The `where()` method can filter an array based on a condition. Then you can cast the success of that filter to `[bool]`. A match will yield `True` and no match will yield `False`.\r\n\r\n    $javafilecontents = Get-Content -Path $javafilepath\r\n    $mybool = [bool]($javafilecontents.where{$_.Contains(&quot;main&quot;)})\r\n\r\nThe same approach as the above method can be used with the ***case-insensitive*** `-match` operator, which produces a cleaner solution. `-cmatch` is the case-sensitive version.\r\n\r\n    $javafilecontents = Get-Content -Path $javafilepath\r\n    $mybool = [bool]($javafilecontents -match &#39;main&#39;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033029/how-do-i-use-contains-on-the-string-value-returned-from-get-content/58033456#58033456","title":"How do I use .Contains() on the string value returned from Get-Content?"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10620332,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hUW_EIqqu8Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAF_Q/xCAgSCJSx_A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Miguel Aragon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10620332/miguel-aragon"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58033456,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569004365,"creation_date":1569001615,"question_id":58033029,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033029","body_markdown":"I am using powershell script to check and see which java file in the directory is the main java file by checking the contents of each file and seeing if it contains &quot;main&quot;.

think your problem is using primitive type for @Id column. \r\n\r\nHere what Hibernate says for `save()` method in javadoc;\r\n\r\n&gt; Persist the given transient instance, first assigning a generated identifier. (Or using the current value of the identifier property if the assigned generator is used.) This operation cascades to associated instances if the association is mapped with cascade=&quot;save-update&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n`CrudRepository#save()` method checks student id, which is 0 for both first and second record, in the database. Since Hibernate founds a record and thinks you&#39;re not inserting a record, instead, you&#39;re updating a record which it&#39;s id is 0. \r\n\r\nIf you do modify your code like below, it should work;\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;student&quot;)\r\n    public class Student {\r\n\r\n      @Id\r\n      @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n      @Column(columnDefinition=&quot;serial&quot;)\r\n      private Integer id;\r\n\r\nNow, Hibernate will check your id and if it&#39;s a new record, id field will be null so Hibernate says this is a new record and it should be inserted as a new record.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlso, there is one more thing. You set `hbm2ddl.auto` in your hibernate configuration. You can check for more detail of `hbm2ddl.auto`, [in here][1].\r\n\r\n    &lt;property name=&quot;hbm2ddl.auto&quot;&gt;create&lt;/property&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this case once `CreatStudentDemo` works, hibernate destroys your old table. That means, it deletes Student table and creates a new table. Then It creates a Student record in database as expected, let&#39;s say Student1. \r\n\r\nHere is the thing, you rerun `CreatStudentDemo` and you expects that the second object would be inserted as Student2. However here is what really happens -- when you rerun `CreatStudentDemo` hibernate destroys the table which Student1 got deleted. Then it creates Student table and inserts Student objects with an id of 1 because this is the first record on newly created Student table.\r\n\r\nBasicly, you can set;\r\n\r\n    &lt;property name=&quot;hbm2ddl.auto&quot;&gt;update&lt;/property&gt;\r\n\r\nor, you can call `save()` method for two times, like;\r\n\r\n            Student student = new Student(&quot;Souid&quot;,&quot;Ayoub&quot;,&quot;ayoub@luv2code.com&quot;);\r\n            Student student2 = new Student(&quot;Test Student&quot;,&quot;TestStudent&quot;,&quot;test@mail.com&quot;);\r\n\r\n            //start the transaction\r\n            session.beginTransaction();\r\n\r\n            //save the object\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Saving the Student...&quot;);\r\n            session.save(student);\r\n            session.save(student2);\r\n            .....\r\n\r\n  [1]:

&quot;//########.#&quot; being the set of characters that I want to align.\r\n\r\nI can already follow the first rule, using the following\r\n\r\n    //[0-9]{8}\\.[0-9a-zA-Z]$\r\n\r\nHowever the result of this ends up like this:\r\n\r\n                //Example\t\t\t\t                                                   \r\n

have the following question:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48458180/python-mysqldb-connect-using-variables\r\n\r\nI am having the exact same problem, but I have checked dozens of times, to make absolutely sure the values in my variables are precisely what I expect them to be. \r\n\r\nIf I use literal strings, I can connect every time:\r\n\r\n`db = MySQLdb.connect(&quot;my_host&quot;,&quot;my_user&quot;,&quot;my_passwd&quot;,&quot;my_database&quot;) `\r\n\r\nHowever, if I load values from another file into variables (with the EXACT SAME VALUES, no extra quotes or anything, verified repeatedly) I fail to connect, every time:\r\n\r\n`db = MySQLdb.connect(db_host,db_user,db_passwd,db_name)`\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, what I am trying to do should work just fine. Is there at least a way I can extract an error message from the MySQLdb.connect command?\r\n\r\nhere is the block where I have assigned my variables.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    db_host, db_user, db_passwd, db_name = &#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39;\r\n    f = open(&quot;../db_config.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);\r\n    configLines = f.readlines();\r\n    for i in configLines:\r\n        (key,value) = i.split(&#39;=&#39;)\r\n        if (key==&#39;db_host&#39;):\r\n            db_host = value\r\n        elif (key==&#39;db_user&#39;):\r\n            db_user = value\r\n        elif (key==&#39;db_passwd&#39;):\r\n            db_passwd = value\r\n        elif (key==&#39;db_name&#39;):\r\n            db_name = value\r\n    f.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I print them out later, they appear identical to the values I am successfully using as string literals.\r\n\r\nThere are no special characters. The hostname has dots, like mysql.chriscalef.com, the password has numbers and letters, everything else is just letters.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032998/why-cant-i-pass-variables-into-mysqldb-connect","title":"Why can&#39;t I pass variables into MySQLdb.connect()?"},{"tags":["visual-studio-code","vscode-extensions"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":28478,"user_id":243245,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aed5c13647d581ae231f019a886e05a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rup","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/243245/rup"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569001600,"post_id":58032993,"comment_id":102468200,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032993/create-terminal-from-jar#comment102468200_58032993"}],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":4232947,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d678de36686dcea65871f4abfded9cde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thoor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4232947/thoor"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569001444,"creation_date":1569001444,"question_id":58032993,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58032993","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing an extension for VS Code and I need to spawn a terminal within vs code.\r\nThe terminal should use my jar as shell.

Is the first code a good practice?\r\n\r\nI see nothing wrong with it. In some languages it is often ill-advised to put things that can throw errors within destructors and that is something I follow, even in C#. The reason being is it can be a bit difficult to debug exceptions from destructors in certain scenarios. But I consider constructors fair game and I know of no technical reason to be afraid of calling a method inside one.  \r\n\r\n2) If I code like in the first code sample then I wouldn&#39;t need to include the IDisposable interface and the Dispose Pattern?\r\n\r\nIf you aren&#39;t disposing of anything unmanaged, you don&#39;t really need the IDisposable. \r\n\r\n3) In the link I included above, I read that if you code like in the first sample, an object is created implicitly. Is that true?\r\n\r\nIf any one of those methods calls a &#39;new&#39; it is being created. Although a personal style preference of mine, is I generally don&#39;t like to label things that create objects as &#39;Get&#39;. Just because a lot of getters have that name.

But we can&#39;t tell that from the code you&#39;ve shown.\r\n\r\n - When working with other classes that implement `IDisposable`, it&#39;s generally best practice to instantiate them in a `using` block, which will automatically call `Dispose` when the block exits:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class EmployeesBL\r\n{\r\n    public IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt; GetAll()\r\n    {\r\n        using(var employeesDa = new EmployeesDA())\r\n        {\r\n            return employeesDa.GetAll();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Employee GetById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n        using(var employeesDa = new EmployeesDA())\r\n        {\r\n            return employeesDa.GetById(id);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

It is inefficient, as you are instantiating a new instance of `EmployeesDA` then immediately throwing it away. Assuming that whatever is queried by `GetAll()` and `GetById(id)` is immutable for the life of an `EmployeesDA` object, it is more efficient to instantiate one object, keep a reference to that object, and call the methods on that object. Even better would be to make the methods static (if possible) so that an instance does not need to be created.\r\n\r\n2) If I code like in the first code sample then I wouldn&#39;t need to include the IDisposable interface and the Dispose Pattern? \r\n\r\nNo you wouldn&#39;t, but you should use a `using` statement to ensure that dispose is immediately called on the object after it has gone out of scope.\r\n\r\n3) In the link I included above, I read that if you code like in the first sample, an object is created implicitly.

ADO.Net still wants you to allocate new SqlConnection (or OleDbConnection, MySqlConnection, OdbcDbConnection, etc) objects for most requests to the database so it can do Connection Pooling properly, but otherwise you want your BL/DL layers to be mainly either static, singleton, single global, or HTTP response-scoped, and there are arguments for each of those options depending on the situation.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we want this:\r\n\r\n    public DL\r\n    {\r\n        private static string connectionString = &quot;...&quot;;\r\n\r\n        public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetAll&lt;T&gt;() \r\n        {\r\n             using (var cn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\r\n             {\r\n                 cn.Open():\r\n                 //...\r\n             }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nrather than this:\r\n\r\n    public DL\r\n    {\r\n        //Assume this is disposed properly for simplicity...\r\n        // Maybe a winforms app with fewer longer cycles, rather than a web app with lots of threads or AppDomains\r\n        private static SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n\r\n        public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetAll&lt;T&gt;() \r\n        {\r\n            connection.Open();\r\n            //...\r\n            connection.Close();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nor this:\r\n\r\n    public DL \r\n    {\r\n        private SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetAll&lt;T&gt;() \r\n        {\r\n             connection.Open();\r\n             //...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nor even this:\r\n\r\n    public DL : IDisposable\r\n    {\r\n        private SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(&quot;...&quot;);\r\n\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetAll&lt;T&gt;() \r\n        {\r\n             connection.Open();\r\n             //...\r\n        }\r\n  \r\n        public void Dispose()\r\n        {\r\n             if (connection is IDisposable) connection.Dispose();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nADO.Net wants the connection objects scoped entirely to the individual API methods that actually call to the database, rather than a single connection for the whole data layer. As bad as the allocations are, the security/authentication/connection negotiations with the database server are typically much worse. Re-using the connection object optimizes for saving that little bit of memory at the expense of much worse efficiency actually accomplishing the connections with the database.\r\n\r\nAside from connections, though, we want to limit needing to create new instances of anything. Sometimes, even my &quot;business objects&quot; are just static mappings over `IDataRecord`, where I don&#39;t need to allocate new instances separate from the DTO returned by ADO.Net. But right now I&#39;m mainly looking at the `DL` and `BL` manager types, and here that means either `static` methods (maybe even the full class) or some mechanism for sharing a common instance, be it singleton, global, or other.\r\n\r\n**BOTH of the options in the question fail at this.**\r\n\r\nBut as for the specific question, let&#39;s look at whether the first option needs to implement `IDisposable` or not.\r\n\r\nIf the data layer is built such that there is no connection object stored in the class instance itself, but rather connections are created, opened, and disposed within the scope of each API method, then the data layer object probably has no unmanaged fields property members at all, and therefore _does not need to implement the `IDisposable` pattern._ If the data layer does not implement `IDisposable`, then it&#39;s also safe to create the throw-away instances as seen in the first example. Moreover, the business layer also probably doesn&#39;t need to implement `IDisposable`.\r\n\r\nMoving on to the second option.\r\n\r\nThis option does not quite properly understand `IDisposable`. It _does_ follow the documentation patterns correctly, but the documentation is misleading here, in that it provides the complete/long version of the pattern that includes finalizers. You only need to write a finalizer if you&#39;re building a brand new kind of unmanaged resource from scratch. If you&#39;re not writing your own finalizer, but only wrapping something else that&#39;s IDisposable, you can almost certainly get by with a simplified version of the pattern.\r\n\r\nIn a BL/DL situation, the only unmanaged resource is typically a database connection somewhere down the way (maybe not even that, if everything is hidden behind a HTTP/JSON API). The database connection will have an ADO.Net provider that&#39;s already done the finalizer; you don&#39;t need to write your own. Now you&#39;re to the point where `Dispose()` _always_ just calls `Dispose(true)`, and nothing else ever calls `Dispose(false)`. Additionally, nothing else ever looks at `disposedValue`, and the `data` variables, which do follow the complete pattern, and are therefore all safe to call `Dispose()` multiple times. \r\n\r\nIn other words, the complicated pattern with the overloaded method, boolean flag, and conditional blocks is no longer needed. You can have a simple `public void Dispose() {data.Dispose();}`\r\n\r\nBut again, that&#39;s predicated on `BL` instances maintaining an instance of the `DL`, where a static or similar option may be better in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032988/is-calling-a-method-while-instantiating-its-class-a-good-practice-c/58036033#58036033","title":"Is calling a method while instantiating its class a good practice?

It seems that the App crash on Location Manager in GPSTracker.java\r\n\r\nGPSTracker.java\r\n\r\n    package YOU.SOLD.YOUR.SOUL;\r\n    \r\n    import android.annotation.SuppressLint;\r\n    import android.app.Service;\r\n    import android.content.Intent;\r\n    import android.location.Location;\r\n    import android.location.LocationListener;\r\n    import android.location.LocationManager;\r\n    import android.os.Bundle;\r\n    import android.os.IBinder;\r\n    \r\n    import androidx.annotation.Nullable;\r\n    \r\n    public class GPSTracker extends Service implements LocationListener {\r\n    \r\n        LocationManager LM;\r\n    \r\n        @SuppressLint(&quot;MissingPermission&quot;)\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onCreate() {\r\n            LM.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 5000, 1, this);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onDestroy() {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Nullable\r\n        @Override\r\n        public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onStatusChanged(String provider, int status, Bundle extras) {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onProviderEnabled(String provider) {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onProviderDisabled(String provider) {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMainActivity.java\r\n\r\n    package YOU.SOLD.YOUR.SOUL;\r\n    \r\n    import android.Manifest;\r\n    import android.content.Intent;\r\n    import android.os.Bundle;\r\n    \r\n    import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\r\n    import androidx.core.app.ActivityCompat;\r\n    \r\n    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\r\n    \r\n        private static final int PERMISSION_1 = 1;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION}, PERMISSION_1);\r\n            Intent intent = new Intent(this, GPSTracker.class);\r\n            startService(intent);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPermissions added to Manifest is COARSE and FINE location.

My problem has 700 nodes, 100 variables (X1,…,X100) and 50 features. At each node, all variables have 50 features which some of features are static and some of them are dynamic. So I have 70000 rows and 50 columns in excel. At node 1 to 700 for X1 static features are fix but dynamic features are different. The same is true for other variables. \r\nMy question is whether I should aggregate data related to a variable (for example X1) and make predictions or make predictions with all 70000 records? If aggregate is better? I would like to know how aggregate data to make predictions using Random Forest.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58032986/how-to-aggregate-data-to-make-predictions","title":"How to aggregate data to make predictions?"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7300}
