Recall that 500 is the lowest possible RU for any container. For 50 GB worth of data, your minimum RU is over that. Actually it is over 2000. \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say it is 5000. Then your 5000 RU is distributed over all your physical partitions, correct. In your case one physical partition will be more than one logical ones.

One physical partition can contain multiple logical partitions.\r\n\r\nI also understand that provisioned RUs are divided equally among physical partitions.\r\n\r\n**The question..**\r\n\r\nSay I have a 500 RU limit, 1 million distinct partition key values and 50GB of data. That&#39;s 1 million logical partitions. \r\n\r\nWill the container&#39;s logical partitions be grouped on a small pool of physical partitions that are reserved exclusively for our use? E.g. among 5 physical partitions, so each partition has 100 RUs?\r\n\r\nOr will each logical partition end up being stored somewhere random on physical partitions shared with other Cosmos users?  Thus my 500 RUs is actually 500 divided by a really, really high number of physical partitions (at most 1 million), with queries likely to fail as the per-physical partition RU limit is exceeded?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that it&#39;s the former, but I want to validate this at the planning stage!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060925/cosmosdb-physical-partition-placement-ru-impact","title":"CosmosDb - physical partition placement, RU impact"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ajax","routes"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":44979,"user_id":1279683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1veuT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Marek Lipka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279683/marek-lipka"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569236368,"post_id":58060923,"comment_id":102518482,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060923/undefined-method-rails-ajax#comment102518482_58060923"},{"owner":{"reputation":2661,"user_id":2190621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2WmJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"demir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2190621/demir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569237221,"post_id":58060923,"comment_id":102518912,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060923/undefined-method-rails-ajax#comment102518912_58060923"},{"owner":{"reputation":50285,"user_id":544825,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UFdOO.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/544825/max"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569237385,"post_id":58060923,"comment_id":102518991,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060923/undefined-method-rails-ajax#comment102518991_58060923"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11226574,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10157791299717366/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sidney Schultz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11226574/sidney-schultz"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569236292,"creation_date":1569236292,"question_id":58060923,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060923","body_markdown":"I am  making this button that needs to make an ajax call.

Why can&#39;t a user copy a certificate from one Red Hat machine to another and use it there? I assume the certificate includes machine-specific values (according to the docs, they are called &quot;facts&quot;), but then...\r\n2. How are the certificates loaded and checked by the other processes? For instance, I guess that `yum` must be using these certificates. But then the `yum` CLI tool must have been patched, right? Is the source code of these changes available?\r\n3. Is the source code of the `subscription-manager` tool available?

Navigate to the project folder.\r\n\r\n2. `export JULIA_LOAD_PATH=.` (or `set JULIA_LOAD_PATH=.` on Windows)\r\n\r\n3. Start `julia`.\r\n\r\n4. `] instantiate` the project\r\n\r\n5. Run you project code (most importantly the `using` statements).\r\n\r\nThis way, julia will exclusively use the packages (and versions) as specified in the project&#39;s toml files. In particular, you will get errors for every package that doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\n**Background**: the `LOAD_PATH` (called `JULIA_LOAD_PATH` outside of Julia) variable specifies a stack of paths pointing to Julia environments. As per default, it contains three entries,\r\n\r\n    julia&gt; LOAD_PATH\r\n    3-element Array{String,1}:\r\n     &quot;@&quot;\r\n     &quot;@v#.#&quot;\r\n     &quot;@stdlib&quot;\r\n\r\nwhich expand to the current active environment (`@`) the general, say, `v.1.2` environment (`@v#.#`) and so on (see [`? LOAD_PATH`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/base/constants/#Base.LOAD_PATH) for more details). If a piece of code tries to `using` or `import` a package, Julia will look for it in the toml files in those directories in order (from top to bottom). This means that one can generally load a package `X` that is only present in the `v.1.2` environment but not in the current project (i.e. the project isn&#39;t self contained). By the procedure above we drop those paths from the `LOAD_PATH` variable and only keep the current project environment.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060881/how-do-i-check-that-a-project-manifest-is-complete-in-julia/58061587#58061587","title":"How do I check that a project manifest is complete in Julia?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1229,"user_id":7619808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHvtS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"logankilpatrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7619808/logankilpatrick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1229,"user_id":7619808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHvtS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"logankilpatrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7619808/logankilpatrick"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58061587,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569238878,"creation_date":1569236168,"last_edit_date":1569236726,"question_id":58060881,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060881","body_markdown":"I am trying to make sure that the `manifest.toml` file for my Julia project is complete such that the results of my project can be reproduced by anyone.

you&#39;re coding a library and you need to define a little helper function. Maybe you name this function `test`:\r\n\r\n    int test(int x)\r\n    {\r\n        return x &gt; 100;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis function isn&#39;t part of the public interface, so you leave it tucked away inside the .c file. And everything is good right?\r\n\r\nWrong.\r\n\r\nProblem #1: Anyone can use this function simply by adding this declaration to their code:\r\n\r\n    int test(int);\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem #2: Imagine if another library had their own `test` helper function. If that library and your library were used in the same program, the linker would error because two functions can&#39;t have the same name.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use `static`. With `static`, the functions are unique to their translation unit and aren&#39;t exposed globally.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060872/why-use-static-functions-in-c/58061359#58061359","title":"Why use static functions in C?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":7997108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce5aa2ae95a6e02d5d87ae3fd1110074?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bodega","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7997108/bodega"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":7997108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce5aa2ae95a6e02d5d87ae3fd1110074?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bodega","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7997108/bodega"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":104,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58061359,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569239639,"creation_date":1569236123,"last_edit_date":1569238548,"question_id":58060872,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060872","body_markdown":"I was reading about static functions in C on this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/a/558201/7997108\r\n\r\nAs i understood it, basically where you define the static functions is the only &quot;place&quot;/file (fileA.c i.e.) where you can call it, which kinda makes this function &quot;private&quot; to that .c or .h file (or translation unit). But if you #include this file in some other (fileB.c) you will still be able to use it there as well?\r\n\r\nSo im trying to understand in which case you want the function to be static to its own .c and how it makes sense if you can still use that &quot;private&quot;/static function by just including the file where it is defined.\r\n\r\nAlso as i understand, in case you don&#39;t include some other file where some function is defined you won&#39;t be able to use/call that function anyways right?  \r\n\r\nIn other words i just cant comprehend what is the typical use-case for static functions and how is it different from non-static function basically.

The thing is If I open MSVS and from tools-&gt;connect databases it connects successfully but from code using ado it doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nSo can anyone show me how to set the connection string and any setting I should do to be able to connect to it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060862/how-to-connect-to-sql-server-2012-databases-using-ado-in-vc-2015","title":"How to connect to SQL Server 2012 databases using ado in vC++ 2015?"},{"tags":["android","firebase","google-cloud-firestore"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569236338,"post_id":58060861,"comment_id":102518463,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060861/how-to-get-firestore-geopoint-value-in-nested-object#comment102518463_58060861"},{"owner":{"reputation":587,"user_id":5407056,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kdXIb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Latief Anwar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5407056/latief-anwar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569236645,"post_id":58060861,"comment_id":102518628,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060861/how-to-get-firestore-geopoint-value-in-nested-object#comment102518628_58060861"},{"owner":{"reputation":2567,"user_id":10182897,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hhPlJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ashish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10182897/ashish"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569237951,"post_id":58060861,"comment_id":102519310,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060861/how-to-get-firestore-geopoint-value-in-nested-object#comment102519310_58060861"},{"owner":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569239212,"post_id":58060861,"comment_id":102519951,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060861/how-to-get-firestore-geopoint-value-in-nested-object#comment102519951_58060861"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2567,"user_id":10182897,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hhPlJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ashish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10182897/ashish"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569238317,"creation_date":1569238317,"answer_id":58061532,"question_id":58060861,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58061532","body_markdown":"You post two different code and one of them provides you proper answer :\r\n\r\n    String stringGeoPoint = products.getLocation().get(&quot;geoPoint&quot;).toString();\r\n\r\nand this line of code shows null :\r\n\r\n    GeoPoint geoPoint = documentSnapshot.getGeoPoint(stringGeoPoint);\r\n\r\n**Reason :**\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the first code works properly because when you retrieving data you have created data model for the documents field. you have you method as `getLocation()` which will return the Location array.

You are able to select any version of your build instead of latest. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nRegarding **backup**, you can add a Powershell task to perform a backup of the original files or generated artifacts. \r\n\r\nThere are also a [Copy Files][2] and a [Zip Files][3] task which you can drop into your process. For example copy your `Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory` to a file share to back up your artifacts. You can even make the tasks conditional. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is no build-in &quot;**rollback**&quot; task, the normal thing to do would be to schedule a new release with the previous version to install. Or use a powershell script to invoke Rest API to create a new release.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBesides, you could also choose to install this [Release Management Utility Tasks][4] extension, you’ll see a new task called “Rollback powershell” in the task catalog. For rollback, you’ll need to add this task to the workflow.\r\n\r\nHere is a useful blog for your reference: [Implement Rollback with Release Management for TFS 2015][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/LciHM.png\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/copy-files?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=yaml\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/archive-files?view=azure-devops\r\n  [4]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.utilitytasks\r\n  [5]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/03/28/implement-rollback-with-release-management-for-tfs-2015/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060837/backup-on-tfs-release-before-deploying/58074950#58074950","title":"Backup on TFS Release before deploying"}],"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":4421327,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fd4d7694aecf5de3774c7ac6ac92cb1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TrulyXax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4421327/trulyxax"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58074950,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569309334,"creation_date":1569236047,"question_id":58060837,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060837","body_markdown":"i&#39;m kinda noobie with the TFS build/releases.\r\nSo my scenario:\r\n\r\nI have a build phase which is making an artifact.

This starts a REPL with a connected managed runtime.

Make sure your JS environment has loaded your compiled ClojureScript code.\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n\r\n 1. In VS Code open any ClojureScript file\r\n 2. Press &lt;kbd&gt;CMD&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;SHIFT&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;p&lt;/kbd&gt; and select `Calva: Start a project REPL and connect (aka Jack-in)`\r\n 3. Wait until the REPL window opens\r\n 4. Only then, open a new terminal and require your build artefact so that a connect to the REPL is made. e.g. `node -e &quot;require(&#39;./dist&#39;)&quot;`\r\n 5. Open any ClojureScript file you want to evaluate in the REPL, press &lt;kbd&gt;CMD&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;SHIFT&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;p&lt;/kbd&gt; and select `Calva: Load current namespace in the REPL window`\r\n\r\nI have attached a screencast below. As you can see:\r\n\r\n- The namespace in the CLJS REPL window isn&#39;t set to `undefined` anymore\r\n- Any change to your ClojureScript file is both automatically recompiled and available in the REPL\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7HTc.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060822/how-to-connect-a-clojurescript-node-repl-to-my-node-library-shadow-cljs-project/58064914#58064914","title":"How to connect a ClojureScript node REPL to my :node-library shadow-cljs project?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4508,"user_id":1244884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79435cc2571ffa23dfcef703f8d762e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"customcommander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1244884/customcommander"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4508,"user_id":1244884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79435cc2571ffa23dfcef703f8d762e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"customcommander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1244884/customcommander"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58064914,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569249823,"creation_date":1569235958,"last_edit_date":1569236335,"question_id":58060822,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060822","body_markdown":"**Context**\r\n\r\nI am building a Node.js library with ClojureScript and [shadow-cljs][1]. &lt;br&gt;\r\nAll development is done with ClojureScript but the build artefact is a NPM package.

And it&#39;s this pointer that I use as parameter (by ref) of my function. \r\n\r\nThe complete and functionnal Python code is following:\r\n\r\n      myDll= dllOpen(Dll)\r\n      listDev = myDll.listDevices\r\n      listDev.argtypes = [POINTER(POINTER(c_char_p)), POINTER(c_short)]\r\n      n = c_short()\r\n      devicesList = (POINTER(c_char)*10)()\r\n      pdevicesList = devicesList[0]\r\n      listDev(byref(pdevicesList),byref(n)) \r\n      for i in range(n.value):\r\n         print (&quot;-&quot;+str(i)+&quot;: &quot; + str(string_at(devicesList[i]),&#39;utf-8&#39;))\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n -0: device0\r\n -1: device1\r\n\r\nPerfect !!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060792/read-string-from-double-pointer-c-function-with-python/58063397#58063397","title":"Read string from double pointer C++ function with Python"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12105851,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZIbt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Elektron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12105851/elektron"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569244735,"creation_date":1569235845,"question_id":58060792,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060792","body_markdown":"I developed a DLL in C++ and I need to use all the functions with Python.

Am I missing another dependent plugin that might not have been upgraded?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I&#39;d be happy to change the default format of numerics to remove the thousand , separator, if that&#39;s possible with the scaffolding/fields plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060787/grails-scaffolding-is-hiding-blanking-out-large-numbers","title":"Grails scaffolding is hiding / blanking out large numbers"},{"tags":["python","selenium","xpath","css-selectors","webdriverwait"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10710153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N7JnklE7ujk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jAvvKFEKyl2QZ-ysOurlOGnqDZYQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"fairy starlight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10710153/fairy-starlight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569565600,"post_id":58060920,"comment_id":102645023,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060785/how-to-click-on-the-tab-button-using-selenium-webdriver-and-python/58060920#comment102645023_58060920"},{"owner":{"reputation":11015,"user_id":10885684,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66b93ef11f20d07cf796af83ae1ffe83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KunduK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10885684/kunduk"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10710153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N7JnklE7ujk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jAvvKFEKyl2QZ-ysOurlOGnqDZYQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"fairy starlight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10710153/fairy-starlight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569572372,"post_id":58060920,"comment_id":102648121,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060785/how-to-click-on-the-tab-button-using-selenium-webdriver-and-python/58060920#comment102648121_58060920"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11015,"user_id":10885684,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66b93ef11f20d07cf796af83ae1ffe83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KunduK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10885684/kunduk"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569236287,"creation_date":1569236287,"answer_id":58060920,"question_id":58060785,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58060920","body_markdown":"To click on the tab you need to induce `WebDriverWait` and `element_to_be_clickable()` and use below xapth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\r\n    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\r\n    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\r\n    from selenium import webdriver\r\n    \r\n    driver=webdriver.Chrome(&#39;./chromedriver.exe&#39;)\r\n    driver.get(&quot;https://www.kebhana.com/cont/mall/mall08/mall0805/index.jsp?_menuNo=62608&quot;)\r\n    WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, &quot;//div[@class=&#39;productSDiv&#39;]//li//a[contains(@onclick,&#39;spb_2812&#39;)]&quot;))).click()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060785/how-to-click-on-the-tab-button-using-selenium-webdriver-and-python/58060920#58060920","title":"How to click on the tab button using Selenium Webdriver and Python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":22920,"user_id":5168011,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb70c32e1e533e7c0cb2f9317a6b2aa3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Guy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5168011/guy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22920,"user_id":5168011,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb70c32e1e533e7c0cb2f9317a6b2aa3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Guy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5168011/guy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569237169,"last_edit_date":1569237169,"creation_date":1569236812,"answer_id":58061074,"question_id":58060785,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58061074","body_markdown":"`findElement` is Java syntax, not Python.

your comment and the async nature of the task you want to accomplish I would like to suggest using multithreading.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my example about Python multithreading using a simple ping command, you can customize it and use it as a starter.\r\n\r\nIt also contains an explanation of the risks and advantages of using multithreading and a brief description of what is the GIL in Python:\r\n\r\n    # Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\r\n    # \r\n    # Python doesn&#39;t allow multi-threading in the truest sense of the word. It has a multi-threading package\r\n    # but if you want to multi-thread to speed your code up, then it&#39;s usually not a good idea to use it.\r\n    # Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\r\n    # The GIL makes sure that only one of your &#39;threads&#39; can execute at any one time.\r\n    # A thread acquires the GIL, does a little work, then passes the GIL onto the next thread.\r\n    # This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your threads are executing in parallel,\r\n    # but they are really just taking turns using the same CPU core.\r\n    # All this GIL passing adds overhead to execution.\r\n    # This means that if you want to make your code run faster then using the threading\r\n    # package often isn&#39;t a good idea.\r\n    \r\n    # There are reasons to use Python&#39;s threading package.\r\n    # If you want to run some things simultaneously, and efficiency is not a concern,\r\n    # then it&#39;s totally fine and convenient.\r\n    # Or if you are running code that needs to wait for something (like some IO) then it could make a lot of sense.\r\n    # But the threading library won&#39;t let you use extra CPU cores.\r\n    \r\n    # Multi-threading can be outsourced to the operating system (by doing multi-processing),\r\n    # some external application that calls your Python code (eg, Spark or Hadoop), or some code that your Python\r\n    # code calls (eg: you could have your Python code call a C function that does the expensive multi-threaded stuff).\r\n    \r\n    # Why This Matters\r\n    # Because the GIL is an A-hole. Lots of people spend a lot of time trying to find bottlenecks in their fancy\r\n    # Python multi-threaded code before they learn what the GIL is.\r\n    \r\n    # Once this is clear...\r\n    # Let&#39;s get our hands dirty :)\r\n    \r\n    #!/bin/python\r\n    from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool\r\n    from subprocess import PIPE,Popen\r\n    import time\r\n    import os\r\n    \r\n    __author__ = &quot;Davide Nastri&quot;\r\n    __version__ = &quot;0.1.0&quot;\r\n    __license__ = &quot;MIT&quot;\r\n    \r\n    pool_size = 5\r\n    \r\n    def do_ping(ip):\r\n        if os.name == &#39;nt&#39;:\r\n            print (&quot;Using Windows Ping to &quot; + ip)\r\n            proc = Popen([&#39;ping&#39;, ip], stdout=PIPE)\r\n            return proc.communicate()[0]\r\n        else:\r\n            print (&quot;Using Linux Ping to &quot; + ip)\r\n            proc = Popen([&#39;ping&#39;, ip, &#39;-c&#39;, &#39;4&#39;], stdout=PIPE)\r\n            return proc.communicate()[0]\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    os.system(&#39;cls&#39; if os.name==&#39;nt&#39; else &#39;clear&#39;)\r\n    print (&quot;Running using threads\\n&quot;)\r\n    start_time = time.time()\r\n    pool = Pool(pool_size)\r\n    website_names = [&quot;www.davidenastri.it&quot;, &quot;www.google.com&quot;,&quot;www.facebook.com&quot;,&quot;www.pinterest.com&quot;,&quot;www.microsoft.com&quot;]\r\n    result = {}\r\n    for website_name in website_names:\r\n        result[website_name] = pool.apply_async(do_ping, args=(website_name,))\r\n    pool.close()\r\n    pool.join()\r\n    print (&quot;\\n--- Execution took {} seconds ---&quot;.format((time.time() - start_time)))\r\n    \r\n    # Now we do the same without threading, just to compare time\r\n    print (&quot;\\nRunning NOT using threads\\n&quot;)\r\n    start_time = time.time()\r\n    for website_name in website_names:\r\n        do_ping(website_name)\r\n    print (&quot;\\n--- Execution took {} seconds ---&quot;.format((time.time() - start_time)))\r\n    \r\n    # Here&#39;s one way to print the final output from the threads\r\n    output = {}\r\n    for key, value in result.items():\r\n        output[key] = value.get()\r\n    print (&quot;\\nOutput aggregated in a Dictionary:&quot;)\r\n    print (output)\r\n    print (&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    print (&quot;\\nPretty printed output:&quot;)\r\n    for key, value in output.items():\r\n        print (key + &quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n        print (value)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060783/design-to-aggregate-multiple-rest-apis-and-send-the-data-to-ui/58076585#58076585","title":"Design to aggregate multiple REST APIs and send the data to UI"}],"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":842035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7a673d07346876874c32e590e19a993?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lokn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/842035/lokn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":83498,"user_id":3001761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/feZwC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jonrsharpe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3001761/jonrsharpe"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58076585,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569315406,"creation_date":1569235822,"last_edit_date":1569236022,"question_id":58060783,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060783","body_markdown":"I have a requirement to aggregate multiple REST APIs and to send the data to UI.\r\n\r\nOne way I am thinking is to call all the REST APIs in multiple different threads and aggregate the result and send it to UI.

But this is the idea for calculating each period.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060760/finding-time-difference-between-rows/58060866#58060866","title":"finding time difference between rows"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":170,"user_id":1023554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32d11b06ed738d0a3cd2974fe682c9da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"syncdm2012","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1023554/syncdm2012"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569322302,"post_id":58068222,"comment_id":102551768,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060760/finding-time-difference-between-rows/58068222#comment102551768_58068222"},{"owner":{"reputation":76070,"user_id":5221944,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHLm9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikhail Berlyant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221944/mikhail-berlyant"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":170,"user_id":1023554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32d11b06ed738d0a3cd2974fe682c9da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"syncdm2012","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1023554/syncdm2012"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569327854,"post_id":58068222,"comment_id":102554788,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060760/finding-time-difference-between-rows/58068222#comment102554788_58068222"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76070,"user_id":5221944,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHLm9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikhail Berlyant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221944/mikhail-berlyant"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569263425,"creation_date":1569263425,"answer_id":58068222,"question_id":58060760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58068222","body_markdown":"Below is for BigQuery Standard SQL    \r\n\r\n    #standardSQL\r\n    WITH `project.dataset.table` AS (\r\n      SELECT 101 IssueID, TIMESTAMP &#39;2019-08-23 0:25:41&#39;

Below is the code that I mentioned:\r\n```\r\nfor i in range(1000):\r\n    if eval(f&quot;1e+{i}&quot;) != eval(f&quot;10 ** {i}&quot;):\r\n        print(i, eval(f&quot;1e+{i}&quot;), eval(f&quot;10 ** {i}&quot;))\r\n        break\r\n```\r\nWhen I run the above codes, I am getting an output like below:\r\n```\r\n23 1e+23 100000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\nWhat I wonder is, why `1e+23` is not equal to `10 ** 23`, while `1e+22` is equal to `10 ** 22`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060755/why-does-this-code-print-false-value-after-a-while","title":"Why does this code print False value after a while?"},{"tags":["php","laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":301,"user_id":10303471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZjZr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sajad Haibat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10303471/sajad-haibat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569236140,"post_id":58060754,"comment_id":102518363,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060754/how-to-print-id-specific-data#comment102518363_58060754"},{"owner":{"reputation":2143,"user_id":10314162,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e15cf1edc54d0fde7769f36cb2b8d0ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"George Hanson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10314162/george-hanson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569236140,"post_id":58060754,"comment_id":102518364,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060754/how-to-print-id-specific-data#comment102518364_58060754"},{"owner":{"reputation":485,"user_id":2669814,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/If4KI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lkdhruw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2669814/lkdhruw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569236219,"post_id":58060754,"comment_id":102518399,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060754/how-to-print-id-specific-data#comment102518399_58060754"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":754,"user_id":8319351,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yiUr8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amit Senjaliya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8319351/amit-senjaliya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":754,"user_id":8319351,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yiUr8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amit Senjaliya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8319351/amit-senjaliya"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569237048,"last_edit_date":1569237048,"creation_date":1569236547,"answer_id":58061000,"question_id":58060754,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58061000","body_markdown":"You should try to use a laravel relationship.

At the end it is just a form that creates a new record in the User table... \r\n\r\nThen you would like one login form. Fine because you can give users certain different roles. The only question remaining is that you maybe want to direct different users to a different page when they are successfully logged in. This is very easy too. Read the docs about [generating a login form][1]. At step drie you are able to redirect the user after login. \r\n\r\nMy advise would be to keep one User entity with sometimes some properties and methods that are not needed for every type of user. Use ROLES to separate different type of users, especially when you want to secure pages for some type of users. \r\n\r\nAlso read about [Hierarchical Roles][2] so that you know how to setup different roles like this little example here:\r\n\r\n    role_hierarchy:\r\n        ROLE_DRIVER:         ROLE_USER  # normal driver\r\n        ROLE_CUSTOMER:       ROLE_USER  # normal customer\r\n        ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR:  ROLE_USER  # normal administrator\r\n        ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH]  # this role is for you\r\n\r\nOne more thing you may ask yourself: What if a customer is also a driver or administrator...\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/form_login_setup.html#generating-the-login-form\r\n  [2]: https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html#hierarchical-roles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060736/symfony-multiple-users-types/58066315#58066315","title":"Symfony : Multiple Users Types"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9771521,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10204686640043114/picture?type=large","display_name":"Hamza Rouissi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9771521/hamza-rouissi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3324,"user_id":3219606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hhvlm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Al Foиce    ѫ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3219606/al-fo%d0%b8ce-%d1%ab"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569255600,"creation_date":1569235618,"last_edit_date":1569244180,"question_id":58060736,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060736","body_markdown":"I am creating an application that should have at least 3 types of users.

Below is my code:\r\n\r\n    func JSONToString(logs map[string]interface{}){\r\n        jsonLog, err := json.Marshal(logs)\r\n\t    if err != nil {\r\n\t\t    fmt.Println(err.Error())\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    jsonLogString := string(jsonLog[:len(jsonLog)])\r\n\t    logfile := &quot;/ServiceLogs/&quot; + &quot;UploadServiceLog_&quot; + currentTime.Format(&quot;2006-01-02&quot;) + &quot;.txt&quot;\r\n\t    jsonLogFile, err := os.OpenFile(logfile, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND, 0644)\r\n\t    if err != nil {\r\n\t\t    fmt.Println(err.Error())\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    defer jsonLogFile.Close()\r\n\r\n\t    jsonLogFile.WriteString(jsonLogString + &quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n\t    jsonLogFile.Close()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow what I get in logs is like \r\n\r\n&gt; {&quot;Errors&quot;:{},&quot;RequestEnd&quot;:1569214715575873000,&quot;ResponseTime&quot;:1569214715575.873,&quot;ServiceName&quot;:&quot;IMAGE_LISTING_SERVICE&quot;,&quot;Times&quot;:{&quot;BasicValidationTime&quot;:0.150016,&quot;ExtraValidationTime&quot;:0.002048,&quot;FormParsingTime&quot;:0.479232,&quot;ImagePgConnectionTime&quot;:0.31488,&quot;RequestDecodingTime&quot;:0.009216}}\r\n\r\nBut I actually wanted this:\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;{\\&quot;Errors\\&quot;:{},\\&quot;RequestEnd\\&quot;:1569214715575873000,\\&quot;ResponseTime\\&quot;:1569214715575.873,\\&quot;ServiceName\\&quot;:\\&quot;IMAGE_LISTING_SERVICE\\&quot;,\\&quot;Times\\&quot;:{\\&quot;BasicValidationTime\\&quot;:0.150016,\\&quot;ExtraValidationTime\\&quot;:0.002048,\\&quot;FormParsingTime\\&quot;:0.479232,\\&quot;ImagePgConnectionTime\\&quot;:0.31488,\\&quot;RequestDecodingTime\\&quot;:0.009216}}&quot;\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how to achieve this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58060725/properly-converting-json-to-string","title":"Properly converting JSON to string"},{"tags":["jenkins","jenkins-pipeline"],"owner":{"reputation":4735,"user_id":95750,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5666019ae946f06e81d3729416b76d9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"haridsv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/95750/haridsv"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4735,"user_id":95750,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5666019ae946f06e81d3729416b76d9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"haridsv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/95750/haridsv"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569254900,"creation_date":1569235591,"last_edit_date":1569254900,"question_id":58060724,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58060724","body_markdown":"We have a few classes in the shared library where we have to access the pipeline steps using the DSL object, so I thought he below code would work:\r\n\r\n*Version 1*\r\n\r\n    class T {\r\n        def dsl\r\n\r\n        def T(def dsl) {\r\n            this.dsl = dsl\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        def F() {\r\n            this.dsl.with {\r\n                echo &quot;Hello World&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    new T(this).F()\r\n\r\nHowever, it generates the below script security exception:\r\n\r\n    Scripts not permitted to use method groovy.lang.GroovyObject invokeMethod java.lang.String java.lang.Object (T echo java.lang.String). Administrators can decide whether to approve or reject this signature.\r\n    [Pipeline] End of Pipeline\r\n    org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.sandbox.RejectedAccessException: Scripts not permitted to use method groovy.lang.GroovyObject invokeMethod java.lang.String java.lang.Object (T echo java.lang.String)\r\n\r\nIt looks like `dsl.with { echo ... }` doesn&#39;t translate to `dsl.echo` and instead it results in a lookup of the `echo` method on the `class T`. Assuming it is some closure delegate issue, I tried the below, and it still didn&#39;t work (same error as above):\r\n\r\n*Version 2*\r\n\r\n    def withDsl(def body) {\r\n        body.delegate = this\r\n        this.with body\r\n    }\r\n        \r\n    class T {\r\n        def dsl\r\n\r\n        def T(def dsl) {\r\n            this.dsl = dsl\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        def F() {\r\n            dsl.withDsl {\r\n                echo &quot;Hello World&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    new T(this).F()\r\n\r\nIt finally worked when I created a wrapper on top of DSL and created methods that simply delegated the calls to DSL. I also had to modify the closure&#39;s delegate to get it working:\r\n\r\n*Version 3*\r\n\r\n    class MyDsl {\r\n        def dsl\r\n        \r\n        def MyDsl(def dsl) {\r\n            this.dsl = dsl\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        def echo(msg) {\r\n            dsl.echo msg        \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    def withDsl(def body) {\r\n        def mydsl = new MyDsl(this)\r\n        body.delegate = mydsl\r\n        mydsl.with body\r\n    }\r\n        \r\n    class T {\r\n        def dsl\r\n\r\n        def T(def dsl) {\r\n            this.dsl = dsl\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        def F() {\r\n            dsl.withDsl {\r\n                echo &quot;Hello World&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    new T(this).F()\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain why the first two versions wouldn&#39;t work?

This is done by adding/removing the UITableView object to an array of its class. If the table has been selected (user has been added to the array) the accessoryType for that cell changes to checkmark and when the user is removed it changes back to none.\r\n\r\n    var selectedUsers = [User]()\r\n    \r\n        func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n            if let cell = tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath) as?
