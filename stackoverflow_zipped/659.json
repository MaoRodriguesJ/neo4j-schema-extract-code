The selector `.tribe-events-week .tribe-events-tooltip` also carries four points of specifity, but note the space here -- this denotes that `.tribe-events-week` is an ancestor of `.tribe-events-tooltip`.\r\n\r\nWhen specificity results in a tie (as is likely your case), the rules override one another as they get applied in the DOM. As such, the **last** valid selector to get applied takes effect. Based on how you structure your HTML, this is likely in the last *stylesheet* that you load in the HTML.\r\n\r\nNote that even when a selector is referenced earlier in the DOM, it will still take effect if it has more specificity:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .tribe-events-tooltip.tribe-event-featured {\r\n      color: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .tribe-events-tooltip {\r\n      color: blue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;tribe-events-tooltip tribe-event-featured&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThis can be seen when you inspect the element in the F12 Developer console (note the strike-through):\r\n\r\n[![Specificity override][2]][2]\r\n\r\nAs such, you can simply chain classes (or other selectors) together to override the specificity. In this specific example I would try simply targetting `.tribe-events-shortcode.view-week`, and add additional selectors to it if necessary.\r\n\r\nYou *can* make use of [the `!important` declaration][3] to have an almost-certain way of ensuring that your styles always apply, but where possible, you should try to avoid doing so (as you could end up having the same problem when trying to override the `!important` declaration itself), and instead opt for improving the specificity of your selector.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUpEY.png\r\n  [3]: https://www.developeracademy.io/blog/css-important-rule-use-correctly/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384758/stylesheet-importance/58384833#58384833","title":"Stylesheet Importance"}],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":1275349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5307619eedaeb1ff4cb07abe82b5ab5b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Justin Lucas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1275349/justin-lucas"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58384833,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571093496,"creation_date":1571091710,"question_id":58384758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384758","body_markdown":"The problem: CSS custom style overrides not taking place.\r\n\r\nThe actual html:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;tribe-events-tooltip-109-2019-11-01&quot; class=&quot;tribe-events-tooltip tribe-event-featured&quot; style=&quot;bottom: 71px; display: none;&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nMy current function for queuing the stylesheets:\r\n\r\n    function my_enqueues(){\r\n\r\n    wp_enqueue_style( &#39;bootstrap&#39;, get_template_directory_uri() . &#39;/css/bootstrap.min.css&#39;, array(), null, &#39;all&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    wp_enqueue_style( &#39;tribe&#39;, get_template_directory_uri() . &#39;/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/src/resources/css/tribe-events-theme.min.css&#39;, array( &#39;bootstrap&#39;), null, &#39;all&#39; );\r\n    \r\n    wp_enqueue_style( &#39;bootstrap&#39;, get_template_directory_uri() . &#39;/style.css&#39;, array( &#39;tribe&#39; ), null, &#39;all&#39;); }\r\n\r\n    add_action( &#39;wp_enqueue_scripts&#39;, &#39;my_enqueues&#39; );\r\n\r\nSelectors referenced in Chrome Inspection:\r\n\r\n    .recurring-info-tooltip, .tribe-events-calendar .tribe-events-tooltip, .tribe-events-shortcode.view-week .tribe-events-tooltip, .tribe-events-week .tribe-events-tooltip {\r\n\r\nWhat I add that does not work:\r\n\r\n    .tribe-event-featured{border: solid #567175;}\r\n\r\nWhat I add that DOES WORK:\r\n\r\n    .recurring-info-tooltip, .tribe-events-calendar .tribe-events-tooltip, .tribe-events-shortcode.view-week .tribe-events-tooltip, .tribe-events-week .tribe-events-tooltip {border: solid #567175;}\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried this from multiple angles, likeso above with functions and another function that claimed would override all stylesheets. So far I can&#39;t get it to stick. It would appear it won&#39;t stick because of how many selectors are being referenced for this bit of CSS and thus it gains importance no matter in what order it is laid out. Unless I&#39;m wrong? \r\n\r\nI would prefer not having to add 10xxx selectors every time I want to make a small change to the theme. Nor do I want to put the custom CSS in the backend so it is implied inline in the code.  Is there a solution that will actually work so that my stylesheet is considered the master style sheet and will always over write other plugins css no matter how many selectors the original css has? \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384758/stylesheet-importance","title":"Stylesheet Importance"},{"tags":["c#","html-agility-pack"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571092130,"post_id":58384757,"comment_id":103117514,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384757/c-htmlagilitypack-extract-outer-scope-matched-value-tabletable-table-t#comment103117514_58384757"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5621,"user_id":1249472,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e7d2ac9163237829d11cbf4ee7d563d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nikita","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1249472/nikita"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571093306,"creation_date":1571093306,"answer_id":58384962,"question_id":58384757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384962","body_markdown":"Start XPath expression with `/` to explicitly specify matching relative to the root of the document, e.g. `&quot;/table/tr&quot;`.

Java, you cannot assign anything to a variable marked as `final` except in declaration.

So what you may need to do with this particular code is to move variable declarations into closure, removing `final` modifier.

I then proceeded to write the test for it and I obviously had to generate a mock exception which I did as follows:\r\n\r\n**module/query_bq**\r\n\r\n    from py4j.protocol import Py4JJavaError\r\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\n    def submit_bq_query(spark, table, filter_string):\r\n        try:\r\n            df = spark.read.format(&#39;bigquery&#39;).option(&#39;table&#39;, table).option(&#39;filter&#39;, filter_string).load()\r\n            return df\r\n        except Py4JJavaError as e:\r\n            java_error_msg = str(e).split(&#39;\\n&#39;)[1]\r\n            if &quot;java.lang.RuntimeException&quot; in java_error_msg and (&quot;{} not found&quot;.format(table)) in java_error_msg:\r\n                raise Exception(&quot;RuntimeException: Table {} not found!&quot;.format(table))\r\n\r\nAs I said, this works like a charm. Now, the test for it looks like this:\r\n\r\n**module/test_query_bq**\r\n\r\n    import pytest\r\n    from mock import patch, mock\r\n    from py4j.java_gateway import GatewayProperty, GatewayClient, JavaObject\r\n    from py4j.protocol import Py4JJavaError\r\n    from pyspark.sql.dataframe import DataFrame\r\n    from pyspark.sql.types import StructType\r\n\r\n\r\n    def mock_p4j_java_error_generator(msg):\r\n        gateway_property = GatewayProperty(auto_field=&quot;Mock&quot;, pool=&quot;Mock&quot;)\r\n        client = GatewayClient(gateway_property=gateway_property)\r\n        java_object = JavaObject(&quot;RunTimeError&quot;, client)\r\n        exception = Py4JJavaError(msg, java_exception=java_object)\r\n        return Exception(exception)\r\n\r\n\r\n    def test_exception_is_thrown_if_table_not_present():\r\n\r\n        # Given\r\n        mock_table_name = &#39;spark_bq_test.false_table_name&#39;\r\n        mock_filter = &quot;word is &#39;V&#39;&quot;\r\n        mock_errmsg = &quot;Table {} not found&quot;.format(mock_table_name)\r\n\r\n        # Mocking\r\n        mock_spark = mock.Mock()\r\n        mock_spark_reader = mock.Mock()\r\n\r\n        # Mocking return-values setup\r\n        mock_spark.read.format.return_value = mock_spark_reader\r\n        mock_spark_reader.option.return_value = mock_spark_reader\r\n        mock_spark_reader.load.side_effect = mock_p4j_java_error_generator(mock_errmsg)\r\n\r\n        # When\r\n        with pytest.raises(Exception) as exception:\r\n            submit_bq_query(mock_spark, mock_table_name, mock_filter)\r\n        assert exception.value.message.errmsg == mock_errmsg\r\n\r\nRunning the test succeeds, **but** when I try to debug it, just to follow the execution, I notice that the code just after the exception is caught:\r\n\r\n**module/query_bq**\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n        except Py4JJavaError as e:\r\n            java_error_msg = str(e).split(&#39;\\n&#39;)[1] .  # This line is never reached!\r\n            if &quot;java.lang.RuntimeException&quot; in java_error_msg and (&quot;{} not found&quot;.format(table)) in java_error_msg:\r\n                raise Exception(&quot;RuntimeException: Table {} not found!&quot;.format(table))\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nis never reached. Nevertheless, *the test, still, does succeed*.\r\n\r\nIn short, the exception is mocked and thrown as should in the test. It is also caught but it is not handled. The test&#39;s assertion passes and the test is successful as if it was handled when it is not, but I never get to inspect the insides of the mock exception. Once more, let me note that **module/query_bq** works against the server just fine; returns `dataframes` and handles exceptions just fine when a table is not present! The point here is testing.\r\n\r\nI need to do additional things to the handling part of the exception in **module/query_bq**, but I can&#39;t &#39;cause I don&#39;t know what is happening. Can anyone explain?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-bigquery-connector","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384719/pyspark-mocking-exception-test-succeeds-but-exception-is-not-handled","title":"PySpark Mocking: Exception Test Succeeds but Exception is not handled"},{"tags":["python","lxml"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2918,"user_id":9448090,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/600951510246447/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jack Fleeting","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9448090/jack-fleeting"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571096616,"creation_date":1571096616,"answer_id":58385349,"question_id":58384718,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58385349","body_markdown":"If I understand you correctly, there&#39;s a somewhat strange way to get there and it works at least with your stripped down xml above - so if it fits your needs, it may be good enough...\r\n\r\n    myx = &quot;&quot;&quot;[your xml snippet]&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs\r\n    soup = bs(myx,&#39;html.parser&#39;) #yup, html parser...\r\n    for i in soup:           \r\n        if &#39;ENTITY&#39; in i and &#39;SYSTEM&#39; in i:\r\n            one = i.split(&#39;SYSTEM&#39;)\r\n            two = one[1].split(&#39;NDATA&#39;)\r\n            print(two[0])\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&gt;    somegraphic1.cgm\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  somegraphic2.cgm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384718/get-list-of-entities-in-doctype-of-xml-file/58385349#58385349","title":"get list of entities in doctype of xml file"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":10172067,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fQpRY0cNEbk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/30QlcZDfsAM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kibukj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10172067/kibukj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":116,"user_id":10172067,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fQpRY0cNEbk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/30QlcZDfsAM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kibukj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10172067/kibukj"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571166516,"last_edit_date":1571166516,"creation_date":1571165382,"answer_id":58400951,"question_id":58384718,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400951","body_markdown":"libxml2 has a function [xmlGetDocEntity(doc, name)][1] which returns an object representing the entity, with a field [URI][2] containing the unparsed entity URI.

We may have some OOMs (out of memory), but the numbers don&#39;t align up, I expect to see some crashes, some users reported it.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/t3UwT.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/legjH.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nl92u.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384707/what-is-needed-for-crashes-to-show-up-after-fabric-firebase-migration","title":"What is needed for crashes to show up after Fabric Firebase migration?"},{"tags":["ssl","heroku","cloudflare"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":570,"user_id":756514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2MHda.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jon B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/756514/jon-b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571099528,"post_id":58384706,"comment_id":103118955,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384706/connecting-cloudflare-to-heroku-with-full-ssl-for-free-problem-with-uploading#comment103118955_58384706"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12216970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/673f148bb3458252295cfb6506597608?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryuki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216970/ryuki"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":570,"user_id":756514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2MHda.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jon B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/756514/jon-b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571120828,"post_id":58384706,"comment_id":103123721,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384706/connecting-cloudflare-to-heroku-with-full-ssl-for-free-problem-with-uploading#comment103123721_58384706"},{"owner":{"reputation":570,"user_id":756514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2MHda.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jon B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/756514/jon-b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571120977,"post_id":58384706,"comment_id":103123780,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384706/connecting-cloudflare-to-heroku-with-full-ssl-for-free-problem-with-uploading#comment103123780_58384706"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12216970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/673f148bb3458252295cfb6506597608?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryuki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216970/ryuki"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571091328,"creation_date":1571091328,"question_id":58384706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384706","body_markdown":"I am trying to ensure that https://www.my-site.com works, or in other words, the green lock appears next to the url of my site.

Here is my code in didFinishLaunching\r\n\r\n    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -&gt; Bool {\r\n        // Override point for customization after application launch.\r\n        notificationCenter.delegate = self\r\n        FirebaseApp.configure()  //Firebase\r\n        Database.database().isPersistenceEnabled = true\r\n        Messaging.messaging().delegate = self\r\n        \r\n        GIDSignIn.sharedInstance().clientID = FirebaseApp.app()?.options.clientID //google sign-in\r\n        application.registerForRemoteNotifications()\r\n        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self //Notifications\r\n        let authOptions: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .badge, .sound]\r\n        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: authOptions) {_,_ in }\r\n        UIApplication.shared.applicationIconBadgeNumber = 0\r\n        \r\n        UINavigationBar.appearance().barStyle = .blackOpaque\r\n        \r\n        // set up your background color view\r\n        let colorView = UIView()\r\n        colorView.backgroundColor = UIColor.white.withAlphaComponent(0.4)\r\n        \r\n        // use UITableViewCell.appearance() to configure\r\n        // the default appearance of all UITableViewCells in your app\r\n        UITableViewCell.appearance().selectedBackgroundView = colorView\r\n        \r\n        getAllData() //function that gets all data\r\n        \r\n        if updatedToNewDataSystem == nil { //var that confirms if it was in new location (nil means no, true is yes, and false is new user)\r\n            runWithStandardUserDefaults() //moves data to new location\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        signInController.setup() //check if user is signed in\r\n        \r\n        return true\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLastly, here are some logs that I found did not appear when the app was working correctly:\r\n\r\n    2019-10-14 16:26:40.421963-0400 SHS Assistant[443:24394] [] tcp_input [C3.1:3] flags=[R] seq=1279028434, ack=0, win=0 state=LAST_ACK rcv_nxt=1279028434, snd_una=3119232704 \r\n    2019-10-14 16:26:40.425750-0400 SHS Assistant[443:24394] [] tcp_input [C3.1:3] flags=[R] seq=1279028434, ack=0, win=0 state=CLOSED rcv_nxt=1279028434, snd_una=3119232704\r\n    2019-10-14 16:26:40.427276-0400 SHS Assistant[443:24394] [] tcp_input [C3.1:3] flags=[R] seq=1279028434, ack=0, win=0 state=CLOSED rcv_nxt=1279028434, snd_una=3119232704\r\n\r\n\r\nI really appreciate any help I can get on this issue!

is a literal answer - I suspect there may be more to it so I can update as needed.\r\n\r\nStart with a structure similar to yours\r\n\r\n    people\r\n       uid_0 //the user whom the current user liked,\r\n          peopleWholike2\r\n             uid_1: 123456 //the current user with a timestamp\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s one way to get directly to the timestamp: 123456. I added some extra vars so you can see the path and self.ref points to my Firebase.\r\n\r\n    func readChildTimestamp() {\r\n        let peopleRef = self.ref.child(&quot;people&quot;)\r\n        let thisPersonRef = peopleRef.child(&quot;uid_1&quot;)\r\n        let peopleThatLikeThisPersonRef = thisPersonRef.child(&quot;peopleWhoLike2&quot;)\r\n        peopleThatLikeThisPersonRef.observeSingleEvent(of: .childAdded, with: { snapshot in\r\n            let personUidKey = snapshot.key\r\n            let timestamp = snapshot.value as? Int ?? 0\r\n            print(personUidKey, timestamp)\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI leveraged .childAdded in this case because it only will ever read the first node when used with .observeSingleEvent. In your question you are looking for that specific timestamp so this will do it.\r\n\r\n**Edit**:\r\n\r\nBased on some additional information we need to expand this answer. It appears there may be multiple child nodes within the peopleWhoLikeMe2 node like this\r\n\r\n    people\r\n       uid_0\r\n          peopleWholike2\r\n             uid_1: 123\r\n             uid_2: 456\r\n             uid_3: 789\r\n\r\nSuppose user with uid_3 logs in and wants to read their timestamp from uid_0&#39;s node. Here&#39;s the code\r\n\r\n    func readChildTimestamp() {\r\n        let myUid = &quot;uid_3&quot; //this is the currently logged in user\r\n        let peopleRef = self.ref.child(&quot;people&quot;)\r\n        let thisPersonRef = peopleRef.child(&quot;uid_0&quot;)\r\n        let peopleThatLikeThisPersonRef = thisPersonRef.child(&quot;peopleWhoLike2&quot;)\r\n        let myRef = peopleThatLikeThisPersonRef.child(myUid)\r\n        myRef.observeSingleEvent(of: .value, with: { snapshot in\r\n            let personUidKey = snapshot.key\r\n            let timestamp = snapshot.value as? Int ?? 0\r\n            print(personUidKey, timestamp)\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand the out is\r\n\r\n    uid_3 789\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384696/how-can-a-timestamp-nestled-in-a-firebase-double-or-string-be-retrieved-via-sn/58402090#58402090","title":"How can a timestamp (nestled in a firebase Double or String) be retrieved via snapshot as an int for use in an if statement?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":4774142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e66664920bb3a43b46591ddcc6555d6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SeattleSurfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4774142/seattlesurfer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58402090,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571763379,"creation_date":1571091275,"last_edit_date":1571091484,"question_id":58384696,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384696","body_markdown":"The question seems easy bit it is a bit more complicated.

this is not a correct way to lock as it does not unlock object in case of an exception (as shown in the code in the post) or in general allows mismatching lock/unlock pairs.\r\n\r\n         img.Lock();\r\n         img.Write(); // exception causes object to never unlock\r\n         img.Unlock();\r\n\r\nPossible solutions for this particular issue:\r\n\r\n- require `try`/`finally` for every place you use `Lock` to unlock inside `finally`. \r\n- You can also expose `m_lock` as read-only property and let callers just use `lock {...}` statement. There is no particular benefits of hiding the object if you have to expose pair of methods as alternative as both approaches allow to end up with mismatched locking pair (also with object it requires explicit effort). And there is obvious drawback of two methods as there is no syntactic sugar to write correct code\r\n\r\n        public object TheLock { get { return m_lock; } }\r\n- move locking inside each method that accesses shared data so callers can&#39;t get it wrong for single method call. \r\n\r\n        public void Write()\r\n        {\r\n            lock(m_lock)\r\n            {\r\n            // …\r\n            }\r\n        }        \r\n\r\n- have method that runs whatever code you want inside a lock &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;sup&gt; :\r\n \r\n        class Image { ...\r\n          public T SafeOperation&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;Image, T&gt; operation)\r\n          {\r\n              Lock();\r\n              try \r\n              {\r\n                  return operation(this);\r\n              }\r\n              finally\r\n              {\r\n                   Unlock();\r\n              }\r\n          }\r\n        …}\r\n     \r\n        img.SafeOperation(x =&gt; x.Write());\r\n     \r\n\r\nNote that generally you need to have locking at higher level than individual objects to avoid spending all execution time on locking and releasing locks. Switching to immutable data structures as hinted by  mjwills in comments may simplify code...\r\n\r\n&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; As Christopher pointed out using `lock` statement would be simpler even for code inside the class and custom `Lock`/`Unlock` methods has no particular benefits there (as exactly the same code generated for `lock { … }`. Exposing lock object outside of the class (to use `lock` outside) has the same problems of misuse that object as `Lock`/`Unlock` pair that allows to lock incorrectly.&lt;/sub&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384687/locking-access-to-an-object-to-edit-it/58385131#58385131","title":"Locking access to an object to edit it"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":88100,"user_id":477420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0eb05243292dee6726c128660d31583b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexei Levenkov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/477420/alexei-levenkov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571099792,"post_id":58385603,"comment_id":103119003,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384687/locking-access-to-an-object-to-edit-it/58385603#comment103119003_58385603"},{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":88100,"user_id":477420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0eb05243292dee6726c128660d31583b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexei Levenkov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/477420/alexei-levenkov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571106248,"post_id":58385603,"comment_id":103120065,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384687/locking-access-to-an-object-to-edit-it/58385603#comment103120065_58385603"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571099423,"last_edit_date":1571099423,"creation_date":1571098937,"answer_id":58385603,"question_id":58384687,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58385603","body_markdown":"Yes, in order to lock you need a shared resource. That is how [lock/mutext pattern synchronsiation][1] works.\r\n\r\nYou did the first part right, by having a dedicated mutex object (m_lock) to point Monitor at.\r\n\r\nYou seem to have a wierd, unexplainable issue with using the lock statement. You seem intent on calling Monitor.Enter() and .Exit(). This makes absolutely no sense, makes the code more verbose and orders more prone to error. Please just stop doing that.\r\n\r\n    function or property{\r\n      lock(mutex){\r\n        //do your Work here\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\nThis is the minimum amount you can do for synchronsiation.\r\n\r\nIt is also the maximum you can do from inside that class.\r\n\r\n**There are race conditions that no class code has any hope of preventing.** \r\nOnly the calling code can prevent those.\r\n\r\nThat is likely *why* we do not have a [concurrent list][2] - Index Race conditions. The index becomming invalid, because someone added or removed something from it since getting that Index.\r\n\r\n - Preventing Add() and Remove() Race Conditons? Not a problem. Use my above sample code.\r\n - Preventing Index Race Condtions? Not a chance. Class code has the chance of a Snowball during the big bang to prevent that particular race condition.\r\n\r\nBag, Queue or Stack? Do not have a index to use, only add/remove or equivalents. Not a problem.\r\nDictionary? Uses a key. No race condition danger here. And yes, you can totally use `ConcurrentDictionary&lt;int, T&gt;` instead of List&lt;T&gt;.\r\n\r\nArray, List or anything else with a Index?

But now I need to temporarily serve a static html file from the api so my host name can be verified by a load testing service. The html loads just fine when I run locally (either via IIS Express or my local Docker instance). But it simply will not load from my AKS k8s instance. I don’t know where to go from here.\r\n\r\nHere is my app configuration…\r\n\r\n```\r\n        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)\r\n        {\r\n            if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n            {\r\n                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.\r\n                app.UseHsts();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            app.UseRouting();\r\n            app.UseStaticFiles();\r\n            app.AddMonitorEndpoint(&quot;/heartbeat&quot;);\r\n            app.AddPathReturnEndpoint();\r\n\r\n            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                endpoints.MapControllers();\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my program startup...\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args )\r\n            {\r\n            var root = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, &quot;wwwroot&quot;);\r\n            Console.WriteLine($&quot;New Web Root path: {root}&quot;);\r\n            return WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n                .UseWebRoot(root)\r\n                .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see above I&#39;m trying to force Kestrel to use my web content folder (wwroot). I thought this might fix things but it didn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nFinally, here is my ingress yaml (extracted from my k8s instance)...\r\n\r\n```\r\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\r\nkind: Ingress\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\r\n  creationTimestamp: &quot;2019-10-11T21:58:57Z&quot;\r\n  generation: 6\r\n  labels:\r\n

route) succeeding and the static content request responding with 404.\r\n\r\n```\r\n?[40m?[32minfo?[39m?[22m?[49m: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[1]\r\n      Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET

advance!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384685/serving-static-content-using-asp-net-core-hosted-in-a-linux-docker-container-and","title":"Serving static content using Asp.net core

 ⋮       ⋮        ⋮       ⋮       ⋮        ⋮\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I want to rename the timestamps according to time order, ie. the `x0` replacing the first timestamp, `x1` the second ...\r\n\r\nI checked the `df.pivot_table` documentation and couldn&#39;t find a relevant function that sorts time series. And discussion on [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47152691/how-to-pivot-a-dataframe) did not help me with this problem.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384682/how-to-transpose-time-series-by-unique-values-in-a-column","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How to transpose time-series by unique values in a column"},{"tags":["ios","swift","interface-builder","custom-view"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2683,"user_id":3564632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f1242cf9c44778bb0d9ab17ba71eb17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"denis_lor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3564632/denis-lor"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2683,"user_id":3564632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f1242cf9c44778bb0d9ab17ba71eb17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"denis_lor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3564632/denis-lor"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571124257,"last_edit_date":1571124257,"creation_date":1571123799,"answer_id":58389175,"question_id":58384681,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58389175","body_markdown":"I think that any size related adjustments should be put in `layoutSubviews`.\r\n\r\n    override func layoutSubviews() {\r\n       super.layoutSubviews()\r\n       setupView()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might use `prepareForInterfaceBuilder` to populate some samples data, for example to preview in the IB, but you shouldn’t recall the setup you already did in `init` methods (like `setupView()`).\r\n\r\nYou can also omit the `init` methods I guess and simplify everything down to:\r\n\r\n    import Foundation\r\n    import UIKit\r\n    \r\n    @IBDesignable\r\n    class FALabel : UILabel {\r\n    \r\n        @IBInspectable\r\n        public var icon: String = &quot;&quot;

The layout group forces the child component to fit its height, and the aspect ratio fitter actively increases the child componenet width to match the aspect ratio of the image, make it nice and responsive. wide screens will see more children at once, narrow screens will see less and more will overflow, but since it is a scroll rect that is no problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that **I am not allowed to set the aspect ratio fitter on the children when the parent has a layout group**. (there is a warning on the component about this) and when I click play it behaves weird, the children looses their width and get stacked on top of each other.\r\n\r\n**So my question is.**\r\nWhat settings should I use on the layout group (and/or) the content size fitter? And what settings should I use on the child image, in order to get:\r\n\r\n - child height = 100%\r\n - child width = height * aspect ratio of image *(without using aspect ratio fitter)*\r\n\r\n  [1]:

How can I re-structure the code so that I can derive the Id from the `String` payload at entry point? Should conversion to Document and Id mapping move to a common interface? Some ideas or suggestions about what pattern I can use in this instance or code examples will be much appreciated. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384629/using-one-mapping-implementation-across-multiple-services","title":"Using one mapping implementation across multiple services"},{"tags":["c++","class","dynamic-memory-allocation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2175,"user_id":2878796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8bxWv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"UnholySheep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2878796/unholysheep"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571090950,"post_id":58384627,"comment_id":103117222,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384627/dynamic-allocation-for-class-members-in-c#comment103117222_58384627"},{"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":10778288,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cKdVS1J_9k8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADY/lsYrvZhirh8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ballow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10778288/ballow"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2175,"user_id":2878796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8bxWv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"UnholySheep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2878796/unholysheep"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571091100,"post_id":58384627,"comment_id":103117262,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384627/dynamic-allocation-for-class-members-in-c#comment103117262_58384627"},{"owner":{"reputation":2175,"user_id":2878796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8bxWv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"UnholySheep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2878796/unholysheep"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571091126,"post_id":58384627,"comment_id":103117276,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384627/dynamic-allocation-for-class-members-in-c#comment103117276_58384627"},{"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":10778288,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cKdVS1J_9k8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADY/lsYrvZhirh8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ballow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10778288/ballow"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2175,"user_id":2878796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8bxWv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"UnholySheep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2878796/unholysheep"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571091226,"post_id":58384627,"comment_id":103117298,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384627/dynamic-allocation-for-class-members-in-c#comment103117298_58384627"},{"owner":{"reputation":367768,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571091699,"post_id":58384627,"comment_id":103117432,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384627/dynamic-allocation-for-class-members-in-c#comment103117432_58384627"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23009,"user_id":1312406,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5418f577abfa7c529dd026723462b440?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Paul Evans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312406/paul-evans"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571091782,"creation_date":1571091782,"answer_id":58384770,"question_id":58384627,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384770","body_markdown":"You don&#39;t find the size of your stack like this:\r\n\r\n    int n_maxim = sizeof(stackArray) / sizeof(int);\r\n\r\nbecause that&#39;s just the `sizeof` a pointer divided by the `sizeof` an `int` and  that&#39;ll probably be `1`.\r\n\r\nYou want something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n    class Stack {\r\n    private:\r\n            int *stackArray;\r\n            int topLevel;\r\n            int n_maxim;\r\n\r\n    public:\r\n            // Constructor without par\r\n            Stack() {\r\n                stackArray = new int[NMAX];\r\n                topLevel = -1;

main problem is that your paragraphs have margins that are pushing out over the boundary of the parent div.\r\n\r\nThis is causing the buttons to be pushed down.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things you can do. \r\n\r\n---\r\nAdd an Overflow Scroll property:\r\n---\r\n\r\n    #advanced, #basic {\r\n      overflow-y: scroll;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tells the `advanced` and `basic` tabs to not exceed the limits they&#39;re assigned in the DOM, and to scroll if they do! \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js

advancedView.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n\r\n    basicButton.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n      advancedView.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n

#advanced p {\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBasically what&#39;s screwing up your layout right now are the margins on the paragraph tags within your separate tabs. You **can** fix this simply by removing them - short and simple. The problem lies in you having to keep an eye on the content of the divs so that they never spill over their container. If this is likely, great! If it isn&#39;t it would be best to use one of the other answers above!\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var basicView = document.getElementById(&quot;basic&quot;);\r\n    var advancedView = document.getElementById(&quot;advanced&quot;);\r\n\r\n    var basicButton = document.getElementById(&quot;basicButton&quot;);\r\n    var advancedButton = document.getElementById(&quot;advancedButton&quot;);\r\n\r\n\r\n    function sameSize(from, to) {\r\n     let el = getComputedStyle(from);\r\n     [&quot;height&quot;, &quot;width&quot;].forEach(p =&gt; to.style[p] = el[p]);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    sameSize(advancedView, basicView);\r\n\r\n    advancedView.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n\r\n    basicButton.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n      advancedView.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n      basicView.style.display = &quot;block&quot;;\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    advancedButton.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n      advancedView.style.display = &quot;block&quot;;\r\n      basicView.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n    })\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    #basic {\r\n      background-color: rgb(255,0,0,.2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #advanced {\r\n      background-color: rgb(155,145,0,.2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .buttonbar {\r\n      flex-direction:row;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .button {\r\n      display: inline-block;\r\n      background-color: gainsboro;\r\n      padding: 4px 8px;\r\n      cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n    .button:hover {\r\n      background-color: silver;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #basic p, #advanced p {\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;basic&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world basic&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;advanced&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;buttonbar&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;basicButton&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\r\n        Basic\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;advancedButton&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\r\n        Advanced\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\nGrid-Area:\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother cool recent addition to the CSS spec is `CSS Grid`. \r\n\r\nYou can use `display: grid` on a parent element, and then assign the layout a number of ways.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way is to use `grid-area` on each of the children you&#39;d like to layout, and give them a name. This allows you to easily swap/adjust the layout by changing `grid-template-areas` with a string that defines where the children should be located, by name. A.e.\r\n\r\n    .parent {\r\n      display: grid;\r\n      grid-template-areas: &quot;a b c&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n    .childLeft {\r\n     grid-area: a;\r\n    }\r\n    .childMiddle {\r\n     grid-area: b;\r\n    }\r\n    .childRight {\r\n     grid-area: c;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nWithin your code using this pattern is great because it actually allows you to deal with any number of tabs as needed with a few changes of CSS and this change to your JavaScript:\r\n\r\n    document.querySelectorAll( &quot;.buttonbar div&quot; )\r\n    \t.forEach( element =&gt; {\r\n    \t\tlet tabID = element.id.replace( &quot;Button&quot;, &quot;&quot; ), \r\n        elementTab = document.querySelector(&quot;#container #&quot; + tabID),\r\n        otherTabs = document.querySelectorAll( &quot;#container  div:not([id=&#39;&quot; + tabID + &quot;&#39;])&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        //on btn click\r\n        element.addEventListener( &quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n          //hide other tabs\r\n          otherTabs.forEach( tab =&gt; {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\ttab.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t});\r\n          //show clicked tab\r\n    \t\t\t\telementTab.style.display = &quot;block&quot;;\r\n          //change template area\r\n    \t\t\t\tcontainer.style.gridTemplateAreas = &quot;&#39;&quot; + tabID + &quot;&#39;&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t} );\r\n    \t} )\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let container = document.querySelector( &quot;#container&quot; );\r\n\r\n    document.querySelectorAll( &quot;.buttonbar div&quot; )\r\n    \t.forEach( element =&gt; {\r\n    \t\tlet tabID = element.id.replace( &quot;Button&quot;, &quot;&quot; ), \r\n        elementTab = document.querySelector(&quot;#container #&quot; + tabID),\r\n        otherTabs = document.querySelectorAll( &quot;#container  div:not([id=&#39;&quot; + tabID + &quot;&#39;])&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        //on btn click\r\n        element.addEventListener( &quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n          //hide other tabs\r\n          otherTabs.forEach( tab =&gt; {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\ttab.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t});\r\n          //show clicked tab\r\n    \t\t\t\telementTab.style.display = &quot;block&quot;;\r\n          //change template area\r\n    \t\t\t\tcontainer.style.gridTemplateAreas = &quot;&#39;&quot; + tabID + &quot;&#39;&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\t} );\r\n    \t} )\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    #basic {\r\n      background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0, .2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #advanced {\r\n      background-color: rgb(155, 145, 0, .2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .buttonbar {\r\n      flex-direction: row;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .button {\r\n      display: inline-block;\r\n      background-color: gainsboro;\r\n      padding: 4px 8px;\r\n      cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .button:hover {\r\n      background-color: silver;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #container {\r\n      display: grid;\r\n      grid-template-areas: &quot;basic&quot;;\r\n      grid-template-rows: 150px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #basic {\r\n      grid-area: basic;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #advanced {\r\n      grid-area: advanced;\r\n      display: none;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;basic&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world basic&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;advanced&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Hello world adv&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;buttonbar&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;basicButton&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\r\n        Basic\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;advancedButton&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\r\n        Advanced\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384579/how-to-make-two-div-screens-show-and-hide-at-the-same-exact-height/58384825#58384825","title":"How to make two div screens show and hide at the same exact height"}],"owner":{"reputation":6478,"user_id":441016,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3aa08907388338521f3d9cec7a13d32?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"1.21 gigawatts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/441016/1-21-gigawatts"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571094667,"creation_date":1571090483,"question_id":58384579,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384579","body_markdown":"I have two screens I&#39;d like to show.
