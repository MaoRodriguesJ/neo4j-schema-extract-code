Unfortunately, I encounter an issue when downloading a file via the OneDrive API due to preflights failing.\r\n\r\nDeeply buried in the [Microsoft API docs][1] there is a mention of a workaround for CORS request for javascript apps, because preflights will fail. In order to circumvent a 302 redirect, a file download has to be executed in two steps: first get the download url, then download the file via that url. This works fine as a simple `GET` request doesn&#39;t require a preflight check.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to the filesystem. According to the [chrome.fileSystemProvider API docs][2]:\r\n\r\n&gt; The results must be returned in chunks by calling successCallback several times.\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved by using the `Range` header on the `GET` request to the download-url, which actually is supported by OneDrive API using [partial range downloads][3]. However, now the request isn&#39;t simple anymore and therefore requires a preflight check, which ultimately fails.\r\n\r\nSo basically, the workaround failed because the problem the workaround tried to work around is still present in the workaround.\r\n\r\nHow can I overcome this problem? I obviously don&#39;t want to funnel the request through a proxy because of bandwidth and privacy issues. Can I perhaps simulate the `Range` header by downloading the entire file first and then serving it in byte-size chunks to the `fileSystemProvider`? \r\nI came across a [question asked almost 5 years ago][4] with a very similar issue, but unfortunately it didn&#39;t get me any further.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

you add the three classifiers for `javafx-graphics`, this solves the issue of building a fat cross-platform jar.\r\n\r\nHowever, running your pom on Mac, from the terminal (it is not an IntelliJ issue), it fails, with the posted error (`No toolkit found`).\r\n\r\nIf you run: `mvn clean -X javafx:run`, you will find the reason for that exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[DEBUG] Executing command line: [.../Contents/Home/bin/java, \\\r\n--module-path, .../target/classes:\\\r\n.../.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-base/13/javafx-base-13-mac.jar:\\\r\n.../.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-controls/13/javafx-controls-13-mac.jar:\\\r\n.../.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-fxml/13/javafx-fxml-13-mac.jar:\\\r\n.../.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-graphics/13/javafx-graphics-13-linux.jar:\\\r\n.../.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-graphics/13/javafx-graphics-13-mac.jar:\\\r\n.../.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-graphics/13/javafx-graphics-13-win.jar,\\\r\n--add-modules,...]\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNotice that it shows the `linux` classifier in the first place, because the artifacts are sorted alphanumerically, and the three jars actually refer to the same module `javafx-graphics`. \r\n\r\nSince `--module-path` will only resolve the first occurrence of a given module (see JEP 261 or this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46574200/3956070)), ignoring the others, `mvn clean javafx:run` will only work on Linux.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, with your current pom, the fat cross-platform jar will work on Linux, Mac and Windows, and `javafx:run` will only run on Linux.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nTo prevent the need of commenting out the graphic dependency with classifiers every time you want to run `javafx:run`, while keeping them for building the shade plugin, the solution, based on [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35562992/3956070), is the following:\r\n\r\n- Remove the three `javafx-graphic` dependencies from your pom\r\n- Add the following profile to your pom, including those three dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;profiles&gt;\r\n        &lt;profile&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;shadeProfile&lt;/id&gt;\r\n

&lt;mainClass&gt;com.app.MainClass&lt;/mainClass&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;/transformer&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;/transformers&gt;\r\n

&lt;/profiles&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run this profile, you will need to run:\r\n\r\n    mvn -PshadeProfile package\r\n\r\nThis will include all the existing dependencies in your pom, and will additionally include the extra three jars.\r\n\r\nNow both `mvn clean javafx:run` and `java -jar yourShade.jar` should work on Linux, Mac and Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048659/cant-run-javafx-application-from-intellij-on-osx-mac/58049700#58049700","title":"Can&#39;t run JavaFx application from

libs.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I execute the following run configuration:\r\n\r\n    (mvn) clean package\r\n\r\nThen it builds proper JAR that I can then execute on my Mac.\r\n\r\nSo, I suspect that this might be some problem related to javafx intellij plugin, but I&#39;m not sure about it and how to work around this issue (if this is indeed the issue).\r\n\r\nMy pom.xml:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml

mentioned in the comments, the problem with `scanf()` is (among other things) the way it handles the newline character. However, the `sscanf()` function (reading from a string) doesn&#39;t have this issue! So, depending on exactly what you&#39;re trying to achieve, maybe something like the following code will help:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n    \tint a[5], n = 0, given;\r\n    \tchar buffer[200];\r\n    \twhile (n &gt;= 0) {\r\n    \t\tprintf(&quot;\\nEnter n and a list of numbers: &quot;);\r\n    \t\tfgets(buffer, 200, stdin);\r\n

it is a java string variable as\r\n\r\n    String asd = &quot;Some \\\\\\\\n text&quot;\r\n\r\nthat means the engine already escapes from one `\\` and you would see the value `\\\\n` on the debug console like `&quot;Some \\\\n text&quot;`. So if your original string on your text is `&quot;Some \\\\\\\\n text&quot;`, that means the java variable equivalent of this is\r\n\r\n    String asd = &quot;Some \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n text&quot;\r\n\r\nThat looks as `&quot;Some \\\\\\\\n text&quot;` in debug console.

But `decoding` `JSON` into `Core Data` seems really tricky.\r\n\r\nI created all the `Entities` with the corresponding `attributes` some of those `attributes` are of type `Transformable` also I added `relationships` to each `Entity`. From here on I don&#39;t really know the next steps.\r\n\r\nThis is the JSON data:\r\n\r\n    [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Leanne Graham&quot;,\r\n            &quot;username&quot;: &quot;Bret&quot;,\r\n            &quot;email&quot;: &quot;Sincere@april.biz&quot;,\r\n            &quot;address&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;street&quot;: &quot;Kulas Light&quot;,\r\n                &quot;suite&quot;: &quot;Apt. 556&quot;,\r\n                &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Gwenborough&quot;,\r\n                &quot;zipcode&quot;: &quot;92998-3874&quot;,\r\n                &quot;geo&quot;: {\r\n                    &quot;lat&quot;: &quot;-37.3159&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;lng&quot;: &quot;81.1496&quot;\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;avatar&quot; : &quot;https://tinyfac.es/data/avatars/A7299C8E-CEFC-47D9-939A-3C8CA0EA4D13-200w.jpeg&quot;,\r\n            &quot;phone&quot;: &quot;1-770-736-8031 x56442&quot;,\r\n            &quot;website&quot;: &quot;hildegard.org&quot;,\r\n            &quot;company&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Romaguera-Crona&quot;,\r\n                &quot;catchPhrase&quot;: &quot;Multi-layered client-server neural-net&quot;,\r\n                &quot;bs&quot;: &quot;harness real-time e-markets&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the generated code for the User entity:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n    import Foundation\r\n    import CoreData\r\n    \r\n    extension User {\r\n    \r\n        @nonobjc public class func fetchRequest() -&gt; NSFetchRequest&lt;User&gt; {\r\n            return NSFetchRequest&lt;User&gt;(entityName: &quot;User&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @NSManaged public var id: Int32\r\n        @NSManaged public var name: String\r\n        @NSManaged public var username: String\r\n        @NSManaged public var email: String\r\n        @NSManaged public var address: Address\r\n        @NSManaged public var avatar: String\r\n        @NSManaged public var phone: String\r\n        @NSManaged public var website: String\r\n        @NSManaged public var company: Company\r\n        @NSManaged public var addressRe: Address\r\n        @NSManaged public var companyRe: Company\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n----------\r\n```swift\r\n    import Foundation\r\n    import CoreData\r\n    \r\n    @objc(User)\r\n    public class User: NSManagedObject {\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelationships between the entities:\r\n[Relationships between the entities Image Link][1]\r\n\r\nAttributes And Entities :\r\n[Attributes And Entities Image Link][2]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like to meantime that I did look at some good answers now for days.

[Found here.][1]\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure my code is fairly standard and pretty much a copy from answers here in C#. [For example see this SO question.][2]\r\n\r\n    Private Function OpenStandardStreamIn() As String\r\n        Dim MsgLength As Integer = 0\r\n        Dim InputData As String = &quot;&quot;\r\n        Dim LenBytes As Byte() = New Byte(3) {} &#39;first 4 bytes are length\r\n\r\n        Dim StdIn As System.IO.Stream = Console.OpenStandardInput() &#39;open the stream\r\n        StdIn.Read(LenBytes, 0, 4) &#39;length\r\n        MsgLength = System.BitConverter.ToInt32(LenBytes, 0) &#39;convert length to Int\r\n\r\n        Dim Buffer As Char() = New Char(MsgLength - 1) {} &#39;create Char array for remaining bytes\r\n\r\n        Using Reader As System.IO.StreamReader = New System.IO.StreamReader(StdIn) &#39;Using to auto dispose of stream reader\r\n            While Reader.Peek() &gt;= 0 &#39;while the next byte is not Null\r\n                Reader.Read(Buffer, 0, Buffer.Length) &#39;add to the buffer\r\n            End While\r\n        End Using\r\n\r\n        InputData = New String(Buffer) &#39;convert buffer to string\r\n\r\n        Return InputData\r\n    End Function\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that when the JSON includes characters such as &#223; &#220; &#214; &#196; then the whole string seems to be diffent and I cannot deserialize it. It is readable and my log shows the string is fine, but there is something different. As long as the string does NOT include these characters then deserialization works fine.  I am not supplying the JavascriptSerializer code as this is not the problem.\r\n\r\nI have tried creating the StreamReader with different Encodings such as\r\n\r\n    New System.IO.StreamReader(StdIn, Encoding.GetEncoding(&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;), True)\r\n\r\nhowever the &#223; &#196; etc are then not correct.\r\n\r\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is if the string is UTF8 and .NET uses UTF16 how am I supposed to make sure the conversion is done properly?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nBeen doing some testing. What I have found is if I receive a string with fu&#223; then the message length (provided by native messaging) is 4 but number of Char in the buffer is 3, if the string is fus then the message length is 3 and number of characters is 3. Why is that?\r\n\r\nWith the above code the Buffer object is 1 too big and thus is why there is a problem. If I simple use the Read method on the stream then it works fine. It appears that Google Messaging is sending a message length that is different when the &#223; is in the string.\r\n\r\nIf I want to use the above code then how can I know that the message length is not right?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging\r\n  [2]:

it is just the formatting here but check your `&quot;` symbols .. they are strange.\r\n\r\n - The reason your `outro` string isn&#39;t found is because you declare it within the `if` block ... it is not known outside of this scope. Declare the variable outside of the `if` block. You could/should even make it a `const` since it doesn&#39;t change anywhere between its declaration and usage.\r\n\r\n - If you *would* use a string interpolation it has to start with a `$` symbol\r\n\r\n        SetBool($&quot;{outro}&quot;, true);\r\n\r\n However in this case you pass only exactly one simple string value so there is absolutely no need to use string interpolation at all. Rather simply pass in the variable itself\r\n\r\n        SetBool(outro, true);\r\n\r\n - The `NullReferenceExceptions` comes either from your `Find` or `GetComponent` call.\r\n\r\n Since you are checking if the `animator 1` object is `activeSelf` it seems pretty obvious that in some cases it might not be.\r\n\r\n In this case [`Find`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.Find.html) will return `null`. This is probably where the exception comes from mainly.\r\n\r\n &gt; This function only returns active GameObjects. If no GameObject with name can be found, null is returned. If name contains a &#39;/&#39; character, it traverses the hierarchy like a path name.\r\n\r\n Next it is also possible that the found object simply doesn&#39;t have an `Animator` attached so [`GetComponent`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html) returns `null`.\r\n\r\n &gt; Returns the component of Type type if the game object has one attached, null if it doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nBest way to find out is debugging and do your stuff in single steps and check each retrieved reference for `null`.\r\n\r\n    private const string OUTRO = &quot;animation&quot;;\r\n\r\n    // Personally in general as soon as you use strings that never change anyway I would recommend a const\r\n    private const string ANIMATOR_1 = &quot;animator 1&quot;;\r\n    private const string ANIMATOR_2 = &quot;animator 2&quot;;\r\n    private const string INTRO = &quot;intro&quot;;\r\n    private const string ERROR_COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND = &quot;The object {0} has no Animator Component!&quot;;\r\n    private const string ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND = &quot;No object with name {0} was found!

So instead of having to activate each animation then deactivate it before switching to another animation I wanted to make it so that whatever animator is active it would automatically detect that, play the corresponding outro animation and go to the next animation all in one command. The solution I came up with is string interpellation. \r\n\r\nThe problem is I keep getting the error: \r\n\r\n&gt; Object reference not set to an instance of an object. \r\n\r\nIn Unity pertaining to the line where \r\n(“{outro}”) is referenced and I’m not sure but maybe it’s because I’m trying to use string interpolation across 2 if statements? \r\n\r\nP.S without the additional if statement this script works it still runs in Unity with the 2nd if statement but it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to.\r\n\r\n    if (word == “animator 2”)\r\n    {\r\n        if (GameObject.Find(“animator 1”).activeSelf);\r\n        {\r\n            string outro = “animation”;\r\n        }\r\n        GameObject.Find(“animator 1”).GetComponent&lt;Animator&gt;\r\n        ().SetBool(“{outro}”, true);\r\n        GameObject.Find(“animator 2”).GetComponent&lt;Animator&gt;\r\n        ().SetBool(“intro”, true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSo upon receiving many responses to this post I am able to narrow my problem down to one simple question.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to reference a variable from an if statement?\r\n\r\nBecause I do need the if statement unless their is some other method that does the exact same thing. The only issue now is the variable “outro” is obviously not even a thing outside of the if statement.

  }\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere AppPages is simply another class imported by app.component.ts and inside i having the public static property pages, this is simply an array of objects, and inside each object i have some menu display properties, like the title and icon of each menu item, also, having another property, called detailTag, this tag allows me to easily show or hide some content of the menu depending to the property:\r\n\r\n    currentDisplayMenu\r\n\r\nof app.component.ts, so some menu info is clasified by &#39;basicInfo&#39; inside detailTag property, this means that when currentDisplayMenu have content &#39;basicInfo&#39;, i will only show the menu items that have the detailTag matching by &#39;basicInfo&#39;, the other clasification is &#39;accountInfo&#39;.\r\n\r\nWell, other file that is needed is **menu_functionality.ts**, which looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n    import { BehaviorSubject } from &#39;rxjs&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    var componentBehaviorSubject:BehaviorSubject&lt;string&gt;;\r\n    \r\n    export function showInfo(tag){\r\n    \r\n        switch(tag){\r\n    \r\n          case &#39;basicInfo&#39;:\r\n            return componentBehaviorSubject.next(&#39;basicInfo&#39;);\r\n            break;\r\n          case &#39;accountInfo&#39;:\r\n            let CBS = componentBehaviorSubject.next(&#39;accountInfo&#39;);\r\n            this.menu.open();\r\n            return CBS;\r\n            break;\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    export function setComponentBehaviorSubject(behaviorSubject:BehaviorSubject&lt;string&gt;){\r\n    \r\n      componentBehaviorSubject = behaviorSubject;\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe reason of why i&#39;m calling the this.menu.open(); function only when the tag is &#39;accountInfo&#39;, is because, the app.component.html and app.component.ts are working globaly in the app and if the user clicks only in the sidemenu button to open it there is no problem and no need to put it, but here is the thing and the real reason of why i&#39;m using BehaviorSubject:\r\n\r\n- App.component.html and app.component.ts are shared, so there are no problems if the user hits in the menu opener button in one or other page of the app, but... the way i&#39;m showing other info like &#39;accountInfo&#39; is using an avatar which is not inside of app.component.html (is not shared) i wanted to put in another place instead of putting it in the menu, this is because i didn&#39;t know how to make it globally usable like app.component.html, so i have to write that html in each page.html that i want to use it.\r\n\r\nand when user hits the avatar i need to only show the &#39;accountInfo&#39; items in the menu and obviously open it, (this is why i only call this.menu.open when the tag is accountInfo), i don&#39;t know if there is another better way to make this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048631/cannot-read-property-next-of-undefined-using-behaviorsubject","title":"Cannot read property &#39;next&#39; of undefined using

As is specified in the Wikipedia article:\r\n\r\n&gt; The fragment identifier functions differently to the rest of the URI: **its processing is exclusively client-sided** with no participation from the web server, though the server typically helps to determine the MIME type, and the MIME type determines the processing of fragments. When an agent (such as a web browser) requests a web resource from a web server, **the agent sends the URI to the server, but does not send the fragment**. Instead, the agent waits for the server to send the resource, and then the agent processes the resource according to the document type and fragment value.\r\n\r\nSo the webserver will never even obtain the fragment identifier. If you want to include a hash as part of the key of a querystring, you need to *encode* it with the [*percent-encoding* [wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), a hash is encoded to `%23`. Indeed, if you want the hash to be in the querydict, the URI should be:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://localhost:8000/?&lt;b&gt;%23&lt;/b&gt;access_token=EAAJ0Dqh2BJ0BABNKWfkqmiIr3uWwKvpkVeCAVQTZBQSEFG87GKjXunsoofixxKS11ZCicElsZBRMKHL4Dk5nGeBa5lBkYvzw3YKrzZAyZAvhlvd1pAtxzZBPlD4PJaD7JFz4UCjOEIyo5ZCfyBIysva1PCK0XZAN7FpXCDRpDxlEVxtnN9RrbZAt26ZChHV3LRupoZD&amp;amp;data_access_expiration_time=1576926047&amp;amp;expires_in=7153&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nIf we generate such URI, then Django will parse this as:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; QueryDict(&#39;%23access_token=EAAJ0Dqh2BJ0BABNKWfkqmiIr3uWwKvpkVeCAVQTZBQSEFG87GKjXunsoofixxKS11ZCicElsZBRMKHL4Dk5nGeBa5lBkYvzw3YKrzZAyZAvhlvd1pAtxzZBPlD4PJaD7JFz4UCjOEIyo5ZCfyBIysva1PCK0XZAN7FpXCDRpDxlEVxtnN9RrbZAt26ZChHV3LRupoZD&amp;data_access_expiration_time=1576926047&amp;expires_in=7153&#39;)\r\n    &lt;QueryDict: {&#39;#access_token&#39;: [&#39;EAAJ0Dqh2BJ0BABNKWfkqmiIr3uWwKvpkVeCAVQTZBQSEFG87GKjXunsoofixxKS11ZCicElsZBRMKHL4Dk5nGeBa5lBkYvzw3YKrzZAyZAvhlvd1pAtxzZBPlD4PJaD7JFz4UCjOEIyo5ZCfyBIysva1PCK0XZAN7FpXCDRpDxlEVxtnN9RrbZAt26ZChHV3LRupoZD&#39;], &#39;data_access_expiration_time&#39;: [&#39;1576926047&#39;], &#39;expires_in&#39;: [&#39;7153&#39;]}&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is one of the main reasons why you should never do string processing yourself to encode a querystring. There are more characters that should be encoded when these are part of a key or value, like `!`, `*`, `&#39;`, `(`, `)`, `;`, `:`, `@`, `&amp;`, `=`, `+`, `$`, `,`, `/`, `?`, `[` and `]`. Although strictly speaking, you can encode these yourself. It is likely more safe to use a tool that has been tested effectively.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048620/how-to-get-entire-current-url-in-django/58048704#58048704","title":"how to get entire current url in django"}],"owner":{"reputation":133,"user_id":11961593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab4536719f5e229e17894f443ede214a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jingzhun Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11961593/jingzhun-li"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58048704,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569151858,"creation_date":1569150648,"question_id":58048620,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58048620","body_markdown":"I have some trouble getting current url in django.\r\ncurrent url is &#39;https://localhost:8000/?#access_token=EAAJ0Dqh2BJ0BABNKWfkqmiIr3uWwKvpkVeCAVQTZBQSEFG87GKjXunsoofixxKS11ZCicElsZBRMKHL4Dk5nGeBa5lBkYvzw3YKrzZAyZAvhlvd1pAtxzZBPlD4PJaD7JFz4UCjOEIyo5ZCfyBIysva1PCK0XZAN7FpXCDRpDxlEVxtnN9RrbZAt26ZChHV3LRupoZD&amp;data_access_expiration_time=1576926047&amp;expires_in=7153&#39;\r\n\r\ni used several url getting functions such as request.get_full_path() and request.build_absolute_uri(), but they did only returns &#39;https://localhost:8000&#39;\r\n\r\nHow can i get the string following &#39;#&#39; such as access_token?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048620/how-to-get-entire-current-url-in-django","title":"how to get entire current url in django"},{"tags":["html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":103,"user_id":1707592,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c53e57cbfcdb0a4ad5f00b8a58a3471?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Cocest","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1707592/cocest"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569150987,"post_id":58048617,"comment_id":102495966,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048617/html-input-elements-of-type-url-let-enter-non-url#comment102495966_58048617"},{"owner":{"reputation":407,"user_id":3479395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a983984c6d07e4266e0199cb5e094b76?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mulsun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3479395/mulsun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569151269,"post_id":58048617,"comment_id":102496037,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048617/html-input-elements-of-type-url-let-enter-non-url#comment102496037_58048617"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12102443,"user_type":"unregistered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1cca7786100549d54d5584c9e8a5e0d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ikeanyi kenechukwu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12102443/ikeanyi-kenechukwu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12102443,"user_type":"unregistered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1cca7786100549d54d5584c9e8a5e0d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ikeanyi kenechukwu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12102443/ikeanyi-kenechukwu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569159767,"last_edit_date":1569159767,"creation_date":1569151513,"answer_id":58048735,"question_id":58048617,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58048735","body_markdown":"No it is really a bug and not a feature because url only accepts url and cannot accept uri or urn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048617/html-input-elements-of-type-url-let-enter-non-url/58048735#58048735","title":"HTML &lt;input&gt; elements of type url let enter non-url"}],"owner":{"reputation":11484,"user_id":6612932,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3mwe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wasthishelpful","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6612932/wasthishelpful"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3625,"user_id":8566549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0268a88dfbca27a1f18e8ea3974e765a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hasta Dhana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8566549/hasta-dhana"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569159767,"creation_date":1569150638,"last_edit_date":1569158820,"question_id":58048617,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58048617","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a side project to handle my bookmarks, stored through their urls.

per your clarifications: \r\n\r\n&gt; an Activity does not have to be created by a Company\r\n\r\nThis suggests that Activity should be an aggregate of its own. It has a lifetime separate from any other aggregate. \r\n\r\n&gt; An Activity can only be registered to one Company\r\n\r\nThe Activity would have a reference back to the Company via an ID. Effectively, a foreign key. When it is assigned to a Company, it raises an event indicating that the assignment was made. \r\n\r\n&gt; a Company can only have 5 Activities at any one time\r\n\r\nIf you were using a standard RDBMS system to manage these rules, you would have a transaction that checks the number of Activities and either approves or rejects the addition of a new Activity. Similarly, in your domain, you can model this through a two-phase commit. \r\n\r\nWhen you assign an Activity to a Company (**AssignToCompany** command), you raise an **AssignedToCompany** event. A ProcessManager (PM) will receive that event and send a command to Company (**AssignToActivity**) and the Company can either accept (**AssignedToActivity**) or reject that based on the count (**RejectedAssignToActivity**). \r\n\r\nIf the latter, the PM will receive the **RejectedAssignToActivity** event and send a command back to Activity to remove the company (**UnassignCompany**) which will raise the **CompanyUnassigned** event. \r\n\r\nOptional: \r\n\r\nThe PM will receive the **CompanyUnassigned** event and send an UnassignFromActivity command to the Company. This way, you can unassign an activity if needed and have the Company be aware of the change.

However, this means I would have to go through the Comapny Aggregate to access every Activity, which hisn&#39;t ideal as most actions against an activity does not depend on the Company.\r\n\r\nMy second approach was to have seperate Company and Activity aggreagtes. This means that I would have to first raise a ActivityCreated event, then an ActivityAddedToCompany event which would throw an exception if the company is already full of Activities. This approach seems better but I&#39;m not sure if needing the ActivityAddedToCompany is a flag that I have not seperated the aggregates correctly as in a happy path, the ActivityCreated  and ActivityAddedToCompany would always be stored after each other.\r\n\r\nIs the second approach better or am I missing something basic in Domain Driven Design?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048590/how-to-enforce-invarients-in-aggregate-relationships","title":"How to enforce invarients in aggregate relationships"},{"tags":["babylonjs","gltf"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":772,"user_id":729146,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92504842a54e66decbf0a55a6e0c41f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Raanan W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/729146/raanan-w"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569503319,"creation_date":1569503319,"answer_id":58117535,"question_id":58048587,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58117535","body_markdown":"Babylon&#39;s GLTF 2.0 loader has an extension system that can be seen as promise-based plugin for each step of the loading process.\r\nYou can see a few examples for the extensions here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/loaders/src/glTF/2.0/Extensions\r\n\r\nWhat can be very interesting in your case is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/loaders/src/glTF/2.0/Extensions/KHR_texture_transform.ts\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this extension contains a function called `loadTextureInfoAsync` that returns a promise when done, after receiving the texture info that is about to be loaded.\r\n\r\nDepending on your use case you can completely replace the load texture functionality or extend it (like in the example above).

I&#39;m not sure what I am doing wrong since I&#39;ve looked at many articles/tutorials and they all said to do it this way.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval client = Retrofit.Builder()\r\n    .baseUrl(&quot;https://example.com/api/&quot;)\r\n    .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava2CallAdapaterFactory.create())\r\n    .build()\r\n    .create(ApiService::class.java)\r\n\r\nclient.login(JSONObject().put(&quot;email&quot;, ...).toString())\r\n    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())\r\n    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())\r\n    .subscribe()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould anyone explain to me what I&#39;m actually doing wrong?\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nI have tried the follow code and I still get the same result. No request is made.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder().addInterceptor(\r\n    HttpLoggingInterceptor(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Logger.DEFAULT)\r\n).build()\r\n\r\nval client = Retrofit.Builder()\r\n    .baseUrl(&quot;https://example.com/api/&quot;)\r\n    .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava2CallAdapterFactory.create())\r\n    .client(okHttpClient)\r\n    .build()\r\n    .create(ApiClient::class.java)\r\n\r\nclient.login(JSONObject().put(&quot;email&quot;, ...).toString())\r\n    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())\r\n    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())\r\n    .subscribe({ user -&gt;

The script listens for input, and if I type as example `shell &lt;some_ip&gt;`, a new console will appear where I can interact with the opened shell on the client. Basically now I have 2 consoles. It works nice on my dev machine, since I have a GUI, but on the server I would like to rely just on the SSH connection to do that, rather than installing a GUI and remote access it. What I want to happen looks like this:\r\n\r\n - SSH into the server\r\n - Send command to open new console, which happens on the server\r\n - A new window appears on my machine (the one I SSH from) which basically is like SSH-ing in the the other console that opened on the server\r\n\r\nMainly, when a terminal process (related to the initial process, or also being a child) starts into the server, I should also get a new window on my machine. It is like capturing all consoles made by my process. Below I put a terminal scheme so u can understand better what I want:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_machine                      server     client\r\nterm_a_1 (remote of term_b_1)   term_b_1   term_c_1 (the app)\r\n\r\nshell &lt;some_ip&gt;\r\n\r\nmy_machine                      server                          client\r\nterm_a_1 (remote of term_b_1)   term_b_1                        term_c_1 (the app)\r\nterm_a_2 (remote of term_b_2)   term_b_2 (remote of term_c_2)   term_c_2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, I don&#39;t want to connect `term_a_2` to `term_c_2`, since `term_c_2` must always be connected to the server. In the `term_a_2` I could run something like `exit` which `term_b_2` interprets (since it is another NodeJS script that waits for input) and everything would turn back like in the first phase. Everything between the server and client is made by me, I just need some kind of console forwarding between ANY machine and the server.\r\n\r\nSry for my bad English.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048541/capture-multiple-terminals-from-a-linux-server-preferably-over-ssh","title":"Capture multiple terminals from a Linux server preferably over SSH"},{"tags":["node.js","mqtt","mosquitto"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5338325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ece79c67f8b4af45b6265338525c0b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wan Chap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5338325/wan-chap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569163620,"post_id":58048964,"comment_id":102498843,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048539/how-to-catch-access-error-when-publish-inaccessible-topic-in-mqtt-js/58048964#comment102498843_58048964"},{"owner":{"reputation":29000,"user_id":504554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/006ffde9ed3fac6396222405fc5e9bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hardillb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/504554/hardillb"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5338325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ece79c67f8b4af45b6265338525c0b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wan Chap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5338325/wan-chap"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569163814,"post_id":58048964,"comment_id":102498896,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048539/how-to-catch-access-error-when-publish-inaccessible-topic-in-mqtt-js/58048964#comment102498896_58048964"},{"owner":{"reputation":29000,"user_id":504554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/006ffde9ed3fac6396222405fc5e9bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hardillb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/504554/hardillb"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5338325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ece79c67f8b4af45b6265338525c0b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wan Chap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5338325/wan-chap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569163876,"post_id":58048964,"comment_id":102498914,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048539/how-to-catch-access-error-when-publish-inaccessible-topic-in-mqtt-js/58048964#comment102498914_58048964"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5338325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ece79c67f8b4af45b6265338525c0b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wan Chap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5338325/wan-chap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569163966,"post_id":58048964,"comment_id":102498933,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048539/how-to-catch-access-error-when-publish-inaccessible-topic-in-mqtt-js/58048964#comment102498933_58048964"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5338325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ece79c67f8b4af45b6265338525c0b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wan Chap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5338325/wan-chap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569164060,"post_id":58048964,"comment_id":102498955,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048539/how-to-catch-access-error-when-publish-inaccessible-topic-in-mqtt-js/58048964#comment102498955_58048964"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":29000,"user_id":504554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/006ffde9ed3fac6396222405fc5e9bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hardillb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/504554/hardillb"},"last_editor":{"reputation":29000,"user_id":504554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/006ffde9ed3fac6396222405fc5e9bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hardillb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/504554/hardillb"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569154517,"last_edit_date":1569154517,"creation_date":1569153346,"answer_id":58048964,"question_id":58048539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58048964","body_markdown":"You don&#39;t.\r\n\r\nThe broker will not tell the client if it tried to publish to a topic it doesn&#39;t have access to, it will just silently just drop the message.\r\n\r\nThis would be a security vulnerability in that it would expose what topics are available.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048539/how-to-catch-access-error-when-publish-inaccessible-topic-in-mqtt-js/58048964#58048964","title":"How to catch &quot;access error&quot;

Or is there a way to get mautic to support JWT/oauth/openid connect","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048534/integrating-mautic-server-with-another-java-application","title":"Integrating mautic server with another java application"},{"tags":["php","arrays","regex","preg-match-all"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":78642,"user_id":2255089,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNAsT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Casimir et Hippolyte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2255089/casimir-et-hippolyte"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569152413,"post_id":58048532,"comment_id":102496319,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048532/find-word-using-rgex-pattern-and-extract#comment102496319_58048532"},{"owner":{"reputation":78642,"user_id":2255089,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNAsT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Casimir et Hippolyte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2255089/casimir-et-hippolyte"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569152717,"post_id":58048532,"comment_id":102496386,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048532/find-word-using-rgex-pattern-and-extract#comment102496386_58048532"},{"owner":{"reputation":2529,"user_id":6127393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGTXy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arleigh Hix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6127393/arleigh-hix"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569152812,"post_id":58048532,"comment_id":102496404,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048532/find-word-using-rgex-pattern-and-extract#comment102496404_58048532"},{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":12069579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6089946079a7c7eee9d9cb0c6108474a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lori tasker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12069579/lori-tasker"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2529,"user_id":6127393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGTXy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arleigh Hix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6127393/arleigh-hix"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569153375,"post_id":58048532,"comment_id":102496514,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048532/find-word-using-rgex-pattern-and-extract#comment102496514_58048532"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":12069579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6089946079a7c7eee9d9cb0c6108474a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lori tasker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12069579/lori-tasker"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569154704,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569150030,"creation_date":1569150030,"question_id":58048532,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58048532","body_markdown":"this is my list.\r\n\r\n       $red =[\r\n        1 =&gt;

problem coordinate &#39;compiler&#39;:\r\n\r\nI am practically a newbie in python, and I was tasked to create a word search program in python. As of now I can find the coordinates of a certain character given a board, but it finds ALL instances of the characters. A I would really appreciate some help! \r\n\r\n\r\n2nd problem:\r\n\r\nI tried to progress on the code to not waste time. But I have no idea how to go on. After, supposedly getting the coordinates the code must also state the word&#39;s direction (e.g right,left,down-left,up-left,down-right,up-right). I have no idea on I would get this. I was thinking about using slope to determine  the direction but I have been running around circles on how exactly  I would be translating this into a python code. Thank you so much in advance for your help!\r\n\r\nI have already tried restricting to having only one character taken per row, but I realize this won&#39;t do since multiple words can be in the same row. Really hit a dead end here.\r\n\r\nSo basically this is the section that gets the coordinates of the first letter of the given &#39;words&#39; in the board. \r\n\r\n```\r\nwords=[&#39;row&#39;, &#39;war&#39;, &#39;raw&#39;,&#39;rar&#39;,&#39;dew&#39;,&#39;rod&#39;,&#39;red&#39;]\r\nrows= [&#39;rar&#39;, &#39;aoe&#39;, &#39;wed&#39;,]#rows in the board\r\n\r\nfor row_number, row in enumerate(rows):\r\n    for column_number, letter in enumerate(row):\r\n        for word in words:\r\n                if word[0]==letter:\r\n                    print(letter,(column_number+1,row_number+1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n1st problem:\r\n\r\nThe code gives me an output of:\r\n```\r\nr (1, 1)\r\nr (1, 1)\r\nr (1, 1)\r\nr (1, 1)\r\nr (1, 1)\r\nr (3, 1)\r\nr (3, 1)\r\nr (3, 1)\r\nr (3, 1)\r\nr (3, 1)\r\nw (1, 3)\r\nd (3, 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs could see the coordinates are really not that helpful. It seems that it just keep finding the same letter again and again How would I fix this? \r\n\r\n\r\n2nd problem:\r\n\r\nI was hoping to produce the output:\r\n```\r\nword(x,y)-direction\r\n```\r\nThe (x,y) coordinate is somehow almost done and I think I can store the solutions the only problem left now is how I would determine the direction.\r\nThanks again for the help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048527/how-to-code-a-word-search-program-in-python","title":"How to code a word search program in python?"},{"tags":["react-native","localization","expo"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":1737465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f5746d4b059e9abd97fd7763b993a55?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cbuchegger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1737465/cbuchegger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569424535,"creation_date":1569424535,"answer_id":58101669,"question_id":58048521,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58101669","body_markdown":"It seems to be a problem with the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nFor me it helped to set a language &amp; region in the iOS Simulator.

have some documents in my MongoDB collection, i want to update those documents with the newest values retrieved from an API.\r\n\r\nHere is what i tried:\r\n\r\n    def Updating(Data):\r\n    \r\n

Item, &quot;price&quot;: &quot;Price&quot;}})\r\n\r\nHere `Data` is the data retrieved from the API.

Example: using `preventDefault()` on click event will prevent clicking trigger or using `preventDefault()` on keydown will prevent the default keyboard pressing down event.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust like the current answer, to prevent the alert, use `return;`\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I just noticed, your code `onclick=&quot;alerted&quot;` should be `onclick=&quot;alerted()&quot;`\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** \r\n\r\nExplanation 1: The alert won&#39;t fire in the `btn` because it was prevented. you put `alerted()` on `onclick` and the `click` event was prevented.\r\nIn other words, alert is inside click, click was prevented so the alert will not fire.\r\n\r\nExplanation 2: Button is an object not an event, objects can have the same events.

created a custom dense to sparse op for tensorflow in c++.

The `.json` files are configurations that need to be read in at runtime if the appropriate class is executed.

Is this not the use case for `data_files` and should I really only be using `package_data` with `importlib` to read in resource files? Are there other better alternatives to reading in resource files that need to be accessed during the execution of a python program?

unsuccessful search.&lt;/br&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are detailed computations about these,but I am thinking about that if we suppose it is a uniform hashing,then we can consider the insertion is just the unsuccessful search because they are doing the same thing--to find a null slot,and the expected probing times are 1/(1-a)(a is the load factor).&lt;/br&gt;\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the probing sequence of successful search and  insertion of the element is the same,to insert the element,we need to prob about 1/(1-a) slots to find the right position,then when we serch the element,in principle we need to traverse the same sequence,so it should be 1/(1-a) too.but the real sitution is the expected times of successful search is (1/a)ln(1/(1-a)).&lt;/br&gt;\r\n\r\nI can understand the process of the

But the text is never displayed and remains blank.\r\n\r\nObviously there is something wrong but despite the syntaxic differences between the two implementations I just can&#39;t figure out why the Java version is not displaying the value in the Textview.\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n----\r\nThanks to Rajnish suryavanshi I was not getting my binding the right way, I had to only use :\r\n\r\n**binding = DataBindingUtil.setContentView(this, R.layout.activity_main);**\r\n\r\nThis one set the content view with the layout provided AND return the binding. \r\nAlternatively you can do :\r\n\r\n**binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());** (returns the binding but does not set the content view)\r\n\r\n**setContentView(binding.getRoot());** (set the content view with the binding root view)\r\n\r\nI found this misleading -&gt;
