I&#39;m a relative newbie to Qt/PyQt5, so *any* advice would be welcome.\r\n\r\nI am trying to correctly implement validation on a PyQt5 form, giving proper feedback to the user.\r\n\r\nMy current test code is:\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nimport typing\r\n\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore import QTimer, QRegularExpression\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtGui import QValidator, QRegularExpressionValidator\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLineEdit, QVBoxLayout\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyValidator(QRegularExpressionValidator):\r\n    states = {\r\n        QValidator.Invalid: &#39;invalid&#39;,\r\n        QValidator.Intermediate: &#39;intermediate&#39;,\r\n        QValidator.Acceptable: &#39;acceptable&#39;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    def validate(self, text: str, pos: int) -&gt; typing.Tuple[QValidator.State, str, int]:\r\n        def set_selector(s):\r\n            p = self.parent()\r\n            p.setProperty(&#39;selector&#39;, s)\r\n            p.style().unpolish(p)\r\n            p.style().polish(p)\r\n            p.update()\r\n\r\n        state, text, pos = super(MyValidator, self).validate(text, pos)\r\n        selector = MyValidator.states[state]\r\n\r\n        if selector == &#39;invalid&#39;:\r\n            sel = self.parent().property(&#39;selector&#39;)\r\n            QTimer.singleShot(1000, lambda: set_selector(sel))\r\n        set_selector(selector)\r\n        return state, text, pos\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Widget(QWidget):\r\n    def __init__(self, parent=None):\r\n        super(Widget, self).__init__(parent)\r\n\r\n        self.le = QLineEdit()\r\n        regexp = QRegularExpression(r&#39;\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}&#39;)\r\n        self.le.setValidator(MyValidator(regexp, self.le))\r\n        self.le.setProperty(&#39;selector&#39;, &#39;none&#39;)\r\n\r\n        lay = QVBoxLayout(self)\r\n        lay.addWidget(self.le)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    import sys\r\n\r\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    app.setStyleSheet(&#39;&#39;&#39;\\\r\n    *[selector=&quot;invalid&quot;] {border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid red;}\r\n    *[selector=&quot;intermediate&quot;] {border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid gold;}\r\n    *[selector=&quot;acceptable&quot;] {border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid green;}\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;)\r\n\r\n    w = Widget()\r\n    w.show()\r\n\r\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have three &quot;problems&quot; (IMHO strictly connected) with this code:\r\n\r\n 1. I would have liked to use pseudo-classes, but AFAIK thy are not supported by Qt5 (and thus PyQt5 supports them neither). Note that pseudo-classes, as pointed out by @ekhumoro, *are* supported, but they are implemented as a hard-coded (in c++) bitmap, so it&#39;s impossible to add &quot;custom pseudo-classes&quot; to handle something not currently implemented (e.g.: Validation).\r\n 2. In order to force stylesheet reevaluation I had to set a dummy stylesheet for the widget, which is both ugly and (more importantly!) it might break things if a local stylesheet is in use. This is strictly linked with next; see bottom Note2.\r\n 3. I am forced to completely redefine `QLineEdit` border because setting just `border-color: whatever;` is ignored. This, again, is both ugly and (more importantly!) wrong, because the re-created border is *not* exactly the same as the original one. This seems due to fact Qt does not use CSS &quot;by default&quot;; see bottom Note2.\r\n\r\nGiven the above question is: is this the correct way to implement visual feedback or is there some other (possibly cleaner) way?\r\n\r\nNote: I understand this question has a certain amount of opinion-based facets, but I&#39;m asking for consolidated &quot;best practices&quot;, if available.\r\n\r\nNote2: It seems (clarification from knowledgeable people welcome!) Qt does not use CSS by default. This is different from other languages/toolkits (e.g.: java/javaFX) where rendering is *always* driven by CSS and user &quot;merely&quot; updates/adds to the &quot;default CSS&quot; which actually exists.\r\n\r\nMy (possibly faulty) understanding is border (or any other graphic element) is &quot;by default&quot; drawn &quot;by hand&quot; (in c++, drawing directly on canvas), while *IFF* user defines a *relevant* CSS element a separate rendering engine is called and thus rendering is potentially different.\r\n\r\nIn the specific case of &quot;border&quot; I was unable to correctly define a CSS border identical to the &quot;default&quot; drawing; as you can see running the snippet it draws a border that&#39;s one pixel *inside* the default one; I have not been able to &quot;fix&quot; it.\r\n\r\nI am quite happy with the code above, but any &quot;Answer&quot; deepening my understanding of QWidget interaction with CSS and related issues will be gladly accepted.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n-\r\nAs @ekhumoro pointed out in a comment, I&#39;m not using the Qt-approved syntax for [Dynamic Properties](https://wiki.qt.io/Dynamic_Properties_and_Stylesheets).\r\nTwo notes on that:\r\n\r\n 1. Using `style().polish()` actually solves my problem with vertical border dimension.\r\n 2. Using `style().unpolish()` / `style().polish()` like in my revised code above does *not* work as expected... partially. It actually works ok for &quot;static&quot; borders (`Intermediate` and `Acceptable` Validator statuses) but does not work well for &quot;transient&quot; (`Invalid`) borders.\r\n\r\nAny insight welcome.\r\n\r\nUpdate2:\r\n-\r\nI updated code snippet to the final (fully working) version following @ekhumoro (MANY thanks!) advice.\r\n\r\nProblem, for me, is solved. I will leave the Question open for future reference.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289404/pyqt5-dynamically-changing-pseudo-classes","title":"PyQt5: dynamically changing pseudo-classes"},{"tags":["node.js","vue.js","phpstorm"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":194,"user_id":4647221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10437ba12aac703859a9dd6b1cc57184?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AlyssaAlex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4647221/alyssaalex"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570549524,"post_id":58289707,"comment_id":102944055,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289399/i-have-been-trying-to-enable-the-node-js-support-on-phpstorm-but-it-freezes-at-t/58289707#comment102944055_58289707"},{"owner":{"reputation":59579,"user_id":2274212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f05f19aded7e6cfc60f184796e8e02a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2274212/lena"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":194,"user_id":4647221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10437ba12aac703859a9dd6b1cc57184?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AlyssaAlex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4647221/alyssaalex"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570549903,"post_id":58289707,"comment_id":102944226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289399/i-have-been-trying-to-enable-the-node-js-support-on-phpstorm-but-it-freezes-at-t/58289707#comment102944226_58289707"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":59579,"user_id":2274212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f05f19aded7e6cfc60f184796e8e02a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2274212/lena"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570549154,"creation_date":1570549154,"answer_id":58289707,"question_id":58289399,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58289707","body_markdown":"Unfortunately PhpStorm 10 doesn&#39;t support recent Node.js versions. **Node.js Core** library can&#39;t be enabled when using Node.js *6.x - 12.x*, debugging won&#39;t work, etc. You have to either downgrade Node.js to v.*4.x* or upgrade PhpStorm to the most recent version (2019.2.x)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289399/i-have-been-trying-to-enable-the-node-js-support-on-phpstorm-but-it-freezes-at-t/58289707#58289707","title":"I have been trying to enable the Node.js support on PhpStorm but it freezes at the dialog box, how can I fix this?"}],"owner":{"reputation":194,"user_id":4647221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10437ba12aac703859a9dd6b1cc57184?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AlyssaAlex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4647221/alyssaalex"},"last_editor":{"reputation":116935,"user_id":783119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4bbfd3e5e9f8b698abf7cd1c7aae7a10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LazyOne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/783119/lazyone"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570549154,"creation_date":1570548049,"last_edit_date":1570548964,"question_id":58289399,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289399","body_markdown":"I am trying to get code support on my PhpStorm v10.0 for my Vue files.

posted solutions mention raising the memory limit for PHP.\r\n\r\nIt does not work like that. You can&#39;t just throw more RAM at a problem. What if your server has 2GB of RAM and you upload a file that, with all the arrays created there, can use more than 2GB of RAM? What&#39;s next? Not to mention the risk of the server running out of memory and killing other processes. For example, if the server has shared PHP and MySQL running and PHP is causing the server to run out of memory, the OOM Killer will kick in and **might** kill the MySQL process.\r\n\r\nThe solution to your problem is to process that file in chunks. Laravel 6, for example, has a new type of collection, [Lazy Collections](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/collections#lazy-collections). They can help you speed things up. Your code might have to change in order to use chunk processing, but imho, that is the only way you can fix this problem.\r\n\r\nI would also run this in a queue, not from a user request.\r\n\r\nI also know that the package you are using supports both [chunking](https://docs.laravel-excel.com/3.1/imports/chunk-reading.html) for reading and [batching](https://docs.laravel-excel.com/3.1/imports/batch-inserts.html) for inserting.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289376/memory-allocation-bytes-exhausted-php-laravel/58290515#58290515","title":"Memory Allocation, Bytes Exhausted PHP/LARAVEL"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":5082301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/852676064815171/picture?type=large","display_name":"Saud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5082301/saud"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58290515,"answer_count":4,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570598772,"creation_date":1570547957,"question_id":58289376,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289376","body_markdown":"**Hey guys,**\r\n\r\nI am developing a system using [Laravel Excel/Maatwebsite][1].

This requires .NET Core, and also to pass as argument an array instead of a list:\r\n\r\n    public static MyStruct Total(this MyStruct[] source)\r\n    {\r\n        Debug.Assert(Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(MyStruct)) == 12);\r\n        var span = new ReadOnlySpan&lt;MyStruct&gt;(source);\r\n        var intSpan = MemoryMarshal.Cast&lt;MyStruct, int&gt;(span);\r\n        var sum = new Vector&lt;int&gt;(0);\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; span.Length - 1; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            var vector = new Vector&lt;int&gt;(intSpan.Slice(i * 3, 4));\r\n            sum += vector;\r\n        }\r\n        // The last one must be added separately\r\n        sum += new Vector&lt;int&gt;(new int[] {\r\n            source[^1].PropA, source[^1].PropB, source[^1].PropC, 0 });\r\n        return new MyStruct() { PropA = sum[0], PropB = sum[1], PropC = sum[2] };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere the `Vector` struct is under-utilized, since only three of the four available `int` slots are used (the fourth is discarded). You should also check the property [`Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated`][3] before entering this code path, because you&#39;ll get bad performance if the system does not support Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector-1\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector.ishardwareaccelerated","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289374/more-efficient-way-to-sum-multiple-properties/58292118#58292118","title":"More efficient way to sum multiple properties?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1133,"user_id":976921,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ac1797ebbdd989942744f0916f00f34?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/976921/thomas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7320,"user_id":215552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26bda02894d869c95f620de4b7cd386d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Heretic Monkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215552/heretic-monkey"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":87,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1570567453,"accepted_answer_id":58292118,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570559354,"creation_date":1570547952,"last_edit_date":1570548425,"question_id":58289374,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289374","body_markdown":"So far I have a solution in the vein of:\r\n\r\n    struct MyStruct {\r\n       int propA;\r\n       int propB;\r\n       int propC;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /*Extension Method*/\r\n    function MyStruct Total(this List&lt;MyStruct&gt; toSum) {\r\n       var sum = new MyStruct();\r\n\r\n       toSum.ForEach(x =&gt; {\r\n          sum.propA += x.propA;\r\n          sum.propB += x.propB;\r\n          sum.propC += x.propC;\r\n       });\r\n\r\n       return sum;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis iterates over the list once, adding up each property.

You need to specify a correct connection in your blob trigger. \r\n\r\nHere is my successful sample:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage com.function;\r\n\r\nimport com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;\r\nimport com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;\r\n\r\npublic class Function {\r\n\r\n    @FunctionName(&quot;BlobTrigger&quot;)\r\n    public void run(\r\n            @BlobTrigger(name = &quot;trigger&quot;, path = &quot;test/{fileName}&quot;, dataType = &quot;binary&quot;, connection = &quot;AzureWebJobsStorage&quot;) byte[] content,\r\n            @BindingName(&quot;fileName&quot;) String fileName,\r\n            final ExecutionContext context) {\r\n                context.getLogger().info(&quot;Blob: &quot; + fileName + &quot; -&gt; Length: &quot; + content.length);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use the &quot;AzureWebJobsStorage&quot; connection in my code, so I need to set a connection string in the local.settings.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;IsEncrypted&quot;: false,\r\n  &quot;Values&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;AzureWebJobsStorage&quot;: &quot;DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=storagetest789;AccountKey=*******w==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net&quot;,\r\n    &quot;FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME&quot;: &quot;java&quot;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run the function locally and upload a file to the storage, I will get outputs as following:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n1. When you publish your app to Azure Function App, the settings in your local setting file will not be updated to the cloud. You need to manually update them.\r\n\r\n2. Please ensure that you have made your storage account accessible. If you enable firewall for your storage account, you need to add your client IP for local test, and allow trusted Microsoft Services to access your storage.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n------\r\n\r\n1. If you develop with VS Code, you can upload local settings from the command palette: F1 -&gt; &quot;Upload Local Settings&quot;\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n2.

am attempting to use vb.net code to send individual pixel information as bytes to ffmpeg with the purpose of saving a still DPX image file. I have already successfully read DPX files and output them via STDOUT into vb.net code.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be many examples out there of piping movie files but there are also discrepancies, such as some people using image2pipe and others using rawvideo. I am uncertain when to use one over the other. The various methods I&#39;ve tried result in ffmpeg returned errors such as &quot;Packet too small for DPX header&quot; or &quot;Error while decoding stream #0:0: Invalid data found when processing input&quot;. As I understand it, I am not providing a header, only the raw individual pixel RGBRGBRGB.... values as a byte array.\r\n\r\nThe arguments sent to ffmpeg via command line are:\r\n\r\n-f image2pipe -pix_fmt rgb24 -s 16x16 -bits_per_raw_sample 8 -c:v dpx -i - \\MyPath\\MyFilename.dpx\r\n\r\n\r\nMy vb.net code is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Dim P As New Process\r\n    P.StartInfo.FileName = m_FFMPEGExecutable_PathFile\r\n    P.StartInfo.Arguments = (see above arguments)\r\n    P.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = False\r\n    P.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = True\r\n    P.StartInfo.RedirectStandardInput = True\r\n    p.Start\r\n\r\n\r\n    &#39;Test image: A single red, green, blue, black and white pixel followed by all black\r\n\r\n    Dim Tiny((16 * 16) - 1) As Byte\r\n\r\n    Tiny(0) = 255\r\n    Tiny(1) = 0\r\n    Tiny(2) = 0\r\n\r\n    Tiny(3) = 0\r\n    Tiny(4) = 255\r\n    Tiny(5) = 0\r\n\r\n    Tiny(6) = 0\r\n    Tiny(7) = 0\r\n    Tiny(8) = 255\r\n\r\n    For i As byte = 9 To ((16x16)-1)\r\n       Tiny(i) = 255\r\n    Next\r\n\r\n    &#39;Send the rgb byte array to ffmpeg:\r\n    P.StandardInput.BaseStream.Write(Tiny, 0, Tiny.Length)\r\n    P.StandardInput.Flush()\r\n    P.StandardInput.Close()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried many variations on the above ffmpeg arguments but cannot seem to avoid these errors.

I strongly suggest you read both 2 of mine related QAs first:\r\n\r\n- [Translation from Complex-FFT to Finite-Field-FFT](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18547575/2521214) code that finds and verifies the NTT prime root of unity and related parameters\r\n- [Modular arithmetics and NTT (finite field DFT) optimizations](https://stackoverflow.com/q/18577076/2521214) mine optimized 32 bit NTT\r\n\r\nso you can compare your results/code/constants with mine. However I evolved my NTT to use single hardcoded prime (biggest rooth of unity that fits in 32bit value).\r\n\r\nNow what can be wrong with your code.  I do not code in python but I do not see **NTT** code in your question. Anyway from what I can see:\r\n\r\n1. **check your root or unity**\r\n\r\n In your question you mention condition:\r\n\r\n        w^N = 1 mod M\r\n\r\n but that is far from enough. See the first link above it describes all conditions that must be met (with code that finds and check it). I am not sure your parameters complies all needed conditions and you just forget or miss wrote those or not **so check it**. IIRC I struggled with those conditions too as at the time I coded this there where very little NTT info at my disposal and most of them where incomplete or wrong...\r\n\r\n2. **You are not using modular arithmetics !!!**\r\n\r\n I assume Your prime is `M` (in mine terminology its `p`) so all the subresults must be smaller than `M` which is clearly not true in your example:\r\n\r\n        M = 65537\r\n        NTT(a) = [733, 66681, 147842, 92262, 130933, 107825, 114562, 127302]\r\n        NTT(b) = [666, 64598, 80332, 54468, 131236, 186644, 181708, 88232]\r\n \r\n as you can see only first element of both NTTs are valid all others are bigger than `M` that is wrong !!!\r\n\r\n3. **beware of overflows**\r\n\r\n Your `M` is **really small** `~16bit` in comparison to your input values which look `~8bit` that can overflow really fast invalidating your **NTT** results too.\r\n\r\n Here a quote from my second link I found out the hard and empirical way:\r\n\r\n    &gt; To avoid overflows for big datasets, limit input numbers to p/4 bits.\r\n    &gt; Where p is number of bits per NTT element so for this 32 bit version\r\n    &gt; use max (32 bit/4 -&gt; 8 bit) input values.\r\n\r\n so in your case you should process `16/4 = 4bit` chunks instead of 8 bit or use much bigger `M` for example like mine `0xC0000001` which is `~32bit`.\r\n\r\n This explains your observationa that first elements of product are good and then not ... realize if you multiply 2 8bit numbers you got 16 bit ... now realize you are doing more recursive additions of the multiplicated subresults so it will get above 16 bit `M` very soon in your case right in the second value ...\r\n\r\nSo in summary **you are not using modular arithemics**, have **too small prime** and/or process **too big chunks of data** and **possibly** have also **wrong prime selected**.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289336/schonhage-strassen-multiplication-implementation-error/58299765#58299765","title":"Schonhage-Strassen Multiplication implementation error"}],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":2649681,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f66a6131dd9087ee2f46e2cc9e87b81?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2649681","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649681/user2649681"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570609574,"creation_date":1570547819,"question_id":58289336,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289336","body_markdown":"I am attempting to implement the Schonhage-Strassen multiplication algorithm using NTT, and am running into a problem where the final resulting vector is not actually equal to what it should be.\r\n\r\nFor two input vectors `a`, and `b`, each consisting of `N` &quot;digits&quot; of `K` bits (the final `N/2` entries of each set to 0), each, given a modulus `M = 2^(2*K)+1`, a root of unity `w = N^(4*K-1) | w^N = 1 mod M`, a modular inverse of this value `wi | wi*w = 1 mod M`, and `u | u*N = 1 mod M`, the following python code is used to (attempt to) multiply these vectors using the Schonhage-Strassen algorithm:\r\n\r\n    #a and b are lists of length N, representing large integers\r\n    A = [ sum([ (a[i]*pow(w,i*j,M))%M for i in range(N)]) for j in range(N)] #NTT of a\r\n    B = [ sum([ (b[i]*pow(w,i*j,M))%M for i in range(N)]) for j in range(N)] #NTT of b\r\n    C = [ (A[i]*B[i])%M for i in range(N)] #A * B multiplied pointwise\r\n    c = [ sum([ (C[i]*pow(wi,i*j,M))%M for i in range(N)]) for j in range(N)] #intermediate step in INTT of C\r\n    ci = [ (i*u)%M for i in c] #INTT of C, should be product of a and b\r\n\r\nIn theory, taking the NTT of `a` and `b`, multiplying pointwise, then taking the INTT of the result should give the product, if I am not mistaken, and I have tested these methods for NTT and INTT to confirm that they are inverses of each other. However, the final resulting vector `ci`, rather than being equal to the product of `a` and `b`, is the product where each element is taken modulo `M`, giving an incorrect result for the product.\r\n\r\nFor example, running a test with `N=K=8`, and random vectors for `a, b`, gives the following:\r\n\r\n    M = 2^(2*8)+1 = 65537\r\n    w = 16, wi = 61441\r\n    u = 57345\r\n    a = [212, 251, 84, 186, 0, 0, 0, 0] (3126131668 as an integer)\r\n    b = [180, 27, 234, 225, 0, 0, 0, 0] (3790216116)\r\n    NTT(a) = [733, 66681, 147842, 92262, 130933, 107825, 114562, 127302]\r\n    NTT(b) = [666, 64598, 80332, 54468, 131236, 186644, 181708, 88232]\r\n    Pointwise product of above two lines mod M = [29419, 39913, 25015, 14993, 42695, 49488, 52438, 51319]\r\n    INTT of above line (i.e. result) = [38160, 50904, 5968, 11108, 15616, 62424, 41850, 0] (11848430946168040720)\r\n    Actual product of a x b = [38160, 50904, 71505, 142182, 81153, 62424, 41850, 0] (11848714628791561488)\r\n\r\nIn this example, and in pretty much every time I try it, the elements of the actual product and the result of my algorithm are the same for several elements near the beginning and end of the vector, but towards the middle they deviate.

me, it looks like you&#39;re looking for a logging functionality, and there are tons of well rounded logging applications/libraries out there that you don&#39;t need to reinvent the wheel. Also they will take care of locking etc, since you&#39;re constantly writing to a file that&#39;s something you need to think about and it will do it for you. \r\n\r\nOne of my favorites is [Serilog][1] which you can download as a `Nuget` package. You can find [installation][2] and [basic setup][3] info on links provided. Remember to install `Serilog` main package as well as `Serilog.Sinks.File` since you want to log to a file.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a really basic example of how to use it, but please read through the documentation and it provides tons of options may come in handy for you. I&#39;ve created a for loop to simulate your timely data, but the idea remains the same.\r\n\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration().WriteTo.File(&quot;voltage.log&quot;).CreateLogger();\r\n\r\n        var line = &quot;IDN = {0}, DCV = {1}&quot;;\r\n\r\n        var rnd = new Random();\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            var idn = rnd.Next(0, 100);\r\n            var dcv = rnd.NextDouble();\r\n\r\n            Log.Information(string.Format(line, idn, dcv));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe first line creates an instance of the logger, you only need to do this once. When you call `Log.Information()` it opens up the same file and writes a line, and closes it. This has the added advantage of logging time. Here&#39;s a sample output:\r\n\r\n&gt; 2019-10-08 10:46:28.697 -07:00 [INF] IDN = 57, DCV = 0.985960515209455\r\n\r\n&gt; 2019-10-08 10:46:28.717 -07:00 [INF] IDN = 88, DCV = 0.393538948331745\r\n\r\n&gt;

In most cases, we do not use AJAX to retrieve the data from the server.As far as I know, a page generates on the server side. My boss assigned a task for me to move to React JS. Apparently, to get the data, I will have to make Ajax calls. We cannot touch the back-end.\r\nAt the same time, my co-workers mentioned a fresh feature called &quot;Microservices&quot;. I have never used that technology before. I did some research and as I understood, a microservice is small component which does only one(or couple) actions. I think, the microservice component will be placed between View and Model. \r\nSomething like that: View(React) ---&gt; Microservice ---&gt; Controller --&gt; Model.\r\n\r\nBasically, View will make AJAX call to the microservice which will receive the right data from Controller and Model.\r\n\r\nI explained as I understood.

You will also need their bin directory to be on the path either for Windows or for jGRASP as above.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289311/jgrasp-wedge-error-command-bcc32-not-found/58289976#58289976","title":"jGRASP wedge error: command &quot;bcc32&quot; not found"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":9278805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/10vcf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Muhammad Hazlan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9278805/muhammad-hazlan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58289976,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570550142,"creation_date":1570547741,"question_id":58289311,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289311","body_markdown":"CompSci student here. for some reason, my jGRASP won&#39;t run.

I have Buildable objects (which include a Building and a Level) as well as an abstract templated LevelAddon object that implements Buildable. The concrete addons, for example an Entrance, would derive from the LevelAddon.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve already solved the problem one way using some factory methods but am trying to solve it using the Prototype design pattern now. I have created a Cloneable interface which uses some namehiding with the goal being to call Clone() on an object to get a unique_ptr to a new object of the same type / configuration.\r\n\r\nBecause Levels contain a vector of the addons they own, and those addons can be of any type, I inserted a GenericLevelAddon class as a layer between Buildable and LevelAddon&lt;T&gt; so you could store a list of the addons without knowing the derived types.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I cannot instantiate my derived addons (e.g. Entrance) because the compiler complains that my Cloneable&#39;s Base* CloneDervived method is overridden with a type that is not covariant with Buildable.\r\n\r\nBuildable interface:\r\n```c++\r\nclass Buildable {\r\npublic:\r\n\tvirtual ~Buildable() = default;\r\n\tstd::string GetName();\r\n\tvoid Build();\r\nprotected:\r\n\tBuildable(const std::string&amp;);\r\n\tvirtual std::string OnGetName();\r\n\tvirtual void OnAfterBuild() = 0;\r\n\tvirtual void OnBuild();\r\n\r\n\tstd::string name_;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloneable interface:\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate &lt;typename Base&gt;\r\nclass Cloneable {\r\npublic:\r\n\tvirtual ~Cloneable() = default;\r\n\tstd::unique_ptr&lt;Base&gt;

You will always tell it to set the variable named &quot;name&quot; to the String unassigned. try this\r\n \r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAdditionally you would want to create a constructor and make it overall more efficient (constructors can get rid of the setters and what not). \r\nIn full:\r\n\r\n    public class Main {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args){\r\n    \r\n        Program3a testClass = new Program3a();\r\n    \r\n        testClass.setName(&quot;Rex&quot;);\r\n            System.out.println(testClass.getName());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public  class Program3a {\r\n        private  String name;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        public String getName() {\r\n            return name;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setName(String name) {\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr the better looking constructor \r\n\r\n    public Program3a(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthis will require you to update your tester class of course (I use main).\r\n\r\n        Program3a testClass = new Program3a(&quot;Rex&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        System.out.println(testClass.getName());\r\n\r\nConstructors are automatically created as a ghost. This being overridden can take in the parameters of variables and reduce un-needed coding. Once this is created you use line `Program3a testClass = new Program3a(&quot;Rex&quot;);` to create a new class. The Rex now auto fills the variable Named and continues to use this value when `testClass.getName()` is called until altered.

you use ``ssh -R 9000:localhost:9000 user@myremotesite.com``, that indicates that the server/PHP you want to debug is at ``myremotesite.com``.\r\n\r\nWith that, the following statement is incorrect:\r\n\r\n&gt; Now, based on the instructions, I didn&#39;t see that I have to do any setup on the remote server. \r\n\r\nYou&#39;re debugging PHP on the *remote* server, and that is of course where you need to do the set-up. Xdebug lives inside PHP, and hence needs to be available on the remote Web server.\r\n\r\nThe settings that you need to make on the remote server should be so that it connects to your exposed SSH tunnel port. That means that the host/port that Xdebug needs to connect to is ``localhost:9000``, and no longer ``remote_ip``. Hence, these settings should work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nxdebug.remote_enable=1\r\nxdebug.remote_port=9000\r\nxdebug.remote_host=localhost\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the last two settings are already the default, you could even leave them out, and just use ``xdebug.remote_enable=1``.\r\n\r\nIn case you want to see what Xdebug does, also set ``xdebug.remote_log=/tmp/xdebug.log``. This will log connection attempts (if they exist) and also the full communication.\r\n\r\n&gt; I restarted Apache on my local computer\r\n\r\nThat would also not be needed, as your local Apache is not involved in debugging remote requests (i.e., the ones that run on ``myremotesite.com``&#39;s Apache.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289278/using-phpstorm-for-remote-debugging-something-not-quite-right/58289423#58289423","title":"Using PhpStorm for Remote Debugging - something not quite right"}],"owner":{"reputation":111,"user_id":10593052,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04677d6c1fcbfa8cfcea6bedf338e235?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10593052/brian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":116935,"user_id":783119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4bbfd3e5e9f8b698abf7cd1c7aae7a10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LazyOne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/783119/lazyone"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58289423,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570549812,"creation_date":1570547622,"last_edit_date":1570549812,"question_id":58289278,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289278","body_markdown":"I am following steps here to perform debugging on remote server:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/remote-debugging-via-ssh-tunnel.html\r\n\r\nLocally I am using MAC Sierra.\r\n\r\nIn PhpStorm I have PHP 7.0 as CLI, and it shows Xdebug is installed.

When I read the files into R with\r\n\r\n    read.csv(x, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n\r\neach file is correctly converted to y-m-d format for the date column except for the year 2018, which keeps it in the same m/d/y format. \r\n\r\nThis is an issue when I try to bring the dates into Lubridate because the m/d/y format is not compatible.\r\n\r\nI am unsure why only the year 2018 is having this problem.\r\n\r\nI have tried copying and pasting the dates into the numerical excel format and importing them into R with read.csv. I have copy and pasted in text format. I have also opened up a new excel and csv file and copied the data into those files. I also manually typed 2018 dates and imported into R with read.csv.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to fix this by:\r\n\r\n    y &lt;- read.csv(g, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %&gt;%\r\n      as.tibble()\r\n    y$date &lt;- gsub(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, y$date)\r\n    y$date &lt;- parse_date_time(y$date, orders = c(&#39;mdy&#39;, &#39;ymd&#39;))\r\n    y$date &lt;- as_date(y$date)\r\n\r\nBut I find this disconcerting and would like to know why excel does this for 2018 only and if others are have encountered this.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of what my 2001.csv file looks like after \r\n\r\n    y &lt;- read.csv(x, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %&gt;%\r\n      as.tibble()\r\n    y\r\n    \r\n    # # A tibble: 24 x 4\r\n    #    date       species Site_Code number\r\n    #    &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\r\n    #  1 2001-08-11 WN          23      0\r\n    #  2 2001-10-12 WN          23      0\r\n    #  3 2001-01-11 EEE         27      0\r\n\r\nAnd this is what the 2018.csv file looks like after being read in with the same code as above:\r\n\r\n\r\n    # A tibble: 84 x 4\r\n     date       species Site_Code number\r\n     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\r\n    1 4/16/2018  EEE         23      0\r\n    2 4/30/2018  EEE         23      1\r\n    3 5/7/2018   EEE         23      0\r\n\r\nNo error messages are generated\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289273/phantom-date-format-when-reading-2018-dates-from-csv-files-into-r","title":"Phantom date format when reading 2018 dates from .csv files into R"},{"tags":["python-3.x","while-loop"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8044,"user_id":8398549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tzrl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8398549/cid"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570548010,"post_id":58289260,"comment_id":102943297,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289260/dont-understand-what-is-problem-in-this-code#comment102943297_58289260"},{"owner":{"reputation":8044,"user_id":8398549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tzrl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8398549/cid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570548200,"post_id":58289260,"comment_id":102943388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289260/dont-understand-what-is-problem-in-this-code#comment102943388_58289260"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8010995,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1538098542885774/picture?type=large","display_name":"Abdullah Al Noman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8010995/abdullah-al-noman"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8044,"user_id":8398549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tzrl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8398549/cid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570548907,"post_id":58289260,"comment_id":102943759,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289260/dont-understand-what-is-problem-in-this-code#comment102943759_58289260"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8010995,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1538098542885774/picture?type=large","display_name":"Abdullah Al Noman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8010995/abdullah-al-noman"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8044,"user_id":8398549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tzrl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8398549/cid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571059229,"post_id":58289260,"comment_id":103104063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289260/dont-understand-what-is-problem-in-this-code#comment103104063_58289260"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":244,"user_id":5415398,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72ad0a25e17a427fd2666a69f49b6fac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aleister Tanek Javas Mraz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5415398/aleister-tanek-javas-mraz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570548006,"creation_date":1570548006,"answer_id":58289392,"question_id":58289260,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58289392","body_markdown":"In python, a while-loop has the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    while (condition):\r\n\r\nYou have your condition set to &quot;true&quot;; therefore, it will always be true.

It is not ideal to utilize a fixed 10 mins division of time though.\r\nMy df looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n             DateTime Total_Adults Site    Species  Group_equal_int Group_ideal\r\n  2016-05-28 18:29:14            1   1A wildebeest                1           1\r\n  2016-05-28 18:29:53            1   1A wildebeest                1           1\r\n  2016-05-28 18:30:02            1   1A wildebeest                1           1\r\n  2016-05-28 18:37:56            1   1A wildebeest                1           1\r\n  2016-05-28 18:45:03            1   1A wildebeest                2           2\r\n  2016-05-28 18:50:24            1   1A wildebeest                3           2\r\n  2016-05-28 18:50:40            2   1A wildebeest                3           2\r\n  2016-05-28 18:58:52            1   1A wildebeest                3           3\r\n  2016-05-28 18:59:25            1   1A wildebeest                4           3\r\n  2016-05-28 18:59:41            2   1A wildebeest                4           3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe observation are considered independent if 10 minutes apart, otherwise the two obs are counted as of the same animal. \r\n\r\nAn easy solution would be to divide the time series in 10 mins brackets starting from the first obs; \r\n\r\n```\r\ninterval &lt;- seq.POSIXt(from = min(df$DateTime), to = max(df$DateTime), by = 600)\r\ndf$Group_equal_int &lt;- findInterval(df$DateTime, vec = interval)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI prefer not to; this division is coherent as long as the observation are spaced less that 10 mins apart. Once the successive obs is more than ten mins apart from the previous, there is the possibility that the time interval chosen in the first place falls in the middle of a set of obs that should be considered a single obs (less than 10 mins between the first and the last) and count that as two obs. I show that happening in the Group_equal_int compared to the group_ideal.\r\n\r\nI would need to divide the time of my dataset in a way that account for this, yet I have no idea how to make the starting point of the 10 mins breaks to re-set every time two obs are further apart than 10 mins.\r\n\r\nany idea?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289244/r-adaptive-division-in-time-intervals-for-a-set-of-observations","title":"r - Adaptive division in time intervals for a set of observations"},{"tags":["vb.net"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53116,"user_id":1188513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNdZG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mathieu Guindon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1188513/mathieu-guindon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570548315,"post_id":58289243,"comment_id":102943453,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289243/why-does-it-error-when-i-use-list-box-dot-contains#comment102943453_58289243"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12183154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38cf729a09c15388b839dab0682c9dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mericanjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12183154/mericanjoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570550450,"post_id":58289307,"comment_id":102944492,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289243/why-does-it-error-when-i-use-list-box-dot-contains/58289307#comment102944492_58289307"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12183154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38cf729a09c15388b839dab0682c9dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mericanjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12183154/mericanjoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570550563,"post_id":58289307,"comment_id":102944542,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289243/why-does-it-error-when-i-use-list-box-dot-contains/58289307#comment102944542_58289307"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12183154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38cf729a09c15388b839dab0682c9dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mericanjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12183154/mericanjoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570550594,"post_id":58289307,"comment_id":102944556,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289243/why-does-it-error-when-i-use-list-box-dot-contains/58289307#comment102944556_58289307"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12183154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38cf729a09c15388b839dab0682c9dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mericanjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12183154/mericanjoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570550634,"post_id":58289307,"comment_id":102944578,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289243/why-does-it-error-when-i-use-list-box-dot-contains/58289307#comment102944578_58289307"},{"owner":{"reputation":25115,"user_id":2704659,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wObcB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rory.ap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2704659/rory-ap"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12183154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38cf729a09c15388b839dab0682c9dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mericanjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12183154/mericanjoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570550852,"post_id":58289307,"comment_id":102944682,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289243/why-does-it-error-when-i-use-list-box-dot-contains/58289307#comment102944682_58289307"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":25115,"user_id":2704659,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wObcB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rory.ap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2704659/rory-ap"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1570547723,"creation_date":1570547723,"answer_id":58289307,"question_id":58289243,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58289307","body_markdown":"Because a ListBox is a control, not a collection of things.

In cases where you can feed an element into an API, i.e.\r\n```\r\n    const elementReference = this.shadowRoot.querySelector(&#39;.collapse&#39;);\r\n    startCollapseWith(elementReference);\r\n```\r\nit is possible to graft light DOM solutions to shadow DOM trees, but I&#39;ve not seen a version of Bootstrap that surfaces this sort of API. Maybe it exists somewhere?\r\n\r\nThere have been some great conversations over the years of moving the Bootstrap default implementation over to web components: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/28131 and https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/18015 and https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/14200 but you&#39;ll be able to learn via those issues the current state of that. UI components, especially in the case of things like Bootstrap that is not heavily invested in a specific framework (if you exclude JQuery), are a brilliant use case for web components, I hope to see this path forward for the library gain steam as they target new versions.

In this case, we can remove all elements and put them back as we go along, skipping the second one (and keeping it aside to return it at the end)\r\n\r\n    public static Object removesecond(Queue queue){\r\n        Object toReturn;\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; queue.size(); i++) {\r\n            Object o = queue.remove();\r\n            if (i != 1) queue.push(o)\r\n            else toReturn = o;\r\n        }\r\n        return toReturn;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOf course this is a naive implementation.

problem is actually in your GUI. The code should really look something like this (C# used for example):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    var cmd = new SqlCommand(&quot;UbaciVlasnika&quot;, &quot;connstr&quot;);\r\n    cmd.CommandType=CommandType.StoredProcedure;\r\n    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(&quot;@ImeVlasnika&quot;, &quot;some text&quot;);\r\n    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(&quot;@PrezimeVlasnika&quot;, &quot;some text&quot;);\r\n\r\n    //ATTENTION! parse the string to date type; don&#39;t pass a string into to a date type parameter\r\n    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(&quot;@DatumRodjenja&quot;, DateTime.ParseExact(&quot;2019-01-01&quot;, &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));\r\n\r\n    //OR IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A DATE\r\n    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(&quot;@DatumRodjenja&quot;, myDateTimePicker.Value);\r\n\r\n    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(&quot;@JMBG&quot;, 12345);\r\n    cmd.Parameters.Add(&quot;@VlasnikID&quot;, SqlDbType.Int).Direction = ParameterDirection.Output;\r\n    con.Open();\r\n    int returnCode = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\r\n    con.Close();\r\n\r\n    MessageBox.Show(&quot;Output was &quot; + (int)cmd.Parameters[&quot;@VlasnikID&quot;].Value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the client side app we parse the parameters explicitly, to ensure that we&#39;re passing the right datatype to the server, rather than relying on implicit conversion. The db server might be in a different region to the app that is calling this procedure and hence have a different notion of how dates are formatted. The client app should always do the donkey work of parsing the argument, unless you change the signature of your procedure so it accepts a varchar and specifically convert the date inside the procedure - I&#39;d avoid doing this for aforementioned reasons about the front end knowing/caring about regions and localisation and culture etc whereas the back end db can/should remain ignorant of these things\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using SSMS to quickly test this SP, do this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @return_value int;\r\n    DECLARE @VlasnikID int; \r\n    DECLARE @im NVARCAHR(50) = N&#39;Petar&#39;;\r\n    DECLARE @pv NVARCAHR(50) = N&#39;Petrović&#39;;\r\n    DECLARE @dr DATE = &#39;1897-03-20&#39;; --or CONVERT(date, &#39;1897-03-20&#39;, 20)\r\n    DECLARE @jm INT = 2003897710341; --this is way larger than int&#39;s max value 2147483647 - change it!\r\n\r\n    EXEC @return_value = [dbo].[UbaciVlasnika] @ImeVlasnika = @im, @PrezimeVlasnika = @pv, @DatumRodjenja = @dr, @JMBG = @jm, @VlasnikID = @VlasnikID OUTPUT;\r\n\r\n    SELECT @VlasnikID as VlasnikID, @return_value as ReturnValue\r\n\r\nNote that you&#39;re trying to stuff ~2 trillion into an int, whose max value is ~2 billion\r\n\r\n----\r\nDisclaimer: For clarity, when I said &quot;should look something like this&quot; I mean to treat this as pseudocode example - not that this was the perfect ideal code that should be copypasta&#39;d straight into your production system.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I&#39;m making the point to **convert your data in the client, not rely on the implicit conversion on the server**. I&#39;m not specifically advocating use of AddWithValue; AWV makes for a great way to write some nice clean, simple parameterization code for a SqlCommand as an example on SO, though it opens up [a Pandora&#39;s box](https://blogs.msmvps.com/jcoehoorn/blog/2014/05/12/can-we-stop-using-addwithvalue-already/) of its own - consider whether you want it in a production system. It matters less with stored procedures because the parameter type that is used inside the procedure is defined in the procedure signature rather than inferred from the type inferred from the .net type passed to AddWithValue so I&#39;m more relaxed about it&#39;s use with SPs to the point where I don&#39;t usually draw attention to it unless people start pitchforking about it\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289220/problem-with-stored-procedure-inserting-date-format/58289369#58289369","title":"Problem with stored procedure inserting date

In fact, there are *two* uncommitted representations, in a normal Git repository, that you cannot refer to by name.  One of these is the stuff that is in the *index*—essentially, the proposed next commit—and the other is the stuff in the work-tree.\r\n\r\nIf the index is in a good state,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; you can run `git write-tree`.  The result is a hash ID.  This is not a reference name at all, it&#39;s just a hash ID, but a hash ID is usually just as good.  So if you&#39;d like some Git command to take notice of the proposed next commit, you can run `git write-tree` to write it to a tree object, and then use the resulting hash ID.\r\n\r\nThe work-tree, however, isn&#39;t at all suitable for this.  To turn the work-tree into a hash ID, you need to write it to the—or at least *an*—index and then run `git write-tree`.  You can use the environment variable `GIT_INDEX_FILE` to name a temporary file that will hold a temporary index.\r\n\r\nThe `git diff` and `git status` commands have built-in tricks to use the index and work-tree *as if* they were commits, but most other Git commands don&#39;t.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;If the ref is *symbolic*—as `HEAD` usually is—it just contains the name of another ref.  If that other ref doesn&#39;t actually exist, the symbolic ref won&#39;t resolve to a hash ID at all, and `git rev-parse` will fail on it, but `git symbolic-ref` will let you examine the target.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The index can be in the *merge conflict* state, in which it *can&#39;t* be converted into a tree object. In this case `git write-tree` just errors out.  Unfortunately, there is no good way to deal with this other than just to resolve the merge conflicts.  I say &quot;unfortunately&quot; because it would sometimes be very handy to stash (as if by `git stash` or some such) the conflicted state for safekeeping and/or transport, and the way Git is today, that&#39;s simply not possible.  You can get pretty close, using `git ls-files --stage` to translate the index into text and `git update-index` to invert that, but protecting temporary blob hashes from GC is a problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289214/how-to-explicitly-refer-to-the-current-uncommited-state-of-a-repo-in-a-git-diff/58290498#58290498","title":"How to explicitly refer to the current uncommited state of a repo in a git diff"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8371970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3ulllTZ9l18/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABMU/_afIi5dPHLA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lang Tran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8371970/lang-tran"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64598,"user_id":1755598,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/S6a50.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CodeWizard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1755598/codewizard"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570552292,"creation_date":1570547387,"last_edit_date":1570548981,"question_id":58289214,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289214","body_markdown":"When you run `git diff` or `git diff &lt;some commit&gt;` you&#39;re implicitly diffing the current state of the repo (whether staged or unstaged) implicitly against `HEAD` implicitly in the first case or whatever commit is specified in the latter case. \r\n\r\nMy question is: how do I explicitly refer to the current state of the repo?   \r\nIdeally, I&#39;d like to be calling something like `git diff CURRENT_STATE HEAD`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289214/how-to-explicitly-refer-to-the-current-uncommited-state-of-a-repo-in-a-git-diff","title":"How to explicitly refer to the current uncommited state of a repo in a git diff"},{"tags":["go","amazon-dynamodb","aws-sdk"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":109807,"user_id":221700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad32856042eea9fd2db5210ac033787d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"peterSO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/221700/peterso"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570548670,"post_id":58289213,"comment_id":102943637,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289213/does-aws-dynamodb-batchgetitempageswithcontext-handle-retries#comment102943637_58289213"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":2914703,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/D7TkG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pirfalt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2914703/pirfalt"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570547373,"creation_date":1570547373,"question_id":58289213,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58289213","body_markdown":"\r\nIn the aws go sdk, the\r\n`BatchGetItem` method explicitly states that the client should handle retries.

What happens? When have 5 request per hour it took 200s to get connection,\r\nbut when have 4 per second 1.3.?\r\n\r\nIs there a wrong in the configuration\r\n\r\n    spring:\r\n     datasource:\r\n        connectionTimeout: 10000\r\n        maxLifetime: 18000000\r\n        maximumPoolSize: 5\r\n        cachePrepStmts: true\r\n        prepStmtCacheSize: 250\r\n        prepStmtCacheSqlLimit: 2048\r\n        useServerPrepStmts: true\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\nAs I understand if we have a big period without a call to the DB this physical DB connections wrapped from Hikari are closed. \r\nDo I need to set **minimumIdle** and **idleTimeout** ? If I have inactivity 2 hours all the connections will be over maxLifetime and new connection will be created? No need of minimumIdle,right?\r\n**Example:**\r\nLet have\r\n\r\n    minimumIdle 1\r\n    idleTimeout 2 minutes\r\n    maxLifeTime 20 minutes\r\n\r\nWhen my app stays with nobody making requests during the night, I expect Hikari to close each connection 2 minutes after the connection&#39;s last request, after the last connection being closed create a new one (and hold it in the pool), and then close and re-create this idle connection every 20 minutes. Did I understood correctly? And is that a solution for my problem?\r\n\r\n&gt; The pool &quot;refill&quot; occurs every 30 seconds or so. So, if there are 5\r\n&gt; idle connections and a request comes in and consumes one of them,\r\n&gt; leaving 4 idle, if the request completes and the connection is\r\n&gt; returned before the &quot;refill&quot;, the pool will again have 5 idle\r\n&gt; connections and will not grow.\r\n\r\nLink:\r\n[\\[Understanding HikariCP’s Connection Pooling behaviour\\]][1]\r\n[![enter image

I want it to paste on a loop through (I assume this is more efficient). I also want the code to autofilter before copy and paste versus copy based on a condition which is how it is currently running (I think this is more efficient also).

This was deemed controversial by the ISO C++ committee when attempting to incorporate Concepts TS into the standard. They wanted a way to know by looking at a function declaration whether it was a template or not.\r\n\r\nAfter some back and forth, they [came up with an alternate terse syntax][1]: you use `auto` deduction (taken from generic lambdas), constrained by a concept name:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstd::integral auto plus1(std::integral auto a) {\r\n    return a + 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, most concepts implementations at present implement the Concepts TS functionality, with the newer stuff not yet implemented.

Here you have a kind of cycle since the width is also based on the content.\r\n\r\nIn this case the browser is ignoring the padding to find the width of the container based on its content then the padding is calulated based on that width and added to the image to create the overflow. The browser will not go back to change the container width because it will be an infinte loop.\r\n\r\nThe only way to fix this is to consider fixed values:\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide:
