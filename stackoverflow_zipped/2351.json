You&#39;ll notice in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.client.hubconnectionextensions.sendasync?view=aspnetcore-2.2) that it&#39;s defined as:\r\n\r\n    System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken = null\r\n\r\n(Although in the [actual code](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/3cd5054eb5d8851b25881cd05cccb931aaa022e6/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Client.Core/src/HubConnectionExtensions.SendAsync.cs#L23) it&#39;s `= default`, so I think the docs are wrong)\r\n\r\n[Optional arguments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#optional-arguments) must come last.\r\n\r\nBut also, using infinite parameters with the [`params`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/params) keyword must also come last. So you cannot use both in the same method definition.\r\n\r\nAn alternative could have been to create the method with the `CancellationToken` as the second-last parameter, and an overload without it:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static Task SendAsync (this HubConnection hubConnection, string methodName, params object[] args) {\r\n    return SendAsync(hubConnection, methodName, default, args);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static Task SendAsync (this HubConnection hubConnection, string methodName, CancellationToken cancellationToken, params object[] args) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat effectively makes the `CancellationToken` optional. However, in this specific case, it would also prevent you from sending a `CancellationToken` as the first argument (in the `args` array) and not in the `cancellationToken` parameter, if you needed to do that for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nBut Microsoft also has the standard of putting the `CancellationToken` as the last parameter in every async method they write.

How does the &quot;diag(g&#39;(z[3]))&quot; appear? Is this just the form needed for the matrix multiplication? \r\n 2. Where does the basis vector come from? Why is the basis vector in R2 as opposed to R3 like aj[2] is in? Please explain in detail as I&#39;m confused to this.\r\n\r\n 3. More general question: how come this derivation for the weight matrix update (dL/dW) seems to be different from the one expounded here [https://ailephant.com/programming-a-simple-neural-network/][3]. In this formulation, it says to adjust the weights by the error times the input times the sigmoid curve gradient. And in their code for the multilayer network, I&#39;m particularly unsure of how their updates are performed (and what layer2_delta variable represents).  Are these two distinct (but equivalent?) methods of backpropagation formulations? Or does the latter one [3] make assumptions which Ng&#39;s formulation doesn&#39;t?  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnswering any subset of these questions is fine.

My goal is to calculate Jaccard similarity from this data for each `identifier` and merge records that have values greater than or equal to some value. In other words, the process will be wrapped in a `while` loop until there are no more similarity values greater than the cutoff for merging. What I have so far is the dataset and the rows/columns with values greater than or equal to the cutoff. \r\n\r\n    require(data.table); require(WGCNA)\r\n    \r\n    set.seed(1)\r\n    data &lt;- data.table(identifier = LETTERS[1:10])\r\n    for (c in 1:10) set(x = data, j = paste0(&#39;col&#39;, c), value = sample(c(0, 1), 10, replace = TRUE))\r\n    \r\n    d &lt;- setDF(data[,!&#39;identifier&#39;]); rownames(d) &lt;- data[,identifier]\r\n    adj &lt;- WGCNA::adjacency(datExpr = t(d), distOptions = &quot;method = &#39;binary&#39;&quot;, type = &#39;distance&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    diag(adj) &lt;- 0.0; merge &lt;- which(adj &gt;= 0.75, arr.ind = TRUE)\r\n\r\nI need to update the `data` object by collapsing each row present in `merge` because those similarity values are higher than the cutoff, but preserve the rest of the data as well. The dataset will get iteratively smaller and more 1s will be present per the rows of `identifiers` that are merged. I am having trouble getting to the point where I can do this using `data.table` because the actual dataset is quite large, about 3400 rows and could potentially double. Also, I am using `WGCNA` for the Jaccard calculation but I imagine you could use a preferable one. \r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nSo I realized I was describing the problem and writing code a little bit differently. The code below more accurately represents the data and problem I am having. The 0s and 1s must be updated to show the union presence between two rows. \r\n\r\n    require(data.table); require(WGCNA)\r\n    \r\n    set.seed(1)\r\n    data &lt;- data.table(identifier =

Added table DDL, sample data, and trigger DDL at bottom of this post - long but seems simplifying this opens the doors for dismissal and obviously makes it easier for testing]\r\n\r\nSo I have two tables, Transaction and TransactionTransactionJunc.\r\n\r\nWhen a record is updated in TransactionTransactionJunc - it updates two or three columns in the Transaction table, Amount, AmountAppliedFrom and/or AmountAppliedTo.\r\n\r\nThe Transaction table has an update trigger that responds to updates of these 3 columns. When the Amount is updated, it updates the Balance and BalanceUndeposited columns of the same row, as well as updating a Customer table Balance as well. When the columns AmountAppliedFrom/To is updated, it updates the Balance column of the same row.\r\n\r\nSo, within an explicit transaction, if I update a row in the TransactionTransactionJunc table, I get an error in the Messages window of SSMS: \r\n\r\n&gt; Msg 3930, Level 16, State 1, Procedure\r\n&gt; TransactionTransactionJunc_AfterUpdate, Line 143 [Batch Start Line\r\n&gt; 109] The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot support\r\n&gt; operations that write to the log file. Roll back the transaction.\r\n\r\nIn, the Results window I have this:\r\n\r\n&gt; ErrorNumber ErrorSeverity ErrorState ErrorLine ErrorProcedure\r\n&gt; ErrorMessage 207 16  1 41 Transaction_AfterUpdate Invalid column name\r\n&gt; &#39;AmountDeposited&#39;.\r\n\r\nI think this is a concurrency issue where the trigger on Transaction is trying to update the row, but it is still locked by the trigger on the TransactionTransactionJunc table. I&#39;m not sure. But I KNOW that the Result window error message is wrong about the Invalid column name - the name is correct, is updating correctly via the Transaction update trigger when triggered by an SMSS sql update of the same columns the TransactionTransactionJunc table is updating. This is a false and misleading error.\r\n\r\nIf I have the TransactionTransactionJunc trigger disabled (and before I created it) and I update the same columns (within an explicit transaction) in the Transactions table via update sql it works just fine. It has something to do with the trigger on TransactionTransactionJunc making the update to the Transactions table vs me doing it manually.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure how to resolve this. I do want these to happen within a transaction for business data integrity. There are PK/FK relations between these tables - so no referential integrity issue would exists - but Customer Balances and Transactional balances could get out of kilter if only one part of this process happens. In the code below, I removed the FK definitions to other tables not involved. I also did not include indexes, etc... \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[Added table DDL, sample data, and trigger DDL - removed additional FK on Transaction table]\r\n\r\nTables and Sample

The most important change is the `np.c_` which does two things:\r\n\r\n   1. It converts `t` to array\r\n   2. It makes `t` a column vector\r\n\r\n1) serves as a &quot;germ&quot; for converting all the other lists to arrays via overloaded arithmetic operators.\r\n\r\nException: the unary `-` in front of `vn` hits `vn` before it gets the chance to become an array. We put a zero in front the `-` to make it binary, thereby reducing it&#39;s precedence and closing the array coercion chain. This is not the most obvious fix but the one involving the least typing.\r\n\r\n2) separates the time dimension from the summation dimension which is likely the correct interpretation. We have to add an eplicit `axis` argument to the sum which is the 1 we inserted at the very end of the expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978885/sum-in-python-where-list-of-list-are-in-exponential/57979256#57979256","title":"sum in python where list of list are in exponential"}],"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":5310328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ceOSUrau9gM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE0/B8XniZknx1c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mafeni Alpha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5310328/mafeni-alpha"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57979256,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568810068,"creation_date":1568739513,"question_id":57978885,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57978885","body_markdown":"I would like to write the following summation in python\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe coefficients are given as the following list\r\n\r\n    cn=[1.2,0.4,0.6]\r\n    vn=[1e-6,5e-5,1e-6]\r\n    gn=[4.5e3,6.5e3,9e3]\r\n    t=np.linspace(0,10,100)\r\nI tried the following \r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    cn=[1.2,0.4,0.6]\r\n    vn=[1e-6,5e-5,1e-6]\r\n    gn=[4.5e3,6.5e3,9e3]\r\n    t=np.linspace(0,10,100)\r\n    yt=np.sum(cn *np.exp(-vn*(t-gn)**2))\r\nbut am getting the error \r\n\r\n    TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: &#39;list&#39;\r\n\r\nI would like to know where am getting it wrong or how to do this task \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZbPB.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978885/sum-in-python-where-list-of-list-are-in-exponential","title":"sum in python where list of list are in exponential"},{"tags":["python","flask","jinja2","flask-wtforms"],"owner":{"reputation":1040,"user_id":5058116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8b3aa44d365bdecde8cda380de17513?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alex_lewis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5058116/alex-lewis"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568808901,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568739510,"creation_date":1568739510,"question_id":57978884,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57978884","body_markdown":"I am rendering a simple wtf form with the following:\r\n\r\n    {% from &quot;_form_helpers.html&quot;

first is a generic method that requires a concrete type that conforms to `Encodable`. That means for each call to `encode` with a different type, a completely new copy of the function may be created, optimized just for that concrete type. In some cases the compiler may remove some of these copies, but in principle `encode&lt;Int&gt;()` is a completely different function than `encode&lt;String&gt;()`. It&#39;s a (generic) system for creating functions at compile time.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the second is a non-generic function that accepts a parameter of the &quot;Encodable existential&quot; type. An existential is a compiler-generated box that wraps some other type. In principle this means that the value will be copied into the box at run time before being passed, possibly requiring a heap allocation if it&#39;s too large for the box (again, it may not be because the compiler is very smart and can sometimes see that it&#39;s unnecessary).\r\n\r\nThis ambiguity between the name of the protocol and the name of the existential will hopefully be fixed in the future (and there&#39;s discussion about doing so). In the future, the latter function will hopefully be spelled (note &quot;any&quot;):\r\n\r\n    func encode(value: any Encodable) throws -&gt; Data {...}\r\n\r\nThe former might be faster. It might also take more space for all the copies of the function. (But see above about the compiler. Do not assume you know which of these will be faster in an actual, optimized build.)\r\n\r\nThe former provides a real, concrete type. That means it can be used for things that require a real, concrete type, such as calling a static method, or `init`. This means it can be used when the protocol has an associated type.\r\n\r\nThe latter is boxed into an existential, meaning it can be stored into heterogeneous collections. The former can only be put into collections of its particular concrete type.\r\n\r\nSo they&#39;re pretty different things, and each has its purpose.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978850/whats-the-difference-between-using-a-generic-where-condition-and-specifying-arg/57980187#57980187","title":"What&#39;s the difference between using a generic where condition and specifying argument type?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4031,"user_id":1183071,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUpPp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GoldenJoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1183071/goldenjoe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1568748876,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568745400,"creation_date":1568739370,"last_edit_date":1568739389,"question_id":57978850,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57978850","body_markdown":"What advantages are there to using generics with a where clause over specifying a protocol for an argument, as in the following function signatures?\r\n\r\n    func encode&lt;T&gt;(_ value: T) throws -&gt; Data where T : Encodable {...}\r\n    func encode(value: Encodable) throws -&gt; Data {...}","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978850/whats-the-difference-between-using-a-generic-where-condition-and-specifying-arg","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"What&#39;s the difference between using a generic where condition and specifying argument type?"},{"tags":["xamarin","enterprise","in-house-distribution"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1134,"user_id":10308336,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rxGaJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jessie Zhang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10308336/jessie-zhang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568787651,"creation_date":1568787651,"answer_id":57986229,"question_id":57978849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57986229","body_markdown":"When we check Compare [Visual Studio 2019 Editions][1],we will find each version has all the features of the previous version, as well as additional features.\r\n\r\nWith Visual Studio Professional, it’s an excellent choice for most developers.

&quot;holiday&quot; is an example of a date without a time, and even without a time zone.\r\n\r\nMost holidays are religious in nature, and I don&#39;t want to start religious war, or get sidetracked by minutiae.  So as an example holiday, I&#39;m going to pick Earth Day:  April 22 of each year in the civil calendar.\r\n\r\nIf you write software that deals with holidays, said software isn&#39;t necessarily dealing with an instant in time across the entire planet (thought it could do that in addition to tracking holidays).  Instead it carries the concept that maps April 22 of each year to Earth Day.  And it is irrelevant that some people will experience Earth Day hours before or after other people.\r\n\r\nIf a client wants to know exactly when Earth Day starts/ends for him, then he can translate &quot;the date&quot; into specific instants of time using his particular time zone.  The need for that translation does not diminish the value of the date (say 2020-04-22).\r\n\r\nC++20 will have several types to represent a &quot;timezone-less date&quot; such as 2020-04-22 using different data structures:\r\n\r\n    local_days         // day 18374                   == April/22/2020\r\n    year_month_day     // year 2020, month 4, day 22  == April/22/2020\r\n    year_month_weekday // year 2020, month 4, 4th Wed == April/22/2020","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978845/is-just-a-date-without-time-really-a-valid-concept-in-the-light-of-internation/57979317#57979317","title":"Is &quot;just a date without time&quot; really a valid concept in the light of internationalization?"}],"owner":{"reputation":5411,"user_id":1025555,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KHob.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Good Night Nerd Pride","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1025555/good-night-nerd-pride"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57979317,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568743097,"creation_date":1568739352,"question_id":57978845,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57978845","body_markdown":"I always had conceptual troubles with date values being represented as objects without time (SQL for instance has the type `DATE` beside `DATETIME`). The same thinking often creates issues in languages that always store dates along with a time (e.g. C#&#39;s `DateTime`). Suddenly timezone bugs pop up and the developers insist that all that timezone hullabaloo can be ignored, because their `DateTime` is actually &quot;just a date&quot;. But what does that even mean?\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, such a &quot;plain date&quot; can be interpreted in only two ways:\r\n\r\n  1. From the perspective of points in time (i.e. &quot;instants&quot;) one might infer that &quot;2019-09-17&quot; means the start (end) of the day, which is &quot;2019-09-17 00:00:00&quot; (&quot;2019-09-17 23:59:59&quot;). Hence timezone information is relevant and we are not talking about &quot;just a date&quot;.\r\n  2. The other option is that the date is supposed to mean the whole day, so we are actually talking about a _timespan_ from &quot;2019-09-17 00:00:00&quot; to &quot;2019-09-17 23:59:59&quot; and timezone information cannot be ignored either.\r\n\r\nI argue that all use cases for &quot;plain dates&quot; fall in either of the two categories and that time/timezone can only be ignored if the software will only run on and communicate with systems configured with the exact same timezone.\r\n\r\nCan someone provide a counter example or a third interpretation?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978845/is-just-a-date-without-time-really-a-valid-concept-in-the-light-of-internation","title":"Is &quot;just a date without time&quot;

problem is more relative to C++ than Python.\r\n\r\nThe following should be considered:\r\n\r\n- QApplication is accessed by the entire application using the [`instance()`][1] method since it is a singleton.\r\n\r\n- When the [`exit()`][2] method is called, it does not eliminate the object just stop processing the events.\r\n\r\nSo when you create another QApplication without deleting the previous one, the instance is not created and therefore [`instance()`][1] is nullptr:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMessageBox\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    print(f&quot;app: {app}, instance: {QApplication.instance()}&quot;)\r\n    msg = QMessageBox()\r\n    msg.setText(&quot;Message Box 1&quot;)\r\n    msg.show()\r\n    app.exit(app.exec())\r\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    print(f&quot;app: {app}, instance: {QApplication.instance()}&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```console\r\napp: &lt;PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication object at 0x7effbd41ea50&gt;, instance: &lt;PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication object at 0x7effbd41ea50&gt;\r\napp: &lt;PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication object at 0x7effbd41eb90&gt;, instance: None\r\n```\r\nSo at the time of setting the text with setText() a signal is used that uses the eventloop through the QXApplication using the [`instance()`][1] method that as we see is nullptr generating the segmentation fault.\r\n\r\nIn the case of using other names for QXApplication the eventloop will access another [`instance()`][1] that will not be None (nullptr)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMessageBox\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    app1 = QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    print(f&quot;app: {app1}, instance: {QApplication.instance()}&quot;)\r\n    msg = QMessageBox()\r\n    msg.setText(&quot;Message Box 1&quot;)\r\n    msg.show()\r\n    app1.exit(app1.exec())\r\n    app2 = QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    print(f&quot;app: {app2}, instance: {QApplication.instance()}&quot;)\r\n    msg = QMessageBox()\r\n    msg.setText(&quot;Message Box 1&quot;)\r\n    msg.show()\r\n    app2.exit(app2.exec())\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```console\r\napp: &lt;PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication object at 0x7f3462720a50&gt;, instance: &lt;PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication object at 0x7f3462720a50&gt;\r\napp: &lt;PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication object at 0x7f3462720b90&gt;, instance: &lt;PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication object at 0x7f3462720b90&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n__________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion if you do not use `del` then instance() it will be None, however if you use it it will be called the destructor of the object in C++ eliminating the memory returned by [`instance()`][1] and allowing to create a new object.\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nAs [@ekhumoro][3] says:\r\n\r\n&gt; It&#39;s the exact order of deletion that really matters. Without `del`, the\r\n&gt; new `QApplication` is created before the old one is deleted (so the old\r\n&gt; `instance()` doesn&#39;t get replaced). But then the app variable is\r\n&gt; immediately reassigned, which implictly deletes the old application,\r\n&gt; making `instance()` return `None`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html#instance\r\n  [2]: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html#exit\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/984421/ekhumoro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978839/segmentation-fault-with-multiple-pyqt5-qtwidgets-qapplication-objects/57979309#57979309","title":"Segmentation fault with multiple PyQt5.QtWidgets.QApplication objects"}],"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":439905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d73b3f65f1c3479983efdb0c3e116eb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jacob Lee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/439905/jacob-lee"},"last_editor":{"reputation":171,"user_id":439905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d73b3f65f1c3479983efdb0c3e116eb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jacob Lee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/439905/jacob-lee"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57979309,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568744539,"creation_date":1568739317,"last_edit_date":1568740044,"question_id":57978839,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57978839","body_markdown":"Could someone explain to me why I get a segmentation fault if, in the following code, I remove `del app` between each call to QApplication&#39;s constructor?

Google chrome or any other softwares that installed in user&#39;s computer **is not what you should be able to access it and change it&#39;s properties without official permission from user**, if you do it, you&#39;ve hacked users software.\r\n\r\n - If there is some data that is important to you, and you have to access it from your front-end, and user is not eligible to access it, you have to save it somewhere that user **does not have access to it**; somewhere like your database table. But HTML tags, cookies, sessionStorage, localStorage,... . These are not good places to save important data, these are the best place to save weak data that not affect your site&#39;s functionality.\r\n\r\nthere is a endless list of attentions to say, but for now that&#39;s enough.\r\n\r\nIf you want to prevent user from overposting data there are multiple ways to do so:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n 1. **Bind Attribute**. You can use Bind attribute in your controller&#39;s action to include or exclude some kind of data that user can&#39;t pass to your action as model properties.\r\n\r\nimagine you have User model as below:\r\n\r\n    public class User\r\n    {\r\n        public int UserId { get; set; }\r\n        public string UserName { get; set; }\r\n        public string FirstName { get; set; }\r\n        public string LastName { get; set; }\r\n        public bool IsActive { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand this is your Edit action:\r\n\r\n    [HttpPost]\r\n    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]\r\n    public ActionResult Edit(User user)\r\n    {\r\n        //save expense to database\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd you don&#39;t want user to be able to change IsActive property.\r\n\r\nif you leave your action like above, any clever user can add extra property to the form and post it to action. But using Bind method like below you can prevent this kind of attack:\r\n\r\n    public ActionResult Edit([Bind(Include = &quot;UserName&quot;, Exclude = &quot;IsActive&quot;)]User user)\r\n    {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n 2. **You can use ViewModel**. Using ViewModel for each view helps you keep things simple and don&#39;t loose a point even if you accidentally forgot to use Bind attribute. In this case you can request or retrieve specific properties, and not even prevent attacks, but saving some memory.\r\n\r\n 3. **Server side checking**. In the post methods you can check your input explicitly to make sure user input does not damage your program.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57978819/secure-read-only-and-disabled-html-helpers/57982581#57982581","title":"Secure read only and disabled HTML helpers"}],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":3137590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Lejz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mazhar Hayat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3137590/mazhar-hayat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18874,"user_id":134725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb9010d5f80331e9a23a86c93917b5ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike Brind","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134725/mike-brind"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568757608,"creation_date":1568739242,"last_edit_date":1568753285,"question_id":57978819,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57978819","body_markdown":"I have to secure my HTML helpers like textboxfor in MVC in a way if user inspects or f12 and change the value I should take the original value or prompt with an error.

It must have an alias - so give it one. \r\n\r\nIn the query used to form the derived table, you have used incorrect syntax. You should not attempt to give the aggregated column the name of a.price (and you SHOULD be consistent with your names and their spelling - one day this inconsistency will bite you). Why? Well, first it is the source of your error. If you want the column to be named &quot;a.price&quot;, then you need to delimit it since it violates the rules for regular identifiers. But don&#39;t - the period (or dot) has a specific meaning / usage and using it in the column name is very, VERY misleading. So just give it an alias without the period.  \r\n\r\n    ... (select A.seller_id, A.product_id, min(A.price) as minprice \r\n    from ... ) as MinAssoc \r\n\r\nAs you can see in this snippet, I gave the derived table the alias &quot;MinAssoc&quot; - which is the first thing I mentioned. If you leave it out, you will encounter an error if you just fix the column alias problem. \r\n\r\nNext, stop using single letter aliases. That is just lazy. Sure, this is a short example and it is easy to see what your code does NOW. But you are building and reinforcing habits that will not serve you well and it reflects poorly on your work when others see it and need to decipher more complicated queries (because a single letter doesn&#39;t provide any help to understanding the &quot;thing&quot; a row represents). \r\n\r\nThese will fix your errors but you will need to use a different approach to your goal - as already suggested.

I need to find the two cheapest prices for each product (ordered by increasing price) and their corresponding vendors. The ideal column outputs are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproduct_id, product_description, seller_id, seller_name, price\r\n\r\np01, milk, s04, walmart, 1.50\r\n\r\np01, milk, s02, target, 2.25\r\n\r\np02, rice, s05, safeway, 1.30\r\n\r\np02, rice, s03, dillons, 1.75\r\n```\r\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried on SQL-server; it&#39;s an intermediate step towards the answer. I&#39;m triggering an error but don&#39;t understand why:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT TOP 2 *\r\nFROM\r\n\t\r\n\t(SELECT A.seller_id, A.product_id, min(price) AS A.price\r\n\tFROM Association A\r\n\tGROUP BY A.seller_ID, A.product_id)\r\n\r\n\tORDER BY A.price ASC\r\n```\r\nAnd the error:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nMsg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 8\r\nIncorrect syntax near &#39;.&#39;.\r\n\r\n```\r\nEdit: I used the solution proposed by Benjamin; it&#39;s near correct. Here&#39;s the query output:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nseller_id, product_id, price, m\r\n1\t1\t7.89\t1\r\n3\t1\t8.00\t1\r\n6\t1\t8.50\t1\r\n1\t2\t12.05\t1\r\n6\t2\t12.50\t1\r\n1\t3\t13.67\t1\r\n6\t3\t15.00\t1\r\n1\t4\t7.66\t1\r\n3\t4\t7.50\t1\r\n6\t4\t8.24\t1\r\n\r\n```  \r\nOf note, some product_id values, such as 1 and 4, occurred 3 times, where I only need the two lowest prices, not the third (or higher.) So I believe that this code is ordering by price, but not removing entries with a price higher than the second lowest.
