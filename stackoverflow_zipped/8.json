It is my understanding that when it processes it goes through and finds a match and should not care of the order. Correct me if i am wrong. I have a working project, it has been a while since i developed it, and i have all my custom routes in the routeConfig file. then at the very end of it i left the default route. This was to catch any links that did not follow a custom route. I did remove this at one point and it broke the site. So i left it at the end. Now in this new project i have done the same thing. For some reason it seems to be ignoring routes. So specifically i have a Explorer that shows a list of folders in a directory it has a custom route to get the contents of the main folder and then each folder listed is select-able to its content. Now i have an Action to delete a folder and when i have tried to &quot;Delete&quot; I am getting a page that says that the directory doesn&#39;t exist. If i put the default route on top it works. Thus ignoring the custom route. This also breaks the explorer from working as well. So when default route is on top it ignores what is below it. I really do not know what i am missing, however maybe someone else can see something i don&#39;t. \r\n\r\nHere is my routeConfig \r\n\r\n    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)\r\n        {\r\n            routes.IgnoreRoute(&quot;{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}&quot;);\r\n\r\n            routes.MapRoute(\r\n            name: &quot;Explorer&quot;,\r\n            url: &quot;Explorer/{*path}&quot;,\r\n            defaults: new { controller = &quot;Explorer&quot;,\r\n                            action = &quot;Index&quot;,\r\n                            path = UrlParameter.Optional }\r\n            );\r\n\r\n\r\n            routes.MapRoute(\r\n            name: &quot;DeleteFolders&quot;,\r\n            url:  &quot;Explorer/DeleteTreeItem/{*path}&quot;,\r\n               new { controller = &quot;Explorer&quot;, action = &quot;DeleteTreeItem&quot;, path = UrlParameter.Optional }\r\n            );\r\n\r\n            routes.MapRoute(\r\n            name: &quot;Default&quot;,\r\n            url: &quot;{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,\r\n            defaults: new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional }\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI have tried leaving the &quot;path = UrlParemeter.Optional&quot; out as well and it doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference. \r\n\r\nthanks for your help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58530489/issue-with-routing-in-mvc-route-config","title":"Issue with routing in MVC route.config"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","type-conversion"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":870966,"user_id":1144035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e514b017977ebf742a418cac697d8996?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Linoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571862431,"post_id":58530487,"comment_id":103384871,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58530487/convert-int-into-time#comment103384871_58530487"},{"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":8234225,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbe53eac0bd0632521fb9a4a1cbca837?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"WWaldo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8234225/wwaldo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":870966,"user_id":1144035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e514b017977ebf742a418cac697d8996?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Linoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571862808,"post_id":58530487,"comment_id":103385036,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58530487/convert-int-into-time#comment103385036_58530487"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":8234225,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbe53eac0bd0632521fb9a4a1cbca837?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"WWaldo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8234225/wwaldo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571862955,"post_id":58530494,"comment_id":103385104,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58530487/convert-int-into-time/58530494#comment103385104_58530494"},{"owner":{"reputation":4368,"user_id":5790584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gg8vN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Eric Brandt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5790584/eric-brandt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571863078,"post_id":58530494,"comment_id":103385158,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58530487/convert-int-into-time/58530494#comment103385158_58530494"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":870966,"user_id":1144035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e514b017977ebf742a418cac697d8996?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Linoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571862263,"creation_date":1571862263,"answer_id":58530494,"question_id":58530487,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58530494","body_markdown":"How about `timefromparts()`?\r\n\r\n    select timefromparts(col / 100, col % 100, 0, 0, 0)\r\n\r\n[Here][1] is a db&lt;&gt;fiddle.\r\n\r\nNote:  The time value `15:16:00` is not the same as `3:16:00`.

because of new error when starting up the local server (but I confirmed in another branch that making that edit alone doesn&#39;t produce the symptom below)\r\n\r\n**Context**: we have a personMap that shows a icons for a set of people, and you click one of them to open a PersonMapStory modal, which shows that person&#39;s story, then links to everybody else in a list at the bottom. If you scroll down and click one of those links, the story up top is replaced accordingly (with the new person&#39;s story), and list below is everyone else. In the code, the button onClick behavior for these bottom links is setActivePerson() to this new person. \r\n\r\n**New bug**: in this new branch, when we click a bottom link it calls setActivePerson() for person #2, but then also calls setActivePerson() for person #1 again! (Back from the original PersonMap li onClick behavior). So the symptom is that you see the first story, scroll down and click a different person&#39;s link, but the modal doesn&#39;t appear to update at all (though it&#39;s really updating twice). In the current/production/working branch it just updates once to the new person and that&#39;s that. This new behavior sounds reeeally similar to [this][1] onClick propagation issue. I tried adding stopPropagation() into the appropriate methods, but no luck. \r\n\r\n**Further info**: in this branch, it looks like ANY click from inside that modal (even if I click on the story that&#39;s displayed up top) calls SetActivePerson() with the original person, from the PersonMap line item onClick behavior, when thisPersonIsQueued is true. (So if I scroll down and click a new person, we SetActivePerson person #2, followed immediately by SetActivePerson person #1, so the modal keeps the same story and never appears to update). In the PersonMap state (viewed in Chrome Developer Tools/Components) there&#39;s a queuedUpPatient: typically in this scenario (in the original/production code) queuedUpPatient is null, but in this new branch, queuedUpPatient keeps the value of Person #1.

have just started learning R and am studying some probability and statistics examples. \r\n\r\nI have the following code snippet, which produces a vector `x` of length 100000 and sample means of

average and sample variance of the vector `x`.

There are 3 sections (Section A, B and C). As the user fills out the form each section is calculated by displaying total points and percentage. I would like to rank the scores and display it in the ranking column but cannot seem to figure how to do it. For example if Section A has 4 points and Section B has 3 points and Section C has 0 points then section A would have the rank of 1, section B would have the rank of 2 and section C would have the rank of 3. Also having the ranking change as the form is being filled out would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI am new to JavaScript, this is an assignment for class I am currently taking. I am having trouble on how to logically implement this. This is just a sample of my form. I really have a much larger form with more sections and questions. Please run my code so you can see a better visual. Any code snippets and advice that would help me will be appreciated. I understand that my code is not the best but like I said I am still learning also my professor wanted us to practice the way my code is structured so changing this code would probably result in some point deductions per my professor.

recently had to migrate an infrastructure consisting of a load balancer and three backends. Each backend is setup with apache2 to handle HTTP/HTTPs requests and forward them through the AJP protocol to a tomcat server.\r\n\r\nSomething I don&#39;t understand appears in apache2. If I look to the server-status page, I see a bunch of [workers][1] stuck in a read state, with the request being the NULL request.\r\nAfter the [Timeout][2] of apache2 is reached, the worker is killed and no timeout error (408) is sent to the client, which makes sense since the client is not even making a request..\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s like the socket is not properly closed or something like that but i&#39;m not sure. We didn&#39;t experienced this with apache2.2 and now we are using apache2.4. The connection doesn&#39;t appear in tomcat, only in apache.\r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated by a low Timeout value but I would like to know if this is something well-known from the community, with a simple solution, or if there are ways to properly solve this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Configuration*:\r\nApache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu). mod_jk/1.2.43.

Your `max_element` implementation always calculates `Score()` for its comparison whereas your `for` loop caches the result of the `Score()` function.\r\n\r\nA better implementation of `Node` might be:\r\n```c++\r\nclass Node {\r\nmutable:\r\n    double cached_score = std::numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::quiet_Nan();\r\npublic:\r\n    auto Score() const -&gt; double {\r\n        if(std::isnan(cached_score)){\r\n           std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;complex calculation\\n&quot;;\r\n           counter++;\r\n           cached_score = 1;\r\n        }\r\n        return cached_score;\r\n    }\r\n    void invalidate_cache() {\r\n      cached_score = std::numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::quiet_Nan();\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis way the complex calculation is only performed once.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, write your own abstraction:\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;cfloat&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;array&gt;\r\n#include &lt;algorithm&gt;\r\n#include &lt;numeric&gt;\r\n\r\nstatic int counter;\r\n\r\nclass Node {\r\npublic:\r\n    auto Score() const -&gt; double {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;complex calculation\\n&quot;;\r\n        counter++;\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate&lt;class ForwardIt, class Evaluate, class Compare&gt;\r\nForwardIt max_eval_element(\r\n    ForwardIt first,\r\n    ForwardIt last,\r\n    Evaluate eval,\r\n    Compare comp\r\n){\r\n    if (first == last) return last;\r\n\r\n    ForwardIt largest = first;\r\n    auto largest_val = eval(*first);\r\n    ++first;\r\n    for (; first != last; ++first) {\r\n        const auto this_val = eval(*first);\r\n        if (comp(largest_val, this_val)) {\r\n            largest = first;\r\n            largest_val = this_val;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return largest;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\r\n    std::array&lt;Node, 10&gt; nodes;\r\n\r\n    counter = 0;\r\n    Node const* nodePtr = max_eval_element(std::cbegin(nodes), std::cend(nodes),\r\n                                       [](Node const&amp; node){ return node.Score(); },\r\n                                       [](double const &amp;a, double const &amp;b) {\r\n                                           return a&lt;b;\r\n                                       });\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;algorithm count &quot; &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n\r\n    counter = 0;\r\n    double maxScore = -FLT_MAX;\r\n    for (const auto&amp; node : nodes) {\r\n        auto score = node.Score();\r\n        if (score &gt; maxScore) {\r\n            maxScore = score;\r\n            nodePtr = &amp;node;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;raw loop count &quot; &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this instance, both loops perform the same number of evaluations.\r\n\r\nMany internal codebases I&#39;ve worked with have extensive libraries which extend the STL. It gives the teams I&#39;ve worked on much greater confidence that their code has been written correctly and allows you to interpret complex operations at a glance. In this way, these abstractions also reduce the effort of understanding code and the effort of communication.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58530330/c-no-raw-loops-without-losing-perfomance/58530574#58530574","title":"C++ &quot;No raw loops&quot; without losing perfomance"}],"owner":{"reputation":3710,"user_id":6717178,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QbOLx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JHBonarius","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6717178/jhbonarius"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3710,"user_id":6717178,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QbOLx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JHBonarius","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6717178/jhbonarius"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":87,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571865373,"creation_date":1571861473,"last_edit_date":1571861982,"question_id":58530330,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58530330","body_markdown":"So the &#39;new (old) big thing&#39; is &quot;No Raw Loops&quot; in C++.

We can instantiate a model **B** like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nnum_in_units = 500\r\nmodel = create_model_B(num_in_units) # Works!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd benefit from all the advantages of a tf.keras.Model. But, the problem arises when we want to obtain the result of an intermediate layer that is of sub-model *A*. If the layer is part of model **B**, everything work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ninter_model_1 = tf.keras.Model(\r\n    model.input, model.get_layer(&#39;downsize_1&#39;).output) # Works!\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if the layer is of sub-model A:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ninter_model_2 = tf.keras.Model(\r\n    model.input, model.get_layer(&#39;A_3&#39;).output) # Does not work!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis crashes with the error:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nValueError: Graph disconnected: cannot obtain value for tensor Tensor(&quot;input_4:0&quot;, shape=(None, 250), dtype=float32) at layer &quot;input_4&quot;. The following previous layers were accessed without issue: [] \r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure I understand all the inside mechanics of keras. But what I understand when I dove in the source code, is that sub-models used this way have two input tensors object created. They can be printed like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint([n.input_tensors.name for n in model.get_layer(&#39;A_3&#39;).inbound_nodes])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis yields:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n[&#39;input_4:0&#39;, &#39;batch_normalization_5/Identity:0&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne is the sub-model `tf.keras.Input` and the other one is the input linked to the top-model. \r\n\r\nWhen building a new model from a top-model **B** input tensor to a top-model **B** output tensor, the path in the graph seems to correctly pass by the `&#39;batch_normalization_5&#39;` input and both tensors are correctly connected in the graph.\r\n \r\nHowever, when trying to link a top-model **B** input tensor to a sub-model **A** output tensor, the output tensors seems to be connected to the sub-model tf.keras.Input adn the path and both tensors are then disconnected.\r\n\r\nA solution I found at the moment is to use the top-model version of the tensor ```model.get_layer(&#39;A_3&#39;).output```:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel.get_layer(&#39;A_3&#39;)._outbound_nodes[0].input_tensors\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this seems overcomplicated and not clean... In addition, it does not let us make use of the layers inside model **A**.\r\n\r\nI wonder if someone could give me some precision on this particular `tf.keras` behavior. Am I right to do so? Is this the intended behavior? Is this a bug?
