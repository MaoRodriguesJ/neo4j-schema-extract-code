A non-key column cannot be used in an index scan search qualification, and it is disregarded for purposes of any uniqueness or exclusion constraint enforced by the index. However, an index-only scan can return the contents of non-key columns without having to visit the index&#39;s table, since they are available directly from the index entry. Thus, addition of non-key columns allows index-only scans to be used for queries that otherwise could not use them.\r\n\r\nIn your case imagine you have an index on sup_id. If you only select sup_id in your query postgres will do an index only scan, but if you select other columns along with id, such as title and date, postgres will have to visit the index table and select these columns, which is slower than an index-only scan.&lt;br&gt;\r\nSo if you want your select query to be faster you include the columns you want in your index. Beware that this will increase the size of the index considerably. Only use it if you have a small number of columns in your select query.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351617/when-should-i-use-postgresql-index-include/58354245#58354245","title":"When should I use PostgreSQL Index Include?"}],"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":10912170,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/162f583a43866a0792789459c05dab0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10912170/sha"},"last_editor":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570883844,"creation_date":1570862776,"last_edit_date":1570869235,"question_id":58351617,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58351617","body_markdown":"Assume that I have a query like below:\r\n\r\n    Select \r\n    t2.date,\r\n    max(t1.title),\r\n    sum(t2.spend)\r\n    ...\r\n    from table1 t1\r\n    left join table t2 on t1.id = t2.t1_id\r\n    where t1.sup_id = 1\r\n    group by t2.date\r\n    order by t2.date\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL 11+ supports index include.

your comment above, it appears that you want to write (update) a document of the `classrooms` collection. More precisely, update the `access` field which is of type Map (see [doc][1] for Firestore types).\r\n\r\nSo your Cloud Function shall simply be triggered when you update this document and to get the value of the `access` map you will call `snap.data().access`.\r\n\r\n    exports.createAccessDetails = functions.firestore.document(&#39;classrooms/{classId}&#39;).onWrite((snap, context) =&gt; {\r\n      const data = snap.data();\r\n    \r\n      const accessMap = snap.data().access;\r\n      const writeAccessMap = accessMap.writeAccess\r\n     \r\n      //........\r\n    \r\n      return null;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n**********\r\n**Update following your comment below:** \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t have a full view of your exact business requirements (in particular I see that you mention writeAccess and readAccess) but you could maybe have the following approach:\r\n\r\nFor each `classroom` doc you create two sub-collections: `writeAccess` and `readAccess`. Each time you want to save an access you write a new document in one of these collections.\r\n\r\nYou can then query the sub-collections to find the docs where a given id has read or write access. Then from the QueryDocumentSnapshot returned by these queries you can find the parent document (through the `ref` property).\r\n\r\nHowever, this means that you will have an extra read to get the classroom details from the results of the queries to the `writeAccess` and `readAccess` collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/data-types","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351564/cloud-firestore-is-not-triggering-onwrite-in-wildcard/58353405#58353405","title":"Cloud Firestore is not triggering onWrite in wildcard"}],"owner":{"reputation":1661,"user_id":7393155,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1051ac2ca2939fadb8b01fa691194a63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Subhendu Kundu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7393155/subhendu-kundu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570902449,"creation_date":1570862393,"last_edit_date":1570902449,"question_id":58351564,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58351564","body_markdown":"I am trying write an aggragation function to update a few details on a value change of a nested object of a doc in wildcard.\r\n```\r\nexports.createAccessDetails = functions.firestore.document(&#39;classrooms/{classId}/access/{accessType}&#39;).onWrite((snap, context) =&gt; {\r\n  // const data = snap.data();\r\n  const { classId, accessType } = context.params;\r\n  console.log(snap);\r\n  console.log(classId, accessType);\r\n  return null;\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThen updating the object like on a button click\r\n```\r\nfunction setAccess() {\r\n  const date = Date.now();\r\n  Firebase.firestore.collection(&#39;classrooms&#39;)\r\n    .doc(&#39;1570776211111&#39;).update({\r\n      [`access.writeAccess.${date}`]: true\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?

you can mismatch call/ret and do them manually (at a large performance code), but you have to emulate them correctly (including what they do to the stack pointer) if you want to not break anything.\r\n\r\n&gt; but second example does not work\r\n\r\n`push` / `ret` is equivalent to `jmp` to an absolute address. (Except for performance: it always causes a branch mispredict and mismatches the call/ret predictor).\r\n\r\n\r\n**You jump to the right place (presumably) but you forgot to pop the return address off the stack**.  So you &quot;return&quot; with ESP pointing to the wrong place.  That can easily lead to a crash in most callers; their own `ret` may pop the wrong return address.\r\n\r\n(A caller that was using EBP as a frame pointer and didn&#39;t access anything relative to ESP before `leave` / `ret` might not notice.  e.g. if the caller&#39;s asm was generated by a C compiler in debug mode.  Even with that, modern Linux requires 16-byte stack alignment before a `call`, and function calls made after calling your `func2` broke its ESP would no longer be made with 16-byte aligned stack.  Some libc functions may crash when you violate the ABI that way.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n## Normally you&#39;d describe things as:\r\n\r\n* `call target` = `push $retaddr` ; `jmp target` ; `retaddr:`\r\n* `ret` = `pop %tmp` ; `jmp *%tmp`.  It&#39;s an indirect branch.  \r\n  (Think of `ret` as a way to write `pop %eip`)\r\n\r\nBut yes if a function only has one caller, you could hardcode the return address and use `add $esp, 4` / `jmp after_call` instead of `ret`.

This effectively makes `func2` a block that&#39;s that part of `func1` for some ways of looking at it.

This is the approach I have tried\r\n\r\n\r\nI get the date using \r\n\r\n     new currentDate = new Date();\r\n\r\nI pass this date into weekly items to get my weekly items object.\r\nThe below function uses two other functions called `addDays` and `dateToString` to properly render the dates.\r\n\r\n    const weeklyItems = (date) =&gt; {\r\n        const day1 = dateToString(addDays(date, 1));\r\n        const day2 = dateToString(addDays(date, 2));\r\n        const day3 = dateToString(addDays(date, 3));\r\n        const day4 = dateToString(addDays(date, 4));\r\n        const day5 = dateToString(addDays(date, 5));\r\n        const day6 = dateToString(addDays(date, 6));\r\n        const currentDate = dateToString(date);\r\n        return {\r\n            currentDate : [],\r\n            day1: [],\r\n            day2: [],\r\n            day3: [],\r\n            day4: [],\r\n            day5: [],\r\n            day6: []\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n`addDays` and `dateToString` are my helper functions:\r\n\r\n    function addDays(date, days) {\r\n        var result = new Date(date);\r\n        result.setDate(result.getDate() + days);\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis function converts a date object into the form &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39; which is what is required by `Agenda`\r\n\r\n    function dateToString (date) {\r\n        const newString  = moment(date).format(&#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;);\r\n        return newString.toString()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have checked to see if my dates were correct and they all check out. I also have used `currentDate` and `day6` as my objects for the `minDate` and `maxDate` props for `Agenda` and they work as expected.\r\n\r\nAfter doing this my `Agenda` now looks like this:\r\n\r\n     &lt;Agenda\r\n        minDate = {currentDate}\r\n        maxDate = {day6}\r\n        selected = {currentDate}\r\n        items: {weeklyItems(currentDate)}\r\n        renderEmptyDate={() =&gt; {return (&lt;View/&gt;);}}\r\n    /&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd this makes it stop working.

This is why the strings in the original array end up modified.\r\n\r\nTo fix this use `map` twice, first to &quot;create new array based on existing array&quot;, and then the second time to &quot;create new string based on existing string&quot;.

If a line (Line A) is drawn from point A to anywhere on another line (line B), how can I create a function that will create a new line that is perpendicular to the original line (and also intersects line B)? I have been having trouble in manipulating specific points between two points (essentially I cannot find the exact location where an intersection happens and this location is key for my project).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n \r\nOther constraints to this include that if Line A intersects with Line B and creates a perpendicular line, it instead creates line C that goes in the same direction of Line A but backwards.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: because a perpendicular new line can be 90 degrees left or right with respect to Line A, how can I make it so that if a line with length X crosses another line (Line C) on one side and not the other, then the third generated line will only be made in the non-Line-C intersecting path. \r\n\r\nLastly, this kind of function would need to be recursive. Does anyone have any ideas that could help me in the right direction? \r\n\r\nBTW I am using Python and am trying to figure out a solution that utilizes matplotlib (using other packages in addition to this are fine).\r\n\r\nGreatly appreciate all of your help and support on this channel!

You can replace:\r\n\r\n    filters: {\r\n        ...newArr,\r\n    },\r\n\r\nby just:\r\n\r\n    filters: newArr,\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351497/redux-deep-clone-state-is-always-equal/58351631#58351631","title":"Redux deep clone - state is always equal"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":310,"user_id":5956254,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a849b77326a2042e9cf49adce52f0dac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raju","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5956254/raju"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570863371,"creation_date":1570863371,"answer_id":58351667,"question_id":58351497,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58351667","body_markdown":"you can use  [Immer][1] , redux also uses this for immutable updates for nested stuffs.\r\nBecause of this, you can write reducers that appear to &quot;mutate&quot; state, but the updates are actually applied immutably.\r\n```\r\nconst initialStateData = {\r\n  jobOffers: {\r\n    filters: {\r\n      employments: [],\r\n      careerLevels: [],\r\n      jobTypeProfiles: [],\r\n      cities: [],\r\n      countries: [],\r\n    },\r\n    configs: {\r\n      searchTerm: &#39;&#39;,\r\n      currentPage: 1,\r\n      pageSize: 5,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n```\r\nexport const reducer = immer.produce((state = initialStateData, action) =&gt; {\r\n    switch (action.type) {\r\n      case Action.TOGGLE_ARR_FILTER:\r\n          \r\n            const subArr = state.jobOffers.filters[action.key];\r\n            const filterIdx = subArr.indexOf(action.value[0]);\r\n            const newArr = state.jobOffers.filters;\r\n\r\n            if (filterIdx !== -1) \r\n              newArr[action.key].splice(filterIdx, 1);\r\n            else \r\n              newArr[action.key].push(action.value[0]);\r\n            \r\n            return state;\r\n           }\r\n          })        \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351497/redux-deep-clone-state-is-always-equal/58351667#58351667","title":"Redux deep clone - state is always equal"}],"owner":{"reputation":597,"user_id":10539128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7605d7f5027335de6852ba7459d7a9fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gutelaunetyp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539128/gutelaunetyp"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58351631,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570863371,"creation_date":1570861776,"question_id":58351497,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58351497","body_markdown":"I have the following reducer in React Redux:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    export const reducer = (state = initialStateData, action) =&gt; {\r\n        switch (action.type) {\r\n          case Action.TOGGLE_ARR_FILTER:\r\n            {\r\n              const subArr = state.jobOffers.filters[action.key];\r\n              const filterIdx = subArr.indexOf(action.value[0]);\r\n              const newArr = { ...state.jobOffers.filters\r\n              };\r\n\r\n              if (filterIdx !== -1) {\r\n                newArr[action.key].splice(filterIdx, 1);\r\n              } else {\r\n                newArr[action.key].push(action.value[0]);\r\n              }\r\n\r\n              return {\r\n                ...state,\r\n                jobOffers: {\r\n                  ...state.jobOffers,\r\n                  filters: {\r\n                    ...newArr,\r\n                  },\r\n                },\r\n              };\r\n            }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd this is my object:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const initialStateData = {\r\n      jobOffers: {\r\n        filters: {\r\n          employments: [],\r\n          careerLevels: [],\r\n          jobTypeProfiles: [],\r\n          cities: [],\r\n          countries: [],\r\n        },\r\n        configs: {\r\n          searchTerm: &#39;&#39;,\r\n          currentPage: 1,\r\n          pageSize: 5,\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    };\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reducer as such seems to work, it toggles the values correctly.\r\n\r\nBut: Redux always shows &quot;states are equal&quot;, which is bad as it won&#39;t recognize changes.\r\n\r\nCan someone help ?

actually answering the question, it is useful to remember what a `Context` is; whenever you are writing an implementation of a `Future` that depends on outside resources (say, I/O), you do not want to busy-wait anything. As a result, you&#39;ll most likely have implementations of `Future` where you&#39;ll return `Pending` and then wake it up. `Context` (and `Waker`) exist for that purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is what they are: low-level, implementation details. If you are using a `Future` already as opposed to writing a low-level implementation of one, the `Waker` will most likely be contained *somewhere*, but not directly accessible to you.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, a `Waker` directly leaking is an implementation detail leak 99.9% of the time and not actually recommended. A `Waker` being used as part of a *bigger* `struct` is perfectly fine, however, but this is where you&#39;ll need to implement your own `Future` from scratch. **There is no other valid use case for this**, and in normal terms, you should never need direct access to a `Waker`.\r\n\r\nDue to the limitations of the playground, I sadly cannot show you a live example of when it is useful to get this `Waker`; however, such a future setup may be used in such a situation: let&#39;s assume we&#39;re building the front door of a house. We have a doorbell and a door, and we want to be notified when somebody rings the doorbell. However, we don&#39;t want to have to wait at the door for visitors.\r\n\r\nWe therefore make two objects: a `FrontDoor` and a `Doorbell`, and we give the option to `wire()` the `Doorbell` to connect the two.\r\n\r\n    pub struct FrontDoor {\r\n        doorbell: Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;Doorbell&gt;&gt;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    impl FrontDoor {\r\n        pub fn new() -&gt; FrontDoor {\r\n            FrontDoor {\r\n                doorbell: Arc::new(RwLock::new(Doorbell {\r\n                    waker: None,\r\n                    visitor: false\r\n                }))\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        pub fn wire(&amp;self) -&gt; Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;Doorbell&gt;&gt; {\r\n            self.doorbell.clone() // We retrieve the bell\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    impl Future for FrontDoor {\r\n    \r\n        type Output = ();\r\n        \r\n        fn poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {\r\n            self.doorbell.read().map(|guard| {\r\n                match guard.visitor {\r\n                    true =&gt; Poll::Ready(()),\r\n                    false =&gt; Poll::Pending\r\n                }\r\n            }).unwrap_or(Poll::Pending)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    pub struct Doorbell {\r\n        waker: Option&lt;Waker&gt;,\r\n        pub visitor: bool\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    impl Doorbell {\r\n        pub fn ring(&amp;mut self) {\r\n            self.visitor = true;\r\n            self.waker.as_ref().map(|waker| waker.wake_by_ref());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOur `FrontDoor` implements `Future`, which means we can just throw it on an executor of your choice; `waker` is contained in the `Doorbell` object and allows us to &quot;ring&quot; and wake up our future.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58351482/is-there-a-way-to-get-a-reference-to-the-current-tasks-context-in-an-async-func/58353120#58353120","title":"Is there a way to get a

\r\n```=GOOGLEFINANCE(&quot;NASDAQ:GOOGL&quot;, &quot;close&quot;,TODAY()-60,TODAY(),&quot;WEEKLY&quot;)```\r\n\r\nYou can adjust the `TODAY()-60` to a start date `DATE(2019,1,1)` for example: \r\n\r\n```=GOOGLEFINANCE(&quot;NASDAQ:GOOGL&quot;, &quot;close&quot;,DATE(2019,1,1),TODAY(),&quot;WEEKLY&quot;)```\r\n\r\n or how you&#39;d like to do it. It might update the current week in real time if you use `&quot;price&quot;` instead of `&quot;close&quot;`, not sure since it&#39;s the weekend, and so nothing is ticking or updating right now. \r\n\r\nSince it appears you just want a single result of the most recent weeks closing price, try this: \r\n\r\n```=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(&quot;NASDAQ:GOOGL&quot;,&quot;price&quot;,TODAY()-14,TODAY(),&quot;WEEKLY&quot;),3,2)```\r\n\r\nImproved the integer for the one above, but it could still theoretically break. \r\n\r\nTry this instead, as it gives a 30 day range but only selects the result from within 1 week: \r\n\r\n`=INDEX(QUERY(GOOGLEFINANCE(&quot;NASDAQ:GOOGL&quot;,&quot;price&quot;,TODAY()-30,TODAY(),&quot;WEEKLY&quot;),&quot;select Col2 where Col1 &lt;

    ...\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nBut I&#39;m not sure, perhafs you need create a getter for you FormArray\r\n\r\n\r\n    get courseOptions()\r\n    {\r\n        return this.addQuestionForm? this.addQuestionForm.get(&#39;courseOptions&#39;) as Form Array:null\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd in your .html\r\n\r\n    &lt;div formArrayName=&quot;courseOptions&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row m-auto&quot; *ngFor=&quot;let project of courseOptions.controls; let i = index&quot;&gt;\r\n      ...\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n
