The idea is that for each window, the user selects an option, the window closes, and then the logic continues until the next user input is needed. Then the next window opens and the process continues. Based on what the user inputs, the choices included in the next window can change. For my starting example, the window has four buttons with the numbers 1-4 and prompts the user to choose a number. I boiled down my code to something really basic:\r\n\r\n    public class LogicLoop()\r\n    {\r\n\r\n    public static AtomicInteger CHOICE; //Global variable to act as the user&#39;s current choice, as there is only ever one choice made at a time\r\n    public static boolean loopDone = false;\r\n    \r\n    public static void main(String [] args)\r\n    {\r\n        new Start().startLoop(); //Calls the class that extends Application to call the launch() command. Since launch() can only be called once, it needs to be outside the loop \r\n        logicLoop();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void logicLoop()\r\n    {\r\n        while(!loopDone)\r\n        {\r\n            Chooser chooser = new Chooser();\r\n            chooser.show();\r\n            int choice = CHOICE.get();\r\n            CHOICE = null;\r\n            doSomething(choice);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public doSomething(int choice)\r\n        {\r\n            //Set some other variables to modify how the next window will look\r\n            //Potentially set loopDone to true;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    }\r\nAnd then my Chooser class:\r\n\r\n    public class Chooser()\r\n    {\r\n        public int show()\r\n        {\r\n            Stage newStage = new Stage();\r\n            createWindow(newStage); //method that sets up window based on global variables and calls show() on newStage. Each button in the window will close the stage. The CHOICE value will also be set based on the user&#39;s input\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe window created by createWindow() has buttons with the following handle() method:\r\n\r\n    public void handle(ActionEvent event) {\r\n\t\t\t\tCHOICE = new AtomicInteger(btn.getValue()); //I made my own Button class that has a value variable and a getter() for it\r\n\t\t\t\tStage stage = (Stage) btn.getScene().getWindow();\r\n\t\t       \tstage.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe issue I&#39;m facing is that when my code goes to execute, the logic doesn&#39;t wait for the user&#39;s input before continuing right past the show() method. So what happens is the code starts the loop, and immediately brings up the first window. At the same time, a NullPointerException is thrown because my logic is already trying to call CHOICE.get() before the user even has time to input any value. So after choosing a button and closing the first window, nothing else happens.  \r\n\r\nSo far I&#39;ve tried making use of the showAndWait() method in my createWindow() method, but it doesn&#39;t appear to make any difference. I&#39;ve tried calling the wait() command after chooser.show(), but it just adds a delay and then I see the same results. Based on information I&#39;ve been able to find on Stack Overflow, I&#39;ve seen a lot of recommendation to use the Platform.runLater() method, but I can&#39;t see how it would be effective here. If the GUI runs later, the logic will still just stampede ahead without it. I need the logic loop to pause until the window closes, which seems to be what showAndWait() is designed to do. What confuses me the most is a statement I came across while researching an answer that said that implementing a basic MVC framework does not require multithreading and that it is not advisable for a beginner to make use of it. At this stage, I&#39;m not certain how that&#39;s possible.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here?

They are the same.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought it was time zone issue which is why I added `adjust-dateTime-to-timezone` . `adjust-dateTime-to-timezone` has no effect.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083917/different-current-time-produces-through-xslt-and-java","title":"Different current time produces through XSLT and Java"},{"tags":["jenkins","jenkins-plugins"],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11078500,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b_PW5ewz3mk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNnyzs2ojz4q3WeQxcwIeK7uXVVKg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"LAKSHMANA KUMAR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11078500/lakshmana-kumar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569339840,"creation_date":1569339840,"question_id":58083914,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58083914","body_markdown":"I had setup nginx as reverse proxy to my Jenkins.

Here is the backend code (this code runs when a user submits an answer to a math problem in order to turn their character):\r\n    \r\n    def send_answer(answer, game_object, player_type, current_position, current_direction):\r\n\r\n        creator_directions = [&#39;p1up&#39;, &#39;p1right&#39;, &#39;p1down&#39;, &#39;p1left&#39;]\r\n        opponent_directions = [&#39;p2up&#39;, &#39;p2right&#39;, &#39;p2down&#39;, &#39;p2left&#39;]\r\n\r\n        with transaction.atomic():\r\n            # d for direction\r\n\r\n            if player_type == &#39;creator&#39;:\r\n                for d in creator_directions:\r\n\r\n                    if is_correct_answer(getattr(game_object, d), int(answer)):\r\n                        context[&#39;move_direction&#39;] = d\r\n                        print(context)\r\n                        new_problem = generate_problem_game(\r\n                            game_object.level, game_object.operation, game_object, player_type)\r\n                        setattr(game_object, d, new_problem)\r\n                        game_object.save()\r\n                        context[&#39;new_problem&#39;] = [d, new_problem]\r\n                        # calculate draw and undraw positions\r\n                        # p1_last_pos: player 1 last position\r\n                        p1_last_pos = game_object.p1lastposupdate\r\n                        # p1_lp_timestamp: player 1 last position timestamp\r\n                        p1_lp_timestamp = game_object.p1lpuTimestamp\r\n                        time_inbetween = timezone.now() - p1_lp_timestamp\r\n                        # ti_milliseconds: time inbetween, milliseconds\r\n                        ti_milliseconds = time_inbetween.seconds * 1000\r\n                        # p1_lp_split: player 1 last_position (split)\r\n                        p1_lp_split = p1_last_pos.split(&#39;,&#39;)\r\n                        # p1_lp_x: player 1 last position, x\r\n                        p1_lp_x = int(p1_lp_split[0])\r\n                        # p1_lp_y: player 1 last_position, y\r\n                        p1_lp_y = int(p1_lp_split[1])\r\n\r\n                        draw_positions = []\r\n                        if current_direction == &#39;up&#39;

Which well... it never is unless you changed something else with some other code. A form submit, by default will do a post request to it&#39;s destination. So normally, the user will be redirected and the need for hiding the modal is non-existent.\r\n\r\n*I don&#39;t think it is valuable to show any code examples on how to do this here, as it doesn&#39;t seem that you have tried to understand the code you took from the internet.

your value of `K`. You need to play around with it until you get good results. If it&#39;s too large it doesn&#39;t filter, if it&#39;s too small you get strong artifacts.\r\n\r\nIf you have knowledge of the noise variance, you can use that to estimate the regularization parameter. In the Wiener filter, the constant `K` is a simplification of `N/S`, where `N` is the noise power and `S` is the signal power. Both these values are frequency-dependent. The signal power `S` can be estimated by the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the image to be filtered. The noise power is hard to estimate, but if you have such an estimate (or know it because you created the noisy image synthetically), then you can plug that value into the equation. Note that this is the noise power, not the variance of the noise.\r\n\r\nThe following code uses [DIPlib](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib) (the Python interface we call PyDIP) to demonstrate Wiener deconvolution (disclaimer: I&#39;m an author). I don&#39;t think it is hard to convert this code to use other libraries.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport PyDIP as dip\r\n\r\nimage = dip.ImageRead(&#39;trui.ics&#39;);\r\nkernel = dip.CreateGauss([3,3]).Pad(image.Sizes())\r\n\r\nsmooth = dip.ConvolveFT(image, kernel)\r\nsmooth = dip.GaussianNoise(smooth, 5.0)  # variance = 5.0\r\n\r\nH = dip.FourierTransform(kernel)\r\nF = dip.FourierTransform(smooth)\r\nS = dip.SquareModulus(F)  # signal power estimate\r\nN = dip.Image(5.0 * smooth.NumberOfPixels())  # noise power (has same value at all frequencies)\r\n\r\nHinv = dip.Conjugate(H) / ( dip.SquareModulus(H) + N / S )\r\n\r\nout = dip.FourierTransform(F * Hinv, {&quot;inverse&quot;, &quot;real&quot;})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `smooth` image looks like this:\r\n\r\n[![smooth][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe `out` image that comes from deconvolving the image above looks like this:\r\n\r\n[![out][2]][2]\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t expect a perfect result. The regularization term impedes a perfect inverse filtering because such filtering would enhance the noise so strongly that it would swamp the signal and produce a totally useless output.

is because the dialog, even though it was _requested_ from your app.component, is not a child of it. You can see this if you inspect the DOM elements of the dialog: the dialog is appended somewhere to the root of the `body`, as a sibling to the root element of the angular app.\r\n\r\nSo the dependency injection is working as intended, it&#39;s just that the service&#39;s scope does not cover the dialog.\r\n\r\nSuggested solution: you can pass data in the `MatDialogConfig` param of `MatDialog.open`, which has a data field.\r\n\r\nThat data can be used in multiple ways:\r\n\r\n - you can pass a callback in it from the component which invokes the dialog, which the dialog can call. The callback will have access to the services which are injected into the component which invoked the dialog.\r\n - you can just pass in a reference to the service instance from the component which invokes the dialog, so the component in the dialog has basically the full service instance\r\n\r\nExample: https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/examples (see the TS part of the first example)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083775/propagating-service-instance-to-dialog-component-not-working-as-expected/58100439#58100439","title":"Propagating service instance to dialog component not working as expected"}],"owner":{"reputation":404,"user_id":2277280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbcc04ef06767dbce715ec9e78f65c4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cmxl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2277280/cmxl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58100439,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569420757,"creation_date":1569339308,"question_id":58083775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58083775","body_markdown":"I have a simple reproduction of what I want to achieve here on stackblitz:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-zb8kvg\r\n\r\nI have a component (here it&#39;s the app.component) which a service is declared on (MyService).\r\nI need a new instance of MyService each time the component gets opened, so it seems right to me, that the service is declared on component level and not in the module.\r\n\r\nNow I want to open a dialog (MatDialog -&gt; TestComponent) from this component which needs the same service instance.\r\n\r\nI get a StaticInjectorError as seen in the console output.\r\n\r\nHow can I use the same service instance in my dialog as my calling component has?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083775/propagating-service-instance-to-dialog-component-not-working-as-expected","title":"Propagating service instance to dialog component not working as expected"},{"tags":["android","sqlite","android-sqlite","sqlcipher"],"owner":{"reputation":168,"user_id":221894,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d6253d4730baca25c37e4d1aafc8159?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rocky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/221894/rocky"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34008,"user_id":2649012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4SzF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fant&#244;mas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649012/fant%c3%b4mas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569343922,"creation_date":1569339308,"last_edit_date":1569343922,"question_id":58083773,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58083773","body_markdown":"My requirement is to encrypt already existing SQLite database in windows and have to use the same database in android.

In order to confirm the behavior, I used the below\r\n&gt; state machine example with Pass:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; {\r\n&gt;             &quot;StartAt&quot;: &quot;Map State&quot;,\r\n&gt;             &quot;TimeoutSeconds&quot;: 3600,\r\n&gt;             &quot;States&quot;: {\r\n&gt;               &quot;Map State&quot;: {\r\n&gt;                 &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Map”,\r\n&gt;                 &quot;Parameters&quot;: {\r\n&gt;                   “ContextValue.$”: &quot;$$.Map.Item.Value&quot;\r\n&gt;                 },\r\n&gt;                 &quot;MaxConcurrency&quot;: 1,\r\n&gt;                 &quot;Iterator&quot;: {\r\n&gt;                   &quot;StartAt&quot;: &quot;Run Task&quot;,\r\n&gt;                   &quot;States&quot;: {\r\n&gt;                     &quot;Run Task&quot;: {\r\n&gt;                       &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Pass&quot;,\r\n&gt;                       &quot;End&quot;: true\r\n&gt;                     }\r\n&gt;                   }\r\n&gt;                 },\r\n&gt;                 &quot;Next&quot;: &quot;Final State&quot;\r\n&gt;               },\r\n&gt;               &quot;Final State&quot;: {\r\n&gt;                 &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Pass&quot;,\r\n&gt;                 &quot;End&quot;: true\r\n&gt;               }\r\n&gt;             }    }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I tested with multiple input lists and MaxConcurrency values and below\r\n&gt; are my observations:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. Input size list: 4 MaxConcurrency:1/2/3 - Fails and MaxConcurrency:0/4/5 or above - Works\r\n&gt; 2. Input size list: 3 MaxConcurrency: 1/2 - Fails and MaxConcurrency:0/3/4 or above - Works \r\n&gt; 3. Similarly, I performed tests by removing the parameters from state machine as well and could see that it works as expected with different\r\n&gt; MaxConcurrency values.\r\n&gt; 4. I also tested the same by changing the Task type of “Pass” with “Lambda” and observed the same behavior. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Hence, I can confirm that the state machine fails when we have\r\n&gt; parameters in the code and specify MaxConcurrency value as anything\r\n&gt; other than zero or the number greater than or equal to the list size. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; After doing some research regarding this behavior to check if this is\r\n&gt; intended, I could not find much information regarding the same as this\r\n&gt; is a new feature.

This can still be true even when the logic in the main view remains correct, because the schema behind it is wrong and needs to be refreshed.\r\n\r\nYou can create your views with `SCHEMABINDING`, which will prevent changes to underlying objects while the view exists, and thus kind of &#39;force remind&#39; you to update your view (as your will have to modify it first or drop it then recreate it after you make those underlying changes).  Alternatively you can continue to refresh the view after changes are made.  Both arrive at the same end result.  \r\n\r\nFor me, the decision on which approach to use would fall on how impactful it would be if someone makes an underlying change and the view does not get refreshed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083738/why-is-refreshing-a-database-view-required-in-our-app/58084377#58084377","title":"Why is refreshing a database view required in our app?"}],"owner":{"reputation":638,"user_id":9008140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153470332463913/picture?type=large","display_name":"John Lord","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9008140/john-lord"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1024,"user_id":6598234,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d1fb733034aa20c56f0b1b34bcc88aa0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shekar Kola","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6598234/shekar-kola"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58084377,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569348535,"creation_date":1569339217,"last_edit_date":1569348535,"question_id":58083738,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58083738","body_markdown":"We have a report generator that consists of nested views to prevent redundant code.

The `GetTemporaryLinkError.email_not_verified` error is relatively new, so you&#39;ll need to make sure you&#39;re using a recent enough version of the SDK to be able to identify it. For the `GetTemporaryLinkError.email_not_verified` error, that is v3.1.0 or later of [the Dropbox Java SDK][1]. (It&#39;s best to just get the latest anyway, which is currently v3.1.1.)\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re are using an updated version of the SDK, it&#39;s also possible you&#39;re just not setting valid JSON for the `GetTemporaryLinkError.email_not_verified` error case when you&#39;re trying to simulate this. You can find the valid JSON for this error case in [the /2/files/get_temporary_link documentation][2]. Make sure you copy that as shown there if you&#39;re trying to simulate this.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, to actually catch that error with the Dropbox Java SDK, you&#39;ll want to catch [`GetTemporaryLinkErrorException`][3] thrown by [`getTemporaryLink`][4]. To check for the specific case, check the [`GetTemporaryLinkErrorException.errorValue`][5].

trying to create a table with CSS grid.

In your `bar()` function, `P` being constrained to `keyof` anything hints the compiler not to widen string literals to string, but no such hint exists for `P` in `Indexed.app()`.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEither you need to come up with a way to modify the `Indexed.app()` signature so as hint that `P` should inferred in a narrow way where possible without actually constraining it (since you don&#39;t know what `P` will be, as you said), or you need to come up with a way to hint/specify that `P` should be narrow when you *call* `Indexed.app()`.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nModifying the signature of `app()` to do this currently requires some weird tricks, and until and unless this [changes](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30680), it looks like this:\r\n\r\n    type Narrowable =\r\n      | string\r\n      | number\r\n      | boolean\r\n      | symbol\r\n      | object\r\n      | undefined\r\n      | void\r\n      | null\r\n      | {};\r\n    \r\n    class Indexed {\r\n      constructor(public a: number = 1) {}\r\n      public app&lt;\r\n        N extends Narrowable,\r\n        P extends N | [] | { [k: string]: N | P | [] }\r\n      &gt;(f: (obj: this, arg: P) =&gt; this, arg: P) {\r\n        return f(this, arg);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    const a = new Indexed().app(bar, [&quot;a&quot;]); // okay\r\n    const b = new Indexed().app(bar, [&quot;wtf&quot;]); // error &quot;wtf&quot; not assignable to &quot;a&quot;|&quot;app&quot;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHinting at the call site is less ugly, if the caller remembers to do it:\r\n\r\n    class Indexed {\r\n      constructor(public a: number = 1) {}\r\n      public app&lt;P&gt;(f: (obj: this, arg: P) =&gt; this, arg: P) {\r\n        return f(this, arg);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    const a = new Indexed().app(bar, [&quot;a&quot; as &quot;a&quot;]); // okay\r\n    const b = new Indexed().app(bar, [&quot;wtf&quot; as &quot;wtf&quot;]); // error &quot;wtf&quot; not assignable to &quot;a&quot;|&quot;app&quot;\r\n\r\nOr you could forget the hint and just specify the type parameter yourself manually:\r\n\r\n    const c = new Indexed().app&lt;[&quot;a&quot;]&gt;(bar, [&quot;a&quot;]); // okay\r\n    const d = new Indexed().app&lt;[&quot;wtf&quot;]&gt;(bar, [&quot;wtf&quot;]); // error &quot;wtf&quot; not assignable to &quot;a&quot;|&quot;app&quot;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, hope one of those helps.

group. First, I would like to bin two columns of data. Binned columns must be adjacent to each other (ie. columns 1&amp;2, columns 5&amp;6 NOT columns 4&amp;6). Where the binning starts in the matrix is random. For example, in a matrix of 600 columns the first two columns binned may be columns 545 &amp; 546 and next columns 3&amp;4. I would like to sample without replacement such that a combination is not sampled twice. Aggregation is defined as calculating row sums for the bin `rowSums()`. Aggregated results will be a new column in a result matrix. The number of columns in the result matrix will be limited to the number of bins randomly sampled. \r\n\r\nBin size continues to get increasingly larger. Next, the bin size increases to 3 such that 3 adjacent columns of data are aggregated. Aggregated data will be  put into a different result matrix. This process would continue until the bin is the size of the data frame. All result matrices would be put into a list of matrices. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have posted a similar question for an alternative binning technique here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021216/moving-window-method-to-aggregate-data\r\n\r\nI have tried modifying the code so that the binning technique randomly samples n adjacent columns and calculates row sums:\r\n\r\n    lapply(seq_len(ncol(mat) - 1), function(j) do.call(cbind, \r\n    lapply(sample(ncol(mat)-j, replace = FALSE, size = length(x)), function(i) rowSums(mat[, i:(i + j)]))))\r\n\r\nI need help modifying this line of code to randomly sample without replacement i adjacent columns of  bin size i for n samples and aggregate each sample using row sums. Note that combinations of columns cannot be resampled but columns can be resampled if they are part of new combinations.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083701/bin-columns-and-aggregate-data-via-random-sample-with-replacement-for-iterativel","title":"Bin columns and aggregate data via random sample with replacement for iteratively larger bin sizes"},{"tags":["javascript","bots","discord"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11391414,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10216242226661979/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kareem Yasser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11391414/kareem-yasser"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11391414,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10216242226661979/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kareem Yasser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11391414/kareem-yasser"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569417722,"last_edit_date":1569417722,"creation_date":1569344052,"answer_id":58084966,"question_id":58083699,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58084966","body_markdown":"```\r\nif (message.guild) {\r\n        let prefix;\r\n\r\n        // if we found a prefix, setup args; otherwise, this isn&#39;t a command\r\n        if (!prefix) return;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like all you&#39;re doing right here is declaring a variable called ```prefix``` and then checking if its value is falsy.
