In the code, you are using es6 shorthand notation for describing a function. `i` is the lone argument to the function.\r\n\r\n\r\n    i =&gt; {\r\n       labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nis the same as\r\n\r\n    function(i){\r\n      labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n    } \r\n\r\nPlease see more in this [reference on shorthand notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)\r\n\r\nEdit: To answer your comment &quot;What is adding it&quot;, you must look at the `repeat(n, action)` function more closely. It also may be confusing to you that `i` is used in both cases so I will rewrite the function to help you understand. This function uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to `n`\r\n\r\n\r\n    for (let idx = 0; idx &lt; n; idx++) {\r\n       action(idx);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand invokes the action with the current for loop index `idx`. So for you example:\r\n\r\n    Iteration 0: action(0) -&gt; labels.push(`Unit ${0 + 1}`);\r\n    Iteration 1: action(1) -&gt; labels.push(`Unit ${1 + 1}`);\r\n    Iteration 2: action(2) -&gt; labels.push(`Unit ${2 + 1}`);\r\n    Iteration 3: action(3) -&gt; labels.push(`Unit ${3 + 1}`);\r\n    Iteration 4: action(4) -&gt; labels.push(`Unit ${4 + 1}`);\r\n\r\nPlease do note that the `repeat`&#39;s declaration of `i` is local to its function body, just as the `i` in `i =&gt; { labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`); }` is local to its function body. These two `i` values are not referencing the same value in memory and can be renamed as I did in my explanation","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286288/how-does-this-abstract-repetition-works/58286351#58286351","title":"How does this abstract repetition works?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":264,"user_id":11541562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/922e908e17f25d44d646a91484398994?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"f278f1b2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541562/f278f1b2"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570537666,"creation_date":1570537666,"answer_id":58286369,"question_id":58286288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58286369","body_markdown":"`repeat` function receives callback and every iteration passes to this callback current value of `i`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286288/how-does-this-abstract-repetition-works/58286369#58286369","title":"How does this abstract repetition works?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":206,"user_id":10562084,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WSqrEWE8IQ8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADHw/ICa87qyyzhA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jay Vaghasiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10562084/jay-vaghasiya"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570537765,"creation_date":1570537765,"answer_id":58286398,"question_id":58286288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58286398","body_markdown":"In `repeat` function you are passing forloop index to callback\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction repeat(n, action) {\r\n   for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n      action(i); // here you are passing index to callback\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you are getting index as params\r\n\r\n```\r\nrepeat(5, i =&gt; { // Here you will get params that is passed by repeat function\r\n   labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nHope this will help\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286288/how-does-this-abstract-repetition-works/58286398#58286398","title":"How does this abstract repetition works?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":38678,"user_id":17447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/167f4b56e9ba1c1660e5980a84e96bbe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"naveen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17447/naveen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":38678,"user_id":17447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/167f4b56e9ba1c1660e5980a84e96bbe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"naveen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17447/naveen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570538595,"last_edit_date":1570538595,"creation_date":1570537937,"answer_id":58286444,"question_id":58286288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58286444","body_markdown":"This is the original function\r\n\r\n    repeat(5, i =&gt; {\r\n       labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n    });\r\nwhich can be written as \r\n\r\n    repeat(5, function (i) {\r\n        labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nMake the anonymous function a named one like this,\r\n \r\n    var action = function(i){\r\n      labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n    } \r\nThen `repeat` call becomes, `repeat(5, action);` //action is function reference\r\n\r\nNow we can change the function definition like this removing the `action` function reference\r\n\r\n    function repeat(n) {\r\n       for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n         action(i);\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n    var action = function(i){\r\n      labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n    } \r\nThis could be simplified as,\r\n\r\n    function repeat(n) {\r\n       for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n         labels.push(`Unit ${i + 1}`);\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\nResult will be `[&quot;Unit 1&quot;, &quot;Unit 2&quot;, &quot;Unit 3&quot;, &quot;Unit 4&quot;, &quot;Unit 5&quot;]` in console.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286288/how-does-this-abstract-repetition-works/58286444#58286444","title":"How does this abstract repetition works?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7047,"user_id":995800,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EWf5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Constantin Gro&#223;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/995800/constantin-gro%c3%9f"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570538437,"creation_date":1570538437,"answer_id":58286563,"question_id":58286288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58286563","body_markdown":"It&#39;s a bit confusing that you use `i` as a variable in the `for` loop as well as the parameter of your arrow function.

Will it ever be, like, 1000 times more? Can you read entire file into the memory (Numpy array or DataFrame) once, so you can use your RAM and CPU cache, instead of reading from disk multiple times? Setting offset on recently found green point would make a viable option then.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286285/replacing-rows-of-a-file-with-rows-of-another-file/58286628#58286628","title":"Replacing rows of a file with rows of another

We need context for this problem, and much more precise and detailed  information on the data format and what you are trying to do. \r\n\r\nFor example, comparing floats for equality doesn&#39;t feel great, and the manipulation of numbers in general always carries a certain risk in terms of precision, etc. Since these points seemingly come from the same place, it would be great if each one had some sort of unique ID that could be used to check for equality.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLike some of the other people here, my first reflex was to grab numpy and pandas.

I actually see the problem in the FOR LOOP when I am basically using NESTED LOOPS, which means I will have 100000*20000 loops for changing the green points. \r\n\r\nIs there an efficient way by using numpy arrays or any other methods?

Our teacher gave us an HTML-File to clone some of the components for our own project, so that we don&#39;t have to write it from scratch. We want to create our own .js file with some listeners for the components we take from her file. \r\n\r\nThe below code produces a label called &quot;keywords&quot; with a question mark icon to its right and a text field further right. A click on the question mark icon opens a popup window with some options and the text field allows comma-separated strings as &quot;keywords&quot;. Our problem is that on our HTML-Page, all these elements show up with no problem, but the popup window won&#39;t show up when we click on the question mark icon and the text field is also not activated when we click on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe looked at our teacher&#39;s HTML file and played on it a bit. We found out, that when we remove her js file as a script the same thing happens on her HTML file too. So we looked into her js file and checked the 55.000 lines long js file for some reference to these elements and found nothing. So we don&#39;t know, why ours doesn&#39;t work. The console shows no errors in the output when we open our HTML file. How can we make these elements respond to clicks? where should we look for errors, mistakes? \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;label class=&quot;control-label col-md-4 col-lg-3&quot;

would suspect that `$survey[&#39;answersPerQuestion&#39;]` is an array but you are trying to store it in a json column.\r\n\r\nYou can use [Laravel&#39;s Array &amp; JSON Casting][1] to cast the array

For example, if your database has\r\n&gt; a JSON or TEXT field type that contains serialized JSON, adding the\r\n&gt; array cast to that attribute will automatically deserialize the\r\n&gt; attribute to a PHP array when you access it on your Eloquent model:\r\n\r\nYour Model:\r\n\r\n    class Survey_Answer extends Model\r\n    {\r\n        protected $fillable = [&#39;name&#39;, &#39;answers&#39;, &#39;complete&#39;];\r\n    \r\n        protected $casts = [\r\n            &#39;answers&#39; =&gt; &#39;array&#39;,\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Once the cast is defined, you may access the options attribute and it\r\n&gt; will automatically be deserialized from JSON into a PHP array.

I have tried to override this in several different ways, but the css always changes to `100%` instead of `center right`.\r\n\r\nWhy does this happen and how do I make sure that `background-position` survives when I build the application?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286223/background-position-scss-changes-when-building-react-application","title":"background-position scss changes when building React application"},{"tags":["reactjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":592,"user_id":6677742,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMUAo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ibtsam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6677742/ibtsam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570537242,"post_id":58286222,"comment_id":102937232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286222/how-to-render-one-object-from-map-instead-all-of-them#comment102937232_58286222"},{"owner":{"reputation":389,"user_id":7334097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fb757405c6469911e1e67df389b8922?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BennKingy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7334097/bennkingy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":592,"user_id":6677742,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMUAo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ibtsam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6677742/ibtsam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570537270,"post_id":58286222,"comment_id":102937243,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286222/how-to-render-one-object-from-map-instead-all-of-them#comment102937243_58286222"},{"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":7805007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_NRe0BnycHg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAcM/un_d4fb_0E8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7805007/abal"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570537335,"post_id":58286222,"comment_id":102937271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286222/how-to-render-one-object-from-map-instead-all-of-them#comment102937271_58286222"},{"owner":{"reputation":389,"user_id":7334097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fb757405c6469911e1e67df389b8922?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BennKingy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7334097/bennkingy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":108,"user_id":7805007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_NRe0BnycHg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAcM/un_d4fb_0E8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7805007/abal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570537542,"post_id":58286222,"comment_id":102937364,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286222/how-to-render-one-object-from-map-instead-all-of-them#comment102937364_58286222"},{"owner":{"reputation":16032,"user_id":1641941,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/064d64da0628fe24a784257f364b9aaf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HMR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1641941/hmr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570539818,"post_id":58286222,"comment_id":102938584,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286222/how-to-render-one-object-from-map-instead-all-of-them#comment102938584_58286222"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9405,"user_id":10106580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvGaY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dupocas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10106580/dupocas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570537490,"creation_date":1570537490,"answer_id":58286321,"question_id":58286222,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58286321","body_markdown":"`filter` the array before `map`\r\n\r\n    renderBasedOnId = id =&gt;{\r\n        const { profiles } = this.state\r\n        return profiles.filter(x =&gt;

It would have to be:\r\n\r\n    arows = list(range(0, rows))\r\n    acolumns = list(range(0, columns))\r\n    with mp.Pool() as pool:\r\n        img = pool.map(myFunc, constant_args, arows, acolumns)\r\n\r\nHowever, this might not result in what you are looking for as this just runs through the 3 arguments (which have to be lists). It is not running through combinations of them, especially `arows` and `acolumns`. For example, if `constant_args` has 3 elements, `Pool.map` would stop after 3 iterations without running through the longer lists `arows` or `acolumns`.\r\n\r\nFirst you should make all combinations of rows and column indices\r\n\r\n    from itertools import product, repeat\r\n    comb = list(product(arows, acolumns))\r\n\r\nThat procudes something like (all possible combinations)\r\n\r\n    [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\r\n\r\nNext I would zip these combinations with your `constant_args`\r\n\r\n    constant_args = [10, 11]\r\n    arguments = list(zip(comb , repeat(constant_args)))\r\n\r\nIt produces a list of tuples with each tuple containing two elements. The first is your pixel position and the second are your `constant_args`\r\n\r\n    [((1, 1), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((1, 2), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((1, 3), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((2, 1), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((2, 2), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((2, 3), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((3, 1), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((3, 2), [10, 11]),\r\n     ((3, 3), [10, 11])]\r\n\r\nNow we have to modify your `myFunc`somewhat:\r\n\r\n    def myFunc(pix_id, constant_args):\r\n        new_pixel = quad(integrand, constant_args, pix_id[0], pix_id[1])\r\n        ... other calculations ... \r\n        return new_pixel\r\n\r\nFinally, we use Pool.starmap to work the magic (see here: [starmap usage][1]):\r\n\r\n    with mp.Pool() as pool:\r\n        img = pool.starmap(myFunc, arguments )\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that `starmap` takes a list of tuples and provides these as inputs for the functions. However, `starmap` automatically unpacks the list of tuples into single arguments for your funtion. The first argument is `pix_id` consisting of two elements and the second argument is `constant_args`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5443941/4141279","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286179/parallelize-calculation-of-matrix-elements-using-scipy-integrate-quad/58340759#58340759","title":"Parallelize calculation of matrix elements using scipy.integrate.quad"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10237648,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uV6L1lVxnr0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/dwjKkCOP5b8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"elena faillace","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10237648/elena-faillace"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570795372,"creation_date":1570536981,"question_id":58286179,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58286179","body_markdown":"I have to evaluate every element of a matrix using a function with a numerical integral (scipy.integrate.quad).

need to encapsulate constants in the Rust type system. Ideally, [RFC2000](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44580) would be ready, but in its absence, and since I only need a restricted set of constants, I can implement something close to what I need:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait U32Const {\r\n    const VAL: u32;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct U32Const10;\r\nimpl U32Const for U32Const10 {\r\n    const VAL: u32 = 10;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct MyType&lt;X: U32Const&gt; {\r\n    val: u32,\r\n    template: X,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl&lt;X: U32Const&gt; MyType&lt;X&gt; {\r\n    fn do_something(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {\r\n        self.val * X::VAL\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let a = MyType::&lt;U32Const10&gt; {\r\n        val: 20,\r\n        template: U32Const10 {},\r\n    };\r\n    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, a.do_something());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prints out `200` as desired - that is, the constant value comes from the type that is passed in at instantiation inside `main`.\r\n\r\nNow, this is a bit warty as it requires an instance of `X` to be created in the struct, which I call `template`, which is then unused so I get a compiler warning.\r\n\r\nIf one removes the `template` field, which is the ideal API, then the compiler complains about an unused parameter `X` on `struct MyType &lt; X: U32Const &gt;`. If I get rid of the `X` parameter on `struct MyType`, I then get an `unexpected type argument` on `MyType` in the the `impl` block.\r\n\r\nIs there some way I can do what I&#39;m trying to do that keeps the compiler happy? Effectively I want a struct which is _only_ used for its internal `const`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286148/how-can-i-have-a-struct-which-is-only-used-for-its-internal-constant","title":"How can I have a struct which is only used for its internal constant?"},{"tags":["laravel","eloquent"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5068,"user_id":999617,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5fba9229a54aba29fe9efb1e3e9b6c0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vincent Decaux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/999617/vincent-decaux"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570538284,"creation_date":1570538284,"answer_id":58286521,"question_id":58286146,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58286521","body_markdown":"You can use nested with relation, try something like :\r\n\r\n    $schedules = Schedule::with(&#39;activities&#39;, &#39;students&#39;, &#39;activities.scores&#39;)-&gt;get();\r\n\r\nHonestly, I understand nothing to your data model, I think you mixed some titles and models.

Longitude**\r\nand *85 to -85* on **Y - Latitude**\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;Currently I am using this formula to calculate its coordinates on map, But I cant figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong here.\r\n&gt;&gt;I put `u` dynamic so i can easily test it..\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Notice that return value has x and y inverted because that is just how leaflet is...\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction getLatLngFromPos(x, y, u = 85) {\r\n\theight = 3000; // of the game map\r\n\twidth = 3000; // of the game map\r\n\r\n\treturn [(y / height) * u, (x / width) * 180];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n###Results(~ means not calculated but visually guessed):###\r\n\r\n`getLatLngFromPos(1482.47 , -1731.9)`\r\n\r\n-&gt;&#160;[-49.0705, 88.9482]\r\nShould be: ~[-71.519235, 88.813477]\r\n\r\n`getLatLngFromPos(1378.4,-1876.25)`\r\n\r\n-&gt;&#160;[-53.16041666666666,82.70400000000001]\r\nShould be: ~[-73.758964, 81.958008]\r\n\r\nIf You need the tiles here is the code to that\r\n`http://145.239.116.170/app-assets/images/maptiles/sanandreas.{z}.{x}.{y}.png`\r\n&gt; Note: **MaxZoom** is &#39;4&#39;\r\n\r\n#Results#\r\n\r\n### Incorrect Result: ###\r\nThe **Car icon** on the map should go to the arrow, and there is extra information like the center of the map. (Also it is repeating on X axis which i want to remove)\r\n\r\nScreenShot:\r\n(https://i.ibb.co/HNHgRLC/Shared-Screenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n#Hypothesis#\r\nI am thinking the Y axis on these maps has some kind of acceleration towards the edges... This is due to the Default Projection of Leaflet\r\nAlso there is an implementation of this for Google Maps API at (https://github.com/ikkentim/SanMap/blob/master/js_src/js/SanMap.js) But Google Maps is being a douche by charging money...\r\n\r\n\r\nI am assuming now that I will have to create some kind of projection like in SanMap implementation, **How can I create my own Projection for Mapbox or Leaflet?**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286143/incorrect-latitude-conversion-from-sa-mpgame-coordinates-for-map-while-longit","title":"Incorrect Latitude Conversion from SA-MP(game)

I am using a very simple fortran code that would use the function DBINOM provided by CERNLIB to compute the binomial coefficient.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes when trying to get access to the function itself. This particular one should be in libmathlib from CERNLIB, but I cannot get access to it. I have tried different commands, but none seem to work\r\n\r\nMy fortran code looks like:\r\n\r\n      IMPLICIT NONE      \r\n      INTEGER X,K\r\n      DOUBLE PRECISION ANS\r\n      DOUBLE PRECISION DBINOM\r\n\r\n      X = 4\r\n      K = 1\r\n      ANS = DBINOM(X,K)\r\n      WRITE(6,*) &#39;ANS = &#39;,ANS\r\n\r\n      END \r\n\r\nAnd then, to compile it, I use:\r\n\r\n     gfortran -o exemple.exe exemple.f -lmathlib\r\n\r\nit compiles, but gives a nonsense result, like it does not identify any function in there. For instance, it says that binomial coeff of 3 over 1 is of the order of 10^-314.\r\n\r\nIf I now manually include the library:\r\n\r\n     gfortran -o exemple.exe exemple.f libmathlib.a -lmathlib\r\n\r\nit gives the following output:\r\n\r\n     /usr/bin/ld: libmathlib.a(binom64.o): undefined reference to symbol &#39;mtlprt_&#39;\r\n     //usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpacklib.so.1_gfortran: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line\r\n     collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n\r\nso I&#39;m not sure how to get access to the functions in CERNLIB to use them in my code.

Initially, the modal displays as expected, however, after I press my submit button on the form it hits my mvc controller method post as expected. Within the controller, an error may get occur and at that point I add an error to my models alert property and return the view. The form and error display, but it seems to have lost all styling. The modal is initially shown as a render partial, but in the controller I was returning it as a view instead of a partialview so thought that might be the issue, but that didn&#39;t make any difference. So next, I thought that it&#39;s because the main stylesheet that the modal needs is declared on the parent, and because I&#39;m using a modal, it might be on coming back that the stylesheet is no longer referenced, So I explicitly referenced the stylesheet in the modal, but that too has made no difference.

And so it goes on until the end of the file. At the end of the reading loop, if the buffer contains lines, it is written to disk.\r\n\r\nIn this way, in addition to checking the number of lines in memory, you also check the number of disk writes. Writing to files every time you read a line may not be a good idea, as well as having a `chunk_size` too large. It&#39;s up to you to find a `chunk_size` value that fits your problem.\r\n\r\n__Note__: You can use the `open()` **buffering** parameter, to get the same result. Find everything in [documentation][1]. But the logic is very similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286120/bypass-memory-error-when-replacing-a-string-in-a-large-txt-file/58286666#58286666","title":"Bypass memory error when replacing a string in a large txt file"}],"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":11724813,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e93e4c2c2a13f35ae5f56bc9cf5a07ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kokokoko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11724813/kokokoko"},"last_editor":{"reputation":117,"user_id":11724813,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e93e4c2c2a13f35ae5f56bc9cf5a07ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kokokoko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11724813/kokokoko"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58286666,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570542078,"creation_date":1570536701,"last_edit_date":1570542078,"question_id":58286120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58286120","body_markdown":"I have several files to iterate through, some of them several million lines long.

They are invoked one by one from ProjectX, ToolE etc. In this setup, AppA may be dependent on LibC/LibD etc. But since they have different Makefile, the dependencies are not properly mentioned in the target recipe.\r\n\r\nNow the problem at hand is that, I would like to make this project compile in parallel(`make -jN`)\r\n\r\nI have tried generating the dependency files using `gcc -M` option and `include` ing these dependency files in the Makefile. But at times what I see is the only the `.o` are created but not the lib or the App. This may be because make sees the dependency and waits for the dependency to be ready. But doesn&#39;t know how to resume? \r\n\r\nWhat is the best approach to fix this.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nI understand that recursive make is a bad thing.

can use an `async` method, which @Jeroen van Langen suggested in the comments.\r\n\r\nUsing `await Task.Delay(time)` in between `Background` changes will delay the changes by a given `time`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate async void Disco(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    Background = Brushes.Coral;\r\n    await Task.Delay(500); // 500 is just an example. You can use any number in milliseconds.\r\n    Background = Brushes.AliceBlue;\r\n    await Task.Delay(500);\r\n    Background = Brushes.DarkRed;\r\n    await Task.Delay(500);\r\n    Background = Brushes.Red;\r\n    await Task.Delay(500);\r\n    Background = Brushes.Blue;\r\n    await Task.Delay(500);\r\n    Background = Brushes.Aquamarine;\r\n    await Task.Delay(500);\r\n    //Set the background back to its original color here.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need your form to continue to &quot;disco&quot; until, for example, a button is pressed again, you can wrap it in a `while` loop that&#39;ll continue until a `Button` is pressed, or a `ToggleButton` is checked.\r\n\r\nIf you go this route, I suggest you read up on the [asynchronous programming documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/).
