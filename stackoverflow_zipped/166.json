The users of your project would still have to pick the right project, but it would be less prone to confusion than sorting by version numbers.\r\n\r\nYou could probably use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/) and/or a good CI/CD system to help you automate the creation and publication of the distributions (_wheels_) for the two (or more) projects.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495438/pip-specify-download-version-based-on-available-library-version/58507684#58507684","title":"pip - specify download version based on available library version"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12254339,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f954094653c59c134cdbbf7b39104aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"latexisdifficult","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12254339/latexisdifficult"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571758264,"creation_date":1571701530,"question_id":58495438,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495438","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing a Python package `my_package` that depends upon some other package `foo_package`.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a few versions of `foo_package` that are used in the community, and unfortunately they&#39;re not backwards compatible with each other. (Because of changes to the C interface that my code is compiled against).\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;d like to distribute multiple copies of `my_package`, corresponding to the different versions of `foo_package`.\r\n\r\nI can distinguish these different copies of `my_package` from each other using post-release tags. For example I can give `my_package` the version `1.1.4-foo_package1.2`, corresponding to version `1.1.4` of `my_package` compiled against version `1.2` of `foo_package`.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. The caveat now is that when it comes to installing this with `pip`, end users have to specify this full version string to be able to get the correct version of `my_package`. That is, they have to know that the latest release of `my_package` is `1.1.4` and that the release of `foo_package` that they&#39;re using is `1.2` and thus use the command `pip install my_package==1.1.4-foo_package1.2`.\r\n\r\nObviously this isn&#39;t ideal for all sorts of reasons. (End user friendliness, avoiding dependency hell... ) After all, all of this can be determined programmatically!\r\n\r\nIs there any sensible way to handle this issue, so that an end user can just run `pip install my_package` and have the correct copy downloaded automatically?\r\n\r\nThere is one unsatisfactory answer to a similar question [here][2].\r\n\r\nFWIW the best solution I&#39;ve come up with so far is to create another package `my_package_installer` which as part of its `setup.py` checks what version of `foo_package` is installed and then specifies the relevant version of `my_package` as the `install_requires` argument to `setuptools.setup`. But that&#39;s completely asinine and seems quite fragile. I can&#39;t be the only one with this issue.\r\n\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54192273/pip-requirement-based-on-available-os-library-version","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495438/pip-specify-download-version-based-on-available-library-version","title":"pip - specify download version based on available library version"},{"tags":["python","numpy","numpy-ndarray"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24719,"user_id":4001592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXDU3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel Mesejo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4001592/daniel-mesejo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571701950,"post_id":58495437,"comment_id":103320639,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495437/how-to-select-rows-in-a-ndarray-based-on-list-condition#comment103320639_58495437"},{"owner":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571705464,"post_id":58495437,"comment_id":103321268,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495437/how-to-select-rows-in-a-ndarray-based-on-list-condition#comment103321268_58495437"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12221577,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YSnVswrE0MU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfhV-lduPD48sg9jXzggd7E3B_jjA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vicky Sun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12221577/vicky-sun"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571758060,"creation_date":1571758060,"answer_id":58507635,"question_id":58495437,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58507635","body_markdown":"First, you have to change your array to 2-dimension, try this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\na=np.array([[ 0,   5,  0.9, 0.6,  0.3,  0.8,  0.7],\r\n [ 0,   5,   0.5, 0.2,  0.2,  0.4,  0.7],\r\n [ 0,   9,   0.6,  0.8,  0.4,  1,   1 ],\r\n [ 0,   9,   0.5,  0.8,  0.3,  0.9,  0.6],\r\n [ 0,  16,   0.6,  0.1,  0,   0.4,  0.4]])\r\n\r\nfor l in a:\r\n    if l[1]==5 or l[1]==9:\r\n        print(l)\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495437/how-to-select-rows-in-a-ndarray-based-on-list-condition/58507635#58507635","title":"How to select rows in a ndarray based on list condition"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11547166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10155800131082447/picture?type=large","display_name":"Joy Au","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11547166/joy-au"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11547166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10155800131082447/picture?type=large","display_name":"Joy Au","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11547166/joy-au"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571809517,"creation_date":1571701521,"last_edit_date":1571809517,"question_id":58495437,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495437","body_markdown":"I have an ndarray of shape (1, 1, 5, 7) and it looks like this: \r\n```\r\narray[0][0] = \r\n[[ 0.   5.   0.9  0.6  0.3  0.8  0.7]\r\n [ 0.   5.   0.5  0.2  0.2  0.4  0.7]\r\n [ 0.   9.   0.6  0.8  0.4  1.   1. ]\r\n [ 0.   9.   0.5  0.8  0.3  0.9  0.6]\r\n [ 0.  16.   0.6  0.1  0.   0.4  0.4]]\r\n```\r\nI would like to select only rows where the value of the second column is either `5` or `9`. \r\n\r\nTo do that, I created a list `list = [5, 9]` and a function below to check if the second column&#39;s value is either those in the `list`: \r\n```\r\ndef check(list, array):\r\n    tf_array = np.zeros(np.shape(array))\r\n    for l in list:\r\n        for i, element in enumerate(array):\r\n            if element == l:\r\n                tf_array[i] = True\r\n    return tf_array\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I used `np.compress(check(list, array[0, 0, :, 1]), array, axis=2)` to extract rows that have the second column&#39;s value being either of those in the list. \r\n\r\n**However, I feel like there has to be a simpler way!

I don&#39;t know how to do it with the `sapply` approach above. At least, with `mutate` there are some alternatives to paralyze it.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495435/combined-mutate-and-function-retuns-error","title":"Combined mutate and function retuns error"},{"tags":["c++"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7054,"user_id":487892,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Leb5B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"drescherjm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/487892/drescherjm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571704037,"post_id":58495433,"comment_id":103321046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495433/how-does-the-computer-read-this-code-i-am-trying-to-get-factorial-to-bind-m#comment103321046_58495433"},{"owner":{"reputation":15256,"user_id":445976,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c82b2b9bdcf1baaf4677238d59cf745f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Blastfurnace","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/445976/blastfurnace"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571705924,"post_id":58495433,"comment_id":103321341,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495433/how-does-the-computer-read-this-code-i-am-trying-to-get-factorial-to-bind-m#comment103321341_58495433"},{"owner":{"reputation":3258,"user_id":10957435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/663773cb7f0bc33d3025eb2f9d47799c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chipster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10957435/chipster"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571707239,"post_id":58495433,"comment_id":103321559,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495433/how-does-the-computer-read-this-code-i-am-trying-to-get-factorial-to-bind-m#comment103321559_58495433"},{"owner":{"reputation":10689,"user_id":7478597,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBOIj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scheff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7478597/scheff"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571725235,"post_id":58495433,"comment_id":103325273,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495433/how-does-the-computer-read-this-code-i-am-trying-to-get-factorial-to-bind-m#comment103325273_58495433"},{"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571775274,"post_id":58495433,"comment_id":103350839,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495433/how-does-the-computer-read-this-code-i-am-trying-to-get-factorial-to-bind-m#comment103350839_58495433"},{"owner":{"reputation":49708,"user_id":3422102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tg0Gt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David C.

i&lt;5; i++) {\r\n\t\t\tvar pos = new Vector3(Random.Range(-15,15), 0, Random.Range(-15,15));\r\n\t\t\tvar obj = GameObject.Instantiate(pre, pos, Quaternion.identity);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nI would like to have 5 original objects, no 5 clones of one object made from script, not in scene manually.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495378/create-gameobject-without-instantiate-as-clone","title":"Create GameObject without Instantiate as clone"},{"tags":["firebase","google-cloud-firestore"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":680,"user_id":1368333,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c9fe0b16e3e9c6d8f8c1c95656f9e1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steve McNiven-Scott","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1368333/steve-mcniven-scott"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571703163,"post_id":58495498,"comment_id":103320888,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495377/proper-collection-structure-for-firestore/58495498#comment103320888_58495498"},{"owner":{"reputation":459,"user_id":6002078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIOLH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stratubas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6002078/stratubas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":680,"user_id":1368333,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c9fe0b16e3e9c6d8f8c1c95656f9e1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steve McNiven-Scott","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1368333/steve-mcniven-scott"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571703654,"post_id":58495498,"comment_id":103320987,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495377/proper-collection-structure-for-firestore/58495498#comment103320987_58495498"},{"owner":{"reputation":459,"user_id":6002078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIOLH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stratubas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6002078/stratubas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":680,"user_id":1368333,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c9fe0b16e3e9c6d8f8c1c95656f9e1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steve McNiven-Scott","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1368333/steve-mcniven-scott"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571703916,"post_id":58495498,"comment_id":103321030,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495377/proper-collection-structure-for-firestore/58495498#comment103321030_58495498"},{"owner":{"reputation":459,"user_id":6002078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIOLH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stratubas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6002078/stratubas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":680,"user_id":1368333,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c9fe0b16e3e9c6d8f8c1c95656f9e1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steve McNiven-Scott","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1368333/steve-mcniven-scott"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571704082,"post_id":58495498,"comment_id":103321054,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495377/proper-collection-structure-for-firestore/58495498#comment103321054_58495498"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":459,"user_id":6002078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIOLH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stratubas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6002078/stratubas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":459,"user_id":6002078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIOLH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stratubas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6002078/stratubas"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571703779,"last_edit_date":1571703779,"creation_date":1571702319,"answer_id":58495498,"question_id":58495377,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58495498","body_markdown":"You might run into a dead-end if you decide to manage your indexes later, because they require specific names of collections and document fields, and your collections will be named after your users&#39;

This corresponds to the loading process defined in the YAML spec:\r\n\r\n![](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/overview2.png)\r\n\r\nNow PyYAML&#39;s `Composer` expects functions `get_event`, `check_event` and `peek_event` to exist on `self`, but doesn&#39;t implement them. They are implemented by `Parser`. Therefore, to have a working YAML loading chain, PyYAML later does:\r\n\r\n    class Loader(Reader, Scanner, Parser, Composer, Constructor, Resolver):\r\n      def __init__(self, stream):\r\n        Reader.__init__(self, stream)\r\n        Scanner.__init__(self)\r\n        Parser.__init__(self)\r\n        Composer.__init__(self)\r\n        Constructor.__init__(self)\r\n        Resolver.__init__(self)\r\n\r\nFor you, this means that you need a `Loader` object and use the `Parser` API for top-level events, along with the `Composer` and `Constructor` API to load each item in the top-level sequence.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s some code that gets you started:\r\n\r\n    import yaml\r\n    \r\n    input = &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    - &quot;A&quot;: 1\r\n    - &quot;B&quot;: 2\r\n    - foo\r\n    - 1\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    loader = yaml.SafeLoader(input)\r\n    \r\n    # check proper stream start (should never fail)\r\n    assert loader.check_event(yaml.StreamStartEvent)\r\n    loader.get_event()\r\n    assert loader.check_event(yaml.DocumentStartEvent)\r\n    loader.get_event()\r\n    \r\n    # assume the root element is a sequence\r\n    assert loader.check_event(yaml.SequenceStartEvent)\r\n    loader.get_event()\r\n    \r\n    # now while the next event does not end the sequence, process each item\r\n    while not loader.check_event(yaml.SequenceEndEvent):\r\n        # compose current item to a node as if it was the root node\r\n        node = loader.compose_node(None, None)\r\n        # construct a native Python value with the node.\r\n        # we set deep=True for complete processing of all the node&#39;s children\r\n        value = loader.construct_object(node, True)\r\n        print(value)\r\n    \r\n    # assume document ends and no further documents are in stream\r\n    loader.get_event()\r\n    assert loader.check_event(yaml.DocumentEndEvent)\r\n    loader.get_event()\r\n    assert loader.check_event(yaml.StreamEndEvent)\r\n\r\nBe aware that you might run into problems if you have anchors &amp; aliases in the YAML document.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495372/parse-yaml-list-elements-one-at-a-time-in-python/58500851#58500851","title":"Parse yaml list elements one at a time in python"}],"owner":{"reputation":2825,"user_id":2640636,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWXEh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SU3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2640636/su3"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571820855,"creation_date":1571700975,"question_id":58495372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495372","body_markdown":"Is there a yaml library in python that can read an input file an entry at a time, as needed, rather than parsing the whole file?

problem is in your `main()`\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    XInitThreads();\r\n    Application* app;\r\n    app-&gt;run();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou need to use `new` here and allocate your `Application`:\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    XInitThreads();\r\n    Application* app = new Application(...);\r\n    app-&gt;run();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, **don&#39;t** do it in `Network`. That will create a memory leak. Do this instead:\r\n```\r\nNetwork::Network(Application *app)\r\n{\r\n    application = app;\r\n    window = app-&gt;window;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\n&gt;could someone explain why that works and using a pointer does not?\r\n\r\nSo, pointers do not allocate any memory by themselves. They are simply pointers. They hold addresses. They don&#39;t allocate memory by themselves to allow things like this:\r\n```\r\nint a =0;\r\nint *b = &amp;a; // holds address of a\r\n```\r\nIf pointers allocated data here, it could cause a memory leak or other things. Thus, if you want to hold a new object independent of other variables, you need to use `new` or some smart pointer:\r\n```\r\nint* c = new int; // c holds an int independent of a or b\r\n```\r\nThus, if you simply do something like this:\r\n```\r\nint* d;\r\n```\r\n`d` has no memory allocated at its position by itself. It is a placeholder that can hold any address. It can hold an existing address, or a new address. But it needs to store some valid address before you can use it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create an instance of `Application`, you either have to allocate it with `new` or, as others have pointed out, not even use a pointer at all, which is actually the recommended course of action:\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    XInitThreads();\r\n    Application app;\r\n    app.run();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495352/segmentation-fault-when-assigning-pointer/58495432#58495432","title":"Segmentation Fault when Assigning Pointer"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23537,"user_id":4581301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5580eebb22e2c65c9b2325d2276d92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4581301/user4581301"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571702863,"post_id":58495493,"comment_id":103320818,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495352/segmentation-fault-when-assigning-pointer/58495493#comment103320818_58495493"},{"owner":{"reputation":2193,"user_id":11941443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f27a880243178eedf3abdab24898b335?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"uneven_mark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11941443/uneven-mark"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571702942,"post_id":58495493,"comment_id":103320839,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495352/segmentation-fault-when-assigning-pointer/58495493#comment103320839_58495493"},{"owner":{"reputation":23537,"user_id":4581301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5580eebb22e2c65c9b2325d2276d92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4581301/user4581301"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571703485,"post_id":58495493,"comment_id":103320952,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495352/segmentation-fault-when-assigning-pointer/58495493#comment103320952_58495493"},{"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":4530832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b154aa0721a0e9aa4ce9422c63baa810?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Otto von Bisquick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4530832/otto-von-bisquick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571703554,"post_id":58495493,"comment_id":103320967,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495352/segmentation-fault-when-assigning-pointer/58495493#comment103320967_58495493"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":4530832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b154aa0721a0e9aa4ce9422c63baa810?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Otto von Bisquick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4530832/otto-von-bisquick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":86,"user_id":4530832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b154aa0721a0e9aa4ce9422c63baa810?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Otto von Bisquick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4530832/otto-von-bisquick"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571702767,"last_edit_date":1571702767,"creation_date":1571702252,"answer_id":58495493,"question_id":58495352,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58495493","body_markdown":"To answer your edit, the difference between\r\n```\r\nApplication* app;\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\nApplication app;\r\n```\r\n\r\nis what gets allocated and constructed, and what does not.\r\n\r\nIn the first example, the compiler sets aside enough space in the stack to hold a pointer, but does not set aside any space for what it might be pointing to - you need to do that manually with `new`. This was why your program did not work - you had space for a pointer, but when you de-referenced that pointer with `-&gt;`, there was no `Application` waiting at the other end. You told it to find an `Application` and take the `window` property and store it somewhere else, but that `window` property had never been created.\r\n\r\nIn the second example, the compiler sets aside enough space for a full `Application` object, and calls the constructor for you. So when you de-reference the pointer this time, there is an `Application` waiting there to be used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI want to add another piece of information. In the first example, pointers aren&#39;t objects, and don&#39;t have constructors to be called, so if you don&#39;t assign a value to them, their initial values are essentially random - whatever was in stack at the time.

the online ftp I have been working on the `ftp_cdup($connection)` always sets the current directory to root and the `ftp_pwd($connection)` always returns &quot;/&quot;. I have spent hours focusing on scope but that cannot possibly the issue (I attempted to debug by setting it in a session variable only to have it still give an undefined index error). If I specify the current directory before `echoTableData()` is run then the output will be all the files in the directory that I set.

The input is of length two, where each element can either be 0 or 1. This gives four distinct input possibilities: [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]. Since there is no noise present, the input can only be these four options. \r\n\r\nIt does not really make sense to use an autoencoder here, but I am trying to build a basic understanding and make sure my general approach works for simple problems with known outcomes before proceeding to more complex problems that involve adding noise, etc.\r\n\r\nI realize this is applied to images so may not directly translate, but I used this tutorial as a starting point: https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html. Here is the structure I used (I made this up, not a ton of intuition behind this architecture choice but wanted to keep it simple and take into account the input/output data format).\r\n\r\n    input_dim = 2\r\n    encoded_dim = 4\r\n    input_ = Input(shape=(input_dim,))\r\n    encoded_ = Dense(input_dim, activation=&#39;relu&#39;)(input_)\r\n    decoded = Dense(input_dim, activation=&#39;relu&#39;)(encoded_) \r\n    output = Dense(input_dim, activation=&#39;sigmoid&#39;)(decoded) # because output should be between 0 and 1\r\n    autoencoder = Model(input_, output)\r\n\r\n    autoencoder.compile(optimizer=&#39;adam&#39;,loss=&#39;binary_crossentropy&#39;) # because each output node in the autoencoder should be a 0 or 1 corresponding to reconstructed input\r\n    autoencoder.fit(inputs, inputs, batch_size = 8, epochs=12, validation_split = 0.20)\r\n\r\nHowever, I am finding the loss to be extremely high and that the predicted output does not correspond at all the input. However, I find this extremely surprising because the problem itself is extremely simple and does not require NNs to solve efficiently since there is no noise/variability in the data. In fact, setting most of the weights to 0 and a few to 1 solves the problem. Do you have any thoughts on why this problem might be difficult for a NN to solve or why my specific approach/architecture choice would not work for this problem? I would appreciate any feedback/improvements/suggestions to help learn.

Consumer thread is not going to call produce() so if I do not enclose the wait call inside the produce method with synchronized keyword then it should still behave the same because produce() is only being called by the Producer thread. Is that right?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dzone.com/articles/the-evolution-of-producer-consumer-problem-in-java","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495317/consumer-producer-problem-is-synchronization-always-necessary","title":"Consumer Producer Problem - Is synchronization always necessary?"},{"tags":["python","class","types","dataset"],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11324600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Hh7c2wHPG3o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHjw/CEN_6erugoQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user217763","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11324600/user217763"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571700339,"creation_date":1571700339,"question_id":58495316,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495316","body_markdown":"Sno 8271 non-null object\r\nDistrict 8271 non-null object\r\nHealth Block 8271 non-null object\r\nHealth Facility 8271 non-null object\r\nHealth SubFacility 8271 non-null object\r\nVillage 8271 non-null object\r\nRCHID 8271 non-null object\r\nCaseNo 8271 non-null object\r\nName 8271 non-null object\r\ndName 8265 non-null object\r\nMobileof 8271 non-null object\r\nMobileNo 8271 non-null object\r\nAge 8271 non-null object\r\nBankName 477 non-null object\r\nAddress 8271 non-null object\r\nName 8271 non-null object\r\nRegistrationDate 8271 non-null object\r\nLMP 8271 non-null object\r\nEDD 8271 non-null object\r\nANC1 4217 non-null object\r\nANC2 5001 non-null object\r\nANC3 573 non-null object","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495316/covert-data-type-from-non-null-object-in-python-i-have-follwing-data-set-which","title":"covert data type from non null object in python. i have follwing data set which is showing all values are non-null object.How can i do this"},{"tags":["python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":3750257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KF8gx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pppery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3750257/pppery"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571706598,"post_id":58495313,"comment_id":103321444,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495313/python-3-x-unintended-keyerror#comment103321444_58495313"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12160983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70baecc8c77422df7c28768fb05db576?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin_B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12160983/martin-b"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12160983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70baecc8c77422df7c28768fb05db576?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin_B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12160983/martin-b"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571730010,"creation_date":1571700322,"last_edit_date":1571730010,"question_id":58495313,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495313","body_markdown":"    \r\n    class Phone_book:\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            self.phoneDic = {}                                         #Tomt dictionary\r\n            commandsDic = { &quot;add&quot;

I include these as --py-files when I spark submit to a Kubernetes spark cluster:\r\n\r\n    spark-submit --py-files s3a://bucket/pyfiles/pyspark_jdbc.zip my_application.py\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gives me:\r\n\r\n\r\n    java.io.FileNotFoundException: File file:/opt/spark/work-dir/pyspark_jdbc.zip does not exist\r\n\r\nAs [other answers][1] have told me, I need to actually add that zip file to the PYTHONPATH. Now, I find that to be no longer true with at least Spark 2.3+, but lets do it with:\r\n\r\n    spark.sparkContext.addPyFile(&quot;pyspark_jdbc.zip&quot;)\r\n\r\nLooking into the cluster logs, I see:\r\n\r\n\r\n    19/10/21 22:40:56 INFO Utils: Fetching s3a://bucket/pyfiles/pyspark_jdbc.zip to \r\n    /var/data/spark-52e390f5-85f4-41c4-9957-ff79f1433f64/spark-402e0a00-6806-40a7-a17d-5adf39a5c2d4/userFiles-680c1bce-ad5f-4a0b-9160-2c3037eefc29/fetchFileTemp5609787392859819321.tmp\r\n\r\nSo, the pyfiles got imported for sure, but into `/var/data/...` and not into my working directory. Therefore, when I go to add the location of my .zip file to my python path, I don&#39;t know where it is. Some diagnostics on the cluster right before attempting to add the python files:\r\n\r\n    &gt; print(sys.path)\r\n    [..., \r\n     &#39;/var/data/spark-52e390f5-85f4-41c4-9957-ff79f1433f64/spark-402e0a00-6806-40a7-a17d-5adf39a5c2d4/userFiles-680c1bce-ad5f-4a0b-9160-2c3037eefc29&#39;, \r\n     &#39;/opt/spark/work-dir/s3a&#39;, \r\n     &#39;//bucket/pyfiles/pyspark_jdbc.zip&#39;\r\n    ...]\r\n    &gt; print(os.getcwd())\r\n    /opt/spark/work-dir\r\n    &gt; subprocess.run([&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;])\r\n    total 0\r\n\r\nSo we see that pyspark did attempt to add the `s3a://` file I added via `--py-files` to PYTHONPATH, except that it mis-interpreted the `:` and did not add the path correctly. The `/var/data/...` directory is in the PYTHONPATH, but the specific .zip file is not so I cannot import from it. \r\n\r\nHow can I solve this problem going forward?

will definitely not get around writing your own dictioanry (derivate). The first value is a key. As such it is intended only for *exact* match, not something like non case-sensitve match. Actually it is even worse then that:\r\n\r\nI recently learned that Dictionary is *also* our generic Hashtable. It uses the Hashtable approach (getting a hash for every key and input and comparing that one first), to speed up comparision, especcially on stuff like strings. So when looking up a key, it goes through teh key collection and:\r\n\r\n 1. Compare the Hashes. If they do not match, this can not be the key.\r\n 2. If they do match, do the full comparision for the type. Hash colissions ar a thing, so the hash can only be used for early &quot;not a match&quot; filtering.\r\n\r\nYour requirements kinda breaks that. Utterly. You actually would end up with not-matches thanks to the hash, when it *should* match.\r\n\r\nThe *first solution* would be to stop trying to do that in Code, and go to a proper DBMS instead. They tend to have support for all the wierd comparisions you might be able to think up. With a lot of ways to speed them up, like indexes. There should be a in-process database out there. But few people are eery willing to go that route.\r\n\r\nThe **second solution** I can think up is try to rewrite Dictionary, with as little work as nesseasry. Some ideas:\r\n\r\n - the key should interally stored only in upper or lower case, ragardles what the user entered. I will asume lower case, as it seems intuitive for me and just a call of `.toLower()` away.\r\n - you need to store the full key, casing and all. For simplicity I would jsut add a field for htat to the value, asuming you are **really** certain no one will modify that one.\r\n - when looking up a key, first use the buildin match for the lowcase version of the input. Then (if nesseary) also check the original key, before you report a match/not match.\r\n\r\nYou basically add a step 3 to my above listing:\r\n\r\n 3. If the lower case of the input matches the (lowercase) key and case sensitivey is required, now check the stored cased key against the cased input\r\n\r\nHopefully would only ahve to modify the add and find routines. Stuff like remove *should* use the find function to first find the element. It is a bit hacky. Ideally you want to hide the internals of how you do this from the user, so the list of cased keys should be private. Of coruse that means having to touch way more code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495287/dictionary-both-case-sensitive-and-insensitive/58495565#58495565","title":"Dictionary both case sensitive and insensitive"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16948,"user_id":2557128,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3cc7fed3c952511b85cfb1c822ecb75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"NetMage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2557128/netmage"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16948,"user_id":2557128,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3cc7fed3c952511b85cfb1c822ecb75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"NetMage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2557128/netmage"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571785052,"last_edit_date":1571785052,"creation_date":1571703452,"answer_id":58495583,"question_id":58495287,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58495583","body_markdown":"After further thought, and reading the comments, I think the best implementation is to have extend what appears to be a case-sensitive `Dictionary` with new case-insensitive properties and methods.

of all, it shouldn&#39;t shock you that a test tool starts from a blank state browser. Who would want the testing context to be polluted by previous browsing, settings, cookies, etc? Secondly, I find it a bit funny that you want to automate a task, but don&#39;t care to automate 3-5 more steps to execute a successful login.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have some extensive level of configurations that need to be added to your Chrome instance (_cookies, local storage, extensions, users &amp; passwords_), then custom [Chrome Profiles](https://www.chromium.org/developers/creating-and-using-profiles) is what you&#39;re looking for.\r\n\r\n 1. Identify where Chrome is storing the **Default** folder\r\n\r\nYou are basically trying to spawn Chrome with a specific set of configs. These are usually kept into the **Default** folder (*path: `/Users/YourUserHere/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default`*).\r\n\r\n**!Note:** This path might differ from OS to OS, so the recommended way to find out where Chrome is storing these configs on your device is by opening a new Chrome tab &amp; typing `chrome://version`. The setting we are looking for here is **Profile Path**. \r\n\r\n 2. Store the contents of your **Default** folder in your designated assets folder\r\n\r\n 3. Add the path to your custom Chrome configs via the `--user-data-dir` [Chromium CLI switch](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/):\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n    &#39;goog:chromeOptions&#39;: {\r\n    // &#39;moz:firefoxOptions&#39;: {\r\n      args: [ &#39;--no-sandbox&#39;,\r\n              &#39;--disable-gpu&#39;,\r\n              &#39;--start-fullscreen&#39;,\r\n              &#39;--disable-notifications&#39;,\r\n              &#39;--user-data-dir=/Path/To/Your/CustomConfigsFolder&#39;,\r\n            ],\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n 4. Run your test with `browser.debug()` &amp; check the configs have been successfully imported.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** I think I tackled this in a more generic sense on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44213119/how-to-design-a-scraper-for-companies-such-as-owler/44213599#44213599) answer.

I Have Done**\r\n\r\nI am trying to implement `ServiceBase.OnCustomCommand(int command)` in a custom Windows Service called `MyTestService`, with custom command codes as done in [this answer][1]:\r\n\r\n    public enum MyCustomCommands { ExecuteScript = 128 };\r\n\r\nI noticed it&#39;s common to start custom command values at `128`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI attempted to implement custom command codes like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic enum MyCustomCommandCodes\r\n{\r\n    Test1 = 1,\r\n    Test2 = 2,\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected override void OnCustomCommand(int command)\r\n{\r\n    switch (command)\r\n    {\r\n        case (int)MyCustomCommandCodes.Test1:\r\n            eventLog1.WriteEntry(&quot;Test1&quot;);\r\n            break;\r\n        case (int)MyCustomCommandCodes.Test2:\r\n            eventLog1.WriteEntry(&quot;Test2&quot;);\r\n            break;\r\n        default:\r\n            eventLog1.WriteEntry(&quot;default&quot;);\r\n            break;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am calling `OnCustomCommand` using Window&#39;s command-line utility [Service Control (SC)][2].\r\n\r\nWhen I enter `sc control MyTestService 1`, I found instead of calling case `Test1`, it actually stopped the service.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, this explains why people start command values at `128`, it&#39;s to prevent overlap with codes already in use.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to see which control codes are already in use by a Windows service.\r\n\r\n**Two-part Question**:\r\n\r\n - Is there a way to query the list of all codes that are in use?\r\n - If yes, is there also a way to query what each code actually does?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17406035/11163122\r\n  [2]:

I&#39;m doing a tutorial where you draw sunglasses on a detected face. I have the faces and I&#39;m able to draw the bitmap but the sunglasses aren&#39;t exactly aligned- they&#39;re close. But more specifically where I&#39;m getting held up is the tilting/rotating of the bitmap to match what I&#39;m assuming should be the getHeadEulerAngleY() position from firebase vision faces.\r\nI used a Matrix to try and &quot;tilt&quot; the glasses with the Y axis but the glasses only rotate in one direction- so not necessarily the eyes. If it&#39;s a float I get from the head Euler Angle Y, wouldn&#39;t the negative bitmap rotation corrispond with the value of the float?\r\n \r\nI&#39;m also still very knew and trying to learn.\r\n\r\nmany different answers got me to this point, but now I&#39;m stuck. \r\n\r\nFor example to aling with the eyes: \r\n\r\n     if(leftEye != null &amp;&amp; rightEye != null){\r\n              distance = (float) Math.sqrt(\r\n                            Math.pow(rightEye.getPosition().getX() - \r\n                            leftEye.getPosition().getX(), 2) +\r\n                            Math.pow(rightEye.getPosition().getY() - \r\n                            leftEye.getPosition().getY(), 2)); \r\n    \r\n    rect = new Rect(\r\n               Math.round(leftEye.getPosition().getX() - distance), \r\n               Math.round(leftEye.getPosition().getY() - distance), \r\n               Math.round(rightEye.getPosition().getX() + distance), \r\n               Math.round(rightEye.getPosition().getY() + distance));\r\n     }else{\r\n        rect = face.getBoundingBox;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthis gets the glasses quite closly aligned with eyes.\r\n\r\nBut what I attempted to do before that code executes was using a Matrix to turn the bitmap first, based on the Y axis:\r\n\r\n     Matrix matrix = new Matrix();\r\n        matrix.postRotate(face.getHeadEulerAngleY);\r\n    \r\n    then apply the glasses to the canvas\r\n          canvas.drawBitmap(sunglasses, null, rect, null);\r\n    image.setImgBitmap(mutable)\r\n\r\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing something. That glasses formula is from a similar function that got me closest to the eyes, so I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s a similar one to match the axis. I&#39;m not sure where to start. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495212/drawing-a-bitmap-on-detected-face-aligning-glasses-to-the-eyes","title":"Drawing a bitmap on detected face, aligning glasses to the eyes"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9534}
