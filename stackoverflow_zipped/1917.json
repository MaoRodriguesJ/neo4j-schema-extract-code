It was recommended to store my data in lists rather than as individual items in the global environment. Therefore I am attempting to import all similar file types (e.g. .csv) into a list of lists. Each nested list represents one of multiple time series .csv files. This currently works using the following code:\r\n\r\n    ImportData &lt;- function(mypattern,...)\r\n    {\r\n      mypattern &lt;- readline(prompt = &quot;Enter File Type:&quot;)\r\n      temp &lt;- list.files(&quot;.&quot;, pattern=mypattern)\r\n      myfiles &lt;- lapply(temp, fread, skip = 1) \r\n      names(myfiles) &lt;- gsub(&quot;-.*&quot;, &quot;&quot;, temp)\r\n      header &lt;- c(&quot;index&quot;,&quot;DateTime&quot;, &quot;Voltage&quot;)\r\n      myfiles &lt;&lt;- lapply(myfiles, setNames, header)\r\n    }\r\n    ImportData()\r\n\r\nThe next step is to combine lists of time series data with similar names that represent data from the same site. After running the above function `myfiles` contains lists with names such as ASW1.csv, ASW1_10Sept.csv, ASW1_2017, as well as others with different abbreviations (e.g. CSW). My goal with the below function is to prompt the user to input a site name (e.g. ASW1) and for every list within the `myfiles` list with a name containing ASW1 to be combined and sorted by date into a new list called ASW1 within `myfiles`. Then the user can call all the data from a particular site.\r\n\r\n    CombineData &lt;- function()\r\n    {\r\n      Site &lt;- invisible(readline(prompt = &quot;Enter Site Name:&quot;))\r\n      myfiles[[Site]] &lt;&lt;- rbindlist(mget(apropos(Site), inherits = TRUE))\r\n    }\r\n    CombineData()\r\n\r\nThe issue I am having is when running `CombineData` an empty list is added to `myfiles` rather than one that contains all the data from any list with the name provided in `Site`. I can manually combine the lists: \r\n\r\n    ASW1 &lt;- myfiles[c(1,2,3,4)]\r\n    ASW1 &lt;- rbindlist(ASW1)\r\n\r\nbut my goal is to make this process as automated as possible. In a previous version of my code I used the following to grab everything containing a particular name `do.call(rbind, mget(ls(pattern = &quot;^ASW1&quot;)))` but clearly there must be something different when working with lists.\r\n\r\nAny help with sorting this out would be greatly appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085719/combining-nested-list-items-with-similar-names-in-r","title":"Combining nested list items with similar names in R"},{"tags":["c++","gstreamer"],"owner":{"reputation":995,"user_id":1072039,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFWFk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"logidelic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1072039/logidelic"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569347245,"creation_date":1569347245,"question_id":58085715,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085715","body_markdown":"To get all bus messages from my GStreamer pipelines, I am currently calling `gst_bus_set_sync_handler` (returning `GST_BUS_DROP` from my handler).

I want to try a number of test cases for each function exposed by the library, so I&#39;ve found it convenient to group the tests for each method in a class. All of the functions I want to test have the same signature and return similar results, so I&#39;d like to use a helper method defined in a superclass to do some assertions on the results. A simplified version would run like so:\r\n\r\n    class MyTestCase:\r\n        function_under_test: Optional[Callable[[str], Any]] = None\r\n    \r\n        def assert_something(self, input_str: str, expected_result: Any) -&gt; None:\r\n            if self.function_under_test is None:\r\n                raise AssertionError(\r\n                    &quot;To use this helper method, you must set the function_under_test&quot;\r\n                    &quot;class variable within your test class to the function to be called.&quot;)\r\n    \r\n            result = self.function_under_test.__func__(input_str)\r\n            assert result == expected_result\r\n            # various other assertions on result...\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class FunctionATest(MyTestCase):\r\n        function_under_test = mymodule.myfunction\r\n    \r\n        def test_whatever(self):\r\n            self.assert_something(&quot;foo bar baz&quot;)\r\n\r\nIn `assert_something`, It&#39;s necessary to call `__func__()` on the function since assigning a function to a class attribute makes it a bound method of that class -- otherwise `self` will be passed through as the first argument to the external library function, where it doesn&#39;t make any sense.\r\n\r\nThis code works as intended. However, it yields the MyPy error:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Callable[[str], Any]&quot; has no attribute &quot;__func__&quot;\r\n\r\nBased on my annotation, it&#39;s correct that this isn&#39;t a safe operation: an arbitrary Callable may not have a `__func__` attribute. However, I can&#39;t find any type annotation that would indicate that the `function_under_test` variable refers to a method and thus will always have `__func__`. Am I overlooking one, or is there another way to tweak my annotations or accesses to get this working with type-checking?\r\n\r\nCertainly, there are plenty of other ways I could get around this, some of which might even be cleaner (use an `Any` type, skip type checking, use a private method to return the function under test rather than making it a class variable, make the helper method a function, etc.). I&#39;m more interested in whether there&#39;s an annotation or other mypy trick that would get this code working.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085648/mypy-type-annotation-for-a-bound-method","title":"MyPy type annotation for a bound method?"},{"tags":["linux","gnome","gnome-shell-extensions","gjs"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12114656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59f266242b41dd5f9a17b75cdcb0ac36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vittorio urbani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12114656/vittorio-urbani"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569407606,"post_id":58087036,"comment_id":102584923,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085645/gnome-shell-3-34-missing-extensionutils-extension-property/58087036#comment102584923_58087036"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1026,"user_id":1108697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d782873c25fc92ccadf8e81cd9771bea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"andy.holmes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1108697/andy-holmes"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569353385,"creation_date":1569353385,"answer_id":58087036,"question_id":58085645,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58087036","body_markdown":"The code you&#39;re looking for, the map of loaded extensions, is also a part of the `ExtensionSystem` module, whereas the `ExtensionUtils` module is mostly utilities for extension authors like GSettings and Gettext helpers.\r\n\r\nThe functions you are looking for are a part of the class `ExtensionManager` in 3.34+.

The bare repository has been created with the Administrator account. The users have been (for the moment) added to the Administrators group. ***Everything is on the same machine***, so as far as I understand git, access between the central repository and the user clones is direct file access. If that understanding isn&#39;t correct, then that could be where our problem is.\r\n\r\nCloning the local user repositories worked fine, but when we try to push a change to the central repository, we get errors such as:\r\n\r\n    remote: error: couldn&#39;t set &#39;refs/heads/master&#39;\r\n\r\nThe push fails as a result. My initial thought was that this was a permissions issue, and we&#39;ve checked that the user accounts have full control for the &quot;master&quot; file, as well as everything else in the .git tree. The repository is marked as shared in the config file. I&#39;ve searched for answers on this, and all of them have to do with Linux permissions, and we&#39;ve applied those concepts to the Windows repository, but without any success.\r\n\r\nWe are not interested in setting up a Linux server; this is for a customer, and they are running everything on Windows. We would prefer to have simplicity of setup without using ssh or other transport mechanisms, so our focus is on making this work as it&#39;s currently set up.\r\n\r\nWhat else can we try to fix and/or troubleshoot the problem?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085637/git-configuration-when-everything-is-local-on-windows","title":"Git Configuration When Everything Is Local on Windows"},{"tags":["django","many-to-many","django-queryset"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12092571,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7522b7f1c282dcdcb68707341fff6c25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"snchrk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092571/snchrk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569347983,"post_id":58085711,"comment_id":102565475,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085636/filter-a-django-queryset-based-on-specific-manytomany-relationships/58085711#comment102565475_58085711"},{"owner":{"reputation":197263,"user_id":67579,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJXub.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Willem Van Onsem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/67579/willem-van-onsem"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12092571,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7522b7f1c282dcdcb68707341fff6c25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"snchrk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092571/snchrk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569348108,"post_id":58085711,"comment_id":102565523,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085636/filter-a-django-queryset-based-on-specific-manytomany-relationships/58085711#comment102565523_58085711"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12092571,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7522b7f1c282dcdcb68707341fff6c25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"snchrk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092571/snchrk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569360521,"post_id":58085711,"comment_id":102570062,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085636/filter-a-django-queryset-based-on-specific-manytomany-relationships/58085711#comment102570062_58085711"},{"owner":{"reputation":197263,"user_id":67579,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJXub.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Willem Van Onsem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/67579/willem-van-onsem"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12092571,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7522b7f1c282dcdcb68707341fff6c25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"snchrk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092571/snchrk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569360604,"post_id":58085711,"comment_id":102570083,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085636/filter-a-django-queryset-based-on-specific-manytomany-relationships/58085711#comment102570083_58085711"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":197263,"user_id":67579,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJXub.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Willem Van Onsem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/67579/willem-van-onsem"},"last_editor":{"reputation":197263,"user_id":67579,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJXub.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Willem Van Onsem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/67579/willem-van-onsem"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569360587,"last_edit_date":1569360587,"creation_date":1569347209,"answer_id":58085711,"question_id":58085636,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58085711","body_markdown":"We can count the number of toppings that are `pepperoni` or `sausage` and compare that with the total number of related toppings, if the two match, and the number is larger than `0`, then we can return such pizza:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from django.db.models import &lt;b&gt;Count, Q&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nPizza.objects.annotate(\r\n    &lt;b&gt;ntopping=Count(&#39;toppings&#39;)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n).filter(\r\n    ntopping__gte=1,\r\n    ntopping=Count(&#39;toppings&#39;, filter=Q(toppings__in=[pepperoni, sausage]))\r\n)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nwill exactly do what you want.

understand why the MIPS instructions are produced to implement your pseudo-code you must first understand the basics of bitwise operations. In this case, you are dealing with a [Bitwise AND][1] operation. A Bitwise AND is a great way to check to see if certain bits are set or not. Such a check often involves using what is known as a bit mask. Bit masks take advantage of the identity property of boolean logic. In other words, any bit AND&#39;d with a 1 retains its value, while any bit AND&#39;d with a 0 results in zero. Consider the few following examples:\r\n\r\n          01000\r\n    (AND) 11000\r\n          -----\r\n          01000\r\n\r\n \r\n          01010\r\n    (AND) 11111\r\n          -----\r\n          01010\r\n\r\n\r\n          01010\r\n    (AND) 00000\r\n          -----\r\n          00000\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice how the bitmask `11111` retains the original value of the first operand, and the bitmask `00000` always results in `00000`.\r\n\r\nNow applying this to your problem. If you want to check if a particular bit is set, say the 11th bit from the rightmost position, then you can do so by creating a bitmask with the 11th bit\r\nset to 1 and the rest set to zero. For example, from hex to binary we have:\r\n\r\n    0x400 = 0000010000000000\r\n\r\nNotice how the 11th bit from the rightmost position is set to 1 in the hexadecimal value `0x400`. Remember, this is only if we start counting from 1.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together. To check if `$s0[10] == 1` (the 11th bit) we know we can use the hex value `0x400` and a bitwise AND. If the 11th bit is set, the result of `$s0 AND 0x400` should result in a non-zero value. Otherwise the result is zero. Now let&#39;s understand the MIPS code.\r\n\r\n    andi $t1, $s0, 0x00400  ; perform the AND and store the result in $t1\r\n    beq $t1, $0, END_IF     ; if $t1 is zero, then the 11th bit must not have been set. BRANCH past the following instruction!\r\n    addi $s6, $0, -1        ; Ah! We didn&#39;t take the branch so the 11th bit was set, so assign -1 to $s6\r\n    END_IF:\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully this clarifies what you are seeing.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** - This was your original request: &quot;*write a sequence of MIPS instructions that writes the value &quot;-1&quot; to the s6 register if the bit in the seventh position (from the right) of the register s0 is &quot;1&quot; (otherwise the register s6 remains unchanged)*&quot;\r\n\r\nWe can use the same logic as above, but we need a different bitmask. The bitmask for checking the 7th bit from the right would look like `0x40 = 01000000`. **Here we have to be careful based on the wording. The 7th bit from the right means we are not counting from zero.** So we can actually use the exact same algorithm as before if we edit the bitmask.\r\n\r\n    andi $t1, $s0, 0x40     ; perform the AND and store the result in $t1\r\n    beq $t1, $0, END_IF     ; if $t1 is zero, then the 7th bit must not have been set.

using Qt 5.12.3 (Clang 10.0 (Apple), 64 bit) on MacOS 10.14.6 to build an app on a MacBook pro 15 mid 2018 2.2ghz i7. \r\n\r\nBasically, the app calls a library I&#39;m using that processes video frames (processFrame, below), one frame at a time. processFrame launches two main threads that receive callbacks at non-deterministic intervals, based on calculations it makes on incoming frames.\r\n\r\nIf I call processFrame and feed it video frames without Qt, it works perfectly fine every time, i.e. when the code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n\r\n    //QApplication a(argc, argv);\r\n    //MainWindow w;\r\n\r\n    while(frame) {\r\n        frame = getVideoFrame(&quot;video.mp4&quot;);\r\n        processFrame(frame);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    //w.show();\r\n    //return a.exec();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I uncomment the Qt inits, but don&#39;t run the Qt window process itself, i.e:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n\r\n    QApplication a(argc, argv);\r\n    MainWindow w;\r\n\r\n    while(frame) {\r\n        frame = getVideoFrame(&quot;video.mp4&quot;);\r\n        processFrame(frame);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    //w.show();\r\n    //return a.exec();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get problems with race conditions and thread management. These problems become particularly bad when I run intensive, unrelated background processes on my machine.\r\n\r\nIn testing, it seems like Qt might be stopping threads in processFrame from running on a core, somewhat arbitrarily, as it decides to allocate processing resources. \r\n\r\nAgain, I need to stress that I cannot get these race conditions _at all_, provided I run processFrame without Qt.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to prevent Qt from managing processing resources in external libraries (if that&#39;s the problem)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085621/problems-with-multithreading-when-qt-app-uses-libraries-that-use-multithreading","title":"Problems with multithreading when Qt app uses libraries that use multithreading"},{"tags":["python","pdf","web-crawler"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12799,"user_id":2823755,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJziA.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wwii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2823755/wwii"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569350213,"post_id":58085620,"comment_id":102566342,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085620/how-can-i-parse-a-pdf-file-with-python-find-keywords-and-save-those-words-into#comment102566342_58085620"},{"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":8289921,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1ab70896d0d4566f0288d4fc9ded76b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8289921/andrew"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12799,"user_id":2823755,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJziA.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wwii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2823755/wwii"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569351283,"post_id":58085620,"comment_id":102566828,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085620/how-can-i-parse-a-pdf-file-with-python-find-keywords-and-save-those-words-into#comment102566828_58085620"},{"owner":{"reputation":12799,"user_id":2823755,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJziA.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wwii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2823755/wwii"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569436717,"post_id":58085620,"comment_id":102600317,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085620/how-can-i-parse-a-pdf-file-with-python-find-keywords-and-save-those-words-into#comment102600317_58085620"}],"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":8289921,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1ab70896d0d4566f0288d4fc9ded76b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8289921/andrew"},"last_editor":{"reputation":80,"user_id":8289921,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1ab70896d0d4566f0288d4fc9ded76b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8289921/andrew"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569351344,"creation_date":1569346784,"last_edit_date":1569351344,"question_id":58085620,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085620","body_markdown":"I want to create a program that goes through a PDF file, finds instances of certain keywords, and saves those keywords into a csv file.\r\n\r\nThe closest solution that I have received is an [answer][1] to a similar question, from Emma Yu. \r\n\r\n    # import packages\r\n    import PyPDF2\r\n    import re\r\n\r\n    # open the pdf file\r\n    object = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(&quot;test.pdf&quot;)\r\n\r\n    # get number of pages\r\n    NumPages = object.getNumPages()\r\n\r\n    # define keyterms\r\n    String = &quot;Social&quot;\r\n\r\n    # extract text and do the search\r\n    for i in range(0, NumPages):\r\n        PageObj = object.getPage(i)\r\n        print(&quot;this is page &quot; + str(i)) \r\n        Text = PageObj.extractText() \r\n        # print(Text)\r\n        ResSearch = re.search(String, Text)\r\n        print(ResSearch)\r\n\r\nHowever, this answer only lets me search for one keyword at a time, and it doesn&#39;t let me save that keyword into a CSV file if it was found at least once in the PDF file.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is a PDF file of Ontario&#39;s 2019 budget: http://budget.ontario.ca/pdf/2019/2019-ontario-budget-en.pdf\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say that I want to find three keywords: &quot;Economy&quot;, &quot;Budget&quot;, and &quot;Rabbit&quot;.

to other similar problems, the solution could be reinstalling `pyqt`, see [here][1]. These answers imply that obsolete versions of `pyqt` are the cause of this problem. In your case, since you are using PySide2 I suggest removing whatever version you currently have and installing again, if you&#39;re using pip:\r\n\r\n    pip uninstall PySide2\r\n    pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir PySide2\r\n\r\nIn case that doesn&#39;t help, I&#39;ve also found another similar error in a question that I hope would at least point you in the right [direction][2] that has an answer (which is probably already mentioned in the comments, don&#39;t add UI elements from other threads), I&#39;m copying it here:\r\n\r\n&gt; STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN is a /GS exception. They are thrown when Windows detects &#39;tampering&#39; of a security cookie protecting a return address. It is probable that you are writing something past the end of a buffer, or writing something to a pointer that is pointing to the wrong place. However it is also possible that you have some dodgy memory or otherwise faulty hardware that is tripping validation code. \r\n \r\n&gt; One thing that you could try is to disable the /GS switch (project properties, look for C/C++ -&gt; Code Generation -&gt; Buffer Security Check) and recompile. Running the code again may well cause an error that you can trap and trace. I think /GS is designed not to give you any info for security reasons.\r\n\r\n&gt; Another thing you could do is run the code as is on a different PC and see if that fails, this may point to a hardware problem if it doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49432873/process-finished-with-exit-code-1073740791-0xc0000409-pycharm\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50562192/process-finished-with-exit-code-1073740791-0xc0000409-pycharm-error\r\n  [3]: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2009/01/28/stack-overflow-stack-exhaustion-not-the-same-as-stack-buffer-overflow/\r\n  [4]: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/windows/39061/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085602/add-objects-asynchronously-to-qgraphicsscene/58251773#58251773","title":"Add objects asynchronously to QGraphicsScene"}],"owner":{"reputation":772,"user_id":3020849,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56b238c1ee61ac5064b891e8f41641e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Santi Pe&#241;ate-Vera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3020849/santi-pe%c3%b1ate-vera"},"last_editor":{"reputation":772,"user_id":3020849,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56b238c1ee61ac5064b891e8f41641e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Santi Pe&#241;ate-Vera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3020849/santi-pe%c3%b1ate-vera"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":132,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570304673,"creation_date":1569346674,"last_edit_date":1569393299,"question_id":58085602,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085602","body_markdown":"I develop an application where a lot of objects need to be added to a `QGraphicsScene` object in order to represent the diagram of an electric power system.

There are a couple of things I am trying to accomplish:\r\n\r\n1. I am trying to set up my gremlin server to &quot;load&quot; a certain `json` file that is in `graphson` format, and getting really weird issues there that I will go into details about.\r\n\r\n2. I am trying to run a simple ajax call to query that data, but - not only am I not able to get the data I want (which might make sense since gremlin refuses to load it), I seem to be getting some data that I have *no idea* where it comes from.\r\n\r\n3. I am trying to figure out how to test the gremlin server on my terminal, but I cannot run a query because `./gremlin-server.sh status` returns `Server not running` even though it is 100% running and my ajax call can see that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGremlin not loading file\r\n===\r\n\r\nTo start up, I am running Gremlin v.3.4.3 and that can be found [here](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/tinkerpop/3.4.3/apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.3-bin.zip). The command I use to run gremlin is \r\n\r\n```bin/gremlin-server.sh data/gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml```\r\n\r\nTe yaml file comes with the Gremlin Server downloads, the contents of which are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#...license stuff...\r\n\r\nhost: localhost\r\nport: 8182\r\nscriptEvaluationTimeout: 30000\r\nchannelizer: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.HttpChannelizer\r\ngraphs: {\r\n  graph: conf/tinkergraph-empty.properties}\r\nscriptEngines: {\r\n  gremlin-groovy: {\r\n    plugins: { org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.jsr223.GremlinServerGremlinPlugin: {},\r\n               org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.jsr223.TinkerGraphGremlinPlugin: {},\r\n               org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.jsr223.ImportGremlinPlugin: {classImports: [java.lang.Math], methodImports: [java.lang.Math#*]},\r\n               org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.jsr223.ScriptFileGremlinPlugin: {files: [scripts/generate-modern.groovy]}}}}\r\nserializers:\r\n  - { className: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser.GraphSONMessageSerializerV3d0, config: { ioRegistries: [org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerIoRegistryV3d0] }}         # application/json\r\nmetrics: {\r\n  slf4jReporter: {enabled: true, interval: 180000}}\r\nstrictTransactionManagement: false\r\nmaxInitialLineLength: 4096\r\nmaxHeaderSize: 8192\r\nmaxChunkSize: 8192\r\nmaxContentLength: 65536\r\nmaxAccumulationBufferComponents: 1024\r\nresultIterationBatchSize: 64\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, as I understand it, the important thing to note is the component `graph` that leads to a `properties` file. The properties file I am loading is `tinkergraph-empty.properties`, the contents of which are:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngremlin.graph=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerGraph\r\ngremlin.tinkergraph.vertexIdManager=LONG\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file name, `tinkergraph-empty`, alludes to something important: the gremlin server will not load a graph. Cool - when I start the gremlin server, it loads up normally with results that I can expect:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Configuring Gremlin Server from ./conf/gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml\r\n[INFO] MetricManager - Configured Metrics Slf4jReporter configured with interval=180000ms and loggerName=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.Settings$Slf4jReporterMetrics\r\n[INFO] DefaultGraphManager - Graph [graph] was successfully configured via [conf/tinkergraph-empty.properties].\r\n[INFO] ServerGremlinExecutor - Initialized Gremlin thread pool.

You notice that this is not even loading my file! `[INFO] ServerGremlinExecutor - A GraphTraversalSource is now bound to [g] with graphtraversalsource[tinkergraph[vertices:7 edges:6], standard]`. My file does not have 7 vertices and 6 edges. It has 1 vertex and 0 edges. This actually looks suspiciously like it&#39;s loading the original `tinkerpop-crew.json` file, or something similar, even though when we originally loaded it, the INFO message said: `[INFO] ServerGremlinExecutor - A GraphTraversalSource is now bound to [g] with graphtraversalsource[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:14], standard]`.\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so I have no idea what is going on here.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning my ajax query to see what is happening\r\n====\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a really, really simple query that I run and post using an AJAX call:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$.ajax({\r\n\t\t\ttype: &quot;POST&quot;,\r\n\t\t\taccept: &quot;application/json&quot;,\r\n\t\t\turl: url // http://localhost:8182,\r\n\t\t\ttimeout: timeout // I have it set to 3500,\r\n\t\t\tdata: JSON.stringify({&quot;gremlin&quot; : q}),\r\n\t\t\tsuccess: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR){\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar retrvData = data.result.data;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log(retrvData)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOkay, so a couple of important things. The `q` variable is a query that I send to the Gremlin server to return some data, and it looks like this:\r\n\r\n`q = &#39;nodes = g.V().limit(15).toList();edges = g.V(nodes).aggregate(&#39;node&#39;).outE().as(&#39;edge&#39;).inV().where(within(&#39;node&#39;)).select(&#39;edge&#39;).toList();[nodes,edges]&#39;`\r\n\r\nThis query should essentially return a list of nodes and edges. Now, there are three cases I want to go over:\r\n\r\n###tinkerpop-empty.properties (actually empty):###\r\n\r\nThe first case is using the unaltered tinkerpop-empty.properties file. Remember, when I loaded that, I got output that said:\r\n\r\n`[INFO] ServerGremlinExecutor - A GraphTraversalSource is now bound to [g] with graphtraversalsource[tinkergraph[vertices:0 edges:0], standard]`\r\n\r\nThat means there should be no information in the tinkergraph. I should receive an empty list. However, when I run my call, I get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalue: Array(2)\r\n0: Array(7)\r\n0: {id: 1, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n1: {id: 2, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n2: {id: 3, label: &quot;software&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n3: {id: 47284629, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n4: {id: 4, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n5: {id: 5, label: &quot;software&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n6: {id: 6, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\nlength: 7\r\n__proto__: Array(0)\r\n1: Array(6)\r\n0: {id: 9, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 3, …}\r\n1: {id: 7, label: &quot;knows&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 2, …}\r\n2: {id: 8, label: &quot;knows&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 4, …}\r\n3: {id: 10, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 5, …}\r\n4: {id: 11, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 3, …}\r\n5: {id: 12, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 3, …}\r\nlength: 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the output in the developer console (from console.log(retrvData)). There are all kinds of data. And look, the length of the nodes is 7, and the edges is 6. Sound familiar? Why is gremlin loading this data? Why is it sending it to my ajax query?\r\n\r\n###tinkergraph-empty.properties (modified to use tinkerpop-crew.json)###\r\nOkay, whatever. Let&#39;s run the next `properties` file. Remember, we are using `tinkerpop-crew.json` now with the graphFormat set to graphson. \r\n\r\nI get the same error that I got before, of course, which is `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Vertex with id already exists: 1`. My server also shuts down:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] GremlinServer - Gremlin Server was unable to start and will now begin shutdown: Vertex with id already exists: 1\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Shutting down OpProcessor[]\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Shutting down OpProcessor[session]\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Shutting down OpProcessor[traversal]\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Shutting down thread pools.\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Executing shutdown LifeCycleHook\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Closed Graph instance [graph]\r\n[INFO] GremlinServer - Gremlin Server - shutdown complete\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s go to my AJAX query and see what we get.\r\n\r\nNothing, of course. My gremlin server crashed. It seems like it could be loading the correct file, since the INFO log says `A GraphTraversalSource is now bound to [g] with graphtraversalsource[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:14], standard]`. I haven&#39;t verified that this is correct... it&#39;s not that easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n###tinkerpop-empty.properties loading tinkerpop-crew2.json###\r\n\r\nThe first time we ran `tinkerpop-crew2.json`, things went well. We changed the ID to some weird number and didn&#39;t get an exception thrown. Also, the graph seemed to load the correct stuff. Let&#39;s run it again now, and change the ID to `4724729456382`.\r\n\r\nOkay, wow, I am typing this as I go, and look what I just found:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:1},&quot;label&quot;:&quot;person&quot;,&quot;outE&quot;:{&quot;created&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:9},&quot;inV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:3},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0.4}}}],&quot;knows&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:7},&quot;inV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:2},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0.5}}},{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:8},&quot;inV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:4},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:1.0}}}]},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0},&quot;value&quot;:&quot;marko&quot;}],&quot;age&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:2},&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:29}}]}}\r\n{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:2},&quot;label&quot;:&quot;person&quot;,&quot;inE&quot;:{&quot;knows&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:7},&quot;outV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:1},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0.5}}}]},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:3},&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vadas&quot;}],&quot;age&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:4},&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:27}}]}}\r\n{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:3},&quot;label&quot;:&quot;software&quot;,&quot;inE&quot;:{&quot;created&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:9},&quot;outV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:1},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0.4}}},{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:11},&quot;outV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:4},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0.4}}},{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:12},&quot;outV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:6},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0.2}}}]},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:5},&quot;value&quot;:&quot;lop&quot;}],&quot;lang&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:6},&quot;value&quot;:&quot;java&quot;}]}}\r\n{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:4},&quot;label&quot;:&quot;person&quot;,&quot;inE&quot;:{&quot;knows&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:8},&quot;outV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:1},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:1.0}}}]},&quot;outE&quot;:{&quot;created&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:10},&quot;inV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:5},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:1.0}}},{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:11},&quot;inV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:3},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Double&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:0.4}}}]},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:7},&quot;value&quot;:&quot;josh&quot;}],&quot;age&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:8},&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:32}}]}}\r\n{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:5},&quot;label&quot;:&quot;software&quot;,&quot;inE&quot;:{&quot;created&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int32&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:10},&quot;outV&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:4},&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;weight&quot;:{&quot

is now the contents of my `tinkerpop-crew2.json`! What is going on here? Why did the gremlin-server dump information to that file? If you see the last line, it has what was the original content of the file:\r\n\r\n`{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:47284629},&quot;label&quot;:&quot;person&quot;}`\r\n\r\nOkay, really, @tinkerpop, what the hell?\r\n\r\nI guess it now makes sense why when I ran the file the second time, it threw that error again and said that the vertex with id 1 was already existing!\r\n\r\nHilariously, I digress! Let us delete the unoriginal portion of that file and just run it with:\r\n\r\n`{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;g:Int64&quot;,&quot;@value&quot;:47284629},&quot;label&quot;:&quot;person&quot;}`\r\n\r\nOkay, that ran fine with the correct INFO that I should be expecting: `[INFO] ServerGremlinExecutor - A GraphTraversalSource is now bound to [g] with graphtraversalsource[tinkergraph[vertices:1 edges:0], standard]`.\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s run that AJAX call...\r\n\r\nGahh!! Same thing!!\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalue: Array(2)\r\n0: Array(7)\r\n0: {id: 1, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n1: {id: 2, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n2: {id: 3, label: &quot;software&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n3: {id: 47284629, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n4: {id: 4, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n5: {id: 5, label: &quot;software&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\n6: {id: 6, label: &quot;person&quot;, type: &quot;vertex&quot;}\r\nlength: 7\r\n__proto__: Array(0)\r\n1: Array(6)\r\n0: {id: 9, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 3, …}\r\n1: {id: 7, label: &quot;knows&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 2, …}\r\n2: {id: 8, label: &quot;knows&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 4, …}\r\n3: {id: 10, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 5, …}\r\n4: {id: 11, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 3, …}\r\n5: {id: 12, label: &quot;created&quot;, inVLabel: &quot;software&quot;, outVLabel: &quot;person&quot;, inV: 3, …}\r\nlength: 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the nodes list is of length 7 and the edges is of lenth 6! Assuming it was loading something, for example, *and* appending my file, it should be node length 8 and edge length 7! What&#39;s going on here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccepted Answer\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe solution was to go into `scripts/generate-modern.groovy` and comment out these lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\nglobals &lt;&lt;

But I&#39;m not 100% sure.\r\n\r\nSO mostly contains older questions that pertain to the pre-&quot;package reference&quot; era before .Net Core and .Net Standard. As a result, any time I search for issues pertaining to &quot;CopyLocal&quot;, I get information on setting the CopyLocal property explicitly on a DLL Reference. I&#39;m not finding anything helpful to fix my issue with automatic determination of CopyLocal by the Package Reference and RAR system.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085571/nuget-pkg-dlls-missing-from-build-folder-in-net-standard-dll-project-dlls-are","title":"Nuget Pkg Dlls Missing from Build Folder in .Net Standard DLL Project. dlls are Not Copy Local?

need to maintain some ETL tool constructed in such a way tasks and pipelines are defined as collection of python packages. Think about plugin architecture with small core and almost thousand of plugins in nested namespaces/packages/subpackages. This is not a hot mess _yet_, overall quality is quite good, but `setup.py` and `__init__.py`-s look very hacky and sometimes cause unexpected problems during imports.\r\n\r\nI would like to simplify this a bit. Since Python 3.3 we can put packages in namespaces simply by creating subdirectories without `__init__.py`. This is exactly what I need, but I would like to avoid deeply nested subdirectories in source code, because a large amount of packages is very small. In extreme they would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tree\r\n.\r\n├── setup.cfg\r\n├── setup.py\r\n└── src\r\n    └── foo\r\n        └── bar\r\n            └── baz\r\n                └── xyz\r\n                    └── uvw\r\n                        └── package\r\n                            ├── actual_code.py\r\n                            └── __init__.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to use implicit namespaces without so deep structure and simply specify namespace somewhere in `setup.py` (or even better `setup.cfg`)? In other words, is there a **simple** way to tell: install `package` in `foo.bar.baz.xyz.uvw` namespace?\r\n\r\nI would like to have structure like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tree\r\n.\r\n├── setup.cfg\r\n├── setup.py\r\n└── src\r\n    └── package\r\n        ├── actual_code.py\r\n        └── __init__.py\r\n```\r\nbut installation process should put `package` into

Each of them has got its own CustomScrollView that lets the used scroll what might end up being a long list of items generated in a SliverList. These lists are also stored in memory, so that as soon as they load there are several hundreds of items loaded.\r\n\r\nBoth pages are very similar and I would like to remember the scroll position of each so that I can return the user to where he left it. This is working nicely, after some trial an error, but I believe there must be a better and efficient way of implementing it.\r\n\r\nRight now I just have a Future in initState that waits for a few milliseconds until the content of the SliverList loads (hopefully), and then scrolls down. \r\n\r\nWhile this is the approach I&#39;ve seen in other questions, I don&#39;t think this is reliable; it works, but if I reduce the time too much (e.g. Duration.zero), I&#39;ll get an exception because the ScrollController is not attached to any view or the scroll won&#39;t work as intended. \r\n\r\n```flutter\r\n@override\r\nvoid initState() {\r\n\r\n  (...)\r\n\r\n  _mainScrollController.addListener(onMainScrolled);\r\n\r\n  Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 200), () {\r\n    _mainScrollController.animateTo(\r\n      widget.recalledScrollPosition,  // Offset passed by the parent\r\n      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 1000),\r\n      curve: Curves.easeInOut,\r\n    );\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  (...)\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method &quot;onMainScrolled&quot; just calls back the value back to the parent (where the PageView is) every time there is a change in the scroll position: \r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid onMainScrolled() {\r\n  widget.notifyScrollPosition(_mainScrollController.offset);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tried another approach (unsuccesfully) with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_mainScrollController = ScrollController(initialScrollOffset: widget.recalledScrollPosition);\r\n_mainScrollController.addListener(onMainScrolled);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in this case, every time I return to the page, the scroll offset is a little bit lower and lower (the scroll has moved a little bit up, little by little, just a few pixels).

(You rarely need to do versioning on these shared atomics, although it can sometimes be needed.)\r\n\r\nAny number of people can buy the newspaper. What matters is that what&#39;s printed was true when it was printed, and is still true if they are invariant truths, like the creation of a monument (invariable by hypothesis).\r\n\r\nSo a release operation publishes what is true at the time of publication, and proper design guarantees that these facts cannot have changed when you can &quot;buy&quot; (acquire) the publication. Any number of threads can see these facts.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085513/acquire-release-memory-order-between-multiple-threads/58142971#58142971","title":"Acquire-release memory order between multiple threads"}],"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":8569915,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98a7276f14ba4c0c329b9218809ba947?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8569915/tes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5213,"user_id":963864,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94e2dd813e278309b6281b4a4b7fdddd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"curiousguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/963864/curiousguy"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":87,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58108689,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569638896,"creation_date":1569346302,"last_edit_date":1569458352,"question_id":58085513,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085513","body_markdown":"Code:\r\n```\r\nstd::atomic&lt;int&gt; done = 0;\r\nint a = 10;\r\n\r\nvoid f1() {\r\n  a = 20;\r\n  done.store(1, std::memory_order_release);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid f2() {\r\n  if(done.load(std::memory_order_acquired) == 1) {\r\n    assert(a == 20);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid f3() {\r\n  if(done.load(std::memory_order_acquired) == 1) {\r\n    assert(a == 20);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  std::thread t1(f1);\r\n  std::thread t2(f2);\r\n  std::thread t3(f3);\r\n  t1.join();\r\n  t2.join();\r\n  t3.join();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe question is if thread 2 &amp; 3 both see `done == 1`, will \r\nthe assertion `a == 20` hold in both threads ?\r\nI know acquire-release works for a pair of threads.

The code I used was this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction loadDocSubscriber() {\r\n\t\tvar xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n\t\txhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {\r\n\t\t\tif (this.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200) {\r\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById(&quot;subscriber&quot;).innerHTML =\r\n\t\t\tthis.responseText;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n\txhttp.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;textfiles/most_recent_subscriber.txt&quot;, true);\r\n\txhttp.send();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt worked fine until OBS updated the Chrome CEF to use CORS. While CORS should see the file opening as something from the same origin and allow it, I&#39;m given to understand that it&#39;s instead reading it as &#39;file:///&#39; and disallowing the javascript from displaying the contents of the opened .txt.\r\n\r\nI believe that the objective is to satisfy the browser that the text file is from the same origin, to this end I&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; content=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\nBut alas that didn&#39;t work. The text files to be pulled from can&#39;t be altered as they&#39;re overwritten regularly, and any messy way of going about it would likely not work because CORS is a security feature and not meant to be circumvented.\r\n\r\nHow can I satisfy the browser&#39;s same origin requirements all while being done locally? \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085511/importing-text-from-an-external-file-without-cors-interfering","title":"Importing text from an external file without CORS interfering"},{"tags":["python","git","pip","requirements.txt"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569347066,"post_id":58085509,"comment_id":102565109,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085509/pip-install-editable-working-dir-to-custom-path-using-requirements-txt#comment102565109_58085509"},{"owner":{"reputation":1077,"user_id":9857620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/50JqF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Frank","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9857620/frank"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569351433,"post_id":58085509,"comment_id":102566873,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085509/pip-install-editable-working-dir-to-custom-path-using-requirements-txt#comment102566873_58085509"},{"owner":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569385981,"post_id":58085509,"comment_id":102575059,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085509/pip-install-editable-working-dir-to-custom-path-using-requirements-txt#comment102575059_58085509"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1077,"user_id":9857620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/50JqF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Frank","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9857620/frank"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569677250,"creation_date":1569677250,"answer_id":58146761,"question_id":58085509,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58146761","body_markdown":"**Why did i ask such a crazy question?**\r\n\r\nI thought i could make my life a little bit easier when both (package and Django project that is using this package) are laying editable inside my workspace because i work on them in parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**My r&#233;sum&#233;**\r\n\r\nI tried it a little bit with the second approach and at the end, i decided to prefer the first approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reason**\r\n\r\nWith both methods pydev won&#39;t show it as an installed package.\r\n\r\nWhen mix both methots like that:\r\n\r\n 1. install package via *requirements.txt* (with the -e switch)\r\n 2. uninstall it\r\n 3. clone it into (eg. *~/workspace/&lt;packagename&gt;*)\r\n 4. install it with the &#39;pip install -e .&#39;
