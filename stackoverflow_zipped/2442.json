Currently each select form shares the same data, therefore searching in one select form will populate the data in all of them. I&#39;m unable to split this up in order to have each select component have individual data. This would be simple to do if they weren&#39;t being dynamically created, however given that I don&#39;t know how many there will be in advance I&#39;m very unsure of how to tackle this problem. \r\n\r\nIn my render function, I have:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{this.createDivs(this.props.Data)}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function creates the divs dynamically based on the number of Data components supplied from props and renders the select component inside of each div. \r\n\r\nThis works through a combination of two functions. \r\n\r\n```\r\ncreateDivs = Data =&gt; {\r\n    return Data.map(this.createDiv)\r\n};\r\n\r\ncreateDiv = Data =&gt; {\r\n\r\nvar name = Data.name;\r\n\r\n const { fetching, data, value } = this.state;\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;Col\r\n        key={Data.id}\r\n      &gt;\r\n        {name}\r\n        &lt;Select\r\n          mode=&quot;multiple&quot;\r\n          labelInValue\r\n          value={value}\r\n          placeholder=&quot;Select something&quot;\r\n          notFoundContent={fetching ? &lt;Spin size=&quot;small&quot; /&gt; : null}\r\n          filterOption={false}\r\n          onSearch={this.fetchUser}\r\n          onChange={this.handleChange}\r\n          style={{ width: &quot;100%&quot; }}\r\n        &gt;\r\n          {data.map(d =&gt; (\r\n            &lt;Option key={d.value}&gt;{d.text}&lt;/Option&gt;\r\n          ))}\r\n        &lt;/Select&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Col&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the const values would need to also be dynamically assigned, and the functions for this.fetchUser and this.handleChange would also need to somehow know which div made the request in order to separate the data from each component. \r\n\r\nfetchUser and handleChange are just using the standard implementation from the antd documentation. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nfetchUser = value =&gt; {\r\n    this.lastFetchId += 1;\r\n    const fetchId = this.lastFetchId;\r\n    this.setState({ data: [], fetching: true });\r\n    fetch(&quot;https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5&quot;)\r\n      .then(response =&gt; response.json())\r\n      .then(body =&gt; {\r\n        if (fetchId !== this.lastFetchId) {\r\n          // for fetch callback order\r\n          return;\r\n        }\r\n        const data = body.results.map(user =&gt; ({\r\n          text: `${user.name.first} ${user.name.last}`,\r\n          value: user.login.username\r\n        }));\r\n        this.setState({ data, fetching: false });\r\n      });\r\n  };\r\n  handleChange = value =&gt; {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      value,\r\n      data: [],\r\n      fetching: false\r\n    });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m unsure how to alter this implementation in order to have each Select component hold its own individual data in state. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated as I haven&#39;t been able to find many examples of how to work with dynamically created components and am quite new to

Additionally, I would need to write for every class, the code to transform is to its serializable version.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to use the strength of XML serialization which takes care of all fuzz about XML, without needing the classes to be deserializable? Or do you have any other suggestions for easy ways to export XML for these classes and properties?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955678/c-generate-xml-for-non-serializable-properties","title":"C# generate XML for non-serializable properties"},{"tags":["android","permissions","adb"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11922217,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nOEeTS8pTWw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdmXqar_fOVx4XiP7bJGFovZzbPYg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rio Kim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11922217/rio-kim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568633947,"post_id":57955897,"comment_id":102323971,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955677/how-to-run-specific-adb-command-in-android-code-i-have-a-problem-of-permission/57955897#comment102323971_57955897"},{"owner":{"reputation":1446,"user_id":10159898,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5mqHUyc2x6w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD1g/QPOjkkQJ8Qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bruno","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10159898/bruno"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11922217,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nOEeTS8pTWw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdmXqar_fOVx4XiP7bJGFovZzbPYg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rio Kim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11922217/rio-kim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568635016,"post_id":57955897,"comment_id":102324547,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955677/how-to-run-specific-adb-command-in-android-code-i-have-a-problem-of-permission/57955897#comment102324547_57955897"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1446,"user_id":10159898,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5mqHUyc2x6w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD1g/QPOjkkQJ8Qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bruno","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10159898/bruno"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568633345,"creation_date":1568633345,"answer_id":57955897,"question_id":57955677,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57955897","body_markdown":"I think you don&#39;t have to specify that it is an adb command.

XSLT 2.0 had a very complicated rule (in &#167;2.4): An implicit result tree is also created when the result sequence is empty, provided that no xsl:result-document instruction has been evaluated during the course of the transformation. In this situation the implicit result tree will consist of a document node with no children.\r\n\r\nInterpreting &quot;creating a result tree&quot; as meaning that the corresponding serialised output file is written to filestore, this means that when the principal result tree is empty, the corresponding output file is written if and only if there are no secondary output files. Which is (I think) the effect that you are asking for.\r\n\r\nThis rule became increasingly unwieldy in XSLT 3.0 because of the greatly extended ways of invoking a stylesheet (e.g by calling an initial public function), and it was therefore dropped; and Saxon followed suit.\r\n\r\nYou can certainly avoid the file being written by supplying a result or destination that discards it rather than writing it to filestore (for example, in s9api, an XdmDestination).

am setting a server with spring boot 2 and angular 6, so far I&#39;ve done several things with some tutorials and some things by myself but that&#39;s not the question.The question and my actual problem is that I am trying to create login so but for some reason I am not able to get it working after I remove .httpBasic and replace it with .formLogin.loginPage I got principal call with null.After I enable httpBasic again I submit my user/pass it works fine but I cannot get it to work without it.As well my angular client is buggy as hell and I don&#39;t actually know from where the problem is. \r\n\r\nLoginRest.java\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@RestController\r\n@CrossOrigin(origins = &quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;)\r\npublic class LoginRest {\r\n    @GetMapping(value =

What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/nazhgvL6/3/\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;svg pointer-events=&quot;none&quot; width=&quot;1558&quot; height=&quot;1163&quot; viewBox=&quot;-130 -97 1558 1163&quot; style=&quot;transform: translate3d(-330px, -497px, 0px) scale(1);&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;defs&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- #mask-shape-1 d attribute is the same as the d attribute of the shape 0 path--&gt;\r\n    &lt;mask id=&quot;mask-shape-1&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- rename ID to turn mask on/off --&gt;\r\n      &lt;path d=&quot;M779 780L779 767L775 741L771 728L760 704L746 682L737 672L717 655L682 636L656 629L630 627L604 636L582 648L563 664L555 673L543 692L529 709L515 737L510 758L508 779L516 799L526 817L539 831L562 847L571 862L592 881L601 887L619 895L630 898L650 897L670 891L689 883L707 871L714 864L733 852L742 844L757 826L764 816L775 792z&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;\r\n      &lt;path d=&quot;M779 780L779 767L775 741L771 728L760 704L746 682L737 672L717 655L682 636L656 629L630 627L604 636L582 648L563 664L555 673L543 692L529 709L515 737L510 758L508 779L516 799L526 817L539 831L562 847L571 862L592 881L601 887L619 895L630 898L650 897L670 891L689 883L707 871L714 864L733 852L742 844L757 826L764 816L775 792z&quot; rx=&quot;5&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&quot;\r\n    &lt;/mask&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;/defs&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;g&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- shape 0 --&gt;\r\n    &lt;path class=&quot;arrival-lines-polygon-fill leaflet-interactive&quot; stroke=&quot;none&quot; fill=&quot;red&quot; fill-opacity=&quot;0.2&quot; d=&quot;M779 780L779 767L775 741L771 728L760 704L746 682L737 672L717 655L682 636L656 629L630 627L604 636L582 648L563 664L555 673L543 692L529 709L515 737L510 758L508 779L516 799L526 817L539 831L562 847L571 862L592 881L601 887L619 895L630 898L650 897L670 891L689 883L707 871L714 864L733 852L742 844L757 826L764 816L775 792z&quot; mask=&quot;url(#mask-shape-0)&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;!-- shape 1 --&gt;\r\n    &lt;path class=&quot;arrival-lines-polygon-fill leaflet-interactive&quot; stroke=&quot;none&quot; fill=&quot;red&quot; fill-opacity=&quot;0.2&quot; d=&quot;M562 849L522 810L495 770L485 749L482 738L483 715L489 693L498 671L504 661L541 613L573 588L599 576L614 572L643 575L657 578L684 588L697 595L709 603L731 622L749 644L756 656L768 683L772 696L777 731L779 760z&quot; mask=&quot;url(#mask-shape-1)&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;\r\n  &lt;/g&gt;\r\n&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955631/svg-masks-using-one-shapes-coordinates-to-partially-mark-another-shape","title":"SVG masks, using one shape&#39;s coordinates to partially mark another shape"},{"tags":["react-native"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":159,"user_id":9921530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a259b9f2a2b20f97eea1842f62771a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Himanshu G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9921530/himanshu-g"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568635845,"creation_date":1568635845,"answer_id":57956635,"question_id":57955628,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57956635","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\nYou are missing the package native-base from package.json but you are using it in LoginForm.js\r\n\r\n 1.

Or to necessarily be issued in strict order if you have a cache and are using RAC. Still, your approach would potentially waste a lot of values for no reason, and it doesn&#39;t need to be that complicated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955591/how-to-handle-auto-increment-sequence-on-dup-val-on-index-oracle-sql/57955813#57955813","title":"How to handle auto increment sequence on dup_val_on_index oracle sql"}],"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":1305226,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/898cbf671a6a1729a9d6f6cc7f1ba925?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Buddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1305226/buddy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57955813,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568633604,"creation_date":1568632290,"question_id":57955591,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955591","body_markdown":"I have an oracle table which has\r\n\r\n1.

Trim the leading space that is added\r\n\r\nThe code is:\r\n\r\n    SELECT  start_hr, Start_min, LTRIM(CONVERT(VARCHAR(12), CONVERT( TIME, CONCAT(start_hr, &#39;:&#39;, Start_min)), 22)) AS Output\r\n      FROM  #DateTime_Table\r\n\r\nThis outputs:\r\n\r\n    start_hr Start_min Output\r\n    -------- --------- ------------\r\n    9        45        9:45:00 AM\r\n    13       25        1:25:00 PM\r\n    19       52        7:52:00 PM\r\n    23       12        11:12:00 PM\r\n\r\nIf you are **desperate to get rid of the seconds** you need to add a fifth step:\r\n\r\n  5. Extract the parts of the output string you want\r\n\r\nThe code for this a little bit more:\r\n\r\n    SELECT  start_hr,\r\n    \t\tStart_min,\r\n    \t\tCONCAT(LEFT(Output, LEN(Output) - 6), RIGHT(Output, 3)) AS Output\r\n      FROM\t(\r\n    \t\tSELECT  start_hr, Start_min, LTRIM(CONVERT(VARCHAR(12), CONVERT( TIME, CONCAT(start_hr, &#39;:&#39;, Start_min)), 22)) AS Output\r\n    \t\t  FROM  #DateTime_Table\r\n    \t\t) a\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    start_hr Start_min Output\r\n    -------- --------- ---------------\r\n    9        45        9:45 AM\r\n    13       25        1:25 PM\r\n    19       52        7:52 PM\r\n    23       12        11:12 PM\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955587/conversion-query/57955884#57955884","title":"Conversion Query"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1721,"user_id":9517769,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a61b863eebac587a8f4215338170897?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xXx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9517769/xxx"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568633692,"creation_date":1568633692,"answer_id":57955980,"question_id":57955587,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57955980","body_markdown":"Your query can be like below :\r\n\r\n    select CAST(CONCAT(CONCAT(CAST(Start_hr as varchar),&#39;:&#39;), Start_min) as time)\r\n                  FROM DateTime_Table\r\n\r\nCheck result here : [sqlfiddle][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!18/085c2/5","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955587/conversion-query/57955980#57955980","title":"Conversion Query"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12013812,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4SDeII04opo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfA6l6CNyo0UBKAzgEP9UxFeJOybw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vignesh S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12013812/vignesh-s"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8000,"user_id":2169762,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nns8w.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2169762/martin"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57955878,"answer_count":4,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568641085,"creation_date":1568632281,"last_edit_date":1568632554,"question_id":57955587,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955587","body_markdown":"I have a Table with 2 columns \r\n\r\n    1. start_hr as smallint\r\n    2.

All the documentation seems to point to a resource value of &quot;me/drives/root&quot;, however with app only access a my site is not defined and so the call fails.\r\n\r\nThese are the different values for resource that I have tried within the request json body\r\n```\r\ndrives(&#39;DRIVE-ID&#39;)/root\r\ndrives/DRIVE-ID/root\r\nDRIVE-ID\r\ndrive/DRIVE-ID\r\ndrive/DRIVE-ID/root\r\nme/drive(&quot;DRIVE-ID&quot;)/root\r\nDRIVE-ITEM-ID-FOR-ROOT\r\n```\r\n\r\nDifferent documentation seems to point to different subscription endpoints.

I downloaded it form git like this: \r\n\r\n    npm i rhalff/angular2-json-schema-form#angular-8\r\n\r\nWhen I started to build my project with this dependency and after attach the import into `app.module.ts` the result is like this:\r\n\r\n    ERROR in src/app/app.module.ts:20:65 - error TS2307: Cannot find module &#39;angular2-json-schema-form&#39;.\r\n\r\nI found that in `node_module` there isn&#39;t any src or dist folder and then I looked into github projecet and I found that in `/.npmignore` there is a src. \r\n\r\nI have a some solution about that, but it&#39;s not the final one and I think is really bad idea. \r\nI will locally clone git repository, next then build it with `npm run build` and then `npm link` \r\nand then `npm link &lt;someName&gt;` in project catalog.\r\n\r\nCan anyone know is there any solution of this problem or maybe someone can suggest me any other libraries for converting JSON Schema for Angular 8 forms?  \r\n \r\n  [1]: https://github.com/dschnelldavis/angular2-json-schema-form\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/rhalff/angular2-json-schema-form/tree/angular-8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955542/dynamically-create-forms-from-json-schema-angular-8","title":"Dynamically create forms from JSON Schema [Angular 8]"},{"tags":["kubernetes","etcd"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12073292,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD3dWuIOq5h21oRYvFXiVdjRFkIX-0Ap-UG8JHT=k-s128","display_name":"Utkarsh Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12073292/utkarsh-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1093,"user_id":5720818,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w1Nhei-1Emk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAkk/wwpYz4kCvb8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yasen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5720818/yasen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568636126,"creation_date":1568632133,"last_edit_date":1568636126,"question_id":57955541,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955541","body_markdown":"I have a Stacked master K8s cluster (`etcd` is also local/internal) with three master and 9 worker nodes.\r\nAnd my cluster version is currently `1.12.3`, while going through `etcd` commands, i tried listing the `etcd` member, executing \r\n```sh\r\nETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl member list\r\n```\r\n, and found that the client Url&#39;s of master2 and master3 is wrong. \r\n\r\nBelow is the image,\r\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9C5Kx.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per my understanding ip for peers and client should be same, but as I can  see IP is `127.0.0.1` in case of `master2` and `master3`.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I check the endpoint status I get below error as,\r\n\r\n&gt;

Prot&#233;g&#233; uses the OWL 2 Manchester syntax to describe classes, and Prot&#233;g&#233; assumes that ontologies are interpreted according to the [OWL 2 Direct Semantics][1]. If the property `hasRestriction` is a DataProperty in Prot&#233;g&#233;, then it means that `hasRestriction` denotes a set of pairs (*x*,*y*) where *x* is an individual (an element of the universe of discourse) and *y* is a data value (like a number, a string, a date). In Prot&#233;g&#233;, class expressions are used to denote sets of individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the statements you provide there are three class expressions:\r\n\r\n    hasRestriction value 2   \r\n    hasRestriction exactly 2  \r\n    hasRestriction only 2\r\n\r\nThe first one, `hasRestriction value 2`, identifies the set of things that have the property `hasRestriction` with the value 2. So if *x* belongs to this class, then (*x*, 2) belongs to what `hasRestriction` denotes. If `A` is a subClass of this class, then a triple `x rdf:type A` entails the triple `x hasRestriction 2`.\r\n\r\nThe second one, `hasRestriction exactly 2`, identifies the set of things that have exactly 2 values for the property `hasRestriction`. So if *x* belongs to this class, then there are two distinct values *v* and *w* such that (*x*, *v*) and (*x*,*w*) belong to what `hasRestriction` denotes. If `A` is a subClass of this class, then a triple `x rdf:type A` entails the triples `x hasRestriction _:v` and `x hasRestriction _:w` and `_:v owl:differentFrom _:w` (I use a quasi-Turtle syntax here).\r\n\r\nThe third one, `hasRestriction only 2` is a syntax error because if `hasRestriction` is a datatype property, then you must use a datatype expression after the keyword `only`. For instance, `hasRestriction only xsd:integer`.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, a given individual `x` in class `A` may have known values for the property `hasRestriction`. For instance, there could be the triples `x rdf:type A`, `x hasRestriction 1`, `x hasRestriction 2`, in which case, we know that `x` exactly has 1 and 2 as values for `hasRestriction`. If, additionally, we know that `x hasRestriction 3`, then there is a contradiction, because 1, 2 and 3 are three distinct values, while the expression tells us that there must be *exactly* two.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-direct-semantics/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955538/owl-restrictions-value-vs-only-vs-exactly-on-dataproperty/57981535#57981535","title":"OWL restrictions value vs only vs exactly on dataProperty"}],"owner":{"reputation":1949,"user_id":4061644,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TE2xobyDBX0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/3cZ5A2tEarE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"alex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4061644/alex"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4182,"user_id":1260887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a483284b031ca9aa017bc32e78451f10?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Antoine Zimmermann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1260887/antoine-zimmermann"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57981535,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568751552,"creation_date":1568632116,"last_edit_date":1568718407,"question_id":57955538,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955538","body_markdown":"Suppose we have a class named `A`, and a **DataProperty** called `hasRestriction`.

as I thought, it was something stupid, and not at all connected to VAO binding and such.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, when I create VBO initially, I do it like this:\r\n\r\n    // Vertices VBO generation\r\n            vboID = glGenBuffers();\r\n            vboIDList.add(vboID);\r\n            verticesBuffer = MemoryUtil.memAllocFloat(size * 3);        // !!! Must Be manually freed!\r\n            verticesBuffer.put(vertex).flip();\r\n            glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vboID);\r\n            glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, verticesBuffer, GL_STATIC_DRAW);\r\n            glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, false, 0, 0);\r\n            vertexAttrArrCount += 1;\r\n\r\nI assumed that because I allocate buffer for size*3 floats, it will be of that size, and when I put it in the VBO - it will allocate size*3*4 bytes, i.e. enough for size*3 floats.\r\n\r\nTurns out Nope! Because I put only one vertex (3 floats) into the buffer - it will allocate only that ammount of space. So when I later try to use glBufferSubData - it only has spaces for 3 floats on the GPU, and naturally doesn&#39;t put the values where I need them. I&#39;m actually surprised it doesn&#39;t flat-out crash on me.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, at the moment I did this instead:\r\n\r\n    // Vertices VBO generation\r\n            ...\r\n            verticesBuffer.put(vertex).put(new float[size*3 - 3]).flip();\r\n            ...\r\n\r\nSo basically I&#39;m manually putting an empty array into the FloatBuffer, and that ensures that the buffer is the right size.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the result:\r\nConstructor:\r\n\r\n    public Mesh(float[] vertex, int size)\r\n    {\r\n        texture = null;\r\n        meshType = 1;           //will draw lines\r\n\r\n        FloatBuffer verticesBuffer = null;\r\n        IntBuffer indicesBuffer = null;\r\n        int vboID;\r\n\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            vertexCount = size;\r\n\r\n            vaoID = glGenVertexArrays();\r\n            glBindVertexArray(vaoID);\r\n\r\n            vboIDList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n            // Vertices VBO generation\r\n            vboID = glGenBuffers();\r\n            vboIDList.add(vboID);\r\n            verticesBuffer = MemoryUtil.memAllocFloat(size * 3);        // !!!

I am actually creating library management project and the main feature is to reserve books from the library. Page I am implementing right know is the search page, user should be allowed to search the books and the data should be represented to him in a table with a search bar on top and search button next to search bar. Books need to searched by author after typing three letters and books in the table should be filtered and showed as user is typing. I know i need service which i already created. I know i need two separate components one for search(so i can use it to search users afterwards) and one for the table(grid) or whatever. Now my question is what do i need to have in a components? How can i take the data and display it in a table? and How can i search through and how can i apply filters.\r\n\r\nThis is what i created so far: \r\n\r\nsearch-books.service.ts\r\n```\r\nimport { Injectable } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\nimport { Http } from &#39;@angular/http&#39;;\r\nimport { Observable } from &#39;rxjs/Observable&#39;;\r\nimport { environment } from &#39;../environment&#39;;\r\nimport { Book } from &#39;../model/book&#39;;\r\n\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\n\r\nexport class SearchBooksService {\r\n\r\n    public url = environment.serverUrl + &#39;/api/books&#39;;\r\n\r\n    constructor(private http: Http) { }\r\n\r\n    getBooks(): Observable&lt;any&gt; {\r\n        return this.http.get(this.url);\r\n    }\r\n}   \r\n```\r\nsearch-books.component.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\nimport { Router } from &#39;@angular/router&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { SearchBooksService } from &#39;../service/search-books.service&#39;;\r\nimport { Book } from &#39;../model/book&#39;;\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    templateUrl: &#39;./app/search-books/search-books.component.html&#39;\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class SearchBooksComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n    books: Book[] = [];\r\n    loading = false;\r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        private router: Router,\r\n        private service: SearchBooksService\r\n    ) { }\r\n\r\n    ngOnInit() {\r\n        this.service.getBooks().subscribe(\r\n            data =&gt; {\r\n                this.books = data.json();\r\n            },\r\n            error =&gt; {\r\n                console.error(error);\r\n            },\r\n            () =&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            //on success\r\n            console.log(this.books);\r\n        }\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand i have search-books.component.html as an empty html so far. \r\n\r\nWhen tested component is working fine i have all the data needed in the ``console.log(this.books)`` this is working fine. How to proceed and how to create those components and that search and table. Please help, and thank you in advance to everyone !
