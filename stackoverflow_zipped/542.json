Using Azure Application Insights we detected many responses with response code 500(Internal server error) without any Exception associated with them in Application Insights. During debugging session we did not encounter any Exception thrown.\r\n\r\nWe had a suspicion that this could be caused by client disconnects. After implementing a .net application simulating disconnects, we could replicate this issue even on a clean webapi2 project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation we found out, that the result code 500(after the client is disconnected) occurs only when specific conditions are met. The request need to be cancelled on a non GET http operation and before `ExecuteRequestHandler` asp.net event is reached. On GET requests we cannot replicate this issue, neither on requests which entered or passed the `ExecuteRequestHandler` event.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to filter out client disconnects from logs and focus on real issues.\r\n\r\nThis issue may be related to [ASP.NET Web API OperationCanceledException when browser cancels the request][1], however the accepted solution does not work, because the disconnect occurs before any DelegatingHandler is reached. We would not use the mentioned solution, because client disconnects is not a Server issue but rather a client. For example in netcore the cancelled requests have response code 0 in logs. Anyway, the client will not see the result nor the result code because it is already gone.\r\n\r\nOther [possibly related question][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are using the latest version Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi v5.2.7 and the investigation take place only on a development machine with IISExpress.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nIncluding the minimal code to reproduce on clean webapi2 project.\r\n\r\nGlobal.asax.cs\r\n```cs\r\npublic class WebApiApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication\r\n{\r\n\tprotected void Application_Start()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tGlobalConfiguration.Configure(WebApiConfig.Register);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprotected void Application_EndRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar context = HttpContext.Current;\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine($&quot;{context.Response.StatusCode}:{context.Response.SubStatusCode}:{context.Request.Path}:{context.Request.Url.AbsoluteUri}&quot;);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHomeController.cs\r\n```cs\r\n[RoutePrefix(&quot;api/foo&quot;)]\r\npublic class HomeController : ApiController\r\n{\r\n\t[Route(&quot;bar&quot;)]\r\n\t[HttpPut]\r\n\tpublic async Task&lt;IHttpActionResult&gt; Put()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tawait Task.Delay(200);\r\n\t\treturn Ok();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt;PUT http://localhost:56952/api/foo/bar\r\n\r\nOn average 1 of 5 cancelled requests end with 500 when cancelled after 10ms. The response code is accessible from &lt;strike&gt;server logs&lt;/strike&gt; Application Insights or  Output Window in VS when logged. The client will not receive the response code, because the connection is closed before any response code is returned.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2**\r\n\r\nTelemetry from Application

noob here. Please bear with me for the long post, I am trying to include most of the information.\r\n\r\nI have the following document structure (includes only relevant fields) for a single order, and there are many orders like this which I export from an SQL database.\r\n\r\n**From these documents, I want to find out the frequently brought together items for a given `product_id`. where `product_id` is a field nested inside `order_summary-&gt;products`**\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;5d9de7fbbcd759252825b182&quot;,\r\n      &quot;order_id&quot;: 100000,\r\n      &quot;user_id&quot;: 9425,\r\n      &quot;order_summary&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;products&quot;: [\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;name&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;en&quot;: &quot;Product A&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;price&quot;: &quot;2.400&quot;,\r\n            &quot;quantity&quot;: 2,\r\n            &quot;product_id&quot;: 100,\r\n            &quot;variant_id&quot;: 98\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;name&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;en&quot;: &quot;Product B&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;price&quot;: &quot;3.900&quot;,\r\n            &quot;quantity&quot;: 1,\r\n            &quot;product_id&quot;: 401,\r\n            &quot;variant_id&quot;: 395\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;total&quot;: &quot;16.895&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBasically I would like to achieve the following\r\n\r\n - Given a product id -&gt; get all the orders contains that product_id\r\n - From the orders take all the other product_ids in those orders\r\n - group the `product_id` together with `sum` of the quantity\r\n - return the result set ordered by the `sum` of quantity\r\n\r\nI was successful querying Mongo DB on the root fields, But when it comes to querying the nested fields I am getting null (Probably an error internally) most of the time. \r\n\r\nSo far I was able to set up the following, but the result is not exactly what I want\r\n\r\n    MongoClient.connect(url, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true }, function (err, client) {\r\n        assert.equal(null, err);\r\n    \r\n        const db = client.db(dbName);\r\n    \r\n        orderCollection = db.collection(&#39;orders&#39;);\r\n        orderCollection.aggregate([\r\n            { $match: {&quot;order_summary.products.product_id&quot;: 100} }, // 100 is the product_id I want to match with\r\n            { $group: { \r\n                _id: &quot;$order_summary.products.product_id&quot;, \r\n                total: {$sum: &quot;$order_summary.products.quantity&quot;}\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n        ]).toArray(function (err, docs) {\r\n         \r\n            console.log(&quot;Found the following records&quot;);\r\n            console.log(docs);\r\n            client.close();\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThe result I get\r\n\r\n    Found the following records\r\n    [\r\n      { _id: [ 100, 937 ], total: 0 },\r\n      { _id: [ 70, 100, 209, 1338, 8572 ], total: 0 },\r\n      { _id: [ 100, 401, 754 ], total: 0 },\r\n      { _id: [ 100, 401, 705, 8134 ], total: 0 },\r\n      { _id: [ 100, 705, 942 ], total: 0 },\r\n      { _id: [ 100, 670 ], total: 0 }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nThe Result I expect\r\n\r\n    [\r\n      {_id: 100, total: 150},\r\n      {_id: 70, total: 140},\r\n      {_id: 401, total: 135},\r\n      .....\r\n      {_id: 670, total: 1},\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nI am using `mongodb&quot;: &quot;^3.3.2`, Javascript client and mongodb `MongoDB 4.0.12 Community, Let me know if any more information needs to be

IDs are by their nature required to be unique. Within the handler, use `this` so you know which element the event targeted, and from that find the tooltip:\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n      $(document).on(&quot;mouseover&quot;, &quot;.datapoint&quot;, function() {\r\n        $(this).nextAll(&quot;.tooltip&quot;).show();\r\n      });\r\n      $(document).on(&quot;mouseleave&quot;, &quot;.datapoint&quot;, function() {\r\n        $(this).nextAll(&quot;.tooltip&quot;).hide();\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\nLive Example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language:

Since you didn&#39;t give explicit values for the lifetime `&#39;a`, the compiler will assume that the `Foo` as the `HashMap` value and `element` `Foo` will have different lifetimes `&#39;a`. This approach works well in general.\r\n\r\nHowever, you want to actually insert `element` into `map` which requires\r\nmatching lifetimes. The compiler rejects your code since the lifetimes do not\r\nmatch. You need to be explicit about the lifetimes of the `x` inside `Foo`, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Verbose.\r\nfn add_to_map&lt;&#39;l&gt;(map: &amp;&#39;l mut HashMap&lt;u32, &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;&gt;,  element : &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;) \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou do not _need_ to give an explicit lifetime of `map` itself since the compiler can verify at the callsite that `map` lives at least as long as `element`,\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Slightly less verbose.\r\nfn add_to_map&lt;&#39;l&gt;(map: &amp;mut HashMap&lt;u32, &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;&gt;,  element : &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;) \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in any case `map` needs to be `mut` in `add_to_map`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411395/passing-variables-to-function-and-lifetime/58411787#58411787","title":"Passing variables to function and lifetime"}],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":5613164,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/959533824107532/picture?type=large","display_name":"Michał Hanusek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5613164/micha%c5%82-hanusek"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571224259,"creation_date":1571222459,"question_id":58411395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411395","body_markdown":"I want passing **HashMap** and element - **Foo** to my **function**. \r\nI don&#39;t understand variables lifetimes.

If i choose a good Comparator, the version with the shorter path (or, if equal, the longer prev list) will be pulled first.

problem comes as you are using same id for both buttons in both modals. `document.getElementById` search for a unique element with that id in the whole document, and in result it just returns first element in HTML with that id.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to use unique id in HTML elements\r\n\r\n&gt; If the id value is not the empty string, it must be unique in a\r\n&gt; document.\r\n\r\n Check this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/id\r\n\r\nBut if you want to stay with repeating ids, you should look for that element from the children in the modal div element.

The second box however, for some reason  doesn&#39;t close after clicking on the OK button.

I&#39;m not an experienced html programmer and whatever the bug is, I just couldn&#39;t find it.

We provide these new CA certificates as an AWS security best practice. For information about the new certificates and the supported AWS Regions, see Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance.\r\n\r\n&gt; The current CA certificates expire on March 5, 2020. Therefore, we strongly recommend completing this change as soon as possible (and no later than February 5, 2020), to avoid disruption on the expiration date. If the change is not completed, your applications will fail to connect to your RDS DB instances using SSL/TLS after March 5, 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Before you update your DB instances to use the new CA certificate, **make sure that you update your clients or applications connecting to your RDS databases**.\r\n\r\n[Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate][1]\r\n[Download Certificate][2]\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n&gt; To update your CA certificate\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. Download the new SSL/TLS certificate from Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a\r\n&gt; Connection to a DB Instance.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2. Update your database applications to use the new SSL/TLS certificate.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 3. Modify the DB instance to change the CA from rds-ca-2015 to\r\n&gt; rds-ca-2019.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; You can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to change the CA\r\n&gt; certificate from rds-ca-2015 to rds-ca-2019 for a DB instance.\r\n\r\nMy question is: do I need to add [rds-ca-2019-root.pem][3] to the glassfish keystore before I apply step 3. and do I need to do anything to MySQL workbench 6.2 so it keeps connecting to db intance?\r\n\r\nNote: Regarding how, in case the answer is yes.

QSslSocket::connectToHostEncrypted: TLS initialization failed\r\n\r\nwhich is the result of the OpenSSL libary not being included in the binary as a dependency. So basically, adding a static OpenSSL library to the project file does not work or I am doing something incorrectly somewhere down the line.\r\n\r\n**Note 4:** \r\nWhy isn&#39;t the question titled: **How to Import a static library into Qt?**\r\n\r\n*Importing a static library is straight forward and not complicated. I am assuming I have made a mistake somewhere in the static compilation of Qt with SSL support enabled.* \r\n\r\nAdvice on solving this problem would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n#Update 1\r\n\r\nI have resolved the problem with `-openssl-linked`. The cause (or fix rather) is to not install OpenSSL to your machine. Rather, extract the `.a` &amp; `include` directries into a seperate directory. So everything is the same with exception of you having the `lib`s &amp; `include` without installing. \r\n\r\nThen use the standard configureation (mentioned above), replacing `-openssl` with `-openssl-linked` and you should have a successful compile.\r\n\r\n**Updated Problem**\r\n\r\nWhen building &amp; running my application with the new *Linked OpenSSL Qt kit*, I get a message saying:\r\n\r\n&gt; The code execution cannot proceed because libcrypto.dll was  not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.\r\n\r\nFollowed by another dialog\r\n\r\n&gt; The code execution cannot proceed because libssl.dll was  not found.

It would be great if I could use the same fixture to test the view too.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411309/unit-testing-a-function-which-consumes-request-from-django-rest-api-view","title":"Unit testing a function which consumes request from django rest api view"},{"tags":["controller","sdn","mininet","pox"],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":3847560,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001086580314/picture?type=large","display_name":"Pallavi Choudhary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3847560/pallavi-choudhary"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571222192,"creation_date":1571222192,"question_id":58411308,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411308","body_markdown":"I want to calculate bandwidth of the flow when the FlowRemoved message is send by the switch to the controller.

As a secondary bitmap would be indicated by the first bit of the primary bitmap being set and you explicitly disable the secondary bitmap in the options this is not the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the rest of the problems arise from the parser interpreting the next 8 bytes as the secondary bitmap and shifting things around:\r\n\r\n    0210723A40010AE180020050009900000007500010021026360...\r\n                        ----------------\r\n\r\nField #2 is now ( just guessing ) being interpreted as a 50 char (BCD) field starting with 0010021 ...:\r\n\r\n    0210723A40010AE180020050009900000007500010021026360...\r\n                                        ------------&gt;  ...\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe there are things going on that aren&#39;t mentioned in the post.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411295/converting-a-hex-encoded-iso-8583-message-to-json-using-node-js/58430123#58430123","title":"Converting a hex encoded iso 8583 message to json using node js"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4506033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pNsqPfotDRA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF4/s_VY0mrSaHg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Hendri Sildrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4506033/hendri-sildrian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5708,"user_id":592958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVNmU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"phuzi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/592958/phuzi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571308353,"creation_date":1571222159,"last_edit_date":1571307283,"question_id":58411295,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411295","body_markdown":"I am using this library: https://github.com/zemuldo/iso_8583 to try parse and dump an ISO 8583 message.\r\n\r\nThe **code**: \r\n\r\n    var bitMapData = &#39;0210723A40010AE18002005000990000000750001002102636000000172636100210036014045016000042 (i&#39;am using this library https://github.com/zemuldo/iso_8583)667818001               000000000TS0002tester                                  0490823 75551512000000075000000000010051003915030257360006133001&#39;;\r\n\r\n    const config = {\r\n        lenHeader: false, \r\n        lenHeaderEncoding: &#39;utf8&#39;, \r\n        bitmapEncoding: &#39;utf8&#39;, \r\n        secondaryBitmap: false, \r\n        hasSpecialFields: true,\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    let incoming = new Iso_8583().getIsoJSON(\r\n        new Buffer.alloc(bitMapData.length, bitMapData),\r\n        config\r\n        );\r\n                \r\n    console.log(incoming)\r\n\r\n**result of code**:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    {   \r\n        \t&#39;0&#39;: &#39;0210&#39;,   \r\n        \t&#39;2&#39;: &#39;00100210263600000017263610021003601404501600004266&#39;,   \r\n        \t&#39;3&#39;: &#39;781800&#39;, \r\n        \t&#39;4&#39;: &#39;1&#39;,   \r\n        \t&#39;7&#39;: &#39;

The images stick nicely, roll up and down, I&#180;m happy. Also clicking the relevant section in the navigation smooth-scrolls me where I want- until I use Firefox. Starting from top of the page going down the links/ section-anchor works perfectly.\r\nBut when I want to navigate back to the title or a section above, it does nothing (scrolling back manually to the top - no problem). I tested Chrome and Opera, no issues at all.\r\nThis seems to be related with the position:sticky of the section, as for it works &quot;normal&quot; with not positioning the sections.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have experience with that? Is this fixable without `JS` (although I know time will come when I have to make friends with it...)?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nUli\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411275/section-navigation-doesn%c2%b4t-work-with-firefox","title":"section navigation doesn&#180;t work with firefox"},{"tags":["angular","parameters","routing","angular8","check-constraints"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1654,"user_id":4604645,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQczD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"The Fabio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604645/the-fabio"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571223360,"creation_date":1571223360,"answer_id":58411669,"question_id":58411273,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58411669","body_markdown":"The way to restrain navigation is by the use of angular Guards, I would suggest you start with a [CanActivate guard][1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  path: &#39;post/:id&#39;,\r\n  component: PostComponent,\r\n  resolve: {resolver: Resolver}},\r\n  canActivate: [CanActivateId]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the Guard can be (for starters just ids which are less then 10 as an example):\r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\nclass CanActivateId implements CanActivate {\r\n  constructor() {}\r\n\r\n  canActivate(\r\n    route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,\r\n    state: RouterStateSnapshot\r\n  ): Observable&lt;boolean|UrlTree&gt;|Promise&lt;boolean|UrlTree&gt;|boolean|UrlTree {\r\n    return route.params.id &gt; 10;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411273/how-to-set-constraints-in-angular-8-routing-with-parameters/58411669#58411669","title":"How to set constraints in Angular 8 routing with parameters"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11272101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb63584f871d8782e8d2a5dc18e7751e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11272101/rumi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1654,"user_id":4604645,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQczD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"The Fabio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604645/the-fabio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571224097,"creation_date":1571222101,"last_edit_date":1571224097,"question_id":58411273,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411273","body_markdown":"I&#39;m setting up routes with parameters in my web application with Angular.

found\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can think of a fairly complicated compat solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nord(s[1]) if (type(s[1]) == type(&quot;str&quot;)) else s[1] # 50 in both Python 2 and 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n... but may be there&#39;s an easier way which I just don&#39;t

String for console output and for HTML output are two VERY different tasks. Method `setPrettyPrinting()` is for console printing. HTML browser will ignore &quot;\\n&quot; symbols and will not respect multiple spaces replacing them with a single space etc. In general, it is usually a client-side task to format the output. But I delt once with this problem and wrote a method that takes a console-formatted string and converts it to Html formatted String. For instance, it replaces all &quot;\\n&quot; symbols with **br** Html tags. It does some other things as well. I had some success with it, but sometimes some unexpected problems occurred. You are welcome to use it. The method is available in MgntUtils Open source library. Here is its [JavaDoc][1].

Do objects get passed by reference when returning them like I am doing in my service. \r\n\r\n\r\nCould someone recommend a better way to implement this","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411254/shared-service-is-passing-object-by-reference","title":"Shared service is passing object by

(It does no longer use the SRAM, but whatever floats my boat)\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint CAN_message_receive(can_message* message)\r\n{\r\n\r\n\tstatic can_message buffers[CAN_MESSAGE_UNIQUE_IDS];\r\n\tstatic int birth = 1;\r\n\tif(birth)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tfor (int i; i &lt; CAN_MESSAGE_UNIQUE_IDS*10; i++)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t*(char*)(0x18FF+i) = 0;\r\n\t\t\tprintf(&quot;buffers: %X\\n&quot;, &amp;buffers[i]);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tbirth = 0;\r\n\t}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411240/struct-memory-allocation-issues-for-message-buffer","title":"Struct memory allocation issues for message buffer"},{"tags":["wso2","mqtt"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12225836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAd0gHw4oWulCLJC0RgNxWNfhNDOXGxy1oM2jDGhg=k-s128","display_name":"Rizwan KD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12225836/rizwan-kd"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571221976,"creation_date":1571221976,"question_id":58411238,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411238","body_markdown":"I am using wso2mb-3.2.0 version.

Using Azure Application Insights we detected many responses with response code 500(Internal server error) without any Exception associated with them in Application Insights. During debugging session we did not encounter any Exception thrown.\r\n\r\nWe had a suspicion that this could be caused by client disconnects. After implementing a .net application simulating disconnects, we could replicate this issue even on a clean webapi2 project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation we found out, that the result code 500(after the client is disconnected) occurs only when specific conditions are met. The request need to be cancelled on a non GET http operation and before `ExecuteRequestHandler` asp.net event is reached. On GET requests we cannot replicate this issue, neither on requests which entered or passed the `ExecuteRequestHandler` event.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to filter out client disconnects from logs and focus on real issues.\r\n\r\nThis issue may be related to [ASP.NET Web API OperationCanceledException when browser cancels the request][1], however the accepted solution does not work, because the disconnect occurs before any DelegatingHandler is reached. We would not use the mentioned solution, because client disconnects is not a Server issue but rather a client. For example in netcore the cancelled requests have response code 0 in logs. Anyway, the client will not see the result nor the result code because it is already gone.\r\n\r\nOther [possibly related question][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are using the latest version Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi v5.2.7 and the investigation take place only on a development machine with IISExpress.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nIncluding the minimal code to reproduce on clean webapi2 project.\r\n\r\nGlobal.asax.cs\r\n```cs\r\npublic class WebApiApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication\r\n{\r\n\tprotected void Application_Start()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tGlobalConfiguration.Configure(WebApiConfig.Register);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprotected void Application_EndRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar context = HttpContext.Current;\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine($&quot;{context.Response.StatusCode}:{context.Response.SubStatusCode}:{context.Request.Path}:{context.Request.Url.AbsoluteUri}&quot;);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHomeController.cs\r\n```cs\r\n[RoutePrefix(&quot;api/foo&quot;)]\r\npublic class HomeController : ApiController\r\n{\r\n\t[Route(&quot;bar&quot;)]\r\n\t[HttpPut]\r\n\tpublic async Task&lt;IHttpActionResult&gt; Put()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tawait Task.Delay(200);\r\n\t\treturn Ok();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt;PUT http://localhost:56952/api/foo/bar\r\n\r\nOn average 1 of 5 cancelled requests end with 500 when cancelled after 10ms.

noob here. Please bear with me for the long post, I am trying to include most of the information.\r\n\r\nI have the following document structure (includes only relevant fields) for a single order, and there are many orders like this which I export from an SQL database.\r\n\r\n**From these documents, I want to find out the frequently brought together items for a given `product_id`. where `product_id` is a field nested inside `order_summary-&gt;products`**\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;5d9de7fbbcd759252825b182&quot;,\r\n      &quot;order_id&quot;: 100000,\r\n      &quot;user_id&quot;: 9425,\r\n      &quot;order_summary&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;products&quot;: [\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;name&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;en&quot;: &quot;Product A&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;price&quot;: &quot;2.400&quot;,\r\n            &quot;quantity&quot;: 2,\r\n            &quot;product_id&quot;: 100,\r\n            &quot;variant_id&quot;: 98\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;name&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;en&quot;: &quot;Product B&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;price&quot;: &quot;3.900&quot;,\r\n            &quot;quantity&quot;: 1,\r\n            &quot;product_id&quot;: 401,\r\n            &quot;variant_id&quot;: 395\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;total&quot;: &quot;16.895&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBasically I would like to achieve the following\r\n\r\n - Given a product id -&gt; get all the orders contains that product_id\r\n - From the orders take all the other product_ids in those orders\r\n - group the `product_id` together with `sum` of the quantity\r\n - return the result set ordered by the `sum` of quantity\r\n\r\nI was successful querying Mongo DB on the root fields, But when it comes to querying the nested fields I am getting null (Probably an error internally) most of the time. \r\n\r\nSo far I was able to set up the following, but the result is not exactly what I want\r\n\r\n    MongoClient.connect(url, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true }, function (err, client) {\r\n        assert.equal(null, err);\r\n    \r\n        const db = client.db(dbName);\r\n    \r\n        orderCollection = db.collection(&#39;orders&#39;);\r\n        orderCollection.aggregate([\r\n            { $match: {&quot;order_summary.products.product_id&quot;: 100} }, // 100 is the product_id I want to match with\r\n            { $group: { \r\n                _id:

IDs are by their nature required to be unique. Within the handler, use `this` so you know which element the event targeted, and from that find the tooltip:\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n      $(document).on(&quot;mouseover&quot;, &quot;.datapoint&quot;, function() {\r\n        $(this).nextAll(&quot;.tooltip&quot;).show();\r\n      });\r\n      $(document).on(&quot;mouseleave&quot;, &quot;.datapoint&quot;, function() {\r\n        $(this).nextAll(&quot;.tooltip&quot;).hide();\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\nLive Example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language:

types are declared with different lifetimes...\r\n10\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Foo&lt;&#39;a&gt;` appears twice here (`&#39;a` is the lifetime of `x` inside `Foo`). Since you didn&#39;t give explicit values for the lifetime `&#39;a`, the compiler will assume that the `Foo` as the `HashMap` value and `element` `Foo` will have different lifetimes `&#39;a`. This approach works well in general.\r\n\r\nHowever, you want to actually insert `element` into `map` which requires\r\nmatching lifetimes. The compiler rejects your code since the lifetimes do not\r\nmatch. You need to be explicit about the lifetimes of the `x` inside `Foo`, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Verbose.\r\nfn add_to_map&lt;&#39;l&gt;(map: &amp;&#39;l mut HashMap&lt;u32, &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;&gt;,  element : &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;) \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou do not _need_ to give an explicit lifetime of `map` itself since the compiler can verify at the callsite that `map` lives at least as long as `element`,\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Slightly less verbose.\r\nfn add_to_map&lt;&#39;l&gt;(map: &amp;mut HashMap&lt;u32, &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;&gt;,  element : &amp;&#39;l Foo&lt;&#39;l&gt;) \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in any case `map` needs to be `mut` in `add_to_map`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411395/passing-variables-to-function-and-lifetime/58411787#58411787","title":"Passing variables to function and lifetime"}],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":5613164,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/959533824107532/picture?type=large","display_name":"Michał Hanusek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5613164/micha%c5%82-hanusek"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571224259,"creation_date":1571222459,"question_id":58411395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411395","body_markdown":"I want passing **HashMap** and element - **Foo** to my **function**. \r\nI don&#39;t understand variables lifetimes.

In line 20, you create a new list containing only u. Additionally (perhaps between 17 and 18), if alt == dist[v], you add u to prev[v]. As this pseudocode does not stop when v == target, you should find all shortest paths.\r\n\r\nConcerning the priority queue, there is the problem that you gain time by adding a v to Q, but if you change a v, you have to find it in the middle of Q (slow), removing it there (slow) and add the changed version. There are data structures that do that process faster. I use priority queues, but i do not remove changed vertices. I add changed vertices without removing their old versions. If i choose a good Comparator, the version with the shorter path (or, if equal, the longer prev list) will be pulled first. So i have to test all u from Q for being visited; if yes, i can throw u away.

problem comes as you are using same id for both buttons in both modals. `document.getElementById` search for a unique element with that id in the whole document, and in result it just returns first element in HTML with that id.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to use unique id in HTML elements\r\n\r\n&gt; If the id value is not the empty string, it must be unique in a\r\n&gt; document.\r\n\r\n Check this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/id\r\n\r\nBut if you want to stay with repeating ids, you should look for that element from the children in the modal div element.

The second box however, for some reason  doesn&#39;t close after clicking on the OK button.

I&#39;m not an experienced html programmer and whatever the bug is, I just couldn&#39;t find it.

We provide these new CA certificates as an AWS security best practice. For information about the new certificates and the supported AWS Regions, see Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance.\r\n\r\n&gt; The current CA certificates expire on March 5, 2020. Therefore, we strongly recommend completing this change as soon as possible (and no later than February 5, 2020), to avoid disruption on the expiration date. If the change is not completed, your applications will fail to connect to your RDS DB instances using SSL/TLS after March 5, 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Before you update your DB instances to use the new CA certificate, **make sure that you update your clients or applications connecting to your RDS databases**.\r\n\r\n[Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate][1]\r\n[Download Certificate][2]\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n&gt; To update your CA certificate\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. Download the new SSL/TLS certificate from Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a\r\n&gt; Connection to a DB Instance.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2. Update your database applications to use the new SSL/TLS certificate.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 3. Modify the DB instance to change the CA from rds-ca-2015 to\r\n&gt; rds-ca-2019.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; You can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to change the CA\r\n&gt; certificate from rds-ca-2015 to rds-ca-2019 for a DB instance.\r\n\r\nMy question is: do I need to add [rds-ca-2019-root.pem][3] to the glassfish keystore before I apply step 3. and do I need to do anything to MySQL workbench 6.2 so it keeps connecting to db intance?\r\n\r\nNote: Regarding how, in case the answer is yes.

QSslSocket::connectToHostEncrypted: TLS initialization failed\r\n\r\nwhich is the result of the OpenSSL libary not being included in the binary as a dependency. So basically, adding a static OpenSSL library to the project file does not work or I am doing something incorrectly somewhere down the line.\r\n\r\n**Note 4:** \r\nWhy isn&#39;t the question titled: **How to Import a static library into Qt?**\r\n\r\n*Importing a static library is straight forward and not complicated. I am assuming I have made a mistake somewhere in the static compilation of Qt with SSL support enabled.* \r\n\r\nAdvice on solving this problem would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n#Update 1\r\n\r\nI have resolved the problem with `-openssl-linked`. The cause (or fix rather) is to not install OpenSSL to your machine. Rather, extract the `.a` &amp; `include` directries into a seperate directory. So everything is the same with exception of you having the `lib`s &amp; `include` without installing. \r\n\r\nThen use the standard configureation (mentioned above), replacing `-openssl` with `-openssl-linked` and you should have a successful compile.\r\n\r\n**Updated Problem**\r\n\r\nWhen building &amp; running my application with the new *Linked OpenSSL Qt kit*, I get a message saying:\r\n\r\n&gt; The code execution cannot proceed because libcrypto.dll was  not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.\r\n\r\nFollowed by another dialog\r\n\r\n&gt; The code execution cannot proceed because libssl.dll was  not found.

It would be great if I could use the same fixture to test the view too.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411309/unit-testing-a-function-which-consumes-request-from-django-rest-api-view","title":"Unit testing a function which consumes request from django rest api view"},{"tags":["controller","sdn","mininet","pox"],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":3847560,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001086580314/picture?type=large","display_name":"Pallavi Choudhary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3847560/pallavi-choudhary"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571222192,"creation_date":1571222192,"question_id":58411308,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411308","body_markdown":"I want to calculate bandwidth of the flow when the FlowRemoved message is send by the switch to the controller.

As a secondary bitmap would be indicated by the first bit of the primary bitmap being set and you explicitly disable the secondary bitmap in the options this is not the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the rest of the problems arise from the parser interpreting the next 8 bytes as the secondary bitmap and shifting things around:\r\n\r\n    0210723A40010AE180020050009900000007500010021026360...\r\n                        ----------------\r\n\r\nField #2 is now ( just guessing ) being interpreted as a 50 char (BCD) field starting with 0010021 ...:\r\n\r\n    0210723A40010AE180020050009900000007500010021026360...\r\n                                        ------------&gt;  ...\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe there are things going on that aren&#39;t mentioned in the post.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411295/converting-a-hex-encoded-iso-8583-message-to-json-using-node-js/58430123#58430123","title":"Converting a hex encoded iso 8583 message to json using node js"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4506033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pNsqPfotDRA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF4/s_VY0mrSaHg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Hendri Sildrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4506033/hendri-sildrian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5708,"user_id":592958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVNmU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"phuzi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/592958/phuzi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571308353,"creation_date":1571222159,"last_edit_date":1571307283,"question_id":58411295,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411295","body_markdown":"I am using this library: https://github.com/zemuldo/iso_8583 to try parse and dump an ISO 8583 message.\r\n\r\nThe **code**: \r\n\r\n    var bitMapData = &#39;0210723A40010AE18002005000990000000750001002102636000000172636100210036014045016000042 (i&#39;am using this library https://github.com/zemuldo/iso_8583)667818001               000000000TS0002tester                                  0490823 75551512000000075000000000010051003915030257360006133001&#39;;\r\n\r\n    const config = {\r\n        lenHeader: false, \r\n        lenHeaderEncoding: &#39;utf8&#39;, \r\n        bitmapEncoding: &#39;utf8&#39;, \r\n        secondaryBitmap: false, \r\n        hasSpecialFields: true,\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    let incoming = new Iso_8583().getIsoJSON(\r\n        new Buffer.alloc(bitMapData.length, bitMapData),\r\n        config\r\n        );\r\n                \r\n    console.log(incoming)\r\n\r\n**result of code**:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    {   \r\n        \t&#39;0&#39;: &#39;0210&#39;,   \r\n        \t&#39;2&#39;: &#39;00100210263600000017263610021003601404501600004266&#39;,   \r\n        \t&#39;3&#39;: &#39;781800&#39;, \r\n        \t&#39;4&#39;: &#39;1&#39;,   \r\n        \t&#39;7&#39;: &#39;

The images stick nicely, roll up and down, I&#180;m happy. Also clicking the relevant section in the navigation smooth-scrolls me where I want- until I use Firefox. Starting from top of the page going down the links/ section-anchor works perfectly.\r\nBut when I want to navigate back to the title or a section above, it does nothing (scrolling back manually to the top - no problem). I tested Chrome and Opera, no issues at all.\r\nThis seems to be related with the position:sticky of the section, as for it works &quot;normal&quot; with not positioning the sections.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have experience with that? Is this fixable without `JS` (although I know time will come when I have to make friends with it...)?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nUli\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411275/section-navigation-doesn%c2%b4t-work-with-firefox","title":"section navigation doesn&#180;t work with firefox"},{"tags":["angular","parameters","routing","angular8","check-constraints"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1654,"user_id":4604645,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQczD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"The Fabio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604645/the-fabio"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571223360,"creation_date":1571223360,"answer_id":58411669,"question_id":58411273,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58411669","body_markdown":"The way to restrain navigation is by the use of angular Guards, I would suggest you start with a [CanActivate guard][1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  path: &#39;post/:id&#39;,\r\n  component: PostComponent,\r\n  resolve: {resolver: Resolver}},\r\n  canActivate: [CanActivateId]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the Guard can be (for starters just ids which are less then 10 as an example):\r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\nclass CanActivateId implements CanActivate {\r\n  constructor() {}\r\n\r\n  canActivate(\r\n    route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,\r\n    state: RouterStateSnapshot\r\n  ): Observable&lt;boolean|UrlTree&gt;|Promise&lt;boolean|UrlTree&gt;|boolean|UrlTree {\r\n    return route.params.id &gt; 10;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411273/how-to-set-constraints-in-angular-8-routing-with-parameters/58411669#58411669","title":"How to set constraints in Angular 8 routing with parameters"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11272101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb63584f871d8782e8d2a5dc18e7751e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11272101/rumi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1654,"user_id":4604645,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQczD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"The Fabio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604645/the-fabio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571224097,"creation_date":1571222101,"last_edit_date":1571224097,"question_id":58411273,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411273","body_markdown":"I&#39;m setting up routes with parameters in my web application with Angular.

found\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can think of a fairly complicated compat solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nord(s[1]) if (type(s[1]) == type(&quot;str&quot;)) else s[1] # 50 in both Python 2 and 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n... but may be there&#39;s an easier way which I just don&#39;t

String for console output and for HTML output are two VERY different tasks. Method `setPrettyPrinting()` is for console printing. HTML browser will ignore &quot;\\n&quot; symbols and will not respect multiple spaces replacing them with a single space etc. In general, it is usually a client-side task to format the output. But I delt once with this problem and wrote a method that takes a console-formatted string and converts it to Html formatted String. For instance, it replaces all &quot;\\n&quot; symbols with **br** Html tags. It does some other things as well. I had some success with it, but sometimes some unexpected problems occurred. You are welcome to use it. The method is available in MgntUtils Open source library. Here is its [JavaDoc][1].

Do objects get passed by reference when returning them like I am doing in my service. \r\n\r\n\r\nCould someone recommend a better way to implement this","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411254/shared-service-is-passing-object-by-reference","title":"Shared service is passing object by

(It does no longer use the SRAM, but whatever floats my boat)\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint CAN_message_receive(can_message* message)\r\n{\r\n\r\n\tstatic can_message buffers[CAN_MESSAGE_UNIQUE_IDS];\r\n\tstatic int birth = 1;\r\n\tif(birth)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tfor (int i; i &lt; CAN_MESSAGE_UNIQUE_IDS*10; i++)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t*(char*)(0x18FF+i) = 0;\r\n\t\t\tprintf(&quot;buffers: %X\\n&quot;, &amp;buffers[i]);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tbirth = 0;\r\n\t}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58411240/struct-memory-allocation-issues-for-message-buffer","title":"Struct memory allocation issues for message buffer"},{"tags":["wso2","mqtt"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12225836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAd0gHw4oWulCLJC0RgNxWNfhNDOXGxy1oM2jDGhg=k-s128","display_name":"Rizwan KD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12225836/rizwan-kd"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571221976,"creation_date":1571221976,"question_id":58411238,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58411238","body_markdown":"I am using wso2mb-3.2.0 version.

would like to open an app (if its installed) when I click on the link on my webpage. I&#39;ve implemented App Links according to official [docs](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) but the link is opened in Chrome and my app is not offered to handle the link. If I click on the link in Messages app for example, it works correctly. I think that it&#39;s some limitation of the Chrome but I cant find anything online about that. If I try to turn off the verification for App links and implement it just like regular deeplinks it does not work either.
