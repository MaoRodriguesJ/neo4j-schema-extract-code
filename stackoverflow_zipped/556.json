In your case, seems to be that you want to have a `Row` with a fixed height equal to the `Placeholder`. In that case, you need to wrap the `Row` with the same height as the `Placeholder`, like this:\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n    Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n      return Scaffold(\r\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text(&quot;&quot;)),\r\n        body: ListView.builder(\r\n            itemCount: 3,\r\n            itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {\r\n              return Card(\r\n                child: SizedBox(\r\n                  height: 100,\r\n                  child: Row(\r\n                    children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                      Placeholder(\r\n                        fallbackHeight: 100,\r\n                        fallbackWidth: 100,\r\n                      ),\r\n                      Column(\r\n                        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,\r\n                        children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                          Text(&quot;One&quot;),\r\n                          Expanded(child: Center(child: Text(&quot;Center&quot;))),\r\n                        ],\r\n                      ),\r\n                    ],\r\n                  ),\r\n                ),\r\n              );\r\n            }),\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI removed the height `10` of the `Text(&quot;One&quot;)` because if the `fontSize` is bigger, the text would look cropped.

have a IS4 set up and most of the clients that use it get their pictures from a simple ASP.NET Core API. There is one method for adding pictures that go to wwwroot. &lt;br /&gt;I noticed that, while unauthorized users can&#39;t add new pictures, anyone can access the pictures if they know the URL. After a quick search, i found out that i need a middleware to protect static files, so i shamelessly used sir Alan&#39;s code from [here](https://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2015/10/06/authorization-policies-and-middleware-in-asp-net-5.aspx). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After modifying it for ASP.NET Core (unsure if i did it correctly), i couldn&#39;t get authorized from any of the clients (I would get a 401 response, so at least that works correctly).\r\nHere are the services added:\r\n\r\n    services.AddAuthentication(\r\n                IdentityServerAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n                .AddIdentityServerAuthentication(options =&gt;\r\n                {\r\n                    options.Authority = &quot;http://some.url&quot;;\r\n                    options.ApiName = &quot;SomeAPI&quot;;\r\n                    options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;\r\n                });\r\n            services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                options.AddPolicy(&quot;Authenticated&quot;, policy =&gt; policy.RequireAuthenticatedUser());\r\n            });\r\nAnd the Invoke method from ProtectFolder, that i modifyied:\r\n\r\n    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext httpContext,\r\n                                 IAuthorizationService authorizationService, \r\n                                 IAuthenticationService authenticationService)\r\n        {\r\n            if (httpContext.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments(_path))\r\n            {\r\n                var authenticated = await authenticationService.AuthenticateAsync(httpContext, \r\n                    IdentityServerAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);\r\n                var authorized = await authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(httpContext.User, null, _policyName);\r\n                if (!authorized.Succeeded)\r\n                {\r\n                    await authenticationService.ChallengeAsync(httpContext,\r\n                        IdentityServerAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, authenticated.Properties);\r\n                    return;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            await _next(httpContext);\r\n        }\r\nSo i managed to protect the files, but now I can&#39;t access them either. Since I&#39;m using IS4 I&#39;m pretty sure I need to use the token for authorization, but I&#39;m unsure how.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\nI checked [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52957531/how-to-protect-static-folder-in-asp-net-core-2-1-using-claims-based-authorizatio) and put UseAuthentication above UseProtectFolder and UseStaticFiles, but I still get a 401 response. I also checked [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52503566/identityserver4-challenge-all-requests-to-api-not-just-authorize), but I&#39;m unsure if it will help, since I&#39;m not using the controller to get the files.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408167/protecting-static-files-with-authorization-middleware-using-identityserver4","title":"Protecting static files with Authorization Middleware using IdentityServer4"},{"tags":["xamarin.forms","webview","xamarin.ios","payment-gateway","payumoney"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7059,"user_id":1771254,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26092880fd028e134a4e8f9a9d427d46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pinedax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1771254/pinedax"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571383715,"post_id":58408166,"comment_id":103230272,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408166/payumoney-integration-in-xamarin-ios#comment103230272_58408166"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":7449360,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":14,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/665338620332732/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mohammed Dastagir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7449360/mohammed-dastagir"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571216771,"creation_date":1571211589,"question_id":58408166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408166","body_markdown":"I&#39;m implementing PayUMoney in Xamarin Forms.

You want to insert the numbers as floats.\r\n\r\nYou can round floats to a certain amount of decimal places without converting them to strings.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef round_floats(o):\r\n  if isinstance(o, float): return round(o, 2) #Line 13, using round instead of\r\n                                                  #string formatting\r\n  if isinstance(o, dict): return {k: round_floats(v) for k, v in o.items()}\r\n  if isinstance(o, (list, tuple)): return [round_floats(x) for x in o]\r\n  return o\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplacing the use of string formatting with the ```round(float, decimals)``` function gives the following output for printout2:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprintout 2:\r\n[[&#39;aa&#39;, &#39;bb&#39;, &#39;cc&#39;, &#39;dd&#39;, &#39;ee&#39;],\r\n [{&#39;v&#39;: 1.1}, {&#39;w&#39;: 2.2}, {&#39;x&#39;: 3.3}, {&#39;y&#39;: 4.4}, {&#39;z&#39;: 5.56}],\r\n [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],\r\n [11.1, 22.22, 33.33, 44.44, 55.56],\r\n [15.71, 41.89, 70.69, 100.53, 130.9],\r\n [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### NEW ANSWER\r\n\r\n**EDIT** - after much debugging we stumble upon a bit of a problem. It is impossible to force the pretty-print to use a certain exponential formatting all the time.\r\n\r\nI tried using [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44356856/12092543) bit of code to override the pretty-printer&#39;s float operator but it doesn&#39;t work for lists. This solution does not override the formatter for a type if it is nested in a list/dictionary/struct. Unfortunately, without re-writing half the pretty-printer code, this solution does not seem viable.\r\n\r\nThe good news is there might not be a need. You can just use two decimal places of precision with all your floats. This does not **guarantee** that the number will be represented with scientific notation, but in most cases this will suit you.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef round_floats(o):\r\n  if isinstance(o, float): return float(&quot;{:.2f}&quot;.format(o) if abs(o)&gt;0.01 else &quot;{:.2e}&quot;.format(o))\r\n  #Edited line 13, just casting back to float\r\n  if isinstance(o, dict): return {k: round_floats(v) for k, v in o.items()}\r\n  if isinstance(o, (list, tuple)): return [round_floats(x) for x in o]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt might be better to instead use the decimal class to adjust the precision of the numbers.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport decimal\r\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 3\r\n\r\ndef round_floats(o):\r\n  if isinstance(o, float): return float(+decimal.Decimal(o))\r\n  if isinstance(o, dict): return {k: round_floats(v) for k, v in o.items()}\r\n  if isinstance(o, (list, tuple)): return [round_floats(x) for x in o]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn either case, the bad news is that numbers around 0 do not behave as you want. A number like 0.0001 will stay with the same representation (as opposed to 1.0e-4). However it does perform a calculation and checks which notation (scientific or normal) takes up less space, so given this approach each representation is guaranteed to be the shortest possible.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[&#39;aa&#39;, &#39;bb&#39;, &#39;cc&#39;, &#39;dd&#39;, &#39;ee&#39;],\r\n [{&#39;v&#39;: 1.1}, {&#39;w&#39;: 2.2}, {&#39;x&#39;: 3.3}, {&#39;y&#39;: 4.4}, {&#39;z&#39;: 5.56}],\r\n [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],\r\n [11.1, 22.2, 33.3, 44.4, 55.6],\r\n [15.7, 41.9, 70.7, 101.0, 131.0],\r\n [0.000157, 0.000419, 0.000707, 0.00101, 0.00131]]\r\n #Note that the bottom row is badly represented, but this representation is\r\n #not longer than writing out the same number in scientific notation. If\r\n #These numbers were smaller, they would be represented scientifically.\r\n\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408126/controlling-the-number-of-decimals-in-a-mixed-list-printout-pprint-pformat-jso/58408292#58408292","title":"Controlling the number of decimals in a mixed list printout (pprint.pformat, json.dumps)"}],"owner":{"reputation":989,"user_id":6197439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/692e93967f23c403a2eb62c0cf99bb53?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sdbbs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6197439/sdbbs"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58408292,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571221915,"creation_date":1571211385,"question_id":58408126,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408126","body_markdown":"I have a &quot;mixed list&quot; (here meaning, a list that may include lists, dicts, strings, ints or floats), and I would like to print it - that is, obtain a string representation of it, hopefully a &quot;pretty&quot; one - however, in such a way, that the floats in this data structure have their number of decimals limited.

id2=0101\r\n\r\nPipe the output of your huge `gzip` to the following filter\r\n\r\n    jq --arg v1 &quot;$id1&quot; --arg v2 &quot;$id2&quot; --stream &#39;fromstream(inputs)| objects | .flow[$v1][$v2]&#39; &gt; &quot;$id1&quot;_&quot;$id2&quot;.json\r\n\r\n(or) if the id names can&#39;t be pre-fetched and you need to fetch them on the run, directly use their names as\r\n\r\n    jq --stream &#39;fromstream(inputs)| objects |

a solution that uses jq&#39;s streaming parser to produce a stream consisting of $id1, $id2, and the corresponding value of interest; this stream can then be piped into another tool (e.g. awk if that&#39;s convenient) to produce the desired files.\r\n\r\nIn the following, we use `atomize` from the jq cookbook:\r\n```\r\n  def atomize(s):\r\n    fromstream(foreach s as $in ( {previous:null, emit: null};\r\n      if ($in | length == 2) and ($in|.[0][0]) != .previous and .previous != null\r\n      then {emit: [[.previous]], previous: $in|.[0][0]}\r\n      else { previous: ($in|.[0][0]), emit: null}\r\n      end;\r\n      (.emit // empty), $in) ) ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main jq program (invoked with --stream -n -c) is then simply:\r\n```\r\natomize(inputs)\r\n| select(type == &quot;object&quot; and .flow)\r\n| .flow\r\n| keys_unsorted[] as $id1\r\n| (.[$id1] | keys_unsorted[]) as $id2\r\n| $id1, $id2, .[$id1][$id2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for each gzip file, $gz, the pipeline would look like this:\r\n\r\n   gunzip -c $gz |\r\n     jq -nc --stream -f program.jq |\r\n     awk ....\r\n\r\nFor an example of using awk to produce the desired result, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56167046/jq-split-a-huge-json-of-array-and-save-into-file-named-with-a-value\r\n\r\n## Caveat and Addendum\r\njq&#39;s streaming parser avoids using RAM at the cost of speed, so usually using the --stream option is only done as a last resort.  From the description of the problem, it looks like you might be able to process some of the zipped files using jq&#39;s regular parser, so you might want to process those files speedily, leaving the &quot;atomize&quot; approach for those files that are too big.  \r\n\r\n## Caution\r\nThe problem description does not make it clear what should be done if there is an id1_id2.json collision.  If there is no possibility of such a collision, then of course there&#39;s no problem.  Otherwise, it would be up to the program that creates those files to manage that contingency.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408121/stream-parse-huge-json-file-into-small-files/58414279#58414279","title":"Stream Parse Huge JSON file into small files"}],"owner":{"reputation":370,"user_id":6037999,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476fb22664aa5d7cd1977e65bb4bf794?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Fahad Abid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6037999/fahad-abid"},"last_editor":{"reputation":42715,"user_id":997358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f849cfde4e526e22e916fa69103ef7e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"peak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/997358/peak"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571244018,"creation_date":1571211357,"last_edit_date":1571244018,"question_id":58408121,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408121","body_markdown":"I have around 96 `gzip` of JSON which is over 350 GB of JSON file after unzipping with following structure \r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;structe&quot;: {},\r\n      &quot;beta&quot;: {},\r\n      &quot;flow&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;1023&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;0101&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;-LEjllNyHqdHYGntO6vu&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n              &quot;t&quot;: 1528736191996\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;-LEjllcXKaVOQu3BDpHF&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n              &quot;t&quot;: 1528736192996\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          &quot;0102&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;-LEjllNyHqdHYGntO6vu&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n              &quot;t&quot;: 1528736191996\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;-LEjllcXKaVOQu3BDpHF&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n              &quot;t&quot;: 1528736192996\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;1024&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;0103&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;-LEjllNyHqdHYGntO6vu&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;lat&quot;: 51.128676733981,\r\n              &quot;lng&quot;: -113.9318991267252,\r\n              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n              &quot;t&quot;: 1528736191996\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;-LEjllcXKaVOQu3BDpHF&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;lat&quot;: 51.128676733981,\r\n              &quot;lng&quot;: -113.9318991267252,\r\n              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n              &quot;t&quot;: 1528736192996\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t load this in RAM , Now I want to stream this file and pull the path `flow-&gt;1023(let id1)-&gt;0101(let id2)` into new `id1_id2.json` file.

is called.\r\n3. spin up a dummy SMTP server and check if it receives the messages\r\n4. use valid credentials to actually send the emails to addresses you control and check if the email is

In connection with the above, I created two helper methods that will supply stab data to my fake container. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  private List&lt;Employee&gt; dataStab() {\r\n    List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++) {\r\n      Employee employee = randomizeEmployeeParam();\r\n      employees.add(employee);\r\n    }\r\n    return employees;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private Employee randomizeEmployeeParam() {\r\n\r\n    return\r\n        new\r\n            Employee(\r\n            &quot;Employee&quot; + rand.nextInt(3000),\r\n            rand.nextInt(50),\r\n            1000 + (10000 - 1000) * rand.nextDouble());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created two tests which are conducting accordingly ```Collectors.mapping``` and ```Stream.map``` operations. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  @RepeatedTest(10)\r\n  void collectorsMapping() {\r\n    Instant start = Instant.now();\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; strings = employeeService.collectorsMapping(dataStab());\r\n    Instant finish = Instant.now();\r\n    long timeElapsed = Duration.between(start, finish).toMillis();\r\n    System.out.println(timeElapsed);\r\n    assertEquals(10000000, strings.size());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @RepeatedTest(10)\r\n  void streamMapAndCollect() {\r\n    Instant start = Instant.now();\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; mapAndCollect = employeeService.streamMapAndCollect(dataStab());\r\n    Instant finish = Instant.now();\r\n    long timeElapsed = Duration.between(start, finish).toMillis();\r\n    System.out.println(timeElapsed);\r\n    assertEquals(10000000, mapAndCollect.size());\r\n  }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nTests work so far but now I suppose to manually calculate an average time of these tests basing on the result in the run window in IntelliJ. Moreover In the long term if I will increase ```@RepeatedTest``` param to calculate the closest result this will be a little bit tedious. I want to know if it is possible to handle the duration param ```timeElapsed``` and calculate the average value for n repeated tests.

First, you will want to know if the response code is [`200 OK`][2]. To gather that information you should use [`getResponseCode()`][3] and check if it equals to `200`. If that is the case, then you must parse the code. To do that you can first use [`getContentText()`][4] and after that [`parse()`][5]. One example implementation, that is compatible with your code, can be this one:\r\n\r\n    if (resp.getResponseCode() == 200) {\r\n      var results = JSON.parse(resp.getContentText());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can then access to the data referring to that variable and the name of the parameter.

If you dont have fillable fields in your pdf, you can create them using any online tool. One example is: https://www.pdfescape.com/\r\n\r\nYou can also use Adobe to do so if you like.\r\n\r\n###Create a PDF with dynamic data\r\nOnce you have your empty, fillable PDF, then you can populate the data in it using [PDFTK][1] library. Of course, you will have to install this tool in your Server in order to use it.\r\n\r\nI recommend using it directly, running `exec` or similar commands in PHP. However, if you are not comfortable, you can use various Pdftk wrapper, available in Laravel. One example is: https://github.com/mikehaertl/php-pdftk\r\n\r\nI myself prefer using `exec` directly from PHP. Here is a REALLY GOOD tutorial for that: https://www.sitepoint.com/filling-pdf-forms-pdftk-php/\r\n\r\n###Send the email\r\nWell once you have your PDF generated and saved on Server, all you need to do is attach it with your email and send. You can find all about attachments in Laravel here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/mail#attachments\r\n\r\n###Run it via cron\r\nIf you have to do it on a regular basis. I advise you create a cron on your Server. There are various ways to do that. I advise you do it via cPanel, if you have one on your server of course as it provides very user-friendly way of creating crons. If not, you can also use terminal to edit the cron files in Linux Server.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend using Laravel inbuild scheduler because it has known issues.\r\n\r\nWell that&#39;s it, voila..that&#39;s the whole process of sending dynamically generated PDFs via email on regular basis.\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408067/how-do-i-send-automatic-pdf-mails-taking-values-from-db/58408269#58408269","title":"How do I send automatic pdf mails taking values from DB"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8478011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1544794648911355/picture?type=large","display_name":"Engr Ebuka Orioha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8478011/engr-ebuka-orioha"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1793,"user_id":391691,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCKhh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/391691/simson"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58408269,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571222228,"creation_date":1571211166,"last_edit_date":1571222228,"question_id":58408067,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408067","body_markdown":"Hello guys I need help here,\r\n\r\nI want to send PDF mails to users on a monthly basics. but the PDF will have values from the db. so each users has a different content from another user all taking values from db.

......&lt;br/&gt;\r\n5.....\r\na.s.o.\r\n\r\nI would like to change the text style of the whole row which includes the totals to bold.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nI searched a lot ad found a lot ;-) but my experience is to small to adapt it.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nI assumed I can use elements out of Vaadin, because XdevGrid is based on Vaadin 7.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nTo assign the data to the grid I used following code:\r\n\r\n    final XdevBeanItemContainer&lt;VUmsCrosstbl2&gt; myContainer = new XdevBeanItemContainer&lt;&gt;(VUmsCrosstbl2.class);\r\n    myContainer.addAll(new VUmsCrosstbl2DAO().getAllCrossDataforYearKonto2(selJahr, &quot;7,8&quot;));\r\n    this.tblUmsCross.setContainerDataSource(myContainer);\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nI stil generated a calculated cell and included it in the table.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n````\r\n    package com.opaheinz.rc_07.ui;\r\n    import java.util.Formatter;\r\n    import com.opaheinz.rc_07.entities.VUmsCrosstbl2;\r\n    import

(bean.getL1GroupName().toLowerCase().startsWith(&quot;&lt;b&gt;&quot;))\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tmyIndicator = &quot;1&quot;;\r\n            // For this case, I would like to change the row style\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tmyIndicator = &quot;0&quot;;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn myIndicator;\r\n\t}\r\n````\r\n\r\nI used the generated cell to validate if there is a total or not.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nAnd I created a special style entry v-table-row-total and placed it in styles.scss:&lt;br/&gt; \r\n\r\n      .v-grid-row.total&gt; td {\r\n     background-color: blue;\r\n     font-weight: bold;\r\n   } \r\n\r\nThis worked fine so far.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\nBut I am not able to access the row style and set it.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nI tried to transfer the vaadin examples into my rapidclipse project, but also without success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\nOut of this my questions:&lt;br/&gt;\r\nHas anyone expierience with XdevTable/ XdevGrid and such a requirment?&lt;br/&gt;\r\nIs this still

This way, you can make the solution of retrieving a fixed set of ids deterministic. So, you can create a (one-time) table that contains the ranks for your ids:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbq query --nouse_legacy_sql --allow_large_results --replace \\ \r\n --destination_table=dataset.ranking_table \\ \r\n&quot;select row_number() over () as rnk, id from dataset.table1&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have this static `ranking_table`, you can go about creating your chunks repeatedly over different ranges. For example (for 1 - 10):\r\n\r\nFor `table1_chunk1`: \r\n```\r\nbq query --nouse_legacy_sql --allow_large_results --replace \\ \r\n --destination_table=dataset.table1_chunk1 \\ \r\n&quot;select a.* from dataset.table1 a join dataset.ranking_table b on b.id=a.id  \r\nwhere b.rnk between 1 and 10&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `table1_chunk2`: \r\n```\r\nbq query --nouse_legacy_sql --allow_large_results --replace \\ \r\n --destination_table=dataset.table2_chunk1 \\ \r\n&quot;select a.* from dataset.table2 a join dataset.ranking_table b on b.id=a.id \r\nwhere b.rnk between 1 and 10&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can go about exporting the data in these tables to a GCS bucket, and then locally. I will leave that part assuming you can figure it out.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408038/export-two-tables-from-bigquery-to-csv-based-on-primary-key/58417759#58417759","title":"Export two tables from BigQuery to csv based on primary key"}],"owner":{"reputation":176,"user_id":1416564,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/251f301b46bf08a7ca104b9c715921c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1416564","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1416564/user1416564"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571242824,"creation_date":1571211097,"question_id":58408038,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408038","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve got 2 tables in BigQuery tables that are aggregated and processed which may have up to 2 million and 10 million rows respectively. \r\n\r\nThey have very different columns but each as the same primary key (IDXX). \r\nIn table 1 there is one row for each IDXX and in table 2 there maybe up to 10 rows with IDXX. \r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to export these two tables from BigQuery in matching chunks.

In C++ a char is byte in disguise and `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed to be `1` by the standard. \r\n\r\n```\r\nsize_t n = dimof(test);\r\n// macro expansion:\r\nsize_t n = sizeof(DimofSizeHelper(array));\r\n```\r\n`n` is assigned the size of the return type of `DimofSizeHelper`, which is `sizeof(char[N])` which is `N`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a bit convoluted &lt;del&gt;and unnecessary&lt;/del&gt;. The usual way to do it was:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate &lt;class T, size_t N&gt;\r\n/*constexpr*/ size_t sizeof_array(T (&amp;)[N]) { return N; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince C++17 this also is unnecessary, as we have [`std::size`][1] which does this, but in a more generic way, being able to get the size of any stl-style container.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by BoBTFish, it is necessary for an edge case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

is actually a really tough one to explain, but I&#39;ll give it a go...\r\n\r\nFirstly, `dimof` tells you the **dimension**, or number of elements in an array. (I believe &quot;dimension&quot; is the preferred terminology in Windows programming environments).\r\n\r\nThis is necessary because `C++` and `C` don&#39;t give you a native way to determine the size of an array.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOften people assume `sizeof(myArray)` will work, but that will actually give you the size in memory, rather than the number of elements. Each element probably takes more than 1 byte of memory!\r\n\r\nNext, they might try `sizeof(myArray) / sizeof(myArray[0])`. This would give the size in memory of the array, divided by the size of the first element. It&#39;s ok, and widely used in `C` code. The major problem with this is that it will appear to work if you pass a pointer instead of an array. The size of a pointer in memory will usually be 4 or 8 bytes, even though the thing it points to might be an array of 1000s of elements.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSo the next thing to try in `C++` is to use templates to force something that only works for arrays, and will give a compiler error on a pointer. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename T, std::size_t N&gt;\r\n    std::size_t ArraySize(T (&amp;inputArray)[N])\r\n    {\r\n        return N;\r\n    }\r\n    //...\r\n    float x[7];\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; ArraySize(x); // prints &quot;7&quot;\r\n\r\nThe template will only work with an array. It will deduce the type (not really needed, but has to be there to get the template to work) and the size of the array, then it returns the size. The way the template is written cannot possibly work with a pointer.\r\n\r\nUsually you can stop here, and this is in the C++ Standard Libary as [`std::size`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/size).\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n### Warning: below here it gets into hairy language-lawyer territory.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is pretty cool, but still fails in an obscure edge case:\r\n\r\n    struct Placeholder {\r\n        static float x[8];\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename T, int N&gt;\r\n    int ArraySize (T (&amp;)[N])\r\n    {\r\n        return N;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        return ArraySize(Placeholder::x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that the array `x` is **declared**, but not **defined**. To call a function (i.e. `ArraySize`) with it, [`x` must be **defined**](https://stackoverflow.com/q/19630570/1171191).\r\n\r\n    In function `main&#39;:\r\n    SO.cpp:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `Placeholder::x&#39;\r\n    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n\r\nYou can&#39;t link this.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe code you have in the question is a way around that. Instead of actually calling a function, we declare a function that **returns an object of exactly the right size**. Then we use the `sizeof` trick on that.\r\n\r\nIt *looks* like we call the function, but `sizeof` is purely a compile time construct, so the function never actually gets called.\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename T, size_t N&gt;\r\n    char(&amp;DimofSizeHelper(T(&amp;array)[N]))[N];\r\n    ^^^^ ^                               ^^^\r\n    // a function that returns a reference to array of N chars - the size of this array in memory will be exactly N bytes\r\n\r\nNote you can&#39;t actually return an array from a function, but you can return a reference to an array.\r\n\r\nThen `DimofSizeHelper(myArray)` is an **expression** whose **type** is an array on `N` `char`s. The expression doesn&#39;t actually have to be runable, but it makes sense at compile time.\r\n\r\nTherefore `sizeof(DimofSizeHelper(myArray))` will tell you the **size at compile time** of what you would get if you did actually call the function. Even though we don&#39;t actually call it.\r\n\r\n[![Austin Powers Cross-Eyed][1]][1]\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t worry if that last block didn&#39;t make any sense. It&#39;s a bizarre trick to work around a bizarre edge case. This is why you don&#39;t write this sort of code yourself, and let library implementers worry about this sort of nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/enZeK.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408024/how-does-this-template-code-to-get-the-size-of-an-array-work/58408504#58408504","title":"How does this template code to get the size of an array work?"}],"owner":{"reputation":283,"user_id":7636340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dc3dc77f62db0b359ca3464b1270b7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shadow fiend","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7636340/shadow-fiend"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264257,"user_id":68587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d9fd158e03cbde94f7e0b33b78222af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Kugelman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/68587/john-kugelman"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":5167,"favorite_count":10,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":57,"accepted_answer_id":58408504,"answer_count":2,"score":53,"last_activity_date":1571292580,"creation_date":1571211062,"last_edit_date":1571278038,"question_id":58408024,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408024","body_markdown":"I wonder why this kind of code can get the size of the test array?

If someone only upload images but quit posting, useless images remain in my server repository, right?\r\n\r\nplz reply and help me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTt05.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408011/image-upload-with-ckeditor-in-react","title":"Image Upload with CKEditor in react"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","testing","junit","h2"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9789035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EWpXDMV9bwo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeg/9C1AdWxfd-M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gabriel Garc&#237;a Garrido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9789035/gabriel-garc%c3%ada-garrido"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571214538,"post_id":58408329,"comment_id":103161674,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408010/spring-boot-preload-data-and-configure-h2-for-tests-special-configuration-ques/58408329#comment103161674_58408329"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9789035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EWpXDMV9bwo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeg/9C1AdWxfd-M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gabriel Garc&#237;a Garrido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9789035/gabriel-garc%c3%ada-garrido"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571230112,"post_id":58408329,"comment_id":103170326,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408010/spring-boot-preload-data-and-configure-h2-for-tests-special-configuration-ques/58408329#comment103170326_58408329"},{"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":9594764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_iJZD6YWsFE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/REL0gd6qLf0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SiR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9594764/sir"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":45,"user_id":9789035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EWpXDMV9bwo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeg/9C1AdWxfd-M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gabriel Garc&#237;a Garrido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9789035/gabriel-garc%c3%ada-garrido"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571326485,"post_id":58408329,"comment_id":103212526,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408010/spring-boot-preload-data-and-configure-h2-for-tests-special-configuration-ques/58408329#comment103212526_58408329"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":9594764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_iJZD6YWsFE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/REL0gd6qLf0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SiR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9594764/sir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":124,"user_id":9594764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_iJZD6YWsFE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/REL0gd6qLf0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SiR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9594764/sir"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571218160,"last_edit_date":1571218160,"creation_date":1571212225,"answer_id":58408329,"question_id":58408010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58408329","body_markdown":"If I understand your question correctly, you are asking whether your DDBBConfig class when used in test (**either as a bean or initialized as a local variable**) will use application-test.properties or application.properties.

the factory is then only deciding based on the passed parameters what type it should return, and then delegating to the container to construct that object for return.\r\n\r\nThis has some benefits\r\n\r\n - It lets you separate the lifecycle of these dependent objects (and indeed, the constructed objects) from the factory\r\n - It decouples the factory from having to know how to construct all the possible object graphs it provides and lets it focus on making the decision on *what* to build, not *how* to build it\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n    public class SimpleFoo: Foo\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic  SimpleFoo(IServiceA a){...}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class ComplexFoo: Foo\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic  ComplexFoo(IServiceA a, IServiceB b){...}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class DegenerateFoo: Foo\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic DegenerateFoo(){..does nothing...}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class FooFactory\r\n    {    \r\n        readonly IContainer _container;\r\n        public void FooFactory(IContainer container){_container=container;}\r\n    \r\n        public Foo GetAFoo(int type)\r\n        {\r\n           switch (type)\r\n    \t   {\r\n    \t\t\tcase 0:\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn _container.Get&lt;SimpleFoo&gt;();\r\n    \t\t\tcase 1:\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn _container.Get&lt;ComplexFoo&gt;();\r\n    \t\t\tdefault:\r\n                    //unknown case, return some kind of Foo that does nothing\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn _container.get&lt;DegenerateFoo&gt;();\r\n    \t   }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYour container, meanwhile, would have been separately configured somewhere else in the application&#39;s &quot;Composition Root&quot; to know how to resolve the object graphs (the following is pseudocode only)\r\n\r\n    container.RegisterTransient&lt;IServiceA, ServiceAImplementation&gt;();\r\n    container.RegisterSingleton&lt;IServiceB, ServiceBImplementation&gt;();\r\n\r\nIn this case we&#39;re configuring that any `IServiceA` injection is a new object instance each time it is requested; whereas `IServiceB` injections will be a single shared instance that the container takes care of creating once and doling out on request. Of course this is just an example of how you might configure these, ultimately you know best how you need to configure the lifetimes of these dependencies.\r\n\r\nHope you get the idea.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58407998/how-to-create-complex-objects-using-factory-design-pattern/58413951#58413951","title":"How to create complex objects using factory design pattern"}],"owner":{"reputation":2076,"user_id":1913744,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95b4046735c09b70a0a5365ae0041ac5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bercovici Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1913744/bercovici-adrian"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58413951,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571230811,"creation_date":1571210967,"question_id":58407998,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58407998","body_markdown":"Hello i have to create a complex object , and i wanted to use the factory pattern for it.However i do not know what to do with the additional dependencies that the object needs in order to be created.\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**\r\n\r\n    public class SomeService\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    public class SomeOtherService\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Hierarchy**\r\n\r\n    public abstract class NeededObjectBase\r\n    {\r\n      public readonly int Type {get;set;}  //id selected by the factory\r\n      \r\n      public abstract void DoSomething();\r\n    }\r\n    public class A:NeededObjectBase\r\n    {\r\n       private SomeService service;\r\n       A(SomeService service){ this.service=service;}\r\n       public override void DoSomething(){}\r\n    }\r\n    public class B:NeededObjectBase\r\n    {\r\n       public B(SomeService service,SomeOtherService otherService){\r\n           this.service=service;\r\n           this.otherService=otherService\r\n       }\r\n       public SomeOtherService service;\r\n       public SomeOtherService otherService;\r\n       public override void DoSomething(){}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Factory**\r\n\r\n    public class Factory\r\n    {\r\n       public static NeededObjectBase CreateInstance(int type)\r\n       {\r\n           switch(type)\r\n           {\r\n            case 0:return new A();  //this would need SomeService =&gt; new A(someService)\r\n            case 1:return new B();   // this would need SomeService &amp; SomeOtherService =&gt; new B(someService,someOtherService);\r\n            default: return new A();\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n\r\n    public class Aggregate\r\n    {\r\n       private SomeService s1;\r\n       private SomeOtherService s2;\r\n       public void UseNeededObject(int type)\r\n       {\r\n         NeededObjectBase neededObject=Factory.CreateInstance(type);\r\n         neededObject.DoSomething();\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you look in the code things happen like this:&lt;br&gt;\r\nI have an `Aggregate` class where i keep my **dependencies**.&lt;Br&gt;Inside its method i  use the `Factory` based on the `type` parameter in order to create the right object.&lt;Br&gt;However i do not know what to do with the dependencies.Should the factory get all the required dependencies in order to create the objects ?
