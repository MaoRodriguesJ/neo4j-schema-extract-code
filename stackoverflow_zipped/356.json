This path can contain a **{build.number}** pattern which will be replaced with the build number of the build whose artifact is retrieved.\r\n\r\nHowever, this caused a few issues (one example [here](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-43762)), as there are several reserved characters in the RFC&#39;s pertaining to URI/URL standards (in this case RFC [1738](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738#page-3)). The RFC 1738 standard deems a group of characters &quot;unsafe&quot; (including curly braces), in addition to the *reserved* characters for URIs:\r\n\r\n&gt; Other characters are unsafe because\r\n   gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify\r\n   such characters. These characters are &quot;{&quot;, &quot;}&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;\\&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;~&quot;,\r\n   &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;, and &quot;`&quot;. [...] All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL.\r\n\r\nThus, the TeamCity software was updated thereafter to support the curly brace **encodings** as well. The TeamCity 10.X [documentation](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Patterns+For+Accessing+Build+Artifacts#PatternsForAccessingBuildArtifacts-ObtainingArtifacts) for **Obtaining Artifacts** was updated to align with the standards for URL encoding:\r\n\r\n&gt; **ARTIFACT_PATH** is a path to the artifact on the TeamCity server. This path can contain a **{build.number}** pattern (`%7Bbuild.number%7D`) which will be replaced by TeamCity with the build number of the build whose artifact is retrieved.\r\n\r\nIt seems that by the TeamCity 2019 versions, the support for using raw curly braces in the URL has been dropped altogether in alignment with the standard, and only the **encoded** version is allowed. So you can update your CMake code to something like this:\r\n\r\n    set(SIM_FILENAME vhnHilsimPlantModel-%7Bbuild.number%7D.zip)\r\n    set(SIM_URL https://teamcity.vh.com/guestAuth/rep/download/Sim_Feat/.lastSuccessful/${SIM_FILENAME})\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453819/non-ascii-in-url-in-cmake-externalproject-add/58457671#58457671","title":"Non-ASCII in URL in CMake ExternalProject_Add"}],"owner":{"reputation":2072,"user_id":224982,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7b4b96492f8648f4e9372a9f3db752f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ilya1725","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224982/ilya1725"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2874,"user_id":3987854,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OV64v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"squareskittles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3987854/squareskittles"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58457671,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571435574,"creation_date":1571412110,"last_edit_date":1571435574,"question_id":58453819,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58453819","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve had this `ExternalProject_Add` call in my CMake:\r\n\r\n    set(SIM_URL https://teamcity.vh.com/guestAuth/rep/download/Sim_Feat/.lastSuccessful/vhnHilsimPlantModel-{build.number}.zip)\r\n    set(SIM_FILENAME vhnHilsimPlantModel-{build.number}.zip)\r\n    \r\n    # Download and install\r\n    include(ExternalProject)\r\n    ExternalProject_Add(get_sim\r\n      DOWNLOAD_NAME ${SIM_FILENAME}\r\n      URL ${SIM_URL}\r\n      CMAKE_ARGS -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;\r\n                 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}\r\n      BUILD_BYPRODUCTS &lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/lib/sim_lib.a\r\n      STEP_TARGETS update)\r\n\r\nIt worked fine with the 2017 version of TeamCity.

n);\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    P1-&gt;OUT &amp;= (~(1U &lt;&lt; n)) &amp; 0xFF;\r\n\r\nto avoid the arithmetic conversions and integer promotions ever producing signed numbers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior/58454011#58454011","title":"Does the position of this bit-wise operator change the behavior?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":95510,"user_id":918959,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9051b2917c3d55d55b3d7042fa49f6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Antti Haapala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/918959/antti-haapala"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571413351,"post_id":58454081,"comment_id":103245678,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior/58454081#comment103245678_58454081"},{"owner":{"reputation":13061,"user_id":4253229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e2FAQvlj5CQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/TlSnekirgNE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugene Sh.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4253229/eugene-sh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414203,"post_id":58454081,"comment_id":103246088,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior/58454081#comment103246088_58454081"},{"owner":{"reputation":598683,"user_id":15168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtEI9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Leffler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13061,"user_id":4253229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e2FAQvlj5CQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/TlSnekirgNE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugene Sh.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4253229/eugene-sh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414340,"post_id":58454081,"comment_id":103246154,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior/58454081#comment103246154_58454081"},{"owner":{"reputation":13061,"user_id":4253229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e2FAQvlj5CQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/TlSnekirgNE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugene Sh.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4253229/eugene-sh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414458,"post_id":58454081,"comment_id":103246209,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior/58454081#comment103246209_58454081"},{"owner":{"reputation":598683,"user_id":15168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtEI9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Leffler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13061,"user_id":4253229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e2FAQvlj5CQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/TlSnekirgNE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugene Sh.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4253229/eugene-sh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414853,"post_id":58454081,"comment_id":103246405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior/58454081#comment103246405_58454081"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":598683,"user_id":15168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtEI9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Leffler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"},"last_editor":{"reputation":598683,"user_id":15168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtEI9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Leffler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571413865,"last_edit_date":1571413865,"creation_date":1571413048,"answer_id":58454081,"question_id":58453740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58454081","body_markdown":"TL;DR — **No!** (They are not always the same, and the result depends on the type of `P1-&gt;OUT`.)\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;_I&#39;m assuming the normal case of 2&#39;s-complement arithmetic.  If you suffer from sign-magnitude or 1&#39;s-complement arithmetic, you have to think quite a lot harder, but the conclusion is probably the same (not always the same)._&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n**Case 1:**\r\n\r\n* `(1&lt;&lt;1)` is an `int` value (`0x02`).\r\n* `(uint8_t)(1&lt;&lt;1)` converts to `uint8_t`, but the value is still `0x02`.\r\n* `~(uint8_t)(1&lt;&lt;1)` converts the `uint8_t` value to `int` again ([usual arithmetic conversions](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#6.3.1.8)) and applies the bit-wise inversion operator `~` to the result.\r\n\r\nAssuming a 32-bit `int` type, you get `0xFFFFFFFD` to `&amp;` with `P1-&gt;OUT`:\r\n\r\n    P1-&gt;OUT &amp;= 0xFFFFFFFD;\r\n\r\n**Case 2:**\r\n\r\n* `(1&lt;&lt;1)` is an `int` value (`0x02`).\r\n* `~(1&lt;&lt;1)` is an `int` value — assuming 32-bit `int`, the value is `0xFFFFFFFD`.\r\n* `(uint8_t)~(1&lt;&lt;1)` casts to `uint8_t`, zeroing the bits in the more significant bytes.\r\n\r\nAssuming a 32-bit `int` type, you get `0x000000FD` to `&amp;` with `P1-&gt;OUT`:\r\n\r\n    P1-&gt;OUT &amp;= 0x000000FD;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nSo, the value combined with `P1-&gt;OUT` is different, but the effect depends also on the (unspecified) type of `P1-&gt;OUT`.  If it is `uint8_t`, then there&#39;s no difference; if it is `uint64_t`, there is potentially a massive difference, but it also depends on the value in `P1-&gt;OUT` before the compound assignment is executed.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior/58454081#58454081","title":"Does the position of this bit-wise operator change the behavior?"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":9968908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b46cf75d6f90e2ca20ca04fb0ef71cb9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephen Wicklund","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9968908/stephen-wicklund"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5213,"user_id":963864,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94e2dd813e278309b6281b4a4b7fdddd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"curiousguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/963864/curiousguy"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58454011,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571452720,"creation_date":1571411854,"last_edit_date":1571452720,"question_id":58453740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58453740","body_markdown":"Are these two lines of code equivalent?\r\n\r\n    P1-&gt;OUT &amp;= ~(uint8_t)(1&lt;&lt;1);\r\n\r\n    P1-&gt;OUT &amp;= (uint8_t)(~(1&lt;&lt;1));","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453740/does-the-position-of-this-bit-wise-operator-change-the-behavior","title":"Does the position of this bit-wise operator change the behavior?"},{"tags":["http","post","distributed-system","distributed-transactions","idempotent"],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":8885009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72ecedabc7ff9c8ed282ebe0d757c722?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8885009/max"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571411851,"creation_date":1571411851,"question_id":58453739,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58453739","body_markdown":"I have been looking for a way to design my API so it will be idempotent, meaning that some of that is to make my POST request routes idempotent, and I stumbled upon [this](https://medium.com/@saurav200892/how-to-achieve-idempotency-in-post-method-d88d7b08fcdd) article.\r\n\r\n(If I have understood something now the way it is, please correct me!)\r\n\r\nIn it, there is a good explanation of the general idea. but what is lacking are some examples of they way that he implemented it by himself.\r\n\r\nSomeone asked the writer of the article, how would he guarantee atomicity?

Thank you very much!\r\nI just started with Java recently and really want to improve my skills with practical projects such as this.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453681/is-it-possible-to-bold-keywords-in-text-extracted-by-using-pdftextstripperbyarea","title":"Is it possible to bold keywords in text extracted by using PDFTextStripperByArea?"},{"tags":["ios","swift","uitextfield"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11353,"user_id":4051118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vKHVO.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andr&#233; Slotta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4051118/andr%c3%a9-slotta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571412121,"post_id":58453679,"comment_id":103245089,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453679/how-to-restrict-first-letter-in-text-field-not-space#comment103245089_58453679"},{"owner":{"reputation":16089,"user_id":9223839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29dcd6d8b4c4a0720ee253013c91d3ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joakim Danielson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9223839/joakim-danielson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571412452,"post_id":58453679,"comment_id":103245235,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453679/how-to-restrict-first-letter-in-text-field-not-space#comment103245235_58453679"},{"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":8919192,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e22a13aad3e5fea543001e7a4ece83a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"narasimha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8919192/narasimha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571412834,"post_id":58453679,"comment_id":103245417,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453679/how-to-restrict-first-letter-in-text-field-not-space#comment103245417_58453679"},{"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":8919192,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e22a13aad3e5fea543001e7a4ece83a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"narasimha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8919192/narasimha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571412907,"post_id":58453679,"comment_id":103245451,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453679/how-to-restrict-first-letter-in-text-field-not-space#comment103245451_58453679"},{"owner":{"reputation":361115,"user_id":341994,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbb4d027695dfdf76bf448b15d7e306a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/341994/matt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571413797,"post_id":58453679,"comment_id":103245873,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453679/how-to-restrict-first-letter-in-text-field-not-space#comment103245873_58453679"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":151579,"user_id":2303865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/varL9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Leo Dabus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2303865/leo-dabus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":151579,"user_id":2303865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/varL9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Leo Dabus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2303865/leo-dabus"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571426288,"last_edit_date":1571426288,"creation_date":1571421012,"answer_id":58455858,"question_id":58453679,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455858","body_markdown":"You can subclass `UITextField`, creating a `CustomTextField` and use `drop(while:)`while  passing a predicate to check if each character is a whitespace trimming only the beginning of your string:\r\n\r\n\r\n    import UIKit\r\n    class CustomTextField: UITextField {\r\n        override func willMove(toSuperview newSuperview: UIView?) {\r\n            addTarget(self, action: #selector(editingChanged), for: .editingChanged)\r\n            textAlignment = .left\r\n            editingChanged()\r\n        }\r\n        @objc func editingChanged() {\r\n            text?.removeAll { !($0.isLetter || $0.isWholeNumber || $0.isWhitespace) }\r\n            text = .init(text?.drop { $0.isWhitespace } ??

have a data from image sensor (2560x2160 pixels) encoded as Mono12Packed.\r\n\r\nThis encoding is defined as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nByte 0: Pixel 1 (bits 4:11)\r\nByte 1: Pixel 1 (bits 0:3), Pixel 2 (bits 0:3)\r\nByte 3: Pixel 2 (bits 4:11)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo unpack this data I use two different codes:\r\n\r\nThe first one reads the data as 12bit (so I get half of the values &#39;for free&#39;) and then I work on the other half.\r\n```\r\nfseek(fid, 0, &#39;bof&#39;);\r\nraw = fread(fid, 2560*2160, &#39;ubit12&#39;);\r\nraw(1:2:end) = arrayfun( ...\r\n    @(x) bitor(bitand(bitshift(x, 4), 4095), bitshift(x, -8)), ...\r\n    raw(1:2:end) ...\r\n);\r\ndat = reshape(raw, [2560, 2160]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second one uses more &#39;standard&#39; approach when the data are readed byte by byte.\r\n```\r\nraw = fread(fid, ceil(2560*2160*1.5), &#39;ubit8&#39;);\r\ndat = zeros(2560*2160, 1);\r\nfor i = 1:3:ceil(2560*2160*1.5)\r\n    p1 = bitor(bitshift(raw(i), 4), bitand(raw(i+1), 15));\r\n    p2 = bitor(bitshift(raw(i+2), 4), bitand(bitshift(raw(i+1), -4), 15));\r\n    dat(ceil(i/1.5)) = p1;\r\n    dat(ceil(i/1.5)+1) = p2;\r\nend;\r\ndat = reshape(dat2, [2560, 2160]);\r\n```\r\nEven though the second one is much faster (surprisingly for me), both are terribly slow. I am sure it could be speeded up by vectorization the loop, I just don&#39;t know how.\r\n\r\nOr maybe there is another solution how to unpack such data as they seems to be quite common.\r\n\r\nBTW, can anybody explain to me why are the data ordered in this way and not &#39;in a row&#39;?\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453674/how-to-unpack-12bit-mono12packed-number","title":"How to unpack 12bit &#39;Mono12Packed&#39; number"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","static","currency","calculation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":909,"user_id":634914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zpnoa.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"howcheng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/634914/howcheng"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571430707,"post_id":58453672,"comment_id":103252615,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453672/how-to-use-static-currency-values-for-all-users-in-asp-net#comment103252615_58453672"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":12103024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49529a5fcc79cd5b9001690cadca4e96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hallowen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12103024/hallowen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571855994,"creation_date":1571411601,"last_edit_date":1571855994,"question_id":58453672,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58453672","body_markdown":"I am trying to use currency values for calculation in ASP.NET.

your data is in a `data.table` named `DT`:\r\n\r\nFirst filter `DT` where the `Positive_Test_Date` is not `NA` (since they&#39;re not useful for creating the new column)\r\n```R\r\nptd_notna &lt;- DT[!is.na(Positive_Test_Date)]\r\n```\r\nThen join your original table with this one on `ID` and `Cycle` and create a new column `idx` which is a boolean indicating whether the `Cycle_Date` of the *table X* is equal to the `Positive_Test_Date` of the *table i* for each group. Think of the join as `X[Y]`, so you refer to the columns of *X* through `x.colname` and the columns of *Y* through `i.colname` (since *Y* is in the `i` part of *X*).\r\n```r\r\nDT[ptd_notna, \r\n   idx := x.Cycle_Date == i.Positive_Test_Date, \r\n   on = .(ID, Cycle)]\r\n```\r\nNow you can use this new column `idx` to filter your table and assign the new column `LH_Date` equal to the `Cycle_Date`. Note how to use a boolean column in `i` you use paretheses.\r\n```r\r\nDT[(idx), LH_Date := Cycle_Date]\r\n```\r\nThen remove the `idx` if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need it.\r\n```r\r\nDT[, idx := NULL]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453655/how-to-create-a-new-column-in-data-table-based-on-values-of-other-columns/58454602#58454602","title":"How to create a new column in data.table based on values of other columns"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12239114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lp3dI8o5KIk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reuTXaZWcVBzMit8Xfvq1ODJnpJCw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user12239114","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239114/user12239114"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571686564,"post_id":58478501,"comment_id":103316014,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453655/how-to-create-a-new-column-in-data-table-based-on-values-of-other-columns/58478501#comment103316014_58478501"},{"owner":{"reputation":13717,"user_id":1989480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eacb7843bd819ab7a34299c21fee0873?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chinsoon12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1989480/chinsoon12"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12239114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lp3dI8o5KIk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reuTXaZWcVBzMit8Xfvq1ODJnpJCw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user12239114","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239114/user12239114"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571705544,"post_id":58478501,"comment_id":103321290,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453655/how-to-create-a-new-column-in-data-table-based-on-values-of-other-columns/58478501#comment103321290_58478501"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13717,"user_id":1989480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eacb7843bd819ab7a34299c21fee0873?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chinsoon12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1989480/chinsoon12"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13717,"user_id":1989480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eacb7843bd819ab7a34299c21fee0873?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chinsoon12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1989480/chinsoon12"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571705504,"last_edit_date":1571705504,"creation_date":1571618411,"answer_id":58478501,"question_id":58453655,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58478501","body_markdown":"Another option is to use indexing to find the rows that fits the condition and update those rows only:\r\n\r\n    #for each group of ID and Cycle, \r\n    #find the row indices where Cycle_Date equals the last Positive_Test_Date \r\n    idxDT &lt;- DT[, .I[Cycle_Date==Positive_Test_Date[.N]], .(ID, Cycle)]\r\n\r\n    #for those row indices, set the LH_Date to be Cycle_Date \r\n    #(NA rows or excluded rows defaults to NA by design in data.table)\r\n    DT[idxDT$V1, LH_Date := Cycle_Date]\r\n\r\n`idxDT` looks like this and `idxDT$V1` extracts the column `V1`:\r\n\r\n       ID Cycle V1\r\n    1:  1     1  2\r\n    2:  1     1 NA\r\n    3:  1     2  7\r\n    4:  1     2 NA\r\n    5:  2     1  9\r\n    6:  2     1 NA\r\n    7:  2     2 14\r\n    8:  2     2 NA\r\n\r\n`.I` contains the row index within a data.table.

have an app with two screens (view controller and tableview) I am trying to reload data in my table view each time user updates a filter used on the data.

The first set of arguments have to come from the source table itself (i.e., information about the schema, table name and column name), whereas the second from the metadata table itself (i.e. property_en and desc_en).\r\n\r\nEssentially, the first table (t1) provides:\r\n@level0name\r\n@level1name\r\n\r\nAnd t2:\r\n@name\r\n@value\r\n\r\nAnd the join is on @level2name, in other words where

attempting to move my javascript files to Webpack. I&#39;m not very familiar with Webpack so I am not sure that I have coded any of this correctly. I am trying to load jquery-ui, popper, and bootstrap 4. However, I am getting an error when requiring `Popper`. Please note that I am using the Wepacker gem for Ruby on Rails.\r\n\r\nI have included the following code in my environment.js file to include jQuery automatically in each file. \r\n\r\n\r\n    const { environment } = require(&#39;@rails/webpacker&#39;)\r\n\r\n    const webpack = require(&#39;webpack&#39;)\r\n    environment.plugins.append(&#39;Provide&#39;, new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\r\n      $: &#39;jquery&#39;,\r\n      jQuery: &#39;jquery&#39;\r\n    }))\r\n\r\n    module.exports = environment\r\n\r\nThis part works. So, from there I ran `yarn add jquery-ui`.\r\n\r\nThen in my /pack/application.js file I included `require(&#39;jquery-ui&#39;)`. \r\n\r\nFrom my js file the following code prints to my console:\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){\r\n        if (jQuery.ui) {\r\n          console.log(&quot;loaded&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAfter this I tried installing and requiring `popper` with `yarn add popper`. \r\n\r\nThen calling popper from inside my `document.ready` function I get an error:\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){\r\n\r\n        console.log(window.Popper)\r\n    \r\n    });\r\n\r\nThe error:\r\n \r\n    Uncaught Error: Module build failed (from ./node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js):\r\n    SyntaxError:

I will explain my problem in simpler terms. \r\n\r\nIn the below case, I am having 10 runnable and  three threads to execute the same. Consider my runnable is doing an insert operation and it is taking time to complete the  task. When I checked ,It is understood that ,if all the threads are busy, the other tasks will go to the queue and once the threads completed the tasks ,it will fetch the tasks from the pool and complete it.\r\n\r\nSo in this case, object of SampleRunnable 4 to 10 will be created and this will be in the pool.\r\n\r\nProblem: Since I need to load millions of tasks,I cannot load all the records in queue which can lead to memory issues. So my question is instead of taking all tasks in the queue  ,is it possible to make the main thread waiting  until any one of the executor worker threads becomes available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing approaches  I tried as a work around instead of queuing this much tasks:\r\n\r\nApproach 1: Used Array Blocking Queue for executor and gave the size as 5 (for e.g.)\r\nSo in this case, when the 9th task comes ,this will throw RejectedExecutionException and in the catch clause,put a sleep for 1 minute and recursively trying the same.This will get picked up on any of the retry when the thread is available.\r\n\r\nApproach 2:  Used shut down and await termination. i.e. if the task count is 5, i am putting shut down and await termination.

Answer\r\n------\r\n\r\nAfter reading comments and updated question I figured out that you want to fetch a small list of data and store it to database and show all the data stored in the database. If this is what you want, you can perform the following *(omitted DataSouce for brevity)* - \r\n\r\nIn `PostDao` You can return a `LiveData&lt;List&lt;MyData&gt;&gt;` instead of `List&lt;MyData&gt;` and observe that `LiveData` in the Activity to update the `RecyclerView`. Just make sure you remove the `suspend` keyword as `room` will take care of threading when it returns `LiveData`.\r\n\r\n    @Dao\r\n    interface PostsDao {\r\n        @Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM &quot; + Post.TABLE_NAME + &quot; ORDER BY &quot; + Post.COLUMN_ID + &quot; desc&quot;)\r\n        fun getAllData(): LiveData&lt;List&lt;MyData&gt;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        @Insert\r\n        suspend fun insertData(data: List&lt;MyData&gt;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn Repository make 2 functions one for fetching remote data and storing it to the database and the other just returns the `LiveData` returned by the `room`. You don&#39;t need to make a request to `room` when you insert the remote data, `room` will automatically update you as you are observing a `LiveData` from `room`.\r\n\r\n    class DataRepository(private val dao: PostsDao, private val dto: PostDto) {\r\n\r\n        fun getDataFromDatabase() = dao.getAllData()\r\n\r\n        suspend fun getDataFromServer(since: Long) = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {\r\n            val data = dto.getRemoteData(since)\r\n            saveDataToDatabase(data)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private suspend fun saveDataToDatabase(data: List&lt;MyData&gt;) = dao.insertData(data)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYour ViewModel should look like,\r\n\r\n    class DataViewModel(private val repository : DataRepository) : ViewModel() {\r\n\r\n        val dataList = repository.getDataFromDatabase()\r\n\r\n        fun data(since: Long) = viewModelScope.launch {\r\n           repository.getDataFromServer(since)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the Activity make sure you use [ListAdapter][1]\r\n\r\n    private lateinit var mDataViewModel: DataViewModel\r\n    private lateinit var mAdapter: ListAdapter\r\n    \r\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceBundle: Bundle?) {\r\n        ...\r\n        mDataViewModel.data(getSince())\r\n        mDataViewModel.dataList.observe(this, Observer(adapter::submitList))\r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInitial Answer\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I would recommend you to look into [Android Architecture Blueprints v2][2]. According to [Android Architecture Blueprints v2][2] following improvements can be made,\r\n\r\n 1. `DataRepository` should be **injected** rather than instantiating internally according to the Dependency Inversion principle.\r\n 2. You should **decouple** the functions in the `ViewModel`. Instead of returning the `LiveData`, the `data()` function can update an encapsulated `LiveData`. For example,\r\n\r\n\r\n        class DataViewModel(private val repository = DataRepository) : ViewModel() {\r\n            private val _dataList = MutableLiveData&lt;List&lt;MyData&gt;&gt;()\r\n            val dataList : LiveData&lt;List&lt;MyData&gt;&gt; = _dataList\r\n    \r\n            fun data(since: Long) = viewModelScope.launch {\r\n                val list = repository.getData(since)\r\n                _dataList.value = list\r\n            }\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n 3. `Repository` should be responsible for fetching data from remote data source and save it to local data source. You should have two data source i.e. `RemoteDataSource` and `LocalDataSource` that should be injected in the Repository. You can also have an abstract `DataSource`. Let&#39;s see how can you improve your repository,\r\n\r\n        interface DataSource {\r\n            suspend fun getData(since: Long) : List&lt;MyData&gt;\r\n            suspend fun saveData(list List&lt;MyData&gt;)\r\n            suspend fun delete()\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        class RemoteDataSource(dto: PostsDto) : DataSource { ... }\r\n        class LocalDataSource(dao: PostsDao) : DataSource { ... }\r\n\r\n        class DataRepository(private val remoteSource: DataSource, private val localSource: DataSource) {\r\n            suspend fun getData(since: Long) : List&lt;MyData&gt; = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {\r\n                val data = remoteSource.getData(since)\r\n                localSource.delete()\r\n                localSource.save(data)\r\n                return@withContext localSource.getData(since)\r\n            }\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n\r\n 4.

As I mentioned I&#39;m using Room, but Room will not let you access the database on the main thread.\r\n\r\nRemember, I have to save in the database first, then retrieve from the database, so I don&#39;t want to call `mDataViewModel.data().observe` until after it saves to the database.\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper approach to this?  I&#39;ve tried doing CoroutineScope on the mDataViewModel.saveData() then `.invokeOnCompletion` to do `mDataViewModel.data().observe`, but it doesn&#39;t save to the database.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m doing my Coroutines incorrectly, but not sure where exactly.\r\n\r\nIt will also eventually need to delete and update records from the database.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58453609/android-app-retrieve-data-from-server-save-in-database-and-display-to-user","title":"Android app retrieve data from server, save in database and display to user"},{"tags":["apache-nifi-registry"],"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":1739784,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzpyD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanp_1982","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1739784/juanp-1982"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571411370,"creation_date":1571411370,"question_id":58453607,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58453607","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to delete a flow in nifi registry, but I&#39;m getting this error in the ui (and in the logs) &quot;ERROR: Flow version is not added yet, can not be serialized.&quot;.
