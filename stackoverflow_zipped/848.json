I want a formula to calculate the &#39;Employeed in last 12 months&#39;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n!https://imgur.com/a/BbavKep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340885/returning-yes-or-no-depending-on-results-of-2-date-columns","title":"Returning Yes or No depending on results of 2 date columns"},{"tags":["android"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1082,"user_id":1954960,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIle.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zafer Celaloglu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1954960/zafer-celaloglu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571384640,"post_id":58340884,"comment_id":103230674,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340884/how-to-start-alarm-manager-on-device-reboot#comment103230674_58340884"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12051344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mALJMI3u5t5kTcfUmfRNVb87BD0fvI3MC62U3-iMA=k-s128","display_name":"Saif Thaha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12051344/saif-thaha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570795817,"post_id":58340946,"comment_id":103037143,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340884/how-to-start-alarm-manager-on-device-reboot/58340946#comment103037143_58340946"},{"owner":{"reputation":1082,"user_id":1954960,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIle.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zafer Celaloglu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1954960/zafer-celaloglu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12051344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mALJMI3u5t5kTcfUmfRNVb87BD0fvI3MC62U3-iMA=k-s128","display_name":"Saif Thaha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12051344/saif-thaha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570796687,"post_id":58340946,"comment_id":103037621,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340884/how-to-start-alarm-manager-on-device-reboot/58340946#comment103037621_58340946"},{"owner":{"reputation":339,"user_id":4408588,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002483357368/picture?type=large","display_name":"Janusz Hain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4408588/janusz-hain"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570798235,"post_id":58340946,"comment_id":103038420,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340884/how-to-start-alarm-manager-on-device-reboot/58340946#comment103038420_58340946"},{"owner":{"reputation":1082,"user_id":1954960,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIle.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zafer Celaloglu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1954960/zafer-celaloglu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":339,"user_id":4408588,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002483357368/picture?type=large","display_name":"Janusz Hain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4408588/janusz-hain"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570798445,"post_id":58340946,"comment_id":103038523,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340884/how-to-start-alarm-manager-on-device-reboot/58340946#comment103038523_58340946"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1082,"user_id":1954960,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIle.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zafer Celaloglu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1954960/zafer-celaloglu"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570795599,"creation_date":1570795599,"answer_id":58340946,"question_id":58340884,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340946","body_markdown":"you need to create a `BroadcastReceiver` in order to be able to listen REBOOT event that is delivered by OS and then you can start your alarm manager there again","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340884/how-to-start-alarm-manager-on-device-reboot/58340946#58340946","title":"How to start Alarm Manager on Device Reboot"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5890471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rInEqk0-gaY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/RA4ZABxb2M8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"DeCoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5890471/decoder"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570796342,"creation_date":1570796342,"answer_id":58341131,"question_id":58340884,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58341131","body_markdown":"Well here is a complete example of an AutoStart Application.\r\n\r\nGive permission of RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED in manifest file, and register your broadcast for BOOT_COMPLETED.\r\n\r\n**AndroidManifest file**\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

It works fine for me. But if I restart the phone within that 5 minutes I don&#39;t get the notification. I have done a research on Alarm Manager and Scheduling Notifications on device reboots. I have a basic idea but I really don&#39;t know how to implement it into my project. I have 4 classes in my project.   They are:   \r\n\r\n- MainActivity\r\n- NotificationUtil\r\n- NotificationPublisher\r\n- NotificationView\r\n\r\nThis is the my NotificationUtil class:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class NotificationUtil\r\n{\r\n    public static void createNotification(Context context,Class&lt;?&gt; cls, String title, String content)\r\n    {\r\n        Intent intent = new Intent(context,cls);\r\n        intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK);\r\n        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0, intent, 0);\r\n\r\n        sendNotification(getNotification(pendingIntent,context,title,content),context);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void sendNotification(Notification notification,Context context)\r\n    {\r\n        Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(context, NotificationPublisher.class);\r\n        notificationIntent.putExtra(NotificationPublisher.NOTIFICATION_ID,1);\r\n        notificationIntent.putExtra(NotificationPublisher.NOTIFICATION,notification);\r\n        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,0,notificationIntent,PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);\r\n        \r\n        AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager)context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);\r\n        alarmManager.set(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP, SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() + 5*60 * 1000,pendingIntent);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static Notification getNotification(PendingIntent pendingIntent, Context context, String title, String content)\r\n    {\r\n        NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(context,&quot;ChannelID&quot;);\r\n        builder.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_bell);\r\n        builder.setContentTitle(title);\r\n        builder.setContentText(&quot;You have a Notification&quot;);\r\n        builder.setSubText(&quot;Tap To View&quot;);\r\n        builder.setStyle(new NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle().bigText(content));\r\n        builder.setContentIntent(pendingIntent);\r\n        return builder.build();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my NotificationPublisher class:\r\n```\r\npublic class NotificationPublisher extends BroadcastReceiver {\r\n\r\n    public static String NOTIFICATION_ID = &quot;notification_id&quot;;\r\n    public static String NOTIFICATION = &quot;notification&quot;;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onReceive(final Context context, Intent intent) {\r\n\r\n        NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager) context.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);\r\n\r\n        Notification notification = intent.getParcelableExtra(NOTIFICATION);\r\n        int notificationId = intent.getIntExtra(NOTIFICATION_ID, 1);\r\n        notificationManager.notify(notificationId, notification);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is how I call the NotificationUtil class on button click in the MainActivity:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\r\n    private Button button;\r\n    private Context context;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n\r\n        button = findViewById(R.id.notification);\r\n        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onClick(View v) {\r\n                NotificationUtil.createNotification(MainActivity.this,NotificationView.class,&quot;Notification&quot;,&quot;You have a new Task&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my manifest file:\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

I tried putting this in the onReceive function\r\n```\r\n Intent pushIntent = new Intent(context, NotificationPublisher.class);\r\n            context.startService(pushIntent);\r\n```\r\nWorks normal, but if I reboot my phone, after 5 minutes I get a message &quot;The Application has stopped working&quot;\r\n\r\nI have a basic idea after having gone through these tutorials but I don&#39;t know how to implement them into my project\r\n\r\nhttps://www.stacktips.com/tutorials/android/repeat-alarm-example-in-android\r\nhttps://droidmentor.com/schedule-notifications-using-alarmmanager/ \r\n\r\nWhat I need is, to get the notification even after my phone is rebooted. If any one out there who could help me to achieve this, I would be grateful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340884/how-to-start-alarm-manager-on-device-reboot","title":"How to start Alarm Manager on Device Reboot"},{"tags":["magento"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1021,"user_id":672722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcdC1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jinesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/672722/jinesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570797006,"post_id":58340883,"comment_id":103037775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340883/magento-2-3-2-bulk-update-price-attribute-is-not-working#comment103037775_58340883"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6219454,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26687a80f200e62496279eab5ce5e799?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sanjeev Kumar Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6219454/sanjeev-kumar-sharma"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1021,"user_id":672722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcdC1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jinesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/672722/jinesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570797394,"post_id":58340883,"comment_id":103037988,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340883/magento-2-3-2-bulk-update-price-attribute-is-not-working#comment103037988_58340883"},{"owner":{"reputation":1021,"user_id":672722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcdC1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jinesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/672722/jinesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570797600,"post_id":58340883,"comment_id":103038079,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340883/magento-2-3-2-bulk-update-price-attribute-is-not-working#comment103038079_58340883"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6219454,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26687a80f200e62496279eab5ce5e799?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sanjeev Kumar Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6219454/sanjeev-kumar-sharma"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570795390,"creation_date":1570795390,"question_id":58340883,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340883","body_markdown":"After upgrade magento 2.3.2 bulk update price attribute is not working it is showing on progress but if I update inventory qty then it update quickly ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340883/magento-2-3-2-bulk-update-price-attribute-is-not-working","title":"magento 2.3.2 bulk update price attribute is not working"},{"tags":["post","share","line-breaks","linkedin-api"],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":7955380,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f3ac78d647a9f51d4609faf584eaaaa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ramya.K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7955380/ramya-k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11415,"user_id":4420967,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6pYX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4420967/james-z"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570857545,"creation_date":1570795376,"last_edit_date":1570857545,"question_id":58340878,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340878","body_markdown":"if we give the Line break/Enter in the Caption and share the post to LinkedIn, the API to share the article to Linkedin Account is not working.

Either via a different plugin or by editing the source code (if that&#39;s even possible).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340858/how-to-create-a-xmlhttprequest-post-within-a-polarion-work-item-post-save-script","title":"How to create a XMLHttpRequest POST within a Polarion Work Item post-save script"},{"tags":["javascript","asynchronous","testing","jestjs"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":10467064,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JcXmefj2Sb0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DUGRm3o8ZXUvEfn7wawy7xzK3Ti3g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michal Kurz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10467064/michal-kurz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570795986,"post_id":58340928,"comment_id":103037238,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340857/how-to-avoid-re-running-asynchronous-api-call-for-each-jest-test-case/58340928#comment103037238_58340928"},{"owner":{"reputation":25784,"user_id":7053190,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPZdC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ankit Agarwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7053190/ankit-agarwal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23,"user_id":10467064,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JcXmefj2Sb0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DUGRm3o8ZXUvEfn7wawy7xzK3Ti3g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michal Kurz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10467064/michal-kurz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570796127,"post_id":58340928,"comment_id":103037309,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340857/how-to-avoid-re-running-asynchronous-api-call-for-each-jest-test-case/58340928#comment103037309_58340928"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":25784,"user_id":7053190,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPZdC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ankit Agarwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7053190/ankit-agarwal"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570795530,"creation_date":1570795530,"answer_id":58340928,"question_id":58340857,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340928","body_markdown":"You need to add a `beforeAll` block that will run only once for all the test cases.

We&#39;ll use this to offset the second bar.\r\n    bar_width = 0.4\r\n    # Note we add the `width` parameter now which sets the width of each bar.\r\n    b1 = ax.bar(x, data.loc[data[&#39;Sex&#39;] == &#39;0&#39;, &#39;count&#39;], width=bar_width)\r\n    # Same thing, but offset the x by the width of the bar.\r\n    b2 = ax.bar(x + bar_width, data.loc[data[&#39;Sex&#39;] == &#39;1&#39;, &#39;count&#39;], width=bar_width)\r\nThis raised the following error: KeyError: &#39;count&#39;\r\n\r\nThen I tried to change the code a bit and got another error:\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\r\n    import pylab as pyl\r\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))\r\n    x = np.arange(len(data.Age.unique()))\r\n    # Define bar width. We&#39;ll use this to offset the second bar.\r\n    bar_width = 0.4\r\n    # Note we add the `width` parameter now which sets the width of each bar.\r\n    b1 = ax.bar(x, (data.loc[data[&#39;Sex&#39;] == &#39;0&#39;].count()), width=bar_width)\r\n    # Same thing, but offset the x by the width of the bar.\r\n    b2 = ax.bar(x + bar_width, (data.loc[data[&#39;Sex&#39;] == &#39;1&#39;].count()), width=bar_width)\r\n\r\nThis raised the error: ValueError: shape mismatch: objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape\r\n\r\nNow how do I count the results that I do can make this grouped bar chart?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340852/python-grouped-bar-chart-count-doesnt-work","title":"Python Grouped bar chart.

have to do a final project for my last year as a student, and I wanted to do an app for Android in Android Studio with Java. I though that it was a good idea to do something with web-scraping, but I am not sure how to do it. My idea is to make a database that stores all the scraped data and update it every day for any change in the scraped webpages, for later extract the data from the database and use it in the android app, it is like a comparator of products so i though it was the best way (maybe I am wrong, just say it if you have a better idea of how to do it). Well, for Android Studio, using Java, with little knowledge of web scraping, what are the best databases, web scraping tools or anything I need, to do it on my own, for free, and the least complicated way possible?. At first I thought for my application to use jsoup to do the scraping, but I don&#39;t know if it is the best option to store the data in a database, besides I don&#39;t know what databases allow to save scraped data to then use them in a java application from android. As you see I am kind of lost so I need advice to know what I have to do exactly, and organize myself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340839/databases-and-tools-for-web-scraping-in-a-java-android-studio-app-project","title":"Databases and tools for web-scraping, in a java

Also I am quite new to coding, so if you could point me in the right direction (I can&#39;t define the problem better at the moment) I would be very thankful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340779/adding-n-times-new-parameters-while-keeping-the-starting-point","title":"Adding n times new parameters while keeping the starting point"},{"tags":["json","oracle","clob"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4357,"user_id":1332870,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gBAKd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ersin G&#252;lbahar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1332870/ersin-g%c3%bclbahar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570795167,"creation_date":1570795167,"answer_id":58340832,"question_id":58340777,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340832","body_markdown":"&gt; The character string returned by this function is of data type\r\n&gt; VARCHAR2.

What is a suitable design pattern to use? Can I use more than one design pattern?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help as I am eager to learn more about organizing my code in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340727/selection-of-an-adequate-architecture-design-pattern-for-minimal-working-example","title":"selection of an adequate architecture/design pattern for minimal working example"},{"tags":["c++"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9943,"user_id":7582247,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OH0qZNY40Y4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABbc/xAoU3i299E0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ted Lyngmo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7582247/ted-lyngmo"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570794946,"post_id":58340722,"comment_id":103036695,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340722/how-to-fix-sizeof-not-giving-the-expected-result-in-an-array-parameter-in-a-fu#comment103036695_58340722"},{"owner":{"reputation":90,"user_id":9117265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-s19RzxP6IeM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAZWo/rKC4GJYOnZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Neel Darji","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9117265/neel-darji"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570795213,"post_id":58340722,"comment_id":103036839,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340722/how-to-fix-sizeof-not-giving-the-expected-result-in-an-array-parameter-in-a-fu#comment103036839_58340722"},{"owner":{"reputation":5957,"user_id":3684343,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bee557e309dc42d91a706c70c8c0c9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3684343/mch"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570795240,"post_id":58340722,"comment_id":103036853,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340722/how-to-fix-sizeof-not-giving-the-expected-result-in-an-array-parameter-in-a-fu#comment103036853_58340722"},{"owner":{"reputation":3576,"user_id":512225,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b01d1b190b75cd4a4c828052fd3bedbb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jimifiki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/512225/jimifiki"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570796052,"post_id":58340722,"comment_id":103037273,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340722/how-to-fix-sizeof-not-giving-the-expected-result-in-an-array-parameter-in-a-fu#comment103037273_58340722"},{"owner":{"reputation":17023,"user_id":9528746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ukFe1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Max Langhof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9528746/max-langhof"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570796528,"post_id":58340722,"comment_id":103037532,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340722/how-to-fix-sizeof-not-giving-the-expected-result-in-an-array-parameter-in-a-fu#comment103037532_58340722"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":10372185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4790b7a9684cd88ebffac101697b700?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"P.Gracia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10372185/p-gracia"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570795262,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570795298,"creation_date":1570794738,"question_id":58340722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340722","body_markdown":"So I&#39;m doing a small task with C++ (never worked with this language before) and I encountered a problem with using &#39;sizeof&#39; in an array to find its length. When I use it inside main() it works as expected, but if I use it inside a function it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s clear that I&#39;m missing some knowledge on very basic topics of C++ so I&#39;ve come to find some guidance (I have checked the related questions of stack overflow and none provides some theory on what&#39;s happening, only ways of solving it in a different way).\r\n\r\nI would also like to point out that I&#39;ve seen different ways of making this work, but I would like to know why this one is not working and learn from it, thanks!\r\n\r\nThis is the code that I&#39;m using:\r\n```C++\r\n// function example\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\n// functions used\r\nfloat max_value_array(float array[]);\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n  float rand_vec[] = {3, 2, 7, 5, 4};\r\n  float max_num = max_value_array(rand_vec);\r\n  cout &lt;&lt; max_num;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfloat max_value_array(float array[])\r\n{\r\n  int len_array = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);\r\n\r\n  float max_number = array[0];\r\n\r\n  for (int i = 1; i &lt; len_array; i++)\r\n  {\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; array[i] &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n    if (array[i] &gt; max_number)\r\n    {\r\n      max_number = array[i];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return max_number;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(`&lt;vector&gt;` is included because I&#39;m using it in a different part of the code)\r\n\r\nWhat I would expect from this code is to return `7`, however I&#39;m getting `3`. Upon investigation I found out that if I return `len_array` in `max_value_array` I&#39;m getting `1` (and thus, getting the first element of the array as the loop doesn&#39;t start), which means that either the vector is not correctly passed, or that operation does not work. However if I return `array[3]` I get `5`, which means the array is passed correctly. \r\n\r\nI also saw that when I return `sizeof(array)` I get `4`, and the same value if I return `sizeof(array[0])` (4). However, if I use `cout` in the main function to log both `sizeof(rand_vec)` and `sizeof(rand_vec[0])` I get respectively 520 and 4, which makes me think that there is something about `sizeof` and arrays that I&#39;m not understanding. \r\n\r\nWhy does this happen?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340722/how-to-fix-sizeof-not-giving-the-expected-result-in-an-array-parameter-in-a-fu","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How to fix

However, this is the missing mapping piece you need to get Dozer to map these two fields since they have different names.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340712/dozer-mapping-for-complex-objects/58342236#58342236","title":"Dozer mapping for complex objects"}],"owner":{"reputation":256,"user_id":1773702,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8a1f07bf80fa3a855d8bdc0f2062892?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"azaveri7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1773702/azaveri7"},"last_editor":{"reputation":256,"user_id":1773702,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8a1f07bf80fa3a855d8bdc0f2062892?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"azaveri7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1773702/azaveri7"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571324705,"creation_date":1570794680,"last_edit_date":1571219436,"question_id":58340712,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340712","body_markdown":"I have 2 POJOs as shown below :\r\n\r\n    package com.main.java.src;\r\n\r\n        public class SourceObj {\r\n        \r\n        protected String name;\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        10 String objects\r\n        \r\n        protected Addresses addresses; \r\n        \r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        getter and setter for all fields\r\n        \r\n        }\r\n    ---------    \r\n    package com.java.main.src;\r\n    \r\n        public class Addresses {\r\n         protected List&lt;Address&gt; address;\r\n        ...\r\n        getters and setters\r\n        }\r\n--------------\r\n        package com.main.java.src;\r\n\r\n        public class Address {\r\n           protected String city;\r\n        \r\n           protected List&lt;Contact&gt; contact;\r\n        \r\n        ...\r\n        \r\n        getters &amp; setters\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    -----\r\n    package com.main.java.dest;\r\n        public class DestObj {\r\n        \r\n        protected String name;\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        10 String objects\r\n        \r\n        protected Addresses addresses; \r\n        \r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        getter and setter for all fields\r\n        \r\n        }\r\n        \r\n    ----------------\r\n    package com.main.java.dest;\r\n    \r\n        public class Addresses {\r\n         protected List&lt;Address&gt; address;\r\n        ...\r\n        getters and setters\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n    package com.main.java.dest;\r\n        public class Address {\r\n           protected String city;\r\n        \r\n           protected List&lt;Contact&gt; contact;\r\n        \r\n        ...\r\n        \r\n        getters &amp; setters\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    Now i have the dozer-configuration.xml as follows:\r\n    \r\n        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n        &lt;mappings xmlns=&quot;http://dozer.sourceforge.net&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n        \txsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://dozer.sourceforge.net http://dozer.sourceforge.net/schema/beanmapping.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;configuration&gt;\r\n        \t\t&lt;stop-on-errors&gt;true&lt;/stop-on-errors&gt;\r\n        \t\t&lt;trim-strings&gt;true&lt;/trim-strings&gt;\r\n        \t\t&lt;relationship-type&gt;non-cumulative&lt;/relationship-type&gt;\t\t\r\n        \t&lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n        \t\r\n        \t&lt;mapping&gt;\r\n        \t\t&lt;class-a&gt;com.main.java.src.SourceObj&lt;/class-a&gt;\r\n        \t\t&lt;class-b&gt;com.main.java.dest.DestObj&lt;/class-b&gt;\r\n                &lt;field&gt;\r\n                    &lt;a&gt;addresses.address&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                    &lt;b&gt;addresses.address&lt;/b&gt;\r\n                    &lt;a-hint&gt;com.main.java.src.Address&lt;/a-hint&gt;\r\n                    &lt;b-hint&gt;com.main.java.dest.Address&lt;/b-hint&gt;\r\n                &lt;field&gt;\t\r\n        \t&lt;/mapping&gt;\r\n        &lt;/mappings&gt;\r\n\r\nNow the above mapping copies fields like name from SourceObj to DestObj, but not able to map List of Address from src package to List of Address of dest package.

or Problem statement:#\r\nIt&#39;s New Year&#39;s Day and everyone&#39;s in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride! There are a number of people queued up, and each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue. Initial positions increment by 1 from 1 at the front of the line to n at the back.\r\n\r\nAny person in the queue can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions. If two people swap positions, they still wear the same sticker denoting their original places in line. One person can bribe at most two others. For example, if n = 8 and Person 5 bribes Person 4, the queue will look like this: 1,2,3,5,4,6,7,8.\r\n\r\nFascinated by this chaotic queue, you decide you must know the minimum number of bribes that took place to get the queue into its current state!\r\n\r\n#Function Description#\r\nComplete the function minimumBribes in the editor below.

There are different definitions which may differ in details but I&#39;ll stick to Martin Fowler&#39;s one for [Repository][1]:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; (...) A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. (...) \r\n\r\nand for [service][2]:\r\n\r\n&gt; A Service Layer defines an application&#39;s boundary [Cockburn PloP] and its set of available operations from the perspective of interfacing client layers. **It encapsulates the application&#39;s business logic, controlling transactions and coor-dinating responses in the implementation of its operations.**\r\n\r\nIt is worth pointing out that `service` isn&#39;t just `repository` + business logic. For most simple scenarios `repository` just wraps up accessing single database, but for advanced scenarios creating single entity may require accesing multiple databases, so `repository` role is to remove this woffle from `service` layer. \r\n\r\nAnd here is what you could come up with:\r\n\r\n1. Use `EntityARepository` directly in `EntityBService` if what you&#39;re trying to do is just fetching `EntityA` without any business logic related to `EntityA`. Here is a simple example:\r\n\r\n&gt; `EntityBService` performs operation on `EntityB`, but it depends on purely `EntityA` state.\r\n\r\n2. Use `EntityAService` in `EntityBService` if requesting `EntityA` involves some business logic related to `EntityA`. Here is a simple example:\r\n\r\n&gt; `EntityBService` performs operation on `EntityB` and `EntityA` and later needs to be created if it doesn&#39;t exist - creation involves a business logic like checking is it allowed (e.g. based on user role).\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html\r\n  [2]: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340656/using-multiple-services-or-multiple-repositories-within-service/58341992#58341992","title":"Using multiple services or multiple repositories within service?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26282,"user_id":54734,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea91774321962f70f19362f43568cda9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VoiceOfUnreason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/54734/voiceofunreason"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570854076,"creation_date":1570854076,"answer_id":58350821,"question_id":58340656,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58350821","body_markdown":"&gt; Is there common design pattern around this topic or recommendations?\r\n\r\nOne common practice is to avoid changing entities that are stored in different places in the same transaction.  One way to ensure that you never do that is to have only one entity active in any transaction.\r\n\r\nSo we might reasonably have entityA, and a _copy_ of the information we need from B.  Or we might have entityB, and a copy of the information we need from A.\r\n\r\nFor use cases where we aren&#39;t changing either entity, we can just use copies of the data.\r\n\r\nIn the case where we are using `entityA` and `recent-copy-of-B`, we know that entityA comes from a repository.  Where does `recent-copy-of-B` come from?  Well, it comes from an abstraction that looks something like a repository, except (a) it fetches values, rather than entities and (b) it is read only.\r\n\r\n`recent-copy-of-B` looks something like a DTO.  And while you might use the same one everywhere, it is actually safe (because values are immutable) to create specialized versions for different use cases.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340656/using-multiple-services-or-multiple-repositories-within-service/58350821#58350821","title":"Using multiple services or multiple repositories within service?"}],"owner":{"reputation":231,"user_id":2544506,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f47a41d7c4dbf03aa0c0074dc4bbc3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tschaka1904","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2544506/tschaka1904"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1119,"user_id":2004186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Gtyd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krzysztof Skrzynecki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2004186/krzysztof-skrzynecki"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570854076,"creation_date":1570794461,"last_edit_date":1570799519,"question_id":58340656,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340656","body_markdown":"Imagine we have two entities, `EntityA` and `EntityB`.

first lines of both your removeDuplicate and findDuplicate function seems indeed to indicate that you refer to the active spreadsheet / sheet / range\r\n\r\n      var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();\r\n      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();\r\n      var range = sheet.getActiveRange();\r\n      var data = range.getValues();\r\n\r\nIf you want to be able to use the same function for a given spreadsheet / sheet / range which is not the active one, you will need to use other functions than the getActiveXXX().\r\n\r\nFor example, to get the sheet named &quot;Blacklist&quot;, you should use \r\n`sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(&quot;Blacklist&quot;)`\r\n(see also https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#getsheetbynamename)\r\n\r\nIf you want to access a specific range which differs from the active range, you should use the getRange method (see also https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#getrangea1notation)\r\nNote that getRange method can be used in different ways, e.g. \r\n`getRange(&quot;A1:D4&quot;)`, `getRange(1, 1, 3, 3)` (the parameters being respectively startRow, startColumn, numRows,numColumns)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you don&#39;t want to hardcode the last line of your 2 columns, you will most probably need this function to find the last line in the code :\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#getlastrow\r\n(there is also an example there showing how to use getRange() in combination with getLastRow()).\r\n\r\nI hope this will help you going further.\r\nPlease note that I didn&#39;t check the rest of your code and just assumed that your deduplication logic works fine as you mentioned it in your commment.\r\n\r\nGood luck !","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340642/remove-duplicates-across-multiple-sheets/58343048#58343048","title":"Remove duplicates across multiple

I use a div that contains an img tag, and based on a mouse wheel event, I&#39;m successfully changing the source of the image (using my own function called changeFrame()). This function is also linked to a numeric input and a jQuery slider that get automatically updated when the frame changes and vice versa.\r\n\r\nI assume two cases: the user scrolls on the div using a mouse (with a wheel) or with the mouse pad (using two fingers). Both cases are working.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to **preventing the default scroll behaviour** (the whole page scrolling up or down), I am having some problems when I use the mouse pad.\r\n\r\nIf I use *event.preventDefault()*, it works perfectly with the mouse wheel, but if I use two fingers it doesn&#39;t. I am very confused, because both event are reacting to the dame eventListener (&#39;DOMMouseScroll&#39; and &#39;mousewheel&#39;).
