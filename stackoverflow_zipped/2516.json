The two pieces of information that are important to check match up are the package name, let&#39;s use **`com.sample.app`** as an example and the Google account, let&#39;s use **`sample@gmail.com`** as an example.\r\n\r\nVerify package name matches up:\r\n\r\n - You should have `com.sample.app` as an app in your Play Console account for `sample@gmail.com` (it can be in any track)\r\n - You should have the `com.sample.app` APK installed on your test device\r\n - You should have an actions.xml in the source code for the app with package `com.sample.app` - you should run the App Actions Test Tool from this project\r\n\r\nVerify the Google account matches up:\r\n\r\n - You should be logged into Android Studio with `sample@gmail.com`\r\n - You should be logged into your test device with `sample@gmail.com`, you should also have Google Assistant set up with the same account (ensure you can trigger Google Assistant for that account)\r\n\r\nYou should also verify:\r\n\r\n - You can successfully trigger the defined Android deep links defined in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (the ones that `actions.xml` will call), see [here][1] for how to test using `adb`. You could also specify your package name in the `adb` command to test even more accurately how Assistant will call your app.\r\n\r\nIf you still have issues, try looking at `adb logcat` for the exact `Intent` that Assistant is trying to call. Note that you will need to turn off a filter for your package name if you are looking in Android Studio. The log will come from the Google Search app (which is what runs Assistant). It should hopefully tell you the package name and Android `Intent` params it is trying to call your app with, which will let you work out what&#39;s going wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developers.google.com/actions/appactions/quickstart#deeplink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936224/app-actions-test-tool-with-google-assistant-shows-sorry-i-couldnt-find-it/57951935#57951935","title":"App Actions test tool with google assistant shows &quot;Sorry, I couldn&#39;t find it&quot;"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15240,"user_id":268156,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLq1c.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AdamK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/268156/adamk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568672928,"post_id":57952017,"comment_id":102341119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936224/app-actions-test-tool-with-google-assistant-shows-sorry-i-couldnt-find-it/57952017#comment102341119_57952017"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":133,"user_id":2207107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2fc83a88f6f39988632437eb7576d45?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"takharsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2207107/takharsh"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568618174,"creation_date":1568618174,"answer_id":57952017,"question_id":57936224,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57952017","body_markdown":"Thanks for quick response.

I am exporting a [IClassifierProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.text.classification.iclassifierprovider?view=visualstudiosdk-2019) in order to be able to change the formatting of certain C# syntax nodes based on something that requires the access to the semantic model (I am using Roslyn). This means that it is relatively computationally expensive to determine whether to classify a certain node or not. Once the user starts typing in Visual Studio, each typed character results in a new semantic model being generated. This makes the coding experience bad.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to tell Visual Studio to wait some time (e.g. 200 millisecond) before deciding to invoke my classifier? If less than 200ms pass between one character being typed and the other, Visual Studio will wait another 200ms before deciding to invoke the classifier. This means that the classifier will only be invoked after 200ms of the user being idle (not changing the code). This will make the experience much better for the developers using the extension.\r\n\r\nThe IClassifier interface has a ClassificationChanged event that I can use to tell Visual Studio that some span needs reclassification. I thought about using this. I would return an empty list when GetClassificationSpans is called in the first time, and then invoke ClassificationChanged  asynchronously after some 200 ms. But there seems to be no way to know if the current invocation of GetClassificationSpans was the result of my recent call to ClassificationChanged or not. The contract of IClassifier doesn&#39;t even guarantee (as far as I understand it), that it will call GetClassificationSpans  with the same span I passed to ClassificationChanged. E.g. What if it decided to split the span into two? Or maybe merge it with another span?\r\n\r\nOne solution I am thinking about is to manually monitor the changes in the current document (via the ITextBuffer.Changed event), monitor the time between changes, &quot;enable&quot; the classifier when I think the time is right for classification, invoke &quot;ClassificationChanged&quot; to trigger classification, then &quot;disable&quot; the classifier after classification.\r\n\r\nAlthough this solution might work, is there a clean way to do this?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936221/enhance-the-performance-of-iclassifier","title":"Enhance the performance of IClassifier"},{"tags":["java","split","key-value"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6103,"user_id":4956907,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ypfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"michalk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4956907/michalk"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1568469740,"post_id":57936220,"comment_id":102288348,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936220/split-string-in-java-in-form-of-key-value-pair#comment102288348_57936220"},{"owner":{"reputation":6103,"user_id":4956907,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ypfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"michalk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4956907/michalk"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568469814,"post_id":57936220,"comment_id":102288370,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936220/split-string-in-java-in-form-of-key-value-pair#comment102288370_57936220"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":7810174,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ILYl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GraphicStone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7810174/graphicstone"},"last_editor":{"reputation":733,"user_id":4905480,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/865b3e8d6ba3b34fb76e7758ca032117?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matthew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4905480/matthew"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1568474667,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568472961,"creation_date":1568469685,"last_edit_date":1568472961,"question_id":57936220,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57936220","body_markdown":"I am new in java so this might seem to be a silly question for many of you, but please help me out.

since you need only Currency code and Continent code, you can fetch all this info from one table `Countries`, so no real need for joins here.\r\n\r\nI understand the &quot;most-used currency&quot; as a currency that is used in most number of countries on that continent.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand what &quot;filter any currency that is used in only one country&quot; means, so I ignored this sentence.\r\n\r\nAt first, `GROUP BY ContinentCode, CurrencyCode` to get the count of countries that use this currency, for each continent\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n        ContinentCode, CurrencyCode, COUNT(*) AS UseCount\r\n    FROM Countries\r\n    GROUP BY ContinentCode, CurrencyCode\r\n\r\nNow, we need to get one, most used currency for each continent. It is a `top-n-per-group` problem. One variant is to use `ROW_NUMBER` function.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll use CTEs (common-table expressions) to make the query readable.\r\n\r\n    WITH\r\n    CTE\r\n    AS\r\n    (\r\n        SELECT\r\n            ContinentCode, CurrencyCode, COUNT(*) AS UseCount\r\n        FROM Countries\r\n        GROUP BY ContinentCode, CurrencyCode\r\n    )\r\n    ,CTE_rn\r\n    AS\r\n    (\r\n        SELECT\r\n            ContinentCode, CurrencyCode, UseCount,\r\n            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ContinentCode ORDER BY UseCount DESC, CurrencyCode) AS rn\r\n        FROM CTE\r\n        WHERE UseCount &gt; 1\r\n    )\r\n    SELECT\r\n        ContinentCode, CurrencyCode, UseCount\r\n    FROM CTE_rn\r\n    WHERE rn = 1\r\n    ;\r\n\r\n\r\nI added `CurrencyCode` in the `ORDER BY` to resolve possible ties. If there is more than one currency that is used in the same number of countries on a continent, they will get the same `UseCount`. In this case the query selects one currency based on their `CurrencyCode`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936217/all-continents-and-their-most-used-currency/57936380#57936380","title":"All continents and their most used currency"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":526,"user_id":9569910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"cte6","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9569910/cte6"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568488680,"creation_date":1568488680,"answer_id":57938536,"question_id":57936217,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938536","body_markdown":"If what you need is the list of Currencies that are used in more than one country, you can use `having`:\r\n\r\n    SELECT c.CurrencyCode, \r\n           COUNT(*)\r\n    FROM dbo.Countries AS c\r\n    GROUP BY c.CurrencyCode\r\n    HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936217/all-continents-and-their-most-used-currency/57938536#57938536","title":"All continents and their most used currency"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12031518,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c00c88e8cfe31d93f35c66f4a2851f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"keylin.rion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031518/keylin-rion"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24546,"user_id":4116017,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HuK9Y.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vladimir Baranov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4116017/vladimir-baranov"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57936380,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568506136,"creation_date":1568469675,"last_edit_date":1568470919,"question_id":57936217,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57936217","body_markdown":"I have the following database:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ln1bc.png\r\n\r\nI am trying to write a query that finds all **continents** and their **most-used currency** and filter any currency that is used in **only one country**.

am looking for a general solution to apply across the project for every scenario with grids following each other. \r\n\r\nOut of the box, when grids with .grid-margin-y following each other, half a grid gutter is produced between them, making it very hard to apply general rules for a consistent appearance.\r\n\r\nIf a grid with .grid-margin-y is followed by a grid without .grid-margin-y, they will have no gutter between them.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would always be the case. I can make that the case by applying &quot;overflow: hidden&quot; to the grid-containers, but that would not allow for absolutely positioned content to flow outside the grid, and seems more like a hack.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example Codepen:\r\nhttps://codepen.io/pettere/pen/ExYmKWP\r\n\r\n\r\n      body {\r\n        padding: 30px;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      .demo {\r\n        background:

For this to work, as commented by Gordon Linoff, you would need to use dynamic SQL, which seems beyond the scope of your question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936170/multiple-passes-of-table-without-subquery/57936201#57936201","title":"Multiple passes of table without subquery"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":2192889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f60c0f89a6957e257e3f4a73d35c699f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SelectStarFrom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2192889/selectstarfrom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568472053,"post_id":57936479,"comment_id":102288914,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936170/multiple-passes-of-table-without-subquery/57936479#comment102288914_57936479"},{"owner":{"reputation":22977,"user_id":5563083,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab25f269dc3fd3b4a657ddd27cf8f349?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Spiegel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5563083/paul-spiegel"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":39,"user_id":2192889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f60c0f89a6957e257e3f4a73d35c699f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SelectStarFrom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2192889/selectstarfrom"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568472561,"post_id":57936479,"comment_id":102289054,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936170/multiple-passes-of-table-without-subquery/57936479#comment102289054_57936479"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":22977,"user_id":5563083,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab25f269dc3fd3b4a657ddd27cf8f349?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Spiegel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5563083/paul-spiegel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22977,"user_id":5563083,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab25f269dc3fd3b4a657ddd27cf8f349?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Spiegel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5563083/paul-spiegel"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568471939,"last_edit_date":1568471939,"creation_date":1568471630,"answer_id":57936479,"question_id":57936170,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57936479","body_markdown":"For step 2:\r\n\r\n    select t1.id as id1, t2.id as id2\r\n    from eav t1\r\n    join eav t2\r\n      on  t2.Id &gt;

But this is not, what I am looking for.\r\n\r\nTHX for any tip in the right direction","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936096/how-to-find-a-word-in-a-string-which-is-used-multiple-times-without-a-quote","title":"How to find a word in a string, which is used multiple times without a quote"},{"tags":["ansible","yaml","ansible-2.x"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8196,"user_id":6482561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cd2b0768a40f668d90cf6f2b8b17caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vladimir Botka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6482561/vladimir-botka"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8196,"user_id":6482561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cd2b0768a40f668d90cf6f2b8b17caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vladimir Botka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6482561/vladimir-botka"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568560653,"last_edit_date":1568560653,"creation_date":1568544888,"answer_id":57943437,"question_id":57936095,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57943437","body_markdown":"&gt;Q: *Lists the server, the service name and then the 2 states.*\r\n\r\nA: The task below does the job\r\n\r\n    - set_fact:\r\n        service_map2: &quot;{{ service_map2|default({})|\r\n                          combine({item.key:\r\n                                   item.value.service_name}) }}&quot;\r\n      loop: &quot;{{ service_map|dict2items }}&quot;\r\n\r\nDictionary *`service_map2`* &quot;lists the server, the service name and then the 2 states&quot;\r\n\r\n    &quot;service_map2&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;server1&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;jboss_prod_1&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;enabled&quot;: &quot;True&quot;, \r\n                &quot;started&quot;: &quot;True&quot;\r\n            }, \r\n            &quot;jboss_prod_2&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;enabled&quot;: &quot;True&quot;, \r\n                &quot;started&quot;: &quot;True&quot;\r\n            }, \r\n            ...\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n1) Use *`json_query`* to select information from the dictionary.

Each listing has the `org&#39;s name`, `state`, `&#39;website link&#39;`, `&#39;training calendar&#39; link`, etc. The information that feeds the directory comes from an xml file that I export from an excel file. \r\n\r\nI have a `datastructure.js` file that defines my resource objects and loads it from my xml. Then I have a different `script.js` files that generates the results on the web page formatted as Bootstrap 3 panels. All of this part works fine.\r\n\r\nThis is what the js looks like for creating the panels:\r\n```\r\n// generate resource table based on selected filters\r\nfunction generateResults(state) {\r\n\tvar table = $(&#39;#LibraryResults&#39;);\r\n\t// first clear the table\r\n\ttable.empty();\r\n\t// next generate items matching filters\r\n\t\t$.each(resource_list, function(i, e) {\r\n\t\t\tif (state == &quot;&quot; || state == e.state ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// block div panel\r\n\t\t\t\tvar iDiv = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\tiDiv.id = &#39;column&#39;+i;\r\n\t\t\t\tiDiv.className = &#39;panel panel-primary&#39;;\r\n\t\t\t\tdocument.getElementById(&#39;LibraryResults&#39;).appendChild(iDiv);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// heading panel\r\n\t\t\t\tvar innerDiv1 = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\tinnerDiv1.id = &#39;heading&#39;+i;\r\n\t\t\t\tinnerDiv1.className = &#39;panel-heading&#39;;\r\n\t\t\t\tiDiv.appendChild(innerDiv1); \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// body panel\r\n\t\t\t\tvar innerDiv2 = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\tinnerDiv2.id = &#39;body&#39;+i;\r\n\t\t\t\tinnerDiv2.className = &#39;panel-body&#39;;\r\n\t\t\t\tiDiv.appendChild(innerDiv2);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t// training calendar div\r\n\t\t\t\tvar trainDiv = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\ttrainDiv.id = &#39;train&#39;+i;\r\n\t\t\t\ttrainDiv.className = &#39;col-sm-3 col-xs-6&#39;;\r\n\t\t\t\tinnerDiv2.appendChild(trainDiv);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t//I want these items to go inside the trainDiv\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$(trainDiv).append( \r\n\t\t\t\t\t&quot;&lt;span class=&#39;glyphicon glyphicon-calendar&#39;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&#39;&quot; + e.urltrain + &quot;&#39; target=&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;Training Calendar&lt;/a&gt;&quot;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy challenge:\r\n \r\nSome of the information the organizations provide is optional, so I may have an empty field in my xmls data (i.e. resource object &#39;urltrain&#39; is empty). Consequently, the `&#39;training calendar&#39; link` in `trainDiv` has an empty href. \r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is, if a resource `object (urltrain)` is empty I want to remove the impacted` div (trainDiv)` and its contents.\r\n\r\nI am pretty novice when it comes to javascript. I can replicate code with some tweaks for my new needs, but I don&#39;t know enough about the language to create something new.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936094/how-to-delete-div-if-resource-object-is-empty","title":"how to delete div if resource object is empty"},{"tags":["c#",".net"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":44065,"user_id":3152130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqxLT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TaW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3152130/taw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568470428,"post_id":57936091,"comment_id":102288509,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936091/how-i-compare-two-picturebox-arrays#comment102288509_57936091"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12067197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2337267929655869/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ivan Golubović","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067197/ivan-golubovi%c4%87"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44065,"user_id":3152130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqxLT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TaW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3152130/taw"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568472902,"post_id":57936091,"comment_id":102289117,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936091/how-i-compare-two-picturebox-arrays#comment102289117_57936091"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user10950779"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568499795,"last_edit_date":1568499795,"creation_date":1568498854,"answer_id":57939619,"question_id":57936091,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57939619","body_markdown":"If you ever want to tackle this again, I have a C# class called TransparencyMaker that converts a Jpeg or Png file to a PixelInformationDatabase.\r\n\r\nThe code is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/DataJuggler/TransparencyMaker\r\n\r\nThe part that would help you achieve this is:\r\nhttps://github.com/DataJuggler/TransparencyMaker/blob/master/TransparencyMaker/MainForm.cs\r\n\r\nIf scroll about 3/4 of the way down the page, a method LoadPixelDatabase and LoadPixelDatabaseEx is the same thing but it accepts a BitMap parameter.\r\n\r\nA PixelInformation database is just a List of PixelInformation objects, and a PixelInfomation class is listed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/DataJuggler/TransparencyMaker/blob/master/TransparencyMaker/Objects/PixelInformation.cs\r\n\r\nBasical a PixelInfo is just an object that contains the RGB Values, X &amp; Y values, plus some info like the Total, which is just sum of RGB, and a few others:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen if you wanted to compare your two databases, which I do when I erase by drawing a line.

Even sub-partitionning in mail_has_mail_status table (it will be easier to maintain if you want to just archive or drop old data) (pg_partman)\r\n - Do things on different tablespaces (hot data, cold data, indexes)\r\n\r\nThe rest is a question of simultaneous access on your cluster and how much money you have for the material. But : \r\n\r\n - SSD are cheap those days and will save you in many cases. \r\n - If you want to RAID : physical card and avoid the RAID 5 family. \r\n - If you need high availability : https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/3553182172805148419?source=blog\r\n - High frequency processor (the number of cores is not that much important. 4 is enough in many cases)\r\n - High frequency memory. And not that much if you do not have the mail core in this database.\r\n\r\nWith this quantity of data you can easily benchmark your architecure.\r\n\r\nOf course to really do the architecture job that you required, you will need a little more precisions in your analysis and a little more time to conform your architecture to your real needs.

It seems that a standard relational database might not be the best fit for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- There&#39;s not much relation required - very few queries will depend on other tables/documents\r\n- There&#39;s a huge amount of data (easily 1M records per month)\r\n- The records quickly becomes unimportant (after a few months, specific documents are rarely queried, although aggregate metrics matter)\r\n\r\nAs far as a data model, there&#39;s three things that exist in this system:\r\n\r\n- The &quot;email job&quot; - a top-level grouping of many emails that were sent out in a batch\r\n- The email record\r\n- The status updates for those email records\r\n\r\nI need to perform the following sorts of queries:\r\n\r\n- What is the current status of Email X?\r\n- What is the status history of Email X (when did each of the status events happen)?\r\n- How many emails in Email Job Y are in each status?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the best way to model this? A relational database sounds expensive and non-performant for this use case... is this one of the rare places with a NoSQL/Mongo/DynamoDB solution makes sense?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936082/email-tracking-data-modeling","title":"Email Tracking Data Modeling"},{"tags":["php","wordpress"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":155,"user_id":7601793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9TW7M.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cosmin P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7601793/cosmin-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568468941,"post_id":57936104,"comment_id":102288181,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936080/placing-php-html-php-in-one-line/57936104#comment102288181_57936104"},{"owner":{"reputation":691,"user_id":2704089,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n9zdR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dazed-and-confused","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2704089/dazed-and-confused"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":155,"user_id":7601793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9TW7M.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cosmin P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7601793/cosmin-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568491146,"post_id":57936104,"comment_id":102293153,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936080/placing-php-html-php-in-one-line/57936104#comment102293153_57936104"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":691,"user_id":2704089,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n9zdR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dazed-and-confused","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2704089/dazed-and-confused"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568468720,"creation_date":1568468720,"answer_id":57936104,"question_id":57936080,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57936104","body_markdown":"**Here you go:**\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php \r\n        if (is_woocommerce())\r\n        { \r\n            echo &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39; . home_url() . &#39;&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&#39;;\r\n        } \r\n        else \r\n        { \r\n            echo &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39; . home_url(&#39;/shop/&#39;) . &#39;&quot;&gt;My Shop&lt;/a&gt;&#39;;\r\n        }\r\n    ?&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936080/placing-php-html-php-in-one-line/57936104#57936104","title":"Placing php ,html, php in one line"}],"owner":{"reputation":155,"user_id":7601793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9TW7M.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cosmin P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7601793/cosmin-p"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568468748,"accepted_answer_id":57936104,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568468720,"creation_date":1568468553,"question_id":57936080,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57936080","body_markdown":"Can someone please tell me what am I doing wrong in my code?

It&#39;s when we start with an intention and work our way _forward_ to a solution that we can begin to understand how `Y` works. \r\n\r\n___&quot;I want to write a recursive formula... without using recursion&quot;___\r\n\r\nThis was a problem facing mathematicians and logicians long before people had widespread access to computers. And this is the problem the `Y` combinator solves, but how does it do it? Let&#39;s first start with a recursive &quot;formula&quot; we want to write -\r\n\r\n    const fact = n =&gt;\r\n      n &lt;= 2\r\n        ? n\r\n        : n * fact (n - 1) // &lt;-- recursive!\r\n\r\nAbove `fact` is defined in terms of itself. We can remove this self-reference by using an extra parameter to control recursion, `recur` -\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;del&gt;const fact =          n =&gt;&lt;/del&gt;\r\nconst fact = recur =&gt; n =&gt;\r\n  n &amp;lt;= 2\r\n    ? n\r\n    &lt;del&gt;: n * fact (n - 1)&lt;/del&gt;\r\n    : n * ...  (n - 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nBut what should `recur` be? And how do we fill in `...`? Meet `U`. `U` simply applies a function to itself -\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const U = f =&gt;\r\n      f (f)                     // &lt;-- apply f to itself\r\n\r\n    const fact = recur =&gt; n =&gt;\r\n      n &lt;= 2\r\n        ? n\r\n        : n * U (recur) (n - 1) // &lt;-- apply recur to itself\r\n\r\n    console.log (U (fact) (5))  // &lt;-- apply fact to itself\r\n    // 120\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nAbove we call `U (fact) (5)` to compute the result. It&#39;s important to observe that we could&#39;ve applied `U` when we defined `fact = ...` -\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const U = f =&gt;\r\n      f (f)\r\n\r\n    const fact = U (recur =&gt; n =&gt; // &lt;-- apply U directly on lambda\r\n      n &lt;= 2\r\n        ? n\r\n        : n * U (recur) (n - 1))\r\n\r\n    console.log (fact (5)) // &lt;-- call fact normally\r\n    // 120\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nUsing `U`, we now have a generic way to write recursive expressions -\r\n\r\n    U (recur =&gt; ...      U (recur) ...)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n___&quot;I don&#39;t like that I have to remember to use `U (recur) (...)`. Can I just call `recur (...)` instead?&quot;___\r\n\r\n`U` is an extremely simple mechanism, but indeed it is a little cumbersome because we have to remember to &quot;reflect&quot; `recur` back onto itself each time we recur. And this is where the `Y` combinator differs from the `U`. `Y` says,\r\n\r\n* Give me function `f`, that&#39;s asking for a recursion mechanism\r\n* I&#39;ll give you a recursion mechanism, `x =&gt; ...`, and when you call it, I will handle passing `x` to some `U (recur) (...)`\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const Y = f =&gt;\r\n      f (x =&gt; ...) // &lt;-- instead of f (f)...\r\n\r\nJust like we saw with `fact` above, we can write a recursive expression using `U` -\r\n\r\n    U (recur =&gt; ...      U (recur) ...)\r\n\r\nSo `Y` of some function `f`, will create a recursion mechanism, `U (recur =&gt; ...)` and it will call `f` with a function, `x =&gt; ...`, that when applied, will recur with `x` using `U (recur) (x)` -\r\n\r\n    const Y = f =&gt;\r\n      //            f (x =&gt;    ...

If `Jackson` instantiated `OtherExample` object you know `type` was set to `OtherExample` in `Yaml` file, etc...\r\n\r\nSo, you can remove `private String type;` from `Report` class and use `getClass().getSimpleName()` for getting `type`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936040/how-can-i-keep-the-property-used-for-setting-the-jsonsubtypes/57942421#57942421","title":"How can I keep the property used for setting the JsonSubTypes?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12067117,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/905c8cef879bd0353d7b7aad12eca6ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BlueIce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067117/blueice"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568537971,"creation_date":1568537971,"answer_id":57942600,"question_id":57936040,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57942600","body_markdown":"In the meantime I solved it by setting the value type in the constructors of the child classes. \r\n```\r\npublic OtherReport() {\r\n\t\tsuper();\r\n        super.setReportType(&quot;OtherReport&quot;);\r\n\t}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936040/how-can-i-keep-the-property-used-for-setting-the-jsonsubtypes/57942600#57942600","title":"How can I keep the property used for setting the JsonSubTypes?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12067117,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/905c8cef879bd0353d7b7aad12eca6ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BlueIce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067117/blueice"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57942421,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568537971,"creation_date":1568468276,"question_id":57936040,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57936040","body_markdown":"When deserializing my yaml-config with the Jackson Datamapper the value in the config that is used for deciding what subtype to create, is then ommited and not saved in the created java object.\r\n\r\nThis is the config I&#39;m trying to read in...\r\n```\r\n#config\r\n--- \r\nlists:\r\n  - filename: filename.xlsx\r\n    template: filename_template.xlsx\r\n    type: classType #this value is ommitted\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this abstract class\r\n```\r\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property=&quot;type&quot;)\r\n@JsonSubTypes({\r\n\t@JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Example.class, name = &quot;Example&quot;),\r\n    @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = OtherExample.class, name = &quot;OtherExample&quot;)\r\n})\r\npublic abstract class Report {\r\n    \r\n    private String filename;\r\n    private String template;\r\n    private String type;

Set a frame height to the PlayerToolbar:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n    PlayerToolBar().frame(height: 40)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Set the height for at least one of your images:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n    Image(systemName: &quot;gobackward.10&quot;)\r\n       .renderingMode(.original)\r\n       .resizable()\r\n       .frame(height: 40)\r\n       .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Set the height to one of your buttons:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n    Button(action: {\r\n        print(&quot;backward button pressed&quot;)\r\n    }){\r\n        Image(systemName: &quot;gobackward.10&quot;)\r\n            .renderingMode(.original)\r\n            .resizable()\r\n            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)\r\n   }.frame(height: 40)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Set the height of the HStack in your PlayerToolbar.\r\n\r\n5. Remove the resizable() modifier in at least one of your images.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nImage(systemName: &quot;pencil.circle&quot;).renderingMode(.original).aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll these alternatives aim at the same thing, making sure your images know how much to grow/shrink. There are of course many other options. These are just a few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936017/spacing-issue-with-swiftui/57938695#57938695","title":"Spacing Issue with SwiftUI"}],"owner":{"reputation":830,"user_id":161276,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e83b4e8f310935610e20982beb818c63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chris Dellinger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/161276/chris-dellinger"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57938695,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568491713,"creation_date":1568468103,"question_id":57936017,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57936017","body_markdown":"I am experiencing a weird spacing behavior that I&#39;m hoping someone can explain.

The maximum value for a signed type is 2^(n-1)-1, where n is the number of bits. So the maximum value of **char** is 2^(8-1)-1=2^7-1=128-1=127. The minimum value is actually -2^(n-1). This means the minimun value is -128. When you add something that goes over the maximum value, it overflows and loops back to the minimum value. Hence, 127+1=-128 if you are doing `char` arithmetic.\n\nYou never use `char` for arithmetic. Use `signed char` or `unsigned char` instead. If you replace your `char` with `unsigned char` the program would print 128 as expected. Just note that the overflow can still happen (unsigned types have a range from 0 to 2^n-1, so `unsigned char` overflows if you add 1 to 255, giving you 0).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57935968/im-confused-with-a-output-so-im-expecting-explaination-for-my-output/57936081#57936081","title":"I&#39;m confused with a output .
