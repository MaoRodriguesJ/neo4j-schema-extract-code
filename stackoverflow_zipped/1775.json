I have this scenario, where I suppose to get some non-predefined element into a child component. In where when the user clicks on that element it&#39;s fired on the parent element events. How can I stop the event trigger on the parent when the child is clicked? Let me explain more with the following example-\r\n\r\nSo, it&#39;s basically an accordion list, by clicking on each item title div (`list-container__item____title`) the body div (`list-container__item____body`) will display.\r\n\r\nNow, inside the title div, I have a link (`list-container__item____title--link`) which opens an overlay (child component). The overlay content comes from API call and the contains of it is HTML. I can&#39;t add some more functions for that element as I don&#39;t know what was included there, it&#39;s based on user choice. If in the HTML have some clickable element like an anchor, button, etc. the state (`activeItem`) is updated with empty (`&#39;&#39;`) value. The result is the respective item is collapsed.

I don&#39;t know if this issue occurs with any other library but I can confirm it occurs with Matplotlib and NLTK.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about re-installing Anaconda but was curious to know more about this really weird issue. I would also like to say that the issue is with my base (root) conda environment, NLTK doesn&#39;t have any issues in my other machine-learning environment. Any help is absolutely appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119830/weird-issue-when-running-python-code-with-data-science-libraries","title":"Weird issue when running Python code with data-science libraries"},{"tags":["reactjs","computation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":10529638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00a2dd86789aad9589e2f188732411f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10529638/marco"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511157,"post_id":58119828,"comment_id":102628784,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119828/let-the-user-decide-how-many-items-in-a-page#comment102628784_58119828"},{"owner":{"reputation":278,"user_id":9455734,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Legeo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9455734/legeo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":146,"user_id":10529638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00a2dd86789aad9589e2f188732411f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10529638/marco"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511559,"post_id":58119828,"comment_id":102628989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119828/let-the-user-decide-how-many-items-in-a-page#comment102628989_58119828"},{"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":10529638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00a2dd86789aad9589e2f188732411f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10529638/marco"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511623,"post_id":58119828,"comment_id":102629024,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119828/let-the-user-decide-how-many-items-in-a-page#comment102629024_58119828"},{"owner":{"reputation":278,"user_id":9455734,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Legeo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9455734/legeo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":146,"user_id":10529638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00a2dd86789aad9589e2f188732411f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10529638/marco"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511826,"post_id":58119828,"comment_id":102629130,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119828/let-the-user-decide-how-many-items-in-a-page#comment102629130_58119828"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":10529638,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00a2dd86789aad9589e2f188732411f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10529638/marco"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569512417,"creation_date":1569512417,"answer_id":58120364,"question_id":58119828,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58120364","body_markdown":"so you have\r\n&lt;code&gt;\r\nconst itemsPerPage = 25; //this you can set to be user alterable if you want\r\nconst itemsTotal = 155; //this you&#39;d use a function to go get the number of items.\r\n\r\nconst pageIncrements[];\r\n\r\nfor (let pageNumber = 1; pageNumber &lt;= itemsTotal / itemsPerPage; pageNumber++) {\r\n   pageIncrements += [((pageNumber - 1) * (itemsPerPage) + 1)) + &quot; - &quot; + (pageNumber * itemsPerPage)]\r\n}\r\nif (itemsTotal % itemsPerPage &gt; 0) {\r\n    pageIncrements += [(itemsTotal - (itemsTotal % itemsPerPage)) + &quot; - &quot; + itemsTotal]\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;\r\nSorry, haven&#39;t worked with react syntax, but the logic should be right.

Even though it _can_ do it (with extended regex), parsing a complex language is more abstract. You need to not only look at the tokens (the words), but at the grammar (the syntax and its meaning).\r\n\r\nA typical issue (which you&#39;re facing) is when a word has a different meaning given the context, and a grammar is there to help on this. And even though you can figure out the first step of parsing the scenarios, when you&#39;ll look at each scenario, you&#39;re likely to have a similar issue.\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s why you need to implement a full blown parser… But writing a parser is not easy (the most complex part being writing the grammar).\r\nSo if you&#39;re lucy, someone else has done it for you!\r\n\r\nAnd you&#39;re lucky! Looking [at some documentation on Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/user_guide/gherkin.html) the language used is call gherkin. With some googling, I found at least one python package that understands that language : [`cucumber/gherkin-python`](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin-python), which has now moved to the [`cucumber/cucumber`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/gherkin) repository.\r\n\r\nThe snippet to use the parser is the following:\r\n\r\n    from gherkin.parser import Parser\r\n    from gherkin.pickles.compiler import compile\r\n\r\n    parser = Parser()\r\n    gherkin_document = parser.parse(&quot;Feature: ...&quot;)\r\n    pickles = compile(gherkin_document)\r\n\r\nThen you&#39;ll get a structured data output which you&#39;ll be able to navigate through easily in python.

Even better would be if I can match with a new line that has a tab or number of spaces.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal here is to get the Scenario description but not the steps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119805/regex-to-match-specific-strings-but-only-first-string-on-new-line","title":"Regex to match specific strings but only first string on new line"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2","stat"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53647,"user_id":322912,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ao2Pm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roman Luštrik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/322912/roman-lu%c5%a1trik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511260,"post_id":58119802,"comment_id":102628833,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119802/no-fitted-curves-with-warning-ggplot2-stat-smooth-warnings-computation-faile#comment102628833_58119802"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12120448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecf731162c952941685d180a4624356d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kickshark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12120448/kickshark"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53647,"user_id":322912,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ao2Pm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roman Luštrik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/322912/roman-lu%c5%a1trik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569512350,"post_id":58119802,"comment_id":102629407,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119802/no-fitted-curves-with-warning-ggplot2-stat-smooth-warnings-computation-faile#comment102629407_58119802"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12120448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecf731162c952941685d180a4624356d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kickshark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12120448/kickshark"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12120448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecf731162c952941685d180a4624356d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kickshark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12120448/kickshark"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569512304,"creation_date":1569510567,"last_edit_date":1569512304,"question_id":58119802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119802","body_markdown":"I am trying to fit nonlinear curves to a list of scatterplots.

The component does also implement the IDisposable interface, which is automatically called by Blazor when the component becomes invisible. \r\n\r\nHere a code snippet out of my WebComponentBase class and the ViewModelAwareComponent class, to roughly give an idea about the pattern:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n\r\n    public abstract class WebFpComponentBase : ComponentBase, IDisposable, IHtmlStyles\r\n    {\r\n    \r\n         private const string DEFAULT_DIM_VALUE = &quot;auto&quot;;\r\n    \r\n         [Inject]\r\n         protected IExceptionUiHandler&lt;ErrorRedirectViewModel&gt; ExceptionUiHandler { get; set; }\r\n    \r\n         //fields and parameters omitted for brevity\r\n    \r\n         #region Blazor Component LifeCycle\r\n         /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n         /// OnInitialized is called after OnInitialized, when the component has received all initial parameters. Place any asynchronous operations here,\r\n         /// which require the component to re-render.\r\n         /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n         /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;\r\n         protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\r\n         {\r\n              try\r\n              {\r\n    \t          await base.OnInitializedAsync();\r\n                  _logger.Info($&quot;{nameof(OnInitializedAsync)} - method invoked in component of type ${this.GetType().FullName}&quot;);\r\n    \t          await OnInitializedInternalAsync();\r\n    \t          _logger.Info($&quot;{nameof(OnInitializedAsync)} - method finished in component of type ${this.GetType().FullName}&quot;);\r\n              } catch(Exception ex)\r\n              {\r\n                 //Exception, if any happend, is forwared using the IExceptionUiHandler in the AfterRenderAsync() method\r\n    \t          _forwardException = ex;\r\n    \t          _logger.Error($&quot;{nameof(OnInitializedAsync)}: Catching and forwarding exception of type {_forwardException.GetType().FullName}&quot;);\r\n              }\r\n         }\r\n    \r\n         protected abstract Task OnInitializedInternalAsync();\r\n         //other methods of the class omitted for brevity\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext my ViewModelAwareComponent, which does have a property containing the ViewModel and does automatically fire ViewModel initialization and deinitialization (closing any service connections, resetting any values etc.) by implementing the [BlazorLifecycleMethod]Internal abstract methods.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic abstract class ViewModelAwareComponent&lt;TViewModel&gt; : WebFpComponentBase where TViewModel : BaseViewModel\r\n{\r\n    private Logger _logger = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public virtual TViewModel ViewModel { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\tprotected override async Task OnInitializedInternalAsync()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tawait ViewModel.InitializeAsync();\r\n\t\tViewModel.PropertyChanged += this.FireComponentStateHasChanged;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic override async void Dispose()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tbase.Dispose();\r\n\t\tawait ViewModel.DeactivateAsync();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprotected virtual async void FireComponentStateHasChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t_logger.Trace($&quot;FireComponentStateHasChanged: property {e.PropertyName} has changed!&quot;);\r\n\t\tawait InvokeAsync(this.StateHasChanged);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprotected override async Task OnParametersSetAsyncInternal()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (ViewModel == null)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tthrow new ArgumentNullException($&quot;{nameof(ViewModel)}&quot;, &quot;Parameter must be supplied!&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe BaseViewModel-Type only implements INotifyPropertyChanged in a typical fashion. I do have a &quot;MainViewModel&quot; which should only be instantiated once for the whole connection (Blazor Circuit). Hence I added it via &lt;code&gt;services.AddScoped&lt;MainViewModel, MainViewModel&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Startup.cs&lt;/code&gt;. As it is not bound to any particular component, I am injecting it into my &lt;code&gt;MainLayout.razor&lt;/code&gt; which is the layout for every Razor component I wrote.\r\n\r\nThe layout does implement &lt;code&gt;protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()&lt;/code&gt; like listed below:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nprotected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\r\n{\r\n\tMainViewModel.PropertyChanged += (obj, args) =&gt; InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);\r\n\tawait MainViewModel.InitializeAsync();\r\n    //some other stuff happening afterwards\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**My problem now is, that the initialization and is done twice every time I startup the app, instead of only once per connection. Same is true for the deinitialization, because the Dispose() of the component is called also twice.**\r\n\r\nWhen debugging I noticed that the &lt;code&gt;OnInitializedAsync&lt;/code&gt; is not re-called when switching between my two existing pages (routed components). It is only called twice on startup. \r\n\r\nDo you maybe have some suggestions for this behaviour? Is there some better way to achieve my desired behaviour for the MainViewModel?\r\n\r\nBest Regards, \r\n\r\ntilt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119782/creating-an-object-viewmodel-once-for-each-blazor-circuit","title":"Creating an object (ViewModel) once for each Blazor Circuit"},{"tags":["css","fonts","laravel-blade"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2447,"user_id":2343305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kNEA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IlGala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2343305/ilgala"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511458,"post_id":58119781,"comment_id":102628928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119781/how-to-change-the-standard-font-in-laravel-fontsquirrel#comment102628928_58119781"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12125766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fs2rYesDv8k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfZRfwPHuI05dnYCTfP0SFV8cCZcA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristhian Rodas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12125766/cristhian-rodas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2447,"user_id":2343305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kNEA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IlGala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2343305/ilgala"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569511726,"post_id":58119781,"comment_id":102629077,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119781/how-to-change-the-standard-font-in-laravel-fontsquirrel#comment102629077_58119781"},{"owner":{"reputation":2447,"user_id":2343305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kNEA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IlGala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2343305/ilgala"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569511858,"post_id":58119781,"comment_id":102629148,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119781/how-to-change-the-standard-font-in-laravel-fontsquirrel#comment102629148_58119781"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12125766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fs2rYesDv8k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfZRfwPHuI05dnYCTfP0SFV8cCZcA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristhian Rodas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12125766/cristhian-rodas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2447,"user_id":2343305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kNEA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IlGala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2343305/ilgala"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569512622,"post_id":58119781,"comment_id":102629515,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119781/how-to-change-the-standard-font-in-laravel-fontsquirrel#comment102629515_58119781"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12125766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fs2rYesDv8k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfZRfwPHuI05dnYCTfP0SFV8cCZcA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristhian Rodas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12125766/cristhian-rodas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3722,"user_id":4369919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYi0G.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"N69S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4369919/n69s"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569512247,"creation_date":1569510491,"last_edit_date":1569512247,"question_id":58119781,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119781","body_markdown":"I&#39;m pretty new at Laravel 5.8 and I would like to change the whole fonts for &#39;Roboto Slab&#39; from &#39;www.fontsquirrel.com&#39;. \r\n\r\nI have tried by downloading and adding it as a style in my app.blade \r\n\r\nHowever as expected it doesn&#39;t work and I&#39;m pretty sure this is not the right way to change the whole font in my project as well.\r\n\r\n     @font-face {\r\n        font-family: RobotoSlab;\r\n        src: url(&#39;{{ URL::asset(&#39;public/assets/fonts/roboto-slab/RobotoSlab-Light.ttf&#39;) }}&#39;)format(‘truetype’);\r\n    } \r\n\r\n     p{\r\n        font-family: RobotoSlab;        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used this code in order to try if the font worked. no results","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119781/how-to-change-the-standard-font-in-laravel-fontsquirrel","title":"How to change the standard font in laravel?

This saves you a lot of work and problems. There already exists a function for your problem. In your description you ask for a sorting of the values. In the provides code you only ask for min and max. The min/max solution would be:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;algorithm&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n        std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; a;\r\n        std::cin &gt;&gt; a[0] &gt;&gt; a[1] &gt;&gt; a[2];\r\n        auto [a_min, a_max] = std::minmax({a[0], a[1], a[2]});\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Min: &quot; &lt;&lt; a_min &lt;&lt; &quot;\\nMax: &quot; &lt;&lt; a_max &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`std::minmax` expects a list of values and returns a `std::pair` with min and max. It won&#39;t change the container. `auto [a_min, a_max]` is a structured binding that stores the first value of the pair in `a_min` and the second value in `a_max`.\r\n\r\nHere is a solution for the sort problem\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;algorithm&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n        std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; a;\r\n        std::cin &gt;&gt; a[0] &gt;&gt; a[1] &gt;&gt; a[2];\r\n        std::sort(std::begin(a), std::end(a));\r\n        for (const auto &amp;el : a) {\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; el &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39;;\r\n        }\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`std::sort` expects an iterator to the beginning and an iterator to the end of your container. It will sort your actual container and don&#39;t provide a sorted copy. The range-based for loop\r\n\r\n    for (const auto &amp;el : a) {\r\n\r\nis a simply way to iterate over your container.\r\n\r\nAlso to fix your current code you can add a new variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    float a, b, c;\r\n    std::cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c;\r\n    float maxx = a;\r\n    if (b &gt; maxx) { maxx = b; }\r\n    if (c &gt; maxx) { maxx = c; }\r\n    float minn = b;\r\n    if (a &lt; minn) { minn = a; }\r\n    if (c &lt; minn) { minn = c; }\r\n    float midd = c;\r\n    if (a &gt; minn &amp;&amp; a &lt; maxx) { midd = a; }\r\n    if (b &gt; minn &amp;&amp; b &lt; maxx) { midd = b; }\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; minn &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; midd &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; maxx;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119778/writing-program-importing-three-float-a-b-and-c-sort-in-ascending-order/58121117#58121117","title":"Writing program, importing three float a, b and c. sort in ascending order"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12093515,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/954323861568062/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ngọc Huyền","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093515/ng%e1%bb%8dc-huy%e1%bb%81n"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5752,"user_id":2932052,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63b8d6f5ce8e33b6953812ce8f5b2d40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Wolf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2932052/wolf"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58121117,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569516181,"creation_date":1569510482,"last_edit_date":1569510725,"question_id":58119778,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119778","body_markdown":"```\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    float a,b,c,maxx,minn;\r\n    cin&gt;&gt;a&gt;&gt;b&gt;&gt;c;\r\n    maxx=a;\r\n    if (b&gt;maxx) (maxx=b);\r\n    if (c&gt;maxx) (maxx=c);\r\n    minn=b;\r\n    if (a&lt;minn) (minn=a);\r\n    if (c&lt;minn) (minn=c);\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;minn&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;&lt;&lt;maxx ;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI don&#39;t know how to print the number between `max` and `min`.\r\n    \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119778/writing-program-importing-three-float-a-b-and-c-sort-in-ascending-order","title":"Writing program, importing three float a, b and c. sort in ascending order"},{"tags":["android","android-source","automotive","android-automotive"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10504440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1953458604699839/picture?type=large","display_name":"Qivi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10504440/qivi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10504440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1953458604699839/picture?type=large","display_name":"Qivi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10504440/qivi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569581551,"last_edit_date":1569581551,"creation_date":1569574326,"answer_id":58131060,"question_id":58119775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58131060","body_markdown":"Ok, already got it.\r\n\r\nProject Structure → + Module → import .Jar/AAR Package → \r\nSource: \r\n\r\n`AOSP/out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/android.car_intermediates/classes-full-debug.jar`\r\n\r\nThen same with \r\n\r\n    AOSP/out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/android.car_intermediates/classes.jar\r\n\r\nThen add those modules as a module dependencies to your app module.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119775/android-studio-car-api/58131060#58131060","title":"Android Studio Car API"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10504440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1953458604699839/picture?type=large","display_name":"Qivi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10504440/qivi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10440,"user_id":6782707,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2425200c04f326a53ef0085b703369d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Edric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6782707/edric"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":129,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58131060,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569581551,"creation_date":1569510465,"last_edit_date":1569510653,"question_id":58119775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119775","body_markdown":"Im trying to add android.car API to Android Studio project.

listView = new ListView&lt;String&gt;(&quot;propertyListView&quot;, model.getObjectsList()) {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    protected void populateItem(final ListItem listItem) {\r\n                        listItem.add(new TextField&lt;String&gt;(&quot;string&quot;, new PropertyModel&lt;&gt;(listItem.getModelObject(), &quot;stringField&quot;)));\r\n                    }\r\n                };\r\n                listView.setReuseItems(true);\r\n    container.add(listView);\r\n    form.add(container);\r\n\r\n\r\nMy question is this: is there some sort of interface I can implement so I don&#39;t have to use the &quot;cheat&quot; of initializing the objects with different property values, and if so, what/how?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119759/wicket-form-components-value-changes-within-listview-affecting-all-elements","title":"Wicket form components value changes within ListView affecting all elements"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","python-dataclasses"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":35993,"user_id":6779307,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p7O3q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Patrick Haugh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6779307/patrick-haugh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569521915,"post_id":58119758,"comment_id":102633775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119758/how-to-remove-dataclass-attributes#comment102633775_58119758"},{"owner":{"reputation":71489,"user_id":510937,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70b13a9ae1aae1ca1aa6ac8dab4643f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bakuriu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/510937/bakuriu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569526178,"post_id":58119758,"comment_id":102635667,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119758/how-to-remove-dataclass-attributes#comment102635667_58119758"},{"owner":{"reputation":502,"user_id":2241168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHNmN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GustavoIP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2241168/gustavoip"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569526363,"post_id":58119758,"comment_id":102635755,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119758/how-to-remove-dataclass-attributes#comment102635755_58119758"},{"owner":{"reputation":5116,"user_id":962190,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxvRS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/962190/arne"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569566445,"post_id":58119758,"comment_id":102645405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119758/how-to-remove-dataclass-attributes#comment102645405_58119758"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5116,"user_id":962190,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxvRS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/962190/arne"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569568190,"creation_date":1569568190,"answer_id":58129534,"question_id":58119758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58129534","body_markdown":"This isn&#39;t an answer to your question about deleting attributes from a dataclass, but it provides a mechanism to get a custom `asdict` that behaves in the way you want:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict, cast\r\n\r\nSENTINEL = cast(None, object())  # have a sentinel that pretends to be &#39;None&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Bla:\r\n    arg1: Optional[int] = SENTINEL\r\n    arg2: Optional[str] = SENTINEL\r\n    arg3: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = SENTINEL\r\n\r\n    def asdict(self):\r\n        return {k: v for k, v in self.__dict__.items() if v is not SENTINEL}\r\n```\r\nSome tests:\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

My first approach was to figure out a way to remove any item that I was not explicitly passed in the ```dataclass``` constructor.\r\n\r\nHowever, as [Patrick and Arne][3]  point out, wisely,  that&#39;s not the right thing to try to accomplish with ```dataclasses```.\r\n\r\nThe best way I found to solve my use case was to use [```TypedDict```][4] from the ```typing_extensions``` module, that, with [PEP 589][5], will be part of the standard library in the module ```typing``` in [Python 3.8][6].\r\n\r\nIn Python 3.8:\r\n\r\n    from typing import TypedDict, Dict\r\n    \r\n    class Bla(TypedDict):\r\n        arg1: int\r\n        arg2: str\r\n        arg3: Dict[str, str]\r\n\r\nIn other versions you have to install `typing_extensions` module:\r\n\r\n    pip install typing-extensions\r\n\r\nthen:\r\n\r\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\r\n\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s try:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; Bla(arg1=1, arg2=&quot;bla&quot;, arg3={&quot;bla&quot;:&quot;bla&quot;})\r\n    {&#39;arg1&#39;: 1, &#39;arg2&#39;: &#39;bla&#39;, &#39;arg3&#39;: {&#39;bla&#39;: &#39;bla&#39;}}\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; Bla(arg1=1, arg2=&quot;bla&quot;)\r\n    {&#39;arg1&#39;: 1, &#39;arg2&#39;: &#39;bla&#39;}\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; Bla(arg1=1)\r\n    {&#39;arg1&#39;: 1}\r\n\r\n\r\nVery elegant and fits perfectly in my use case.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is that `TypedDict` doesn&#39;t support default values yet. There is a [PR][7] for that and I&#39;m hopeful they will do something about.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#module-level-decorators-classes-and-functions\r\n  [2]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.asdict\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119758/how-to-remove-dataclass-attributes#comment102633775_58119758\r\n  [4]: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/more_types.html#typeddict\r\n  [5]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/\r\n  [6]: https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict\r\n  [7]: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6131","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119758/how-to-remove-dataclass-attributes/58208722#58208722","title":"How to remove dataclass attributes"}],"owner":{"reputation":502,"user_id":2241168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHNmN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GustavoIP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2241168/gustavoip"},"last_editor":{"reputation":502,"user_id":2241168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHNmN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GustavoIP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2241168/gustavoip"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58208722,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570053761,"creation_date":1569510405,"last_edit_date":1569810203,"question_id":58119758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119758","body_markdown":"I have a dataclass like this:\r\n\r\n    @dataclass\r\n    class Bla:\r\n    \targ1: Optional[int] = None\r\n    \targ2: Optional[str] = None\r\n    \targ3: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None\r\n\r\n\r\nI want this behavior:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;

You can find methods and props in &quot;Classes&quot; tab, for example `addSeries`: https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts.Chart#addSeries - the params you have set to `false` are `animation` and `redraw` - definitively not what you want to achieve :)\r\n\r\nTo achieve what you need you should:\r\n\r\n - add the third series just like the first one (with `redraw=false`)\r\n - hide this series with [`series.visible`](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.line.visible) and [`series.showInLegend`](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.line.showInLegend) options set to false (if you have disabled legend, no need to set `showInLegend`)\r\n\r\nNow the question is why you need `series.data`. The only reason to use Point Class instances is to call methods like `point.remove()` or `point.update()`. Since that one series is always hidden, then I think it&#39;s not the case. \r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t need real Points, just some data from it, then you always have access to the dataset you used to create the series, right? Like `chart.addSeries({ data: [ ... ]})`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can force generating points this way: https://jsfiddle.net/BlackLabel/nqsemy3z/2/ - note that `series.processData()` and `series.generatePoints()` methods **are not part of API**.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119745/how-to-get-data-for-hidden-series-in-hightcharts-highstock/58121913#58121913","title":"How to get data for hidden series in Hightcharts / Highstock?"}],"owner":{"reputation":468,"user_id":2553593,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a6f67794eb09e076f457a100352d0f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"delux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2553593/delux"},"last_editor":{"reputation":468,"user_id":2553593,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a6f67794eb09e076f457a100352d0f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"delux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2553593/delux"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58121913,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569579235,"creation_date":1569510349,"last_edit_date":1569579235,"question_id":58119745,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119745","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using [highcharts / highstock][1] and their [documentation][2].\r\n\r\nI need to dynamically add a series (once after the original chart data is loaded) and I need to hide the series to not be shown into the chart (but still to exist).\r\nThe reason for this is, I need to apply indicators to a certain time range and for this I&#39;m using the hidden series (which actually works). \r\n\r\nI also need to be able to access to the data of the hidden series at any time, but here is where my issue appears. If I try to access to my hidden series like: \r\n\r\n    console.log(chart.get(&#39;hidden-series&#39;).data);\r\n\r\nthen this returns an empty array.\r\n\r\n**I have the full code in the following [jsfiddle][3]** and here is a short explanation of what I&#39;m doing there:\r\n\r\nWith a click on the first two buttons, I&#39;m dynamically adding two series `series2` and `series3`. One of them is added &quot;normally&quot; (it&#39;s visible) and the other is added to not be visible on the chart (using the `false, false` as second and third parameters in the method `addSeries` - which I&#39;m not sure what actually this means, since this was a legacy code and I can&#39;t find the proper documentation for this anywhere).\r\n\r\n And then with the last buttons I&#39;m trying to get the data for each of the series. As you can notice from my test example, even that the `series3` is added (it&#39;s not visible) when trying to get the data, it&#39;s an empty array.\r\n\r\nIf I comment the two `false` parameters in the line:\r\n\r\n    }, false, false); \r\n\r\nthe data will be retrieved as expected, but the series will be displayed (and this is not what I want).\r\n\r\nIs there any other way for getting the data from invisible series? Or maybe the proper description for the parameters in the `addSeries` method can also help in understanding the issue.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** *(add the reason why I need this, based on the comments below)*\r\n\r\nThe reason that I need this feature is: I need to have the [VWAP indicator][4] on the chart and to be applied only for the current day (so starting from 00:00 until the current moment), while the chart itself contains data for multiple days.\r\n\r\nSo what I&#39;m doing is: I&#39;m taking the subset of the data that represents the current day only, hide this subset and use it&#39;s data to show the VWAP indicator only for this certain time range. \r\n\r\nThe initial load of the indicator works as expected. I need to have access to this data, since the chart is updating in real time and I need to be able to dynamical add new points in the general series of data and but also in the hidden subset for the current day as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.highcharts.com/stock/demo\r\n  [2]: https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/chart.events.addSeries\r\n  [3]: https://jsfiddle.net/delux123/xrmo45Lc/\r\n  [4]: https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/series.vwap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119745/how-to-get-data-for-hidden-series-in-hightcharts-highstock","title":"How to get data for hidden series in Hightcharts / Highstock?"},{"tags":["bash","git","shell","automation","command-prompt"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":364,"user_id":2043313,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd8b670f398f98d76816ccf7ea607e32?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Isma90","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2043313/isma90"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":161,"user_id":2949062,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/816ec4bd94021c26bc81ca1ef7472416?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"johnny243","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2949062/johnny243"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569512243,"post_id":58119743,"comment_id":102629358,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119743/bash-script-answer-automatically-command#comment102629358_58119743"},{"owner":{"reputation":24589,"user_id":3266847,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0oyt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Benjamin W.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3266847/benjamin-w"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569513628,"post_id":58119743,"comment_id":102630009,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119743/bash-script-answer-automatically-command#comment102630009_58119743"}],"owner":{"reputation":364,"user_id":2043313,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd8b670f398f98d76816ccf7ea607e32?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Isma90","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2043313/isma90"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24589,"user_id":3266847,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0oyt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Benjamin W.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3266847/benjamin-w"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569563912,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569513656,"creation_date":1569510343,"last_edit_date":1569513656,"question_id":58119743,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119743","body_markdown":"In a sh script I tried push file automatically, but when you do &quot;git pull&quot; the repository ssh via and then in &quot;git push&quot; command ask me:\r\n\r\n    ECDSA key fingerprint is 11:00:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:10:11:12:13:14:15.\r\n    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\r\n\r\nI tried this:  \r\n\r\n    echo &quot;yes\\n&quot; | git push\r\n\r\n---\r\n    git push &lt;&lt; EOF\r\n    yes\r\n    EOF\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n    yes &quot;yes&quot; | git push\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n    printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; yes | git push\r\n\r\nbut doesn&#39;t work, I don&#39;t know if this command works different","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119743/bash-script-answer-automatically-command","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Bash script answer automatically command"},{"tags":["python","opencv","ubuntu","camera","pyusb"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12079899,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/710573742468579/picture?type=large","display_name":"Doubloon Conroy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079899/doubloon-conroy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569597937,"post_id":58120032,"comment_id":102661409,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119737/controlling-stepper-motors-and-camera-simultaneously/58120032#comment102661409_58120032"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":6200757,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a950f90ecec99b047b37c58d966bff6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex Stanfield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6200757/alex-stanfield"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569511343,"creation_date":1569511343,"answer_id":58120032,"question_id":58119737,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58120032","body_markdown":"It there a reason that you can&#39;t call some function that captures an image on each step?

To test if the `capture()` function works properly I tried the following:\r\n\r\n    def capture():        \r\n        ... \r\n        # saves image in the defined path when called\r\n\r\n    def camera():\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        while(True):\r\n            cv2.imshow(&#39;live&#39;, frame)\r\n            if cv2.waitKey(1) &amp; 255 == ord(&#39;q&#39;):\r\n                capture()\r\n                cv2.destroyAllWindows()\r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n        camera()\r\n\r\nand it works, it saves the frame after  the _q_ button is pressed and then closes the window. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo be able to capture the frame, the imshow window must be open which means the  `while True` condition must hold. Since the `while` loop is in the `camera()` function how do I call `capture()`  whilst the imshow window is still running?

Both devices (Camera and the stage) are connected to my computer (Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS) via 2 different USB 2.0 ports. \r\n\r\nMy script for the camera looks something like:\r\n\r\n    def camera():\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        while(True):\r\n            cv2.imshow(&#39;live&#39;, frame)\r\n            ueye.is_ExitCamera(hCam2)\r\n            cv2.destroyAllWindows()\r\n\r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n        camera()\r\n\r\nand outputs live broadcast from the camera.\r\n\r\nFor the motor something like:\r\n\r\n    i = 0\r\n    while i &lt; 6:           # Move 6 times\r\n        stepper.Move(0.5)  # Moves forward by 0.5 mm\r\n        time.sleep(1)      # Sleeps for a second\r\n        i += 1\r\n\r\n    time.sleep(2)\r\n    print(&quot;\\nProcess End\\n&quot;)\r\n    close()                # closes port \r\n\r\nand moves and sleeps as desired. \r\n\r\nBoth scripts run sucessfully when  executed seperately. However, how do I combine these scripts so that I can take a picture at the end of each step?  For the example adressed above for moving 6 times, I want to get 6 images at the end, captured at the end of each step. Should one use multithreading, multiprocessing?... Both devices are connected to my computer via 2 seperate USB 2.0 ports. I&#39;m not a beginner in programming, but not an expert either  so any suggestions will be kindly appreciated.

To avoid code repetition, I created generic method `callSafely` that takes a suspending API function and a placeId as its parameters.\r\n```\r\nclass SocialRepository {\r\n    private val client: Api = ApiClient.webservice\r\n\r\n    private suspend fun &lt;T&gt; callSafely(\r\n        apiMethod: suspend (placeId: String) -&gt; Response&lt;T&gt;,\r\n        placeId: String,\r\n    ): T? {\r\n        Log.d(TAG, &quot;$apiMethod called safely&quot;)\r\n\r\n        var response: Response&lt;T&gt;? = null\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            response = apiMethod(placeId)\r\n        } catch (e: Exception) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace()\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (response?.isSuccessful != true) {\r\n            Log.w(TAG, &quot;response.isSuccessful isn&#39;t true.&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return response?.body()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    suspend fun getPlaceComments(placeId: String): List&lt;CommentResponse&gt;? {\r\n        return callSafely(client::getPlaceComments, placeId)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    suspend fun deletePlaceComment(placeId: String): Unit? {\r\n        return callSafely(client::deletePlaceComment, placeId)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    suspend fun addPlaceComment(placeId: String, text: String): Unit? {\r\n        return callSafely(client::addPlaceComment, placeId, text) // HERE LIES THE PROBLEM\r\n        // I can&#39;t pass additional data because the method signature won&#39;t match with what&#39;s defined in callSafely()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it works pretty well, of course I&#39;ve got also my Activity and its ViewModel and the ViewModel calls a method in the repository etc. It doesn&#39;t matter.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is that adding a place comment requires additional data, like, the actual text of the comment. Getting and deleting comments require only placeId, whereas when adding a comment, its content, its `text` is also required.\r\nI&#39;ve read that passing `vararg` functions is impossible in Kotlin. I also wouldn&#39;t like to clutter all the API methods with something like a `List of params` that will most of the time be empty and will just create confusion.\r\n\r\nI can go the easy way and just copy the code of `callSafely` to `addPlaceComment` and alter it, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m looking for. I know how to solve the problem, but I don&#39;t know how to do it `the clean way`. In the future I might add some more endpoints requiring additional data (except `placeId`) and the problem will show up again.\r\n\r\nWhat would you do in this situation? How to write it &quot;the correct way&quot;?\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not even sure how to properly express what I&#39;m looking for, that&#39;s why this post&#39;s so rambling. Sorry for that in advance. I really hope you can help me.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119699/kotlin-how-to-pass-a-function-with-varying-arguments-as-a-parameter-to-other-fu","title":"Kotlin: how to pass a

You do have to keep the table well-vacuumed, which can be tricky to do as the autovacuum parameters were really not designed with IOS in mind.

All of the tools you describe need low-level access to the host network and process space: you actively do not want the isolation that Docker is providing here.\r\n\r\nTo give two specific examples: without special setup, you can’t `tcpdump` the host’s network interface, because a container has its own isolated network stack; and you can’t `strace` host processes because a container has its own process ID space and restricted Linux capabilities that disallow it.\r\n\r\n(From a security point of view, also consider that anyone who can run any `docker` command can trivially root the host, and there is a reasonably common misconfiguration to publish this ability to the network.  You’d prefer to not need to install Docker if you’re interested in securing an existing system.)\r\n\r\nI’d probably put this set of tools on a USB drive (if that’s allowed in your environment) and run them directly off of there.  A tar file of tools would work as well, if that’s easier to transfer.

Is there anything required to put onto the test system for the container to run properly?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119639/can-containerized-tools-run-against-a-local-machine","title":"Can containerized tools run against a local machine?"},{"tags":["python","keras"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7340,"user_id":2846923,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0d6c72fc52493dce1c9bde30cdce946?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"The Guy with The Hat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2846923/the-guy-with-the-hat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569510594,"post_id":58119638,"comment_id":102628511,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119638/restore-original-text-from-keras-s-imdb-dataset-again#comment102628511_58119638"},{"owner":{"reputation":1138,"user_id":774133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c30305b8e03ae14c13dc86a79e111c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Antonio Sesto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/774133/antonio-sesto"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7340,"user_id":2846923,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0d6c72fc52493dce1c9bde30cdce946?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"The Guy with The Hat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2846923/the-guy-with-the-hat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569511908,"post_id":58119638,"comment_id":102629172,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119638/restore-original-text-from-keras-s-imdb-dataset-again#comment102629172_58119638"},{"owner":{"reputation":192,"user_id":5007682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1144820032211064/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ahsun Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5007682/ahsun-ali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513236,"post_id":58119638,"comment_id":102629825,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119638/restore-original-text-from-keras-s-imdb-dataset-again#comment102629825_58119638"}],"owner":{"reputation":1138,"user_id":774133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c30305b8e03ae14c13dc86a79e111c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Antonio Sesto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/774133/antonio-sesto"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1138,"user_id":774133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c30305b8e03ae14c13dc86a79e111c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Antonio Sesto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/774133/antonio-sesto"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569511967,"creation_date":1569510033,"last_edit_date":1569511967,"question_id":58119638,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58119638","body_markdown":"I have an issue with the keras IMDB database.\r\n\r\nThe code I am starting from is in the accepted answer here:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/42821330/restore-original-text-from-keras-s-imdb-dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n    import keras\r\n    NUM_WORDS=1000 # only use top 1000 words\r\n    INDEX_FROM=3   # word index offset\r\n    \r\n    train,test = keras.datasets.imdb.load_data(num_words=NUM_WORDS, index_from=INDEX_FROM)\r\n    train_x,train_y = train\r\n    test_x,test_y = test\r\n    \r\n    word_to_id = keras.datasets.imdb.get_word_index()\r\n    word_to_id = {k:(v+INDEX_FROM) for k,v in word_to_id.items()}\r\n    word_to_id[&quot;&lt;PAD&gt;&quot;] = 0\r\n    word_to_id[&quot;&lt;START&gt;&quot;] = 1\r\n    word_to_id[&quot;&lt;UNK&gt;&quot;] = 2\r\n    \r\n    id_to_word = {value:key for key,value in word_to_id.items()}\r\n    print(&#39; &#39;.join(id_to_word[id] for id in train_x[0] ))\r\n\r\nHowever, I agree with the comment by Nate Raw saying:\r\n\r\n&gt; This code is actually incorrect.

You need to skip `g[u][j]` if it is larger than `2 * (10^4)` inside of `bfs`, otherwise those values be enqueued which is a waste of space.

The `abc` object&#39;s state is changed when implementing the `add()` method and adding in an item. So, if I were to create a new instance of `ABCRentals` inside the `getId()` method, it would have an empty state as there&#39;d be no items added in the object. Is there any way I can implicitly retrieve the `abc` object without passing it as a parameter? My code above works, but my method signature cannot be the way it is.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119619/how-to-access-an-objects-state-without-passing-as-parameter-in-method","title":"How to access an object&#39;s state without passing as

copy constructor has an observable side effect (output). The (almost) golden rule of C++ optimizations is the **as-if rule**: Observable side effects must not be changed. But one of the two exceptions from this rule is the elision of some copy operations, specified here:\r\n\r\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/class.copy.elision\r\n\r\n&gt; When certain criteria are met, an implementation is allowed to omit the copy/move construction of a class object, even if the constructor selected for the copy/move operation and/or the destructor for the object have side effects.\r\n\r\nBut this is only allowed in very specific circumstances:\r\n\r\n&gt; This elision of copy/move operations, called copy elision, is permitted in the following circumstances (which may be combined to eliminate multiple copies): \r\n\r\n&gt; - in a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the expression is the name of a non-volatile **automatic** object [...]\r\n\r\nYour variable does not have automatic storage duration (i.e. it is not a local variable).\r\n\r\n&gt;
