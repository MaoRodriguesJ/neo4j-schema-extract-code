too far apart**, using the Pythagorean Theorem, you can add the elevation deltas in.\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;d use Pythagoras: let d the Haversine distance and dh the difference in altitudes, `D=sqrt(d**2+dh**2)`.\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction haversineWithAltitude(lat1, lon1, alt1, lat2, lon2, alt2) {\r\n    const groundDistanceInMeters = haversine(lat1, lon1,

am creating a small Open Layers Addon library with some common style and interaction to use it across some applications.\r\n\r\nSo I create this library in Typescript, and I use webpack to bundle It.\r\n\r\nToday, my library is a single class as follow :\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-ts --&gt;\r\n```\r\nimport Map from &#39;ol/Map&#39;;\r\nimport VectorLayer from &#39;ol/layer/Vector&#39;;\r\nimport VectorSource from &#39;ol/source/Vector&#39;;\r\nimport Feature from &#39;ol/Feature&#39;;\r\nimport GeometryType from &#39;ol/geom/GeometryType&#39;;\r\nimport {OlFeaturesStyles} from &#39;./Styles&#39;;\r\nimport {Draw} from &#39;ol/interaction&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\nexport class OpenLayersAddOn {\r\n  private map: Map;\r\n\r\n  private drawingFeaturesVector: VectorLayer;\r\n  private drawingInteraction: Draw;\r\n  private drawingFeaturesSource: VectorSource;\r\n\r\n  constructor(map: Map) {\r\n    this.map = map;\r\n\r\n    // const foo = new VectorSource();\r\n   \r\n    this.drawingFeaturesVector = new VectorLayer({\r\n      source: new VectorSource({features: []})\r\n    });\r\n    this.map.addLayer(this.drawingFeaturesVector);\r\n    this.drawingFeaturesSource = this.drawingFeaturesVector.getSource();\r\n\r\n    this.drawingInteraction = new Draw({\r\n      source: this.drawingFeaturesSource,\r\n      type: GeometryType.LINE_STRING\r\n    });\r\n    this.map.addInteraction(this.drawingInteraction);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use this library in an Angular component (in another project) as follow :\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-ts --&gt;\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, AfterViewInit, ViewChild, ElementRef } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\nimport Map from &#39;ol/Map&#39;;\r\nimport TileLayer from &#39;ol/layer/Tile&#39;;\r\nimport {OSM} from &#39;ol/source&#39;;\r\nimport View from &#39;ol/View&#39;;\r\nimport {IxOpenLayersAddOn} from &#39;ix-openlayers-add-on&#39;;\r\nimport GeometryType from &#39;ol/geom/GeometryType&#39;;\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: &#39;app-root&#39;,\r\n  templateUrl: &#39;./app.component.html&#39;,\r\n  styleUrls: [&#39;./app.component.css&#39;]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent implements AfterViewInit {\r\n  private addOn: IxOpenLayersAddOn;\r\n  private map: Map;\r\n  @ViewChild(&#39;map&#39;, { static: true }) private mapContainer: ElementRef;\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n\r\n    this.map = new Map({\r\n      layers: [ new TileLayer({source: new OSM()}) ],\r\n      view: new View({\r\n        center: [0, 0],\r\n        zoom: 2\r\n      })\r\n    });\r\n    this.map.setTarget(this.mapContainer.nativeElement);\r\n    this.addOn = new IxOpenLayersAddOn(this.map);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I launch my application, I can see my OpenLayer Map, and the &quot;Line String&quot; drawing interaction is installed.\r\nWhen I start drawing a polyline, I can see the classic &quot;blue polyline&quot; drawing, but when I go out of the interaction (by double clicking), my polyline is not drawn on the map.\r\n\r\nNow, if I create an useless VectorSource before creating my layer *(by uncommenting the ````const foo = new VectorSource();```` in the constructor of my addon)* : I can see my lines on map when drawing...\r\n\r\nSo my question is : **Why should I add the useless vector layer to be able to show my drawing.**\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t think that it can be an OpenLayers&#39;s bug (If I try the same code in a plain old script in an HTML file, everythings is fine).\r\n\r\nI think it can be somewhere in my bundling process (this is my first webpack library)\r\n\r\nHere is the webpack.config.js of the add-on project :\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n````\r\nconst path = require(&#39;path&#39;);\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    mode: &#39;development&#39;,\r\n    watch: true,\r\n    entry: {\r\n        lib: &#39;./index.ts&#39;,\r\n

checked, and my bundle-lib.js is quite small, I can read in it \r\n````\r\n/*!**********************************!*\\\r\n  !*** ./src/OpenLayersAddOn.ts ***!\r\n  \\**********************************/\r\n/*! no static exports found */\r\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\r\n\r\n&quot;use strict&quot;;\r\neval(&quot;\\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \\&quot;__esModule\\&quot;, { value: true });\\nconst Vector_1 = __webpack_require__ ...&quot;);\r\n````\r\nWith the whole transpiled version of my OpenLayersAddOn.ts.\r\n\r\nAnd for the OpenLayers import, they are just declared as this (because I don&#39;t want openlayer be part of my bundle) : \r\n````\r\neval(&quot;module.exports = __WEBPACK_EXTERNAL_MODULE_ol_geom_GeometryType__;\\n\\n//# sourceURL=webpack://OpenLayersAddOnLib/external_%22ol/geom/GeometryType%22?&quot;);\r\n````\r\n\r\nI have also check that the Openlayer

first thing to understand is that **multi-turn conversations and follow-up prompts are in preview**. This generally means one should expect bugs and missing functionality. In this case it means the feature is not only missing from the SDK, *it&#39;s even missing from the API reference*. You can see in the [Generate Answer reference][1] that a call to the `generateAnswer` endpoint includes a `context` property in its body, but the type of that object is undocumented. It links to the `Context` object type that gets returned in the response rather than what you&#39;re supposed to put in the request.\r\n\r\nSince your question mentions `CardHelper.GetHeroCard`, I presume you&#39;re already familiar with the [QnA Maker prompting sample][2]. If that is the case, *that is exactly the kind of information you should be volunteering to the people you&#39;re expecting to help you*. Leaving that information out cripples our ability to answer your question. In the future, you should link to every source you&#39;ve used to get to where you are now, to help your helpers and give them context.\r\n\r\nIf you are by some chance not familiar with that sample, it is the ultimate source of truth when it comes to multi-turn conversations in QnA Maker. That sample contains the entire answer to your question so I&#39;m unsure why you&#39;re not using it. However, you should have also seen what you need to do in [the documentation you should be following][3]:\r\n\r\n&gt; ## A JSON request to return a non-initial answer and follow-up prompts\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Fill the `context` object to include the previous context.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In the following JSON request, the current question is *Use Windows Hello to sign in* and the previous question was *accounts and signing in*. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ```JSON\r\n&gt; {\r\n&gt;   &quot;question&quot;: &quot;Use Windows Hello to sign in&quot;,\r\n&gt;   &quot;top&quot;: 10,\r\n&gt;   &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;Default&quot;,\r\n&gt;   &quot;isTest&quot;: false,\r\n&gt;   &quot;qnaId&quot;: 17,\r\n&gt;   &quot;context&quot;: {\r\n&gt;     &quot;previousQnAId&quot;: 15,\r\n&gt;     &quot;previousUserQuery&quot;: &quot;accounts and signing in&quot;\r\n&gt;   }\r\n&gt; }\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nQnA Maker doesn&#39;t save any state on its own, so it depends on your bot to give it the context from the previous turn. Your bot isn&#39;t doing that, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s not working. Here&#39;s a simplified version of the code from the sample to help you understand what you need to do:\r\n\r\n    async testQnAMaker(turnContext) {\r\n        var qna = new QnAMaker({\r\n            knowledgeBaseId: &#39;&lt;GUID&gt;&#39;,\r\n            endpointKey: &#39;&lt;GUID&gt;&#39;,\r\n            host: &#39;https://&lt;APPNAME&gt;.azurewebsites.net/qnamaker&#39;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        var context = await this.qnaState.get(turnContext) || {\r\n            PreviousQnaId: 0,\r\n            PreviousUserQuery: null\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        // We&#39;re passing a context property into the QnAMakerOptions\r\n        // even though it&#39;s not part of the interface yet\r\n        var results = await qna.getAnswers(turnContext, { context });\r\n        var firstResult = results[0];\r\n\r\n        if (firstResult) {\r\n            var answer = firstResult.answer;\r\n            var resultContext = firstResult.context;\r\n            var prompts = resultContext &amp;&amp; resultContext.prompts;\r\n            \r\n            if (prompts &amp;&amp; prompts.length) {\r\n                await this.qnaState.set(turnContext, {\r\n                    PreviousQnaId: firstResult.id,\r\n                    PreviousUserQuery: turnContext.activity.text\r\n                });\r\n                \r\n                answer = ChoiceFactory.forChannel(\r\n                    turnContext,\r\n                    prompts.map(prompt =&gt; prompt.displayText),\r\n                    answer);\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            await turnContext.sendActivity(answer);\r\n        } else {\r\n            await turnContext.sendActivity(&quot;I can&#39;t answer that&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBecause you&#39;re using a feature that&#39;s currently in preview, you will need to use your own ingenuity when it comes to figuring out how to use it. I&#39;m just using a state property accessor to save the context of the previous question on each turn, but it&#39;s likely that you&#39;ll want to build this into a dialog and save each user query in the dialog state. The point is that you&#39;ll have to save the QnA Maker state if you want the follow-up prompts to work.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** It turns out there is a way to use follow-up prompts without bot state if you put the context in the actions themselves, but that will only work if the user clicks the buttons instead of typing something: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58203069/display-text-for-qnamaker-follow-on-prompts/58209972#58209972\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/qnamakerruntime/runtime/generateanswer#request-body\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/qnamaker-prompting/javascript_nodejs\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/how-to/multiturn-conversation#a-json-request-to-return-a-non-initial-answer-and-follow-up-prompts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120273/botmaker-resolve-qnamaker-followup-questions/58193169#58193169","title":"Botmaker resolve Qnamaker Followup Questions"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":10228129,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VZ4KAapDtDU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASg/oWP-lG8b4zw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Oli Kuroh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10228129/oli-kuroh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3553,"user_id":2122672,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/602458008/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kyle Delaney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2122672/kyle-delaney"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58193169,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570837812,"creation_date":1569512110,"last_edit_date":1569968563,"question_id":58120273,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120273","body_markdown":"for my current project i try to use context-only follow-up prompts.\r\n\r\nMy problem is now, that some of the questions from the follow-up prompts are the same.\r\n[![qna example][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIn the qna ui the separations of the context works fine, but when the user answers the question from the chat i implementen in my application, qna returns the wrong answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode:\r\nBotbuilder version: 4.5.3\r\nNodeJS: 12.10.0\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\nonMessage(){.....\r\n\r\n    let results = qna.getAnswer(context);\r\n    if(results[0].context.prompts.length){ //  Answer with Follow-up\r\n          return context.sendActivity(CardHelper.GetHeroCard(results[0].answer, results[0].context.prompts))\r\n       }else{ // normal answer\r\n          return context.sendActivity(results[0].answer)\r\n       }\r\n}\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n```\r\nSample Questions:\r\n\r\nExpected Answer:\r\nI want to learn programming =&gt;

This is currently sorted in alphabetical order by the label.\r\n\r\nThis data structure is the structure required for Chart.js, which I am using to display a stacked bar chart on my webpage.\r\n\r\nEssentially what I need to accomplish is to sort the `data` array for every user in the `labels` array based on the sum of each data set for that user. I also need to sort the `labels` array to be in the same order.\r\n\r\nMy original idea on how to achieve this is to create a temporary array, loop through all the data sets and add them to this temporary array in the order necessary, but I got stuck after calculating the total for each user. Here is my attempt:\r\n\r\n    $return = [];\r\n    \r\n    foreach($calculated[&#39;labels&#39;] as $key =&gt; &amp;$name) {\r\n    \t\r\n    \t$total = 0;\r\n    \t\r\n    \tforeach($calculated[&#39;datasets&#39;] as $dataset) {\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\t$total += $dataset[&#39;data&#39;][$key];\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \techo &quot;$name - $total&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    \t\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHow can I sort my data and labels in descending order based on the total for each user from all datasets.\r\n\r\nHere is my expected output for the reduced data above\r\n\r\n    Array\r\n    (\r\n        [datasets] =&gt; Array\r\n            (\r\n                [0] =&gt; Array\r\n                    (\r\n                        [label] =&gt; NEW\r\n                        [backgroundColor] =&gt; #37fdfd\r\n                        [data] =&gt; Array\r\n                            (\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[2] =&gt; 5\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1] =&gt; 0\r\n                                [0] =&gt; 0\r\n                                [3] =&gt; 0\r\n                            )\r\n    \r\n                    )\r\n    \r\n                [1] =&gt; Array\r\n                    (\r\n                        [label] =&gt; Grade A\r\n                        [backgroundColor] =&gt; #76ef76\r\n                        [data] =&gt; Array\r\n                            (\r\n                                [2] =&gt; 11\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1] =&gt; 12\r\n                                [0] =&gt; 8\r\n                                [3] =&gt; 0\r\n                            )\r\n    \r\n                    )\r\n    \r\n                [2] =&gt; Array\r\n                    (\r\n                        [label] =&gt; Grade B\r\n                        [backgroundColor] =&gt; #f9f96d\r\n                        [data] =&gt; Array\r\n                            (\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[2] =&gt; 5\r\n                                [1] =&gt; 6\r\n                                [0] =&gt; 1\r\n                                [3] =&gt; 3\r\n                            )\r\n    \r\n                    )\r\n    \r\n                [3] =&gt; Array\r\n                    (\r\n                        [label] =&gt; Grade C\r\n                        [backgroundColor] =&gt; #f3ca36\r\n                        [data] =&gt; Array\r\n                            (\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[2] =&gt; 1\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1] =&gt; 0\r\n                                [0] =&gt; 3\r\n                                [3] =&gt; 4\r\n                            )\r\n    \r\n                    )\r\n    \r\n                [4] =&gt; Array\r\n                    (\r\n                        [label] =&gt; Grade D\r\n                        [backgroundColor] =&gt; #f3ca36\r\n                        [data] =&gt; Array\r\n                            (\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[2] =&gt; 1\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1] =&gt; 0\r\n                                [0] =&gt; 3\r\n                                [3] =&gt; 0\r\n                            )\r\n    \r\n                    )\r\n    \r\n            )\r\n    \r\n        [labels] =&gt; Array\r\n            (\r\n    \t\t\t[2] =&gt; User 2 //23 total across all data sets\r\n    \t\t\t[1] =&gt; User 1 //18 total across all data sets\r\n                [0] =&gt; User 0 //15 total across all data sets\r\n                [3] =&gt; User 3 //7 total across all data sets\r\n            )\r\n    \r\n    )\r\n\r\nThe `key` in the `labels` array acts as a unique identifier for each user in each `dataset` `data` array.\r\n\r\nNotice how each set of `data` inside of each `dataset` is in the same order, as is the `labels` array. Each set should be ordered by the total amount from all sets for each user, not necessarily the highest number in each dataset.\r\n\r\nFor clarification, each set of `data` in each `dataset` contains a list of values, the key for each value is directly related to the key for each user in the `labels` array. So in my example, we have User 0 who has the `key` &quot;0&quot;. This user has a total of 23 from adding up the values from each `dataset` with the key &quot;0&quot;.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120252/sorting-multiple-subarrays-based-on-a-total-count-from-all-sub-arrays","title":"Sorting multiple subarrays based on a total count from all sub arrays"},{"tags":["html","json","encoding","outlook","javamail"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5141,"user_id":4107888,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6AGkT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mohamad Shiralizadeh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4107888/mohamad-shiralizadeh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569512189,"post_id":58120250,"comment_id":102629317,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120250/how-to-use-json-correctly-in-an-html-email#comment102629317_58120250"},{"owner":{"reputation":25250,"user_id":1040885,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NXgVZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bill Shannon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1040885/bill-shannon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569530489,"post_id":58120250,"comment_id":102637408,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120250/how-to-use-json-correctly-in-an-html-email#comment102637408_58120250"}],"owner":{"reputation":6607,"user_id":2750966,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BYLSL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2750966/pme"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569512018,"creation_date":1569512018,"question_id":58120250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120250","body_markdown":"I have an HTML-Email, that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;  content=&quot;text/html charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Do not change next section&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;pre&gt;\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;from&quot;: &quot;..&quot;,\r\n      &quot;to&quot;: &quot;..&quot;,\r\n      &quot;statistic&quot;: {..},\r\n      &quot;creationDate&quot;: &quot;..&quot;\r\n    }\r\n        &lt;/pre&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\nSending this Email content with *Outlook-Exchange* it encodes the `JSON` inside the `HTML` to:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;...&amp;quot;,\r\n      ..\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSending it with *Mailcatcher* it works (`&quot;from&quot;: &quot;2019-08-01&quot;,..`).\r\n\r\nI use `javamail` for sending and receiving emails.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120250/how-to-use-json-correctly-in-an-html-email","title":"How to use JSON correctly in an HTML email"},{"tags":["php","codeigniter","angular-http-interceptors"],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":12125933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCRf7asR_yF3a8eMT2g5XWgR4TfGQ76scqIAueXFg=k-s128","display_name":"Vincent","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12125933/vincent"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569512013,"creation_date":1569512013,"question_id":58120247,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120247","body_markdown":"I&#39;m building an application in CodeIgniter and store an authorization token inside a http-only cookie.

I am just experimenting with the language at the moment, not trying to achieve anything from this example except understanding how javascript works &quot;under the hood&quot;. So let me explain it. I have a var declared and initialized to a string at the Window level (global), and a function that contains a while true loop statement. Inside the loop, there is a condition if it evaluates to true it will break the loop. The condition is x becomes 5. Last, there is a timed out self-invoking function that will set x to 5 after some milliseconds, and it is declared at the window level. The problem is the loop goes into infinity even if x has already been set to 5. Assuming time out function was called and returned. Remember x is global that is, it&#39;s visible to all the functions.\r\n\r\n The way I execute this code is by calling the loop function right after I refreshed the page. The timed out function will run the code inside after 10 seconds, plenty of time to run the loop. What I was expecting is the while true loop will break after the timed out function sets the global variable to 5. Although my expectations here are not correct, and that&#39;s what I am trying to clarify. Thank you in advance for taking the time to look at this problem. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar x = &quot;init&quot;;\r\n\r\n//run after 10s\r\nsetTimeout(\r\n  (setX = () =&gt; {\r\n    x = 5;\r\n    console.log(x);\r\n  }),\r\n\r\n  10000\r\n);\r\n\r\n// I am calling this function manually from the console\r\nfunction loopFunc() {\r\n  while (true) {\r\n    //continue looping until x = 5\r\n\r\n    if (x === 5) {\r\n      break;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  console.log(x);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120235/can-someone-explain-this-javascript-behavior","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Can someone explain this

You can&#39;t arbitrarily combine the two. Regular expression syntax is passed to the `re` module functions via strings, not as Python expressions.\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n\r\n    either = r&quot;({}|{})\\.(\\d+)&quot;.format(date28, date29)\r\n    res = re.search(either, date)\r\n\r\nbecause the regular expression pattern is combined into a single string using regular expression syntax *first*.\r\n\r\nNote that there is *no point* in using `date28` here, because everything that `date28` can match, can also be matched by `date29`. Moreover, `date28` won&#39;t match `02.19.`, a valid date in February.\r\n\r\nIf you want to construct a regex from &#39;labelled&#39; components, I recommend you use the `re.VERBOSE` flag, which causes whitespace in a regex (including newlines) to be ignored, and adds support for using `# ...` comments. To match whitespace, use explicit classes such as `[ ]`, `[\\n]`, `\\s`, etc. I often combine this with explicit group names too.\r\n\r\nE.g. your expression could be written out as:\r\n\r\n    february_date = re.compile(\r\n        r&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        (\r\n            02\\.     # month, always February\r\n            (        # Leap year\r\n                0[1-9]      # first 9 days\r\n                |\r\n                [12][0-9]   # remainder from 10 to 29\r\n            )\r\n            |\r\n            02\\.\r\n            (        # regular year\r\n                0[1-9]      # first 9 days\r\n                |\r\n                [12][0-8]   # remainder 10-18, 20-28\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n        \\.(\\d+)   # The year\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;, flags=re.VERBOSE)\r\n    res = february_date.search(date)\r\n\r\nThis format also makes it much easier to see that you are matching `02\\.` at the start in either pattern, which is rather redundant, and the above pattern of course still has the issue with `[12][0-8]` both being redundant against `[12][0-9]` and not actually matching the 19th of February.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I&#39;d just use `\\d{2}\\.\\d{2}\\.\\d{4}` and then use [`datetime.strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime) to validate that the matched text is actually a valid date. Building a regex to validate dates is a mammoth task, and simply not worth the effort.\r\n\r\nFor example, the pattern you tried to construct doesn&#39;t tell you that 2001 was not a leap year, so `02.29.2001` is not a valid date. But trying to parse it using `datetime.strptime()` throws an exception, telling you this isn&#39;t a valid date:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; date = &#39;02.29.2001&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.strptime(date, &quot;%m.%d.%Y&quot;)\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n      File &quot;/Users/mj/Development/Library/buildout.python/parts/opt/lib/python2.7/_strptime.py&quot;, line 458, in _strptime\r\n        datetime_date(year, 1, 1).toordinal() + 1\r\n    ValueError: day is out of range for month\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120211/how-does-the-or-operator-works-in-regular-expression/58120346#58120346","title":"how does the OR operator (|) works in regular expression?"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":5738019,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf0416a1e9cbb5090c064b17a7b67977?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"s.patra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5738019/s-patra"},"last_editor":{"reputation":768036,"user_id":100297,"user_type":"moderator","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24780fb6df85a943c7aea0402c843737?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martijn Pieters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58120346,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569514367,"creation_date":1569511904,"last_edit_date":1569512109,"question_id":58120211,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120211","body_markdown":"Want to use the or operator(|) within a regular expression match but its not working.

expression correct? I have tried it with alot of data and it seems to be wrong sometimes.\r\n\r\nI need to be certain that it will cover all edge cases.\r\n\r\nIf there is a better way of writing all this logic, it would help to, because this code looks to ugly and hard to understand for other people.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120206/how-to-validate-date-start-and-finish-overlap-from-a-list-of-items","title":"How to validate Date Start and Finish Overlap from a list

replicated your issue on GCP with an Ubuntu 18.04, seeing that the Docker documentation you followed is based on Ubuntu and could make it work:\r\n\r\n**Instance installation on GCP**\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n - In GCP Console, I have created an instance with the image “Ubuntu 18.04”. You can specify the image under the “Boot Disk” category. By default, the image selected is going to be Debian 9, make sure to change it. You can leave all the other settings on default.\r\n - Create instance and SSH into the instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Docker Installation on Ubuntu 18.04**\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n 1. Now on installing Docker, I followed the same documentation you provided:\r\nhttps://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu\r\n 2. Set up the repository. Make sure you install all the necessary packages indicated on the guide. You can verify if all of them have been installed with:\r\n```\r\n    $ dpkg -l apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common\r\n```\r\n 3. Add Docker’s official GPG as mentioned.\r\n```\r\n    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\r\n```\r\n 4. Don’t forget to add the repository:\r\n```\r\n    sudo add-apt-repository &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable&quot;\r\n```\r\n 5. Now to install the version 5:18.09.4:\r\n```\r\n    $ sudo apt-get update\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:18.09.4~3-0~ubuntu-bionic docker-ce-cli=5:18.09.4~3-0~ubuntu-bionic containerd.io\r\n```\r\n 6. Verify it works:\r\n```\r\n    $ sudo docker run hello-world\r\n```\r\n\r\n**DNS Resolution inside Docker with Busybox**\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n 1. I tried to replicated your same error but received a &quot;No answer&quot; error instead:\r\n```\r\n    $ sudo docker run --dns 8.8.8.8 busybox nslookup google.com\r\n    Server:         8.8.8.8\r\n    Address:        8.8.8.8:53\r\n    \r\n    Non-authoritative answer:\r\n    Name:   google.com\r\n    Address: 216.58.206.14\r\n    \r\n    *** Can&#39;t find google.com: No answer\r\n```\r\n 2. Typing &quot;**busybox**&quot; uses the latest version of the image available. Instead, I have tried with a different version and it worked fine:\r\n```\r\n    $ sudo docker run busybox:glibc nslookup google.com\r\n    Server:         169.254.169.254\r\n    Address:        169.254.169.254:53\r\n    \r\n    Non-authoritative answer:\r\n    Name:   google.com\r\n    Address: 216.58.208.46\r\n    \r\n    Non-authoritative answer:\r\n    Name:   google.com\r\n    Address: 2a00:1450:4001:81d::200e\r\n```\r\n```\r\n    $ sudo docker run --dns 8.8.8.8 busybox:glibc nslookup google.com\r\n    Server:         8.8.8.8\r\n    Address:        8.8.8.8:53\r\n    \r\n    Non-authoritative answer:\r\n    Name:   google.com\r\n    Address: 172.217.16.174\r\n    \r\n    Non-authoritative answer:\r\n    Name:   google.com\r\n    Address: 2a00:1450:4001:821::200e\r\n```\r\n 3. So I think we can confirm it was an issue with the image version. You can find more information about the image on the following link: \r\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/busybox?tab=description\r\n\r\nHope this has resolved some of your doubts.\r\n\r\nKind regards,","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120193/docker-cant-resolve-dns-on-google-cloud-compute/58203966#58203966","title":"Docker can&#39;t resolve DNS on Google Cloud Compute"}],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":865308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e38cdbb76bd11c73c34efd79e32e0b46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"anghel adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/865308/anghel-adrian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":57,"user_id":865308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e38cdbb76bd11c73c34efd79e32e0b46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"anghel adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/865308/anghel-adrian"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570027740,"creation_date":1569511861,"last_edit_date":1569851404,"question_id":58120193,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120193","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve setup Docker 18.09.4 on GCP Compute machine.

For example, at t1, the agent takes action a1 and is given the reward and the new state s1. Before the agent takes the next action at t2, some random events occurred in the environment that altered the state. Now when the agent takes action at t2, it&#39;s now acting on &quot;stale information&quot; since the state of the environment had changed. Also, the new state s2 will represent changes not only due to the agent&#39;s action, but also due to the prior random events that occurred. In the worst case, the action could possibly have become invalid for the new state that was introduced due to these random events occurred within the environment.\r\n\r\nHow do we deal with this? Does this mean that this use case is not a good one to solve with RF? If we just ignore these changing states due to the random events in the environment, how would that affect the various learning algorithms?

From [ HemIT Blog][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Where does this Virtual Directory come from? In my development environment, it comes from the following facts:\r\n\r\n&gt; - we are using SVN, and I tend to checkout the modules and compile them outside of my IIS websites\r\n- I am using the famous christoc template for module development (don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s great! It&#39;s just doing things behind our back that we might not foresee).\r\nIndeed, if I look in my project file:\r\n\r\n&gt; [![visual studio image][2]][2]\r\n\r\n&gt; The real culprit is Visual Studio!\r\n\r\n&gt; When you are checking your module out, if you have a site configured on IIS, project will open fine. However when you compile, if you are out of an IIS website, a virtual directory &quot;desktopmodule&quot; will get created, and hide the &quot;DesktopModules&quot; folder.\r\n\r\n&gt; Hence DNN can no longer find the DDRMenu module, hence it is failing.\r\n\r\n**The solution was really simple. Go into IIS and remove the virtual directory labeled &quot;desktopmodules&quot;:**\r\n\r\n[![delete virtual directory][3]][3]\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://blog.hemit.fr/2013/07/dotnetnuke-cant-find-ddrmenumenu-ascx/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hqFzD.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Irhs.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120175/2sxc-searchindexexception-search-error-while-indexing-module/58170567#58170567","title":"2SXC - SearchIndexException: Search: Error while indexing module"}],"owner":{"reputation":534,"user_id":4978814,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9214bb6eae0c09e635394d25bf8fd5c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TheIronCheek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4978814/theironcheek"},"last_editor":{"reputation":534,"user_id":4978814,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9214bb6eae0c09e635394d25bf8fd5c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TheIronCheek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4978814/theironcheek"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58170567,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569855783,"creation_date":1569511780,"last_edit_date":1569601400,"question_id":58120175,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120175","body_markdown":"I&#39;m getting the dreaded DNN Error &quot;An unexpected error has occurred&quot; with a link to return to the site.

You don&#39;t actually need card widget for this. You can add shadow on your container itself.\r\n2. You have to use stack to achieve this.\r\n\r\nAs I am hoping you are using the same code as my previous answer of your another question. I have updated the answer with stack layout &amp; your requirements\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n       Container(\r\n          child: Stack(\r\n            fit: StackFit.expand,\r\n            children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n              Positioned.fill(\r\n                child: Container(\r\n                  color: Colors.blue,\r\n                  alignment: Alignment.center,\r\n                  child: Text(&quot;Hello&quot;),\r\n                ),\r\n              ),\r\n              Align(\r\n                alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,\r\n                child: Container(\r\n                  height: 50,\r\n                  width: double.maxFinite,\r\n                  decoration: BoxDecoration(\r\n                      boxShadow: [\r\n                        new BoxShadow(\r\n                          color: Colors.black,\r\n                          blurRadius: 2.0,\r\n                        ),\r\n                      ],\r\n                      color: Colors.yellow,\r\n                      borderRadius:\r\n                          BorderRadius.vertical(top: Radius.circular(20.0))),\r\n                  child: Row(\r\n                    mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max,\r\n                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,\r\n                    children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                      IconButton(\r\n                        icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),\r\n                        onPressed: () {},\r\n                      ),\r\n                      IconButton(\r\n                        icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_downward),\r\n                        onPressed: () {},\r\n                      ),\r\n                      IconButton(\r\n                        icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_left),\r\n                        onPressed: () {},\r\n                      ),\r\n                      IconButton(\r\n                        icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_upward),\r\n                        onPressed: () {},\r\n                      ),\r\n                    ],\r\n                  ),\r\n                ),\r\n              )\r\n            ],\r\n          ),\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\n**editing steps for your code**\n\nI will try to explain the changes.\n\n 1. You have multiple items in your `Column`. Move everything except `Container` which you used as bottom bar (the last child of column) to another `Column` widget.\n\n 2. Put this last container child inside `Align` widget like my code\n\n 3. Put the newly created `Column` in `Positioned.fill` widget.\n\n 4. Change `column` of `scaffold` to `Stack`\n\n 5. Set this stack&#39;s fit property as `StackFit.expand`\n\n6. The body of you Scaffold should look like this.\n\n```\nStack(\n  fit: StackFit.expand,\n  children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n      Positioned.fill(\n        child: Column(\n           children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n           ....   // Your page body childs\n           ]\n        ),\n    ),\n    Align(\n       alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,\n       child: ...    // Your bottom bar container\n    )\n  ]\n)\n```\n\n&gt; To know more about stack visit [here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://youtu.be/liEGSeD3Zt8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120155/how-to-make-a-bottom-bar-with-border-radius-using-card-and-add-elevation-to-it-i/58134247#58134247","title":"How to make a bottom bar with border radius using Card and add elevation to it in Flutter?"}],"owner":{"reputation":191,"user_id":10764147,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gBYKY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"S.

[answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1428946/venn-diagrams-with-r/14895967#14895967). \r\n\r\nFor instance, `VennDiagram::venn.diagram` package has an `na` variable which gets `stop`, `remove`, and `none`. So, here we would use `remove`; however, it will only give us the diagram and not the table. You can explore other possibilities in other packages.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120146/how-to-identify-and-tally-intersection-items-in-r/58120853#58120853","title":"How to identify and tally intersection items in R"}],"owner":{"reputation":173,"user_id":9394364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"DJC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9394364/djc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":173,"user_id":9394364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"DJC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9394364/djc"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":93,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58120853,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569517828,"creation_date":1569511712,"last_edit_date":1569515427,"question_id":58120146,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120146","body_markdown":"I have a data frame which shows membership in three color classes. **Numbers refer to unique IDs.

With a perspective camera, the deeper the point goes, the greater its x, y coords will be. You need to set a depth (z) for the points to stop at. Additionally, if your camera moves or rotates, your `X, Y` coordinates will not work.\r\n\r\nI recommend you use a [`THREE.Raycaster`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/Raycaster), which performs all those camera projection calculations for you (the docs have an example of its usage at the top of the page). You can see that approach in action [in this example](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_interactive_voxelpainter).\r\n\r\nThe way it works is:\r\n\r\n1. You create a plane for the raycaster to hit (this is your depth).\r\n2. Create a raycast with Raycaster.setFromCamera()\r\n3. Read back the position where the ray hits the plane.\r\n4. Use this position to create your geometry.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120128/how-to-draw-a-geometry-shape-exactly-where-mouse-is-clicked-in-threejs/58122977#58122977","title":"How to draw a geometry shape exactly where mouse is clicked in ThreeJS"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":1107209,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e09387861a06997c98fa040c16136432?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1107209","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1107209/user1107209"},"last_editor":{"reputation":55577,"user_id":128511,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KwGaJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"gman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/128511/gman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569549789,"creation_date":1569511665,"last_edit_date":1569549789,"question_id":58120128,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120128","body_markdown":"I am trying to draw a circle exactly where mouse is clicked, but circle is drawn not at exact position.

Not sure where to go from here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120111/vbs-script-runs-in-batch-file-but-not-when-run-through-task-scheduler","title":".vbs script runs in batch file but not when run through task scheduler"},{"tags":["php","mysql","sql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36136,"user_id":1213708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e617b05eacf75c49dcf76ebb312292ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nigel Ren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1213708/nigel-ren"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1569511685,"post_id":58120109,"comment_id":102629058,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120109/how-to-convert-an-if-php-to-an-if-mysql#comment102629058_58120109"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12120307,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1324498344370258/picture?type=large","display_name":"Omar Ib&#225;&#241;ez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12120307/omar-ib%c3%a1%c3%b1ez"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569511600,"creation_date":1569511600,"question_id":58120109,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120109","body_markdown":"I am passing an msql query made in PHP to place it directly inside a stored procedure, but, I am having problems with IF statements\r\n\r\nThis is a small php code\r\n\r\nPHP CODE\r\nThis code works perfect \r\n\r\n    if ($ind_sin_np == 1) {\r\n      $sql .= &quot;AND EXISTS (\r\n      SELECT PG.id_pago\r\n      FROM pagos PG\r\n      INNER JOIN pagos_det_medios PM ON PG.id_pago=PM.id_pago\r\n      WHERE PG.id_pago=P.id_pago\r\n      AND PM.id_medio_pago&lt;&gt;99\r\n      )&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSQL STATEMENTS\r\n\r\nThese are the sentences that I am making taking as an example the php code\r\n\r\n    AND IF(@ind_sin_np==1, \r\n    EXISTS ( SELECT PG.id_pago \r\n    FROM pagos PG \r\n    INNER JOIN pagos_det_medios PM ON PG.id_pago=PM.id_pago \r\n    WHERE PG.id_pago=P.id_pago \r\n    AND PM.id_medio_pago&lt;&gt;99, TRUE))\r\n    \r\n\r\nYou have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near &#39;=1, \r\n\r\n    EXISTS ( SELECT PG.id_pago \r\n    FROM pagos PG \r\n    INNER JOIN pagos_det_medios PM O&#39; at line 21\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120109/how-to-convert-an-if-php-to-an-if-mysql","title":"How to convert an if php to an if mysql"},{"tags":["angular","directive","spy","angular-lifecycle-hooks"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8179,"user_id":419425,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHXfS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeanluca Scaljeri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/419425/jeanluca-scaljeri"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8179,"user_id":419425,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHXfS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeanluca Scaljeri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/419425/jeanluca-scaljeri"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569586254,"last_edit_date":1569586254,"creation_date":1569517671,"answer_id":58121668,"question_id":58120105,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58121668","body_markdown":"I think there are two options for\r\n\r\n    &lt;app-mycomp cleanup&gt;&lt;/app-mycomp&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n1) The directive knows its host component.

I have created an example below to show you how a text file and image can be read. This example is based on [FileReader examples][2] in another post.\r\n\r\n**Accessing the file**\r\n\r\nHere `element` is the `FileUploadInputElement` reference.\r\n\r\n`element.files[0]` or in case of multiple files `element.files` \r\n\r\n**Set up your file reader**\r\n```lang-dart\r\n  String option1Text = &quot;Initialized text option1&quot;;\r\n  Uint8List uploadedImage;\r\n  FileUploadInputElement element = FileUploadInputElement()..id = &quot;file_input&quot;;\r\n  // setup File Reader\r\n  FileReader fileReader = FileReader();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Use FileReader to read the file**\r\n\r\n`fileReader.readAsText(element.files[0])`\r\n\r\n\r\n**connect the listener for load event**\r\n```lang-dart\r\nfileReader.onLoad.listen((data) {\r\n              setState(() {\r\n                option1Text = fileReader.result;\r\n              });\r\n            });\r\n```\r\n\r\n**connect error events**\r\n```lang-dart\r\nfileReader.onError.listen((fileEvent) {\r\n              setState(() {\r\n                option1Text = &quot;Some Error occured while reading the file&quot;;\r\n              });\r\n            });\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `Image.memory` to show images from byte array.\r\n```lang-dart\r\nImage.memory(uploadedImage)\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; Note: In the following example we choose a file and click the respective button to handle the file reading. But the same can be achieved by connecting the logic in respective events of the `FileUploadInputElement` element in a similar approach. eg: `element.onLoad.listen` or `element.onError.listen` event streams.\r\n\r\n**Full Example**\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n```lang-dart\r\nimport &#39;dart:typed_data&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;package:flutter/material.dart&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;dart:ui&#39; as ui;\r\nimport &#39;dart:html&#39;;\r\n\r\nclass FileUploadTester extends StatefulWidget {\r\n  @override\r\n  _FileUploadTesterState createState() =&gt; _FileUploadTesterState();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass _FileUploadTesterState extends State&lt;FileUploadTester&gt; {\r\n  String option1Text = &quot;Initialized text option1&quot;;\r\n  Uint8List uploadedImage;\r\n  FileUploadInputElement element = FileUploadInputElement()..id = &quot;file_input&quot;;\r\n  // setup File Reader\r\n  FileReader fileReader = FileReader();\r\n\r\n  // reader.onerror = (evt) =&gt; print(&quot;error ${reader.error.code}&quot;);\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    ui.platformViewRegistry.registerViewFactory(&quot;add_input&quot;, (int viewId) {\r\n      return element;\r\n    });\r\n    return Row(\r\n      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,\r\n      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,\r\n      children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n        FlatButton(\r\n          color: Colors.indigoAccent,\r\n          child: Text(&#39;ReadFile&#39;),\r\n          onPressed: () {\r\n            fileReader.onLoad.listen((data) {\r\n              setState(() {\r\n                option1Text = fileReader.result;\r\n              });\r\n            });\r\n            fileReader.onError.listen((fileEvent) {\r\n              setState(() {\r\n                option1Text = &quot;Some Error occured while reading the file&quot;;\r\n              });\r\n            });\r\n            fileReader.readAsText(element.files[0]);\r\n          },\r\n        ),\r\n        Expanded(\r\n          child: Container(\r\n            child: Text(option1Text),\r\n          ),\r\n        ),\r\n        Expanded(child: HtmlElementView(viewType: &#39;add_input&#39;)),\r\n        Expanded(\r\n          child: uploadedImage == null\r\n              ?

Consumers have to resort to skipLibCheck to work around the issue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120091/library-global-typings-in-a-typescript-project","title":"library-global typings in a typescript project"},{"tags":["java","arrays","apache-spark"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":3453912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lCG1c.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yashwanth Kambala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3453912/yashwanth-kambala"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569573140,"creation_date":1569573140,"answer_id":58130742,"question_id":58120089,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58130742","body_markdown":"If your code deals with java8, which has `java.util.Spliterator&lt;T&gt;` , so you can use it to create list from jsonarray.\r\n\r\n\r\n**String type**\r\n```\r\nJavaRDD&lt;String&gt; JsonObject = json_Batch.javaRDD().flatMap(f -&gt; {\r\n        \tString res = f.getAs(&quot;Batch_Address&quot;).toString();\r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\t\r\n\t \t\t JSONArray jsonArr = new JSONArray(res);\r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\tList&lt;String&gt; list = StreamSupport.stream(jsonArr.spliterator(), false)\r\n\t \t            .map(val -&gt;   val.toString())\r\n\t \t             \r\n\t \t            .collect(Collectors.toCollection( ArrayList::new ));\r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\treturn list.iterator();\r\n\t \t\t \r\n        }); \r\n        \r\n        JsonObject.foreach(f -&gt; System.out.println(f));\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**JSONObject type**\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  JavaRDD&lt;JSONObject&gt; JsonObject = json_Batch.javaRDD().flatMap(f -&gt; {\r\n        \tString res = f.getAs(&quot;Batch_Address&quot;).toString();\r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\t\r\n\t \t\t JSONArray jsonArr = new JSONArray(res);\r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\tList&lt;JSONObject&gt; list = StreamSupport.stream(jsonArr.spliterator(), false)\r\n\t \t            .map(val -&gt;  (JSONObject) val)\r\n\t \t             \r\n\t \t            .collect(Collectors.toCollection( ArrayList::new ));\r\n\t \t\t \r\n\t \t\treturn list.iterator();\r\n\t \t\t \r\n        }); \r\n        \r\n        JsonObject.foreach(f -&gt; System.out.println(f));\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120089/how-to-apply-flatmap-on-jsonarray-and-convert-to-jsonobject-in-spark/58130742#58130742","title":"How to apply flatmap on JSONArray and convert to JSONObject in Spark?"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11260704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3013384f947b6aa81e0f6915ef51ea6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rateri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11260704/rateri"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58130742,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569573140,"creation_date":1569511520,"question_id":58120089,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120089","body_markdown":"I am working on spark java module, where I make a geocode api (batch request of 100 records).

(Thanks for calling it excellent.) Did you see the article that went with it? https://medium.com/@danielt1263/retrying-a-network-request-despite-having-an-invalid-token-b8b89340d29\r\n\r\nThere are two key elements in handling 401 retries. First is that you need a way to insert tokens into your requests and start your request pipeline with `Observable.deferred { tokenAcquisitionService.token.take(1) }`. In your case, that means you need a URLRequest.init that will accept a Resource and a token, not just a resource.\r\n\r\nThe second is to throw a `TokenAcquisitionError.unauthorized` error when you get a 401 and end your request pipeline with `.retryWhen { $0.renewToken(with: tokenAcquisitionService) }`\r\n\r\nSo, given what you have above, in order to handle token retries all you need to do is bring my TokenAcquisitionService into your project and use this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc getToken(_ oldToken: Token) -&gt; Observable&lt;(response: HTTPURLResponse, data: Data)&gt; {\r\n    fatalError(&quot;this function needs to be able to request a new token from the server. It has access to the old token if it needs that to request the new one.&quot;)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc extractToken(_ data: Data) -&gt; Token {\r\n    fatalError(&quot;This function needs to be able to extract the new token using the data returned from the previous function.&quot;)\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet tokenAcquisitionService = TokenAcquisitionService&lt;Token&gt;(initialToken: Token(), getToken: getToken, extractToken: extractToken)\r\n\r\nfinal class Client&lt;R&gt; where R: ResourceType {\r\n    let session: URLSession\r\n\r\n    init(session: URLSession = URLSession.shared) {\r\n        self.session = session\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func request&lt;T&gt;(_ resource: R) -&gt; Single&lt;T&gt; where T: Decodable {\r\n        return Observable.deferred { tokenAcquisitionService.token.take(1) }\r\n            .map { token in URLRequest(resource: resource, token: token) }\r\n            .flatMapLatest { [session] request in session.rx.response(request: request) }\r\n            .do(onNext: { response, _ in\r\n                if response.statusCode == 401 {\r\n                    throw TokenAcquisitionError.unauthorized\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n            .map { (_, data) -&gt; T in\r\n                return try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data)\r\n        }\r\n        .retryWhen { $0.renewToken(with: tokenAcquisitionService) }\r\n        .asSingle()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, it could be the case that the `getToken` function has to, for example, present a view controller that asks for the user&#39;s credentials. That means you need to present your login view controller (or a UIAlertController) to gather the data. Or maybe you get both an authorization token and a refresh token from your server when you login. In that case the TokenAcquisitionService should hold on to both of them (i.e., its `T` should be a `(token: String, refresh: String)`. Either is fine.\r\n\r\nThe only problem with the service is that if acquiring the new token fails, the entire service shuts down. I haven&#39;t fixed that yet.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120075/handling-401-status-w-rxswift-urlsession/58126527#58126527","title":"Handling 401 status w/ RxSwift &amp; URLSession"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":11709138,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebf45d7e3ed610a8c227e0d760b69e6b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Teddy K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11709138/teddy-k"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58126527,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569548205,"creation_date":1569511481,"question_id":58120075,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120075","body_markdown":"I currently have a network client that looks like the below:\r\n\r\n    class Client&lt;R: ResourceType&gt; {\r\n    \r\n        let engine: ClientEngineType\r\n        var session: URLSession\r\n    \r\n        init(engine: ClientEngineType = ClientEngine()) {\r\n            self.engine = engine\r\n            self.session = URLSession.shared\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        func request&lt;T: Codable&gt;(_ resource: R) -&gt; Single&lt;T&gt; {\r\n            let request = URLRequest(resource: resource)\r\n        \r\n            return Single&lt;T&gt;.create { [weak self] single in\r\n                guard let self = self else { return Disposables.create() }\r\n                let response = self.session.rx.response(request: request)\r\n    \r\n                return response.subscribe(\r\n                    onNext: { response, data in\r\n    \r\n                        if let error = self.error(from: response) {\r\n                            single(.error(error))\r\n                            return\r\n                        }\r\n    \r\n                        do {\r\n                            let decoder = JSONDecoder()\r\n                            let value = try decoder.decode(T.self, from: data)\r\n                            single(.success(value))\r\n                        } catch let error {\r\n                            single(.error(error))\r\n                        }\r\n                },\r\n                    onError: { error in\r\n                        single(.error(error))\r\n                })\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        struct StatusCodeError: LocalizedError {\r\n            let code: Int\r\n    \r\n            var errorDescription: String? {\r\n                return &quot;An error occurred communicating with the server.
