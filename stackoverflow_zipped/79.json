am developing an audit tracking sheet for some medical coder colleagues and would like to write a macro that would allow them to easily summarize the information they are tracking. The workflow is as follows...\r\n\r\n1. A Doctor is Selected for Audit\r\n\r\n2. Each Patient has his/her own unique tab created that contains their specific information\r\n\r\n3. The audit is performed in each sheet\r\n\r\nOnce the audit is complete, I need to summarize all the changes for one doctor. The naming convention of all the sheet is the same, as well as the structure. \r\n\r\nWhat I would like to have happen is let them run one macro that will copy columns &quot;R:T&quot; from every sheet in the workbook that contains the last name of the doctor and stack them on top of one another in a new sheet. However, I want this new sheet to be created from the Macro and the name of that sheet will be a user input. I hope this is clear. Let me know if anyone needs more detail. The following code is where I have started, but I need help to get further. Please see below.\r\n\r\n    Sub Summary_Sheet()    \r\n        Dim sArr() As String, Cnt As Long, WS As Object\r\n        Dim newName As String\r\n        ReDim sArr(0)\r\n        \r\n        newName = InputBox(&quot;Enter Doctor&#39;s Last Name&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        Sheets.Add After:=Worksheets(Sheets.Count)\r\n        ActiveSheet.Name = newName\r\n        \r\n        Cnt = 0\r\n        For Each WS In ActiveWorkbook.Sheets        \r\n            If InStr(WS.Name, newName) Then\r\n                ReDim Preserve sArr(Cnt)\r\n                sArr(Cnt) = WS.Name\r\n                Cnt = Cnt + 1\r\n            End If        \r\n        Next\r\n\r\n        If Cnt &gt; 0 Then Sheets(sArr).Select\r\n        Set WS = Nothing\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nCurrently the code will only create a new sheet and will not select based off the new sheet name. I know that the for loop will need to copy and paste each individual sheet as opposed to selecting all of them, but I wanted to turn to the experts.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the columns that are copied over will need the duplicates removed and I will need to save the sheet as a pretty PDF but I need to solve this problem first. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I posted my code below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    void validateAndSave() {\r\n        final form = _formKey.currentState;\r\n        if (form.validate()) {\r\n    \r\n          _formKey.currentState.save();\r\n          print(&#39;Form is valid&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n        //  _formKey.currentState.\r\n          print(&#39;form is invalid&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n      }\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n      Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n        return Scaffold(\r\n          appBar: AppBar(title: Text(&quot;Entry&quot;),\r\n            actions: [\r\n              new FlatButton(\r\n                  onPressed: () {\r\n                    //TODO: Handle save\r\n                   // _printl();\r\n                    //_confirm();\r\n                    validateAndSave();\r\n                  },\r\n                  child: new Text(&#39;Submit&#39;,\r\n                      style: Theme\r\n                          .of(context)\r\n                          .textTheme\r\n                          .subhead\r\n                          .copyWith(color: Colors.white))),\r\n            ],\r\n          ),\r\n          body:\r\n    \r\n          Form(\r\n             key: _formKey,\r\n             child: ListView.builder(\r\n                shrinkWrap: true,\r\n                itemCount: itemList.length,\r\n                itemBuilder: (context, index) {\r\n                  if (itemList.isEmpty) {\r\n                    return CircularProgressIndicator();\r\n                  } else {\r\n                    return singleItemList(index);\r\n                  }\r\n                }),\r\n        ),\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Widget singleItemList(int index) {\r\n        Item item = itemList[index];\r\n    \r\n        return Container(\r\n          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,\r\n          decoration: BoxDecoration(\r\n            color: Colors.white,\r\n          ),\r\n          child:\r\n          Row(\r\n            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,\r\n            children: [\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n              Expanded(\r\n    \r\n                child:Padding(\r\n                  padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(20, 10, 10, 20),\r\n    \r\n    \r\n                  child: new TextFormField(\r\n                   controller: _controller[index],\r\n    \r\n                  keyboardType: TextInputType.number,\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n                    //onSubmitted: (text) {\r\n                  //  takeNumber(text, item.id);\r\n                  //},\r\n    \r\n    \r\n                    validator: (value) {\r\n                      if (value.isEmpty) return &#39;value is required&#39;;\r\n                     \r\n                    },\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n                    decoration: new InputDecoration(\r\n    \r\n                      border: new OutlineInputBorder(\r\n                          borderSide: new BorderSide(color: Colors.indigo)),\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n                      labelText: itemList[index].id,\r\n                      \r\n                      suffixStyle: const TextStyle(color: Colors.red)\r\n                  ),\r\n    \r\n    \r\n                  ),\r\n                ),\r\n              ),\r\n    \r\n    \r\n            ],\r\n          ),\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        );\r\n    \r\n      }\r\n\r\nPlease help me.

The single equals = is the *assignment operator* in python, meaning that it stores the value on the right side of the = into the name given on the left.  For example,\r\n\r\n    myPetObjects = []\r\n\r\nassigns an empty list on the right to the name myPetObjects on the left.\r\n\r\nThe other change in the code you may notice in the line I rewrote is the quotations added to &#39;no&#39;.  This will compare the value referred to by the name &quot;input&quot; to the string literal &#39;no&#39;.  As previously written, &quot;no&quot; without quotes refers to a name/variable no, which has not been defined and will confuse Python.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing:  Since you are using a break statement, which will leave your loop once ran, you can update the while loop line to simply say\r\n\r\n    while True:\r\n\r\nThis way, the loop will continue indefinitely until explicitly exited with a &quot;break&quot; statement (which you have included).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the actual body of the while loop, it needs a little refactoring.  The statement\r\n\r\n    input(&quot;what type of animal&quot;)\r\n\r\nis a call to the built-in input function of python, and it will evaluate to, or return, a *string* inputted by the user when prompted with &quot;what type of animal&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo, we can treat it as a string.\r\nWith this in mind, let&#39;s create your pet objects.\r\nCreating an object in Python has the general syntax\r\n\r\n    object_name = class_name(parameters)\r\n\r\nwhere parameters refers to the parameters taken by \\__init__.\r\nThis will assign an object instance of your class class_name to object_name by using the assignment operator =.\r\n\r\nTo append a new object to myPetObjects, we do not need to assign our new object a name.  We can instead do:\r\n\r\n    myPetObjects.append(class_name(parameters))\r\n\r\nIn your situation, this can be written:\r\n\r\n    myPetObjects.append(petClass(input(&quot;what type of animal&quot;), input(&quot;what is its name&quot;)))\r\n\r\nSo, our entire loop:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    while True:\r\n        myPetObjects.append(petClass(input(&quot;what type of animal&quot;), input(&quot;what is its name&quot;)))\r\n        response = input(&quot;add another animal?&quot;)\r\n        if response == &#39;no&#39;:\r\n            break \r\n\r\nPerhaps a more easily readable version:\r\n\r\n    while True:\r\n        new_pet = petClass(input(&quot;what type of animal&quot;), input(&quot;what is its name&quot;))\r\n        myPetObjects.append(new_pet)\r\n        response = input(&quot;add another animal?&quot;)\r\n        if response == &#39;no&#39;:\r\n            break \r\n\r\nI hope this helps out, and let me know if you have any more questions, if something wasn&#39;t clear, or if I didn&#39;t answer the question the way you wanted.

i am writing a program for school where we have to make a random array using random numbers than find the min and max and how many duplicates.

When a single country is matched, I will then render some data about the country, then fetch and render the weather details for the single country&#39;s capital city. \r\n\r\nOne of the problems I&#39;m having is that when I set the state, the value always seems to be one step behind. For example, in this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/helgatheviking/pen/gOOmMwW) when you enter FRA you should get &quot;France&quot;. However, I have to enter &quot;FRAN&quot; to get the match. This doesn&#39;t happen when I don&#39;t use a state variable for the matches (just `let matches`). This becomes a problem because I need to run the next API call when the number of matches = 1, but the length of the matches state is always wrong.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to know 1. how to get the correct state of the matched countries. And 2. _when_ I should run the second API call without getting into an infinite loop.

I want there to be more space between `A` and the subgraph, and less space between nodes of the subgraph.\r\n2. I want `E` to be on the same vertical alignment as the other nodes. I want the `D -&gt; E` edge to be a flat line.\r\n3. I want the `E -&gt; B` edge to bend in a more aesthetically pleasing way. I would prefer it come out of the &#39;s&#39; port of `E`, take a rounded 90 left turn, continue left until it&#39;s reached node `B`, and then take a rounded 90 degree turn up, and enter the &#39;s&#39; port of `B` in a perpendicular way. I believe this occurs because of the way that graphViz spaces the spline points -- I guess what I actually want to do is drag every intermediate spline point down a little bit so that the left-traveling portion of the edge is flat.\r\n\r\nI have tried adjusting `nodesep` and `ranksep` parameters to solve the first two problems and not been able to consistently understand why the changes I make produce the changes they do. I have not been able to solve #3 at all.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am using *diagrammeR* in R to render this to PDF and HTML documents, so any answer here should be output format agnostic, in case it matters.\r\n\r\nAny advice? I&#39;ve tried scouring the graphViz documentation to no avail and I can&#39;t find any worked examples that exhibit these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BUe8.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514706/graphviz-dot-adjusting-node-placement-and-edge-shape","title":"graphViz/dot: Adjusting node placement and edge shape"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css","lightbox"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":611,"user_id":4176291,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KxYq8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dqlgnoleht","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4176291/dqlgnoleht"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571799068,"post_id":58514704,"comment_id":103356554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514704/fixing-the-size-of-your-lightbox#comment103356554_58514704"},{"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":11497131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79fa28b073debfb4c4ccd6f3e422b87b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hack Dawg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11497131/hack-dawg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571800803,"post_id":58514704,"comment_id":103356830,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514704/fixing-the-size-of-your-lightbox#comment103356830_58514704"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12260508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/3474503479234351/picture?type=large","display_name":"Worf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12260508/worf"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571801180,"post_id":58514704,"comment_id":103356901,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514704/fixing-the-size-of-your-lightbox#comment103356901_58514704"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12260508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/3474503479234351/picture?type=large","display_name":"Worf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12260508/worf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12260508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/3474503479234351/picture?type=large","display_name":"Worf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12260508/worf"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571801090,"creation_date":1571798370,"last_edit_date":1571801090,"question_id":58514704,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58514704","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a photo gallery with lightbox2 but whenever i put in more photos on the page where i have to end up scrolling down, my lightbox just keeps on getting larger.

I am getting 401 error when I try to call the `api/Test/AddUser` method. Is there a way I can send the cookie containing the JWT token through the authorization header automatically, similar to how `CookieAuthentication` does it? I know this is because of my not having an Authorization header. However because I stored my JWT token inside the HttpOnly cookie, I cannot find a way to pass the token into the authorization header. I could add Authorization { &quot;Bearer &quot; + token }. I would have to use sessionStorage or use a normal cookie but that would pop up some security concerns. I have seen many tutorials but have never seen how the javascript passes its authorization header, most show passing through authorization header in Postman.\r\n\r\n 2. If the above could be done, is there a way the expiration date could be synced up with the `CookieAuthentication` cookie? Since a JWT token expiration date cannot be extended like cookie, how would I ensure that the user is able to access the APIs and MVC if they are using two different types of authentication?\r\n\r\n 3. The project only uses HTTPS and I implemented anti forgery tokens inside the forms I submit. Is there any attacks I should protect against?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514669/jwt-authorization-using-httponly-cookie","title":"JWT Authorization using HttpOnly cookie"},{"tags":["javascript","html","reactjs","performance","render"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6819,"user_id":8012206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9JNr6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joseph D.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8012206/joseph-d"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571798206,"post_id":58514668,"comment_id":103356401,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514668/reactjs-rending-100-divs-without-any-rendering-hiccups#comment103356401_58514668"},{"owner":{"reputation":3481,"user_id":1123556,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zhvl4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Etienne Martin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1123556/etienne-martin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571798255,"post_id":58514668,"comment_id":103356406,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514668/reactjs-rending-100-divs-without-any-rendering-hiccups#comment103356406_58514668"},{"owner":{"reputation":4919,"user_id":6831341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wPogL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alexander Nied","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6831341/alexander-nied"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571798554,"post_id":58514668,"comment_id":103356472,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514668/reactjs-rending-100-divs-without-any-rendering-hiccups#comment103356472_58514668"},{"owner":{"reputation":137,"user_id":5091718,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c921127a030625df256c45fe08855fd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mohan Ramalingam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5091718/mohan-ramalingam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571813623,"post_id":58514668,"comment_id":103360337,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514668/reactjs-rending-100-divs-without-any-rendering-hiccups#comment103360337_58514668"}],"owner":{"reputation":527,"user_id":5733078,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/486048318249673/picture?type=large","display_name":"devamat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5733078/devamat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":527,"user_id":5733078,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/486048318249673/picture?type=large","display_name":"devamat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5733078/devamat"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571798387,"creation_date":1571798054,"last_edit_date":1571798387,"question_id":58514668,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58514668","body_markdown":"I have a component that renders 100 divs:\r\n\r\n      return (hive.map((hex)=&gt;\r\n              &lt;div\r\n                key={hex.id}\r\n                id={hex.id}\r\n                className={`hex hex-zoom-out`}\r\n                style={{ width: hex.width, height: hex.height, top: hex.top, left: hex.left }}\r\n                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup(hex.html)}\r\n                onClick={(e)=&gt;hex.link ? window.open(hex.link, &quot;_blank&quot;) : console.log(e.target.style)}\r\n                onMouseOver={(e)=&gt;hex.link ? &#39;&#39; : e.target.style.cursor = &#39;default&#39;}\r\n                onMouseEnter={(e)=&gt;startAnimation(e)}\r\n              /&gt;\r\n          )\r\n\r\n**PROBLEM:** I have an animated loader icon visible before the data that will fill the array is fetched.

Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    file = open(&#39;parsed_data.txt&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;)\r\n    for link in soup.findAll(&#39;a&#39;, attrs={&#39;href&#39;: re.compile(&quot;^http&quot;)}):\r\n        soup_link = str(link)\r\n        print soup_link\r\n        file.write(soup_link)\r\n        file.flush()\r\n        file.close()\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58514666/valueerror-i-o-operation-on-closed-file-in-jupyter-notebooks","title":"ValueError: I/O Operation on Closed File in Jupyter Notebooks"},{"tags":["html","css"],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":9053803,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4a5835570750eaa0b6e24fac1254c7a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"minorproblem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9053803/minorproblem"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571797990,"creation_date":1571797990,"question_id":58514664,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58514664","body_markdown":"I&#39;m in the middle of coding my personal website (which will be very bare-bones), and I have a section/page where it displays my images as a gallery.
