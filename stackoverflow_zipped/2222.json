How to test DELETE Request method:\r\n\r\n// delete application\r\n**Controller class**\r\n\t\r\n\r\n        @DeleteMapping(&quot;/applications&quot;)\r\n    \tpublic String deleteApplicationByObject(@RequestBody Application application) {\r\n    \t\tapplicationService.deleteById(application.getId());\r\n    \t\treturn &quot;Deleted&quot;;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\n// delete application\r\n**Service class**\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n    \t@Transactional\r\n    \tpublic String removeById(Long id) {\r\n    \t\tdao.deleteById(id);\r\n    \t\treturn &quot;SUCCESS&quot;;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\n// delete application\r\n**Dao class**\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n    \tpublic void deleteById(Long id) {\r\n    \t\tApplication application = findById(id);\r\n    \t\tem.remove(application);\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012029/how-to-test-delete-method-in-spring-boot-using-mockito-and-junit","title":"How to test DELETE method in Spring boot using Mockito and JUnit"},{"tags":["sql","postgresql","plpgsql"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10293432,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d235d3f6be6941a86dc9046730981d30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"skotian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10293432/skotian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568956063,"post_id":58012525,"comment_id":102446924,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012028/dbms-sql-last-error-position-error-position-for-postgresql-database/58012525#comment102446924_58012525"},{"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10293432,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d235d3f6be6941a86dc9046730981d30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"skotian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10293432/skotian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568958555,"post_id":58012525,"comment_id":102447619,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012028/dbms-sql-last-error-position-error-position-for-postgresql-database/58012525#comment102447619_58012525"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568900834,"creation_date":1568900834,"answer_id":58012525,"question_id":58012028,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58012525","body_markdown":"You don&#39;t specify in what programming language you want to access this information, and not all APIs give you access to the location of the error, but it is sent with the PostgreSQL error message.\r\n\r\nSee [the documentation for the C API][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; `PQresultErrorField`\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Returns an individual field of an error report.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     char *PQresultErrorField(const PGresult *res, int fieldcode);\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;code&gt;*fieldcode*&lt;/code&gt; is an error field identifier; see the symbols listed below. `NULL` is returned if the `PGresult` is not an error or warning result, or does not include the specified field.

During prepare the server already checks the privileges and will return an error.\r\n\r\nExample in C:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst char *stmt_str= &quot;INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (?)&quot;;\r\nif (mysql_stmt_prepare(stmt, stmt_str, strlen(stmt_str))\r\n{\r\n  printf(&quot;Error: %s\\n&quot;, mysql_stmt_error(stmt));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample in SQL:\r\n```\r\nmysql&gt; prepare my from &quot;insert into t2 values (?)&quot;;\r\nERROR 1142 (42000): INSERT command denied to user &#39;foo&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; for table &#39;t2&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution however is limited, since not all SQL statements can be prepared. The list of permitted statements can be found in the [MariaDB Documentation][1].\r\n\r\nIn case the prepare command suceeded, don&#39;t forget to free the prepared statement.\r\n\r\nIf you only need to check SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE privileges you can also use the EXPLAIN command which also checks permissions.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/prepare-statement/#permitted-statements","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012006/how-can-i-check-if-current-user-has-certain-privilege-on-mysql-mariadb/58028837#58028837","title":"How can I check if current user has certain privilege on MySQL/MariaDB?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":708,"user_id":6930501,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5637ccd51605f78822946e32fecb50c1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Georg Richter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6930501/georg-richter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569084363,"post_id":58036105,"comment_id":102484845,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012006/how-can-i-check-if-current-user-has-certain-privilege-on-mysql-mariadb/58036105#comment102484845_58036105"},{"owner":{"reputation":6089,"user_id":3824283,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l7OG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EternalHour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824283/eternalhour"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":708,"user_id":6930501,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5637ccd51605f78822946e32fecb50c1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Georg Richter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6930501/georg-richter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569086000,"post_id":58036105,"comment_id":102485225,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012006/how-can-i-check-if-current-user-has-certain-privilege-on-mysql-mariadb/58036105#comment102485225_58036105"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6089,"user_id":3824283,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l7OG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EternalHour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824283/eternalhour"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6089,"user_id":3824283,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l7OG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EternalHour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824283/eternalhour"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569023490,"last_edit_date":1569023490,"creation_date":1569022103,"answer_id":58036105,"question_id":58012006,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036105","body_markdown":"You could use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to query for the required privilege based on the action needing to be performed.\r\n\r\n    SELECT IF(COUNT(*) &gt; 0, TRUE, FALSE) AS Allowed\r\n    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_PRIVILEGES\r\n    WHERE GRANTEE LIKE &#39;%user%&#39; AND PRIVILEGE_TYPE = &#39;INSERT&#39;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58012006/how-can-i-check-if-current-user-has-certain-privilege-on-mysql-mariadb/58036105#58036105","title":"How can I check if current user has certain privilege on MySQL/MariaDB?"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":10575565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2016056871982963/picture?type=large","display_name":"Lukas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10575565/lukas"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569023490,"creation_date":1568899284,"question_id":58012006,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58012006","body_markdown":"How can I easily check if my current user has a certain privilege, e.g. if he can run the following statement:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO testdb (id) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;);\r\n\r\nOf course, I could try it but I need the information before I know what to insert.

&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;)))\r\n\r\nThis assumes that you only have two date formats present.  If there could be there or more, we would have to change the above solution to take that into account.\r\n\r\nHere is some sample data to show that this can be made to work:\r\n\r\n    t &lt;- data.frame(datetime=c(&quot;09/02/2017 15:50:55&quot;, &quot;2017-02-09 15:50:55&quot;))\r\n    t$dt &lt;- ifelse(grepl(&quot;\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{4} \\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}&quot;, t$datetime),\r\n                   as.POSIXct(strptime(t$datetime, &quot;%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S&quot;)),\r\n                   as.POSIXct(strptime(t$datetime, &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;)))\r\n    t\r\n\r\n                 datetime         dt\r\n    1 09/02/2017 15:50:55 1486651855   &lt;-- same values for dt, as expected\r\n    2 2017-02-09 15:50:55 1486651855","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011979/how-to-convert-all-datetimes-in-a-dataframe-column-into-a-particular-datetime-fo/58012102#58012102","title":"how to convert all datetimes in a dataframe column into a particular datetime format in R (when the csv file has stored them in different formats)"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":170625,"user_id":516548,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8d6b7cb1d943bc7a2f00c390be3fe97?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"G.

This dataframe is a product of a bunch of different processing steps applied to a series of individual files that were at some point merged into a single file (the individuals are identified by an id column). As the files must have been treated differently at some point, the format of the datetime column differs between the unique id blocks - i.e. some cells have the format &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot; and some have the format &quot;%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S&quot; even though all look like they are in the second of the two formats when I open the csv file.\r\n\r\nI want to load the data and split it by the unique id values before then doing a bunch of other stuff to it based on the datetime column. Unfortunately, no matter what I try to do, the data won&#39;t all be coerced into a single type of datetime format. I have tried reformatting the column in the original csv file, or loading the data and reclassing it as a POSIXct object with a single format, but when I do this those id blocks in the format that I am not specifying with the POSIXct command return as NAs (obviously!). I have also tried unclassing the data into a numeric format. Nothing I try seems to work, and my dataframe is too big to go through each id block separately! There has to be a way to do this and it has to be simple! Please someone put me out of my misery! Many thanks.\r\n\r\nExample data:\r\n\r\n    &gt; dput(t)\r\n    \r\n      row_id            datetime id\r\n    1 165656 09/02/2017 15:50:55  1\r\n    2 165657 09/02/2017 15:51:25  1\r\n    3 165658

this answer seems a lot more complicated than it really is. And without knowing specifically what your query looks like (re:`OR` conditions), I&#39;m not really sure how to structure it. It can be better. The goal should be to make one single trip to your SQL server with the query that makes the most sense for the data you&#39;re trying to get. I&#39;m not sure what you are trying to do with `cfsavecontent`, but I don&#39;t think you need it. \r\n\r\nThe bulk of my example query (https://trycf.com/gist/4e1f46bfa84a6748aced0f9ee8221c6d/acf2016?theme=monokai) is setup. I chose to go with a cfscript format, because as Redtopia said, I also find it much easier to build a dynamic query in cfscript.\r\n\r\nAfter initial setup, I basically just script out the variables I&#39;ll use in my final `queryExecute()`.\r\n\r\n    // Base query.\r\n    qry = &quot;SELECT count(*) AS theCount FROM IT_PROJECTS WHERE 1=1 &quot; ;\r\n    // This is our dynamic filter that we build below.\r\n    qfilter = {} ;\r\n    // Query options. \r\n    opts =  { &quot;dbtype&quot;:&quot;query&quot; } ;\r\n\r\nAfter we have our base, I build up the dynamic part of the query. This is the part that will likely change quite a bit depending on your current needs and setup. \r\n\r\nFor the first part, I basically replaced your `cfif` with a ternary evaluation. I&#39;m not sure how your data plays into the evaluation of `dept` or where that array comes from. But from there I build a basic included statement of the query and set up the queryparam values for it. Then I add a second check that will pick a different set of values for the query (currently based on even/odd seconds). Again, I&#39;m not sure of the intent of your query here, so I just made something dynamic.\r\n\r\n      //////////// BUILD DYNAMIC FILTER ////////////\r\n      \r\n      qdept = ( wrkDept == dept[2][1] ) ? &#39;Health&#39; : wrkDept ;\r\n      /// This one is an included filter:\r\n      qry &amp;= &quot; AND department = :dpt AND status = :sts &quot; ;\r\n      qfilter.dpt = {&quot;value&quot;:qdept,&quot;cfsqltype&quot;:&quot;CFSQLVARCHAR&quot;} ;\r\n      qfilter.sts = {&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Cancelled&quot;,&quot;cfsqltype&quot;:&quot;CFSQLVARCHAR&quot;} ;\r\n      \r\n      /// Adding Dynamic ORs\r\n      \r\n      // Dynamically set status based on even/odd seconds.\r\n      qStatus = ( now().second()%2==0) ? &quot;Cancelled&quot; : &quot;Active&quot; ;\r\n      qry &amp;= &quot; OR ( department = :dpt2 AND status = :sts2 ) &quot; ;\r\n      qfilter.dpt2 = {value:&quot;IT&quot;,cfsqltype:&quot;CFSQLVARCHAR&quot;} ;\r\n      qfilter.sts2 = {value:qStatus,cfsqltype:&quot;CFSQLVARCHAR&quot;} ;\r\n\r\nThis gives us a SQL string that looks like:\r\n\r\n    SELECT count(*) AS theCount \r\n    FROM IT_PROJECTS \r\n    WHERE 1=1 \r\n        AND department = :dpt AND status = :sts \r\n        OR \r\n        ( department = :dpt2 AND status = :sts2 ) \r\n\r\nWith a SQL statement, the placement of `AND` and `OR` conditions can greatly impact the results. Use parenthesis to group conditions how you need them. \r\n\r\nAfter we&#39;ve built the query string, we just have to plug it and our queryparams into the `queryExecute()`.\r\n\r\n      result = queryExecute( qry , qfilter , opts ) ;\r\n\r\nAnd if we want to output our data, we can go:\r\n\r\n      writeOutput(&quot;There are &quot; &amp; result.theCount &amp; &quot; records.&quot; ) ;\r\n\r\nWhich gives us:\r\n\r\n    There are 8 records.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don&#39;t know what your main conditions look like. If you can give me an example of a query with a bunch of `OR`s and `AND`s, I&#39;ll try to modify this for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011970/cfsavecontent-display-double-apostrophe-in-sql-statement/58020185#58020185","title":"cfsavecontent display double apostrophe in SQL statement"}],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":6678503,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10157273132680444/picture?type=large","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6678503/michael"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568938003,"creation_date":1568899173,"question_id":58011970,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58011970","body_markdown":"I have several OR in my SQL statement so I want to save a chuck of it in a cfsavecontent.

I am also free to use any other delimiter if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I want to read the `unsigned int` first in order to be able to read the actual data. I am thinking of `memcpy` but I am not sure how can I get the exact unsigned int value as I think `memcpy` copies character by character. How can I extract `10` as it is from the content?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011965/how-to-copy-for-the-following-scenario","title":"How to copy for the following scenario?"},{"tags":["python","apache-spark","elasticsearch","pyspark","jks"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3839,"user_id":9510729,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HbuuPS6a5d4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/8hLG9Jvhyzc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jxc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9510729/jxc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569111716,"post_id":58011961,"comment_id":102490081,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011961/unable-to-read-keystore-file-from-pyspark#comment102490081_58011961"},{"owner":{"reputation":124399,"user_id":4604579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reC2t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Val","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604579/val"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569131159,"post_id":58011961,"comment_id":102492193,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011961/unable-to-read-keystore-file-from-pyspark#comment102492193_58011961"},{"owner":{"reputation":1264,"user_id":605343,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0aae278ac8c8a632fb429d5b3264c302?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RAVITEJA SATYAVADA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/605343/raviteja-satyavada"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":124399,"user_id":4604579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reC2t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Val","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604579/val"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569147979,"post_id":58011961,"comment_id":102495235,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011961/unable-to-read-keystore-file-from-pyspark#comment102495235_58011961"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1264,"user_id":605343,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0aae278ac8c8a632fb429d5b3264c302?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RAVITEJA SATYAVADA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/605343/raviteja-satyavada"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569149475,"post_id":58044970,"comment_id":102495578,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011961/unable-to-read-keystore-file-from-pyspark/58044970#comment102495578_58044970"},{"owner":{"reputation":93768,"user_id":2308683,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eac16c9fc481cb6825f8b3a35f916b5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cricket_007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2308683/cricket-007"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1264,"user_id":605343,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0aae278ac8c8a632fb429d5b3264c302?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RAVITEJA SATYAVADA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/605343/raviteja-satyavada"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569160830,"post_id":58044970,"comment_id":102498154,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011961/unable-to-read-keystore-file-from-pyspark/58044970#comment102498154_58044970"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":93768,"user_id":2308683,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eac16c9fc481cb6825f8b3a35f916b5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cricket_007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2308683/cricket-007"},"last_editor":{"reputation":93768,"user_id":2308683,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eac16c9fc481cb6825f8b3a35f916b5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cricket_007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2308683/cricket-007"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569808938,"last_edit_date":1569808938,"creation_date":1569109557,"answer_id":58044970,"question_id":58011961,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58044970","body_markdown":"I think you&#39;re using the wrong option\r\n\r\n&gt; For Python, you can use the `--py-files` argument of spark-submit to add **.py, .zip or .egg files** to be distributed with your application\r\n\r\nInstead you want `--files`\r\n\r\n&gt; `--files FILES: Comma-separated list of files to be placed in the working directory of each executor.

I wasn&#39;t sure how to make it more precise.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m processing financial report data and I&#39;ve come to realise that this data is not all reliable.\r\n\r\nFor my use case I need all report entries to be quarterly, and all quarters to be present for a given year. This means that if for some reason quarters are missing or were reported as half-years (either for parts of the year of the full year), I need to transform those reports into four quarterly reports as far as possible.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m also realising that my prowess in pandas is not up to snuff to deal with this, in my opinion, tangled reindexing.\r\n\r\nHere is some data that is not at all unusual to find in the data set I have available:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;date&#39;: [&#39;2021-12-31&#39;, &#39;2021-12-31&#39;, &#39;2021-04-31&#39;,&#39;2020-12-31&#39;, &#39;2020-12-31&#39;, &#39;2020-06-30&#39;, &#39;2020-04-31&#39;, \r\n                                &#39;2019-01-15&#39;, &#39;2019-01-15&#39;, &#39;2019-01-15&#39;, &#39;2019-09-30&#39;, \r\n                                &#39;2019-06-30&#39;, &#39;2018-12-31&#39;, &#39;2018-12-31&#39;],\r\n                        &#39;fiscal_period&#39;: [&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;Q4&#39;,&#39;Q1&#39;&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;Q4&#39;,&#39;H1&#39;,&#39;Q1&#39;,&#39;H2&#39;,&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;Q4&#39;,&#39;Q3&#39;,&#39;Q2&#39;,&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;H2&#39;],\r\n                        &#39;fiscal_year&#39;: [&#39;2021&#39;,&#39;2021&#39;,&#39;2021&#39;,&#39;2020&#39;,&#39;2020&#39;,&#39;2020&#39;,&#39;2020&#39;,&#39;2019&#39;,\r\n                                        &#39;2019&#39;,&#39;2019&#39;,&#39;2019&#39;,&#39;2019&#39;,&#39;2018&#39;,&#39;2018&#39;] }\r\n                        )\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; df.set_index(&#39;date&#39;)\r\n               fiscal_period fiscal_year\r\n    date                                \r\n    2021-12-31             Y        2021\r\n    2021-12-31            Q4        2021\r\n    2021-04-31            Q1        2021\r\n    2020-12-31             Y        2020\r\n    2020-12-31            Q4        2020\r\n    2020-06-30            H1        2020\r\n    2020-04-31            Q1        2020\r\n    2019-01-15            H2        2019\r\n    2019-01-15             Y        2019\r\n    2019-01-15            Q4        2019\r\n    2019-09-30            Q3        2019\r\n    2019-06-30            Q2        2019\r\n    2018-12-31             Y        2018\r\n    2018-12-31            H2        2018\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this data, I need to turn half-years into quarters and insert &#39;missing&#39; quarters. &#39;Missing&#39; in the example would be 2019-Q1, 2020-Q3, 2021-Q2 and 2021-Q3.\r\n\r\nFor my use case it doesn&#39;t matter where the &#39;new&#39; quarters are inserted in their allotted time period, so 2019-Q1 can be anywhere from 2019-01-01 and 2019-06-29. The only requirement is that the order must be correct, i.e. 2019-Q1 must be earlier in time than 2019-Q2.\r\n\r\nAttempts\r\n-------------------------\r\nOne of my initial attempts was to reindex quarterly, which I eventually realised doesn&#39;t work since companies do not report at the end of months and dates can vary wildly. Another attempt was to resample on 3-month basis which doesn&#39;t work either since reports are sometimes delayed and don&#39;t come in 3-month intervals.\r\n\r\nMy current attempt is to group by `fiscal_year`, check for the existence of each quarter, and then insert them &quot;manually&quot;. I&#39;m certain that this will take way too long though given my 10 years of data for over 30k companies. \r\n\r\nMy requirements for the output\r\n----------------------\r\n - Each year must have a Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 (and a Y, but they all have that already)\r\n - It doesn&#39;t matter where new quarters are inserted as long as fiscal period are in the correct order within each fiscal year.\r\n - Half-years should be turned into their appropriate matching quarters.

This uses `id` because it seems more stable than date/times (there are duplicate date/time values in one of the columns).\r\n- When the ids are different, then a new island is identified.  The cumulative sum identifies the groups.\r\n- This `grp` is then used to calculate values over the entire group, using window functions.\r\n- The outer query then just filters down to the first row in each group.\r\n\r\n[Here][1] is a db&lt;&gt;fiddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=sqlserver_2017&amp;fiddle=88b93a7a79d0e0b81fe8dae6b5862346","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011938/merge-groups-of-consecutive-rows-in-t-sql-and-sum-values-from-each-group/58013271#58013271","title":"Merge groups of consecutive rows in T-SQL and sum values from each group"}],"owner":{"reputation":557,"user_id":3763715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f958964390468f36d326bfa029f3026d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Efstathios Chatzikyriakidis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3763715/efstathios-chatzikyriakidis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":557,"user_id":3763715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f958964390468f36d326bfa029f3026d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Efstathios Chatzikyriakidis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3763715/efstathios-chatzikyriakidis"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":89,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58013271,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570673421,"creation_date":1568899086,"last_edit_date":1570568054,"question_id":58011938,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58011938","body_markdown":"Updated 10/08/2019:\r\n\r\n@Gordon Linoff: I have tried to applied your solution but I realized that is not working as expected.

The T-SQL query needs to run in MS SQL Server in Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse.\r\n\r\nDesired Result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|    Id    |     SessionId    | Transaction |       DateTimeEnd  |      DateStart     |   Rank  |\r\n|----------|------------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|\r\n|    1     |         1        |      Deposit|2017-01-20T11:16:33Z|2017-01-20T11:16:33Z|   600   |\r\n|    2     |         1        |   Withdrawal|2017-01-21T11:16:33Z|2017-01-20T11:16:33Z|   100   |\r\n|  4       |         1        |   Withdrawal|2017-01-24T11:16:33Z|2017-01-21T11:16:33Z|   300   |\r\n|  7       |         1        |   Withdrawal|2017-01-28T11:16:33Z|2017-01-26T11:16:33Z|    30   |\r\n|    3     |         2        |      Deposit|2017-02-23T11:16:33Z|2017-02-23T11:16:33Z|   500   |\r\n|    6     |         2        |   Withdrawal|2017-02-27T11:16:33Z|2017-02-23T11:16:33Z|   200   |\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried so many approaches and couldn&#39;t implement it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011938/merge-groups-of-consecutive-rows-in-t-sql-and-sum-values-from-each-group","title":"Merge groups of consecutive rows in T-SQL and sum values from each group"},{"tags":["postgresql","pgadmin","postgresql-9.5","import-csv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3732,"user_id":3733070,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bayif.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"404","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3733070/404"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568899735,"post_id":58011937,"comment_id":102428493,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011937/import-csv-in-pgadmin-3-with-autoincrement-id#comment102428493_58011937"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12056635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77dc15e25fd46f7f55555ce1a61bd562?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Apurva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12056635/apurva"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3732,"user_id":3733070,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bayif.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"404","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3733070/404"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568949404,"post_id":58011937,"comment_id":102445728,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011937/import-csv-in-pgadmin-3-with-autoincrement-id#comment102445728_58011937"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12056635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77dc15e25fd46f7f55555ce1a61bd562?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Apurva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12056635/apurva"},"last_editor":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568899739,"creation_date":1568899085,"last_edit_date":1568899739,"question_id":58011937,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58011937","body_markdown":"I want to import CSV in PGAdmin III with ID field auto increment.

Hence will improve readability, but not the efficiency.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why it&#39;s usually better to project nested object into unflattened DTO property, i.e. instead of `OwnerFirstName`, `OwnerLastName`, `OwnerEmailAddress` have a class with properties `FirstName`, `LastName`, `EmailAddress` and property let say `Owner` of that type in `OrganizationListItem` (similar to entity with reference navigation property). This way you will be able to use something like\r\n\r\n    dbContext.Organizations.AsNoTracking()\r\n        .Select(x =&gt; new\r\n        {\r\n            Id = x.Organization.Id,\r\n            Name = x.Organization.Name,\r\n            Owner = x.Members\r\n                .Where(member =&gt; member.Role == RoleType.Owner)\r\n                .OrderBy(member =&gt; member.CreatedAt)\r\n                .Select(member =&gt; new OwnerInfo // the new class\r\n                 {\r\n                     FirstName = member.FirstName,\r\n                     LastName = member.LastName,\r\n                     EmailAddress = member.EmailAddress\r\n                 })\r\n                .FirstOrDefault()\r\n        })\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in pre 3.0 versions EF Core will generate N + 1 SQL queries for this LINQ query, but in 3.0+ it will generate a single and quite efficient SQL query.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011931/how-can-i-reuse-a-subquery-inside-a-select-expression/58013491#58013491","title":"How can I reuse a subquery inside a select expression?"}],"owner":{"reputation":796,"user_id":10485848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tRear.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Redstone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10485848/redstone"},"last_editor":{"reputation":796,"user_id":10485848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tRear.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Redstone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10485848/redstone"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58013491,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568903806,"creation_date":1568899062,"last_edit_date":1568900088,"question_id":58011931,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58011931","body_markdown":"In my database I have two tables `Organizations` and `OrganizationMembers`, with a 1:N relationship.\r\n\r\nI want to express a query that returns each organization with the first and last name of the *first organization owner*.\r\n\r\nMy current select expression works, but it&#39;s neither efficient nor does it look right to me, since every subquery gets defined multiple times.\r\n\r\n```\r\nawait dbContext.Organizations\r\n    .AsNoTracking()\r\n    .Select(x =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        return new OrganizationListItem\r\n        {\r\n            Id = x.Id,\r\n            Name = x.Name,\r\n            OwnerFirstName = (x.Members.OrderBy(member =&gt; member.CreatedAt).First(member =&gt; member.Role == RoleType.Owner)).FirstName,\r\n            OwnerLastName = (x.Members.OrderBy(member =&gt; member.CreatedAt).First(member =&gt; member.Role == RoleType.Owner)).LastName,\r\n            OwnerEmailAddress = (x.Members.OrderBy(member =&gt; member.CreatedAt).First(member =&gt; member.Role == RoleType.Owner)).EmailAddress\r\n        };\r\n    })\r\n    .ToArrayAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it somehow possible to summarize or reuse the subqueries, so I don&#39;t need to define them multiple times?\r\n\r\nNote that I&#39;ve already tried storing the subquery result in a variable.

created a RegEx on my textbox to validate an exact text (case-insensitive) on a DocuSign envelope: ***^(?i)(Lu, approuv&#233; 1000 parts)$***\r\n\r\nWhen opening the envelope, if I type the correct or wrong text the textbox stray red-highlighted. Thus I cannot approve my envelope, and my RegEx error message is even not displayed (same behaviour if no content provided).\r\n\r\nOn the [DocuSign data validation guide][1], it is said that we can use [RegexStorm.NET][2] to test our RegEx. I did it and it works.\r\n\r\nIt is also stated in the documentation that DocuSign uses the .NET RegEx engine. I did a test in .NET and once again my RegEx works (see [my .NET Fiddle][3]).\r\n\r\nIf I remove `(?i)` from my RegEx it works, but I need case-insensitive.\r\n\r\nIt seems there is a problem DocuSign-side with RegEx.\r\n\r\nAny idea how can I do that?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-data-validation-for-text-fields\r\n  [2]: http://regexstorm.net/tester\r\n  [3]: https://dotnetfiddle.net/7JSHeZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011910/regex-not-working-on-docusign-for-text-validation","title":"RegEx not working on DocuSign for text validation"},{"tags":["c#","json","system.runtime.serialization.json"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3740,"user_id":2077651,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16036f8a383cc2cf4cde596b7f9f3a42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ganesh Kamath -

When I run the app, I can see it has been populated, but looking at the actual form, it is empty.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried replacing the control with just a label, and they show up fine, it&#39;s just when I try to use the user control that it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nThis code runs in the Load method and generates a list of `GridSquareModel`, which is used to populate the user control. Each model has an X and Y position which relates to their cell on the table panel.\r\n```cs\r\nvar startup = new StartupForm();\r\nif (startup.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)\r\n{\r\n    var grid = new List&lt;GridSquareModel&gt;();\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 64; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        Position pos = new Position();\r\n        pos.X = i % 8;\r\n        pos.Y = i / 8;\r\n        grid.Add(new GridSquareModel(pos));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    RenderGrid(grid);\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    Application.Exit();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method generates a `GridSquareControl` for every `GridSquareModel` in the list.

older versions of [tag:visual-studio] required a complete definition of the type for `default_deleter` to be *defined.* ([I know this was the case in Visual Studio 2012](https://stackoverflow.com/q/57992892/2642059) but I&#39;d give bonus points to anyone who could tell me which version remedied this.)\r\n\r\nTo work around this I can write a `custom_deleter` function like so:\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    void custom_deleter(T* param) {\r\n        delete param;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd declare a smart pointer on a forward declared type like so: `unique_ptr&lt;Foo, function&lt;void(Foo*)&gt;&gt; pFoo`, assigning this pointer where `Foo` was completely declared like so: `pFoo = decltype(pFoo)(new Foo, function(custom_deleter&lt;Foo&gt;))`\r\n\r\nNow as suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57992892/workaround-for-making-a-unique-ptr-to-a-forward-declared-type/58011286#comment102427027_58011286), I&#39;d like to make my `custom_deleter` into a

*should* allow me to declare: `unique_ptr&lt;Foo, MyDeleter&gt;` and assign: `pFoo = decltype(pFoo)(new Foo)` However when I try to do this in [tag:visual-studio-2012] I get:\r\n\r\n&gt; warning C4150: deletion of pointer to incomplete type `Foo;` no destructor called\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can work around this as well?\r\n\r\n[&lt;kbd&gt;Live

From the [vimhelp website][1]:\r\n\r\n &gt; Examples are often given in the `&lt;&gt;` notation.  Sometimes this is just to make\r\nclear what you need to type, but often it can be typed literally, e.g., with\r\nthe `:map` command.  The rules are:\r\n\r\n &gt; 1.  Any printable characters are typed directly, except backslash and `&lt;`\r\n &gt; 2.  A backslash is represented with `&quot;\\\\&quot;`, double backslash, or `&quot;&lt;Bslash&gt;&quot;`.\r\n &gt; 3.  **A real `&lt;` is represented with `&quot;\\&lt;&quot;` or `&quot;&lt;lt&gt;&quot;`. When there is no\r\n     confusion possible, a `&lt;` can be used directly.**\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt goes on to give an example for mapping &lt;kbd&gt;C-H&lt;/kbd&gt; to the six characters &quot;&lt; Home&gt;&quot;. I&#39;ve replaced it with &quot;&lt; yes&gt;&quot; because home is a keyword.\r\n``` \r\n:imap &lt;C-H&gt; \\&lt;yes&gt;\r\n```\r\nTry it yourself; &lt;kbd&gt;C-H&lt;/kbd&gt; will print the literal string &quot;&lt; yes&gt;&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo for your command, it&#39;s escaping the &lt;kbd&gt;C-y&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;C-g&lt;/kbd&gt; key sequences into their literal string representations; `&quot;&lt;C-y&gt;&quot;` and `&quot;&lt;C-g&gt;&quot;`, respectively. Originally, this was done because the `&lt;expr&gt;` attribute makes it so the command expects to get the _string representation_ of the command to execute, not the already-parsed control sequence itself. But this escaping is useless, as it&#39;s already in double quotes. That&#39;s why the behavior doesn&#39;t change when you remove the slashes.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#%3C%3E","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011877/what-is-the-difference-between-escaping-a-keycode-in-an-expr-noremap/58012388#58012388","title":"What is the difference between escaping a keycode in an &lt;expr&gt;

And normally you would just inject `IConfiguration` through constructor injection:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute\r\n{\r\n    private readonly IConfiguration _config;\r\n\r\n    public MyActionFilter(IConfiguration config)\r\n    {\r\n        _config = config;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would work but that also means when you use the action filter, you need to supply `IConfiguration` as one of the parameters:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIt would be better if you don&#39;t have to provide the dependencies manually.\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n### Use `GetService&lt;&gt;` instead ###\r\n\r\nOne way to go around it is to get the required service(s) on one of the overrides instead:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\n\r\npublic class MyActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute\r\n{\r\n    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)\r\n    {\r\n        var config = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetService&lt;IConfiguration&gt;();\r\n\r\n        string recaptchaVersion = config.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(&quot;recaptcha:version&quot;);\r\n\r\n        base.OnActionExecuting(context);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if your `appsettings.json` has something like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  &quot;recaptcha&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;secretKey&quot;: &quot;xxx&quot;,\r\n    &quot;siteKey&quot;: &quot;xxx&quot;,\r\n    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;v3&quot;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `config.GetValue&lt;&gt;` should give you what you want to access\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DtdHI.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lZqIN.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011870/inject-iconfiguration-into-actionfilter/58012764#58012764","title":"Inject IConfiguration into ActionFilter"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10916827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ealb_qsfasY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/C2FF4Nfz7_g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shreyas Pednekar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10916827/shreyas-pednekar"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58012764,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568901629,"creation_date":1568898865,"question_id":58011870,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58011870","body_markdown":"We can inject IConfiguration into class like this:\r\n\r\n    //Controller\r\n    AppSettings obj = new AppSettings(_configuration);\r\n\r\n    //Class\r\n    public class AppSettings\r\n    {\r\n        private IConfiguration _configuration;\r\n\r\n        public AppSettings(IConfiguration configuration)\r\n        {\r\n            _configuration = configuration;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m trying to inject IConfiguration into my ActionFilter.

Just to explain the above, `oID` stands for `orderID` but really should be `salesID` and links to the sales table ID, and `pID` stands for `productID` and is a foreign key linking to the `products` table. Similarily, `cID` is really `categoryID`.\r\n\r\nOkay So the cafe manager had requested a table that looks like the following:\r\n\r\n    +---------------+-----+------+-------+------------+-----------+\r\n    | Drinks        | Qty | Cost | Price | Cost-Total | Qty-total |\r\n    +---------------+-----+------+-------+------------+-----------+\r\n    | Juice Carton  | 2   | 33p  | 60p   | 66p        | &#163;1.20     |\r\n    | Filter Coffee | 11  | 20p  | 80p   | &#163;2.20      | &#163;8.80     |\r\n    | Sub Total     | 13  |      |       | &#163;2.86      | &#163;10.00    |\r\n    | Grand Total   | 13  |      |       | &#163;2.86      | &#163;10.00    |\r\n    +---------------+-----+------+-------+------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nWhich has been fine, I&#39;ve used the following SQL statement to produce this:\r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n    categories.name AS category, products.name, pID, \r\n    (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM receipts s WHERE s.pID = r.pID AND DATE(s.ts) = CURDATE()) AS quantity, \r\n    products.price,\r\n    products.cost \r\n    FROM receipts r \r\n    LEFT JOIN products ON r.pID = products.id \r\n    LEFT JOIN categories ON products.cID = categories.id \r\n    WHERE DATE(r.ts) = CURDATE()\r\n    GROUP BY r.pID ORDER BY categories.name;\r\n\r\nHowever now I need to display two tables, one for card and one for cash.  Now the card payments are marked in the `sales` table with a `1` in the card column.  So I tried writing this:\r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n    categories.name AS category, products.name, pID, \r\n    (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM receipts s WHERE s.pID = r.pID AND DATE(s.ts) = CURDATE()) AS quantity, \r\n    products.price,\r\n    products.cost \r\n    FROM receipts r \r\n    \r\n    LEFT JOIN products ON r.pID = products.id \r\n    LEFT JOIN sales x on r.oID = x.id \r\n    LEFT JOIN categories ON products.cID = categories.id \r\n    \r\n    WHERE DATE(r.ts) = CURDATE() AND x.card = 1 \r\n    GROUP BY r.pID ORDER BY categories.name;\r\n\r\nHowever it is just displaying the same data as the first query.  I know where the problem is - its in the embedded SELECT statement (`AS quantity`), as I&#39;m not specifying in there whether its a card payment or a cash payement.  I thought that just by adding `x.card = 1` a the end would do it, but evidentally not.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me fix this SQL problem? How can I get the card condition into the embedded SQL, as it is retrieving from receipts and receipts does not hold information as to wether its a card payment or not?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m lost as to how to proceed really.

would like to remove a portion of my soup HTML object, concatenate them together and return as one single soup object.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the HTML object that I want to remove are all the contents within the `span` and `div` tags that contain a certain `class` name.\r\n\r\nAn example of the HTML is like so, note that they are in a list of `tag` objects:\r\n\r\n    body = [\r\n    &lt;div

[Luckily someone already wrote a data provider for Strapi](https://github.com/nazirov91/ra-strapi-rest). I had no problem with step 1 and 2 of this README, and I can authenticate to Strapi within my React app.\r\n\r\n**I now want to fetch and display my Strapi data**, starting with Users. In order to do that, quoting Step 3 of this readme : *&#39;In controllers I need to set the Content-Range header with the total number of results to build the pagination&#39;.*\r\n\r\nSo far I tried to do this in my User controller, with no success.\r\n\r\n## What I try to achieve: ##\r\n\r\n- First, I&#39;d like it to simply work with the `ctx.set(&#39;Content-Range&#39;, ...)` hard-coded in the controller like aforementioned Step 3.\r\n\r\n- Second, I&#39;ve thought it would be very dirty to c/p this logic in every controller (not to mention in any future controllers), instead of having some callback function dynamically appending the Content-Range header to any fetchAll request. Ultimately that&#39;s what I aim for, because with ~40 Strapi objects to administrate already and plenty more to come, it has to scale.\r\n\r\n## Technical infos ##\r\n`node -v`: 11.13.0\r\n\r\n`npm -v`: 6.7.0\r\n\r\n`strapi version`: 3.0.0-alpha.25.2\r\n\r\n`uname -r` output: Linux 4.14.106-97.85.amzn2.x86_64\r\n\r\nDB: mySQL v2.16\r\n\r\n___\r\nSo far I&#39;ve tried accessing the count() method of User model like aforementioned step3, but my controller doesn&#39;t look like the example as  I&#39;m working with users-permissions plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the action I&#39;ve tried to edit (located in project/plugins/users-permissions/controllers/User.js)\r\n```\r\n  find: async (ctx) =&gt; {\r\n    let data = await strapi.plugins[&#39;users-permissions&#39;].services.user.fetchAll(ctx.query);\r\n    data.reduce((acc, user) =&gt; {\r\n      acc.push(_.omit(user.toJSON ? user.toJSON() : user, [&#39;password&#39;, &#39;resetPasswordToken&#39;]));\r\n      return acc;\r\n    }, []);\r\n\r\n    // Send 200 `ok`\r\n    ctx.send(data);\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I&#39;ve gathered on Strapi documentation ([here](https://strapi.io/documentation/1.x.x/context.html#api) and also [here](https://strapi.io/documentation/3.0.0-alpha.x/guides/authentication.html#user-object-in-strapi-context)), context is a sort of wrapper object. I only worked with Express-generated APIs before, so I understood this snippet as **&#39;use fetchAll method of the User model object, with ctx.query as an argument&#39;**, &lt;s&gt;but I had no luck logging this ctx.query. And as I can&#39;t log stuff, I&#39;m kinda blocked. &lt;/s&gt;\r\n\r\nIn my exploration, I naively tried to log the full ctx object and work from there:\r\n```\r\n    // Send 200 `ok`\r\n    ctx.send(data);\r\n    strapi.log.info(ctx.query, &#39; were query&#39;);\r\n    strapi.log.info(ctx.request, &#39;were request&#39;);\r\n    strapi.log.info(ctx.response, &#39;were response&#39;);\r\n    strapi.log.info(ctx.res, &#39;were res&#39;);\r\n    strapi.log.info(ctx.req, &#39;were req&#39;);\r\n    strapi.log.info(ctx, &#39;is full context&#39;)\r\n  },\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;s&gt;Unfortunately, I fear I miss something obvious, as it gives me no input at all. Making a fetchAll request from my React app with these console.logs print this in my terminal:&lt;/s&gt;\r\n```\r\n[2019-09-19T12:43:03.409Z] info  were query\r\n[2019-09-19T12:43:03.410Z] info were request\r\n[2019-09-19T12:43:03.418Z] info were response\r\n[2019-09-19T12:43:03.419Z] info were res\r\n[2019-09-19T12:43:03.419Z] info were req\r\n[2019-09-19T12:43:03.419Z] info is full context\r\n[2019-09-19T12:43:03.435Z] debug GET /users?_sort=id:DESC&amp;_start=0&amp;_limit=10&amp; (74 ms)\r\n```\r\nWhile in my frontend I get the good ol&#39; *The Content-Range header is missing in the HTTP Response* message I&#39;m trying to solve.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter writing this wall of text I realize the logging issue is separated from my original problem, but if I was able to at least log ctx properly, maybe I&#39;d be able to find the solution myself.\r\n\r\n## Trying to summarize: ##\r\n\r\n- **Actual problem is, how do I set my Content-Range properly in my strapi controller ?** (partially answered cf. edit 3)\r\n- &lt;s&gt;Collateral problem n&#176;1: Can&#39;t even log ctx object&lt;/s&gt; (*cf. edit 2*)\r\n- Collateral problem n&#176;2: Once I figure out the actual problem, is it feasible to address it dynamically (basically some callback function for index/fetchAll routes, in which the model is a variable, on which I&#39;d call the appropriate `count()` method, and finally append the result to my response header)? I&#39;m not asking for the code here, just if you think it&#39;s feasible and/or know a more elegant way. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading through and excuse me if it was confuse; I wasn&#39;t sure which infos would be relevant, so I thought the more the better.\r\n\r\n**/edit1**: forgot to mention, in my controller I also tried to log `strapi.plugins[&#39;users-permissions&#39;].services.user` object to see if it actually has a count() method but got no luck with that either. Also tried the original snippet (Step 3 of aforementioned README), but failed as expected as afaik I don&#39;t see the User model being imported anywhere (the only import in User.js being `lodash`)\r\n\r\n**/edit2: About the logs, my bad, I just misunderstood the documentation. I now do:**\r\n```\r\n    ctx.send(data);\r\n    strapi.log.info(&#39;ctx should be : &#39;, {ctx});\r\n    strapi.log.info(&#39;ctx.req = &#39;, {...ctx.req});\r\n    strapi.log.info(&#39;ctx.res = &#39;, {...ctx.res});\r\n    strapi.log.info(&#39;ctx.request = &#39;, {...ctx.request});\r\n    ctrapi.log.info(&#39;ctx.response = &#39;, {...ctx.response});\r\n```\r\nCtx logs this way; also it seems that it needs the spread operator to display nested objects ({ctx.req} crash the server, {...ctx.req} is okay). Cool, because it narrows the question to what&#39;s interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n**/edit3**: As expected, having logs helps big time. I&#39;ve managed to display my users (although in the dirty way). Couldn&#39;t find any count() method, but watching the `data` object that is passed to `ctx.send()`, it&#39;s equivalent to your typical &#39;res.data&#39; i.e a pure JSON with my user list. So a simple .length did the trick:\r\n```\r\n    let data = await strapi.plugins[&#39;users-permissions&#39;].services.user.fetchAll(ctx.query);\r\n    data.reduce((acc, user) =&gt; {\r\n      acc.push(_.omit(user.toJSON ? user.toJSON() : user, [&#39;password&#39;, &#39;resetPasswordToken&#39;]));\r\n      return acc;\r\n    }, []);\r\n    ctx.set(&#39;Content-Range&#39;, data.length) // &lt;-- it did the trick\r\n    // Send 200 `ok`\r\n    ctx.send(data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow starting to work on the hard part: the dynamic callback function that will do that for any index/fetchAll call.

And on save button i can see the image in network, application/frames..Any idea with so little info?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58011835/image-not-showing-anywere-any-idea-where-to-search","title":"Image not showing anywere.
