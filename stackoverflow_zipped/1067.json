During the Bus setup we create a token using the managed service identity (MSI), like this...\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar tokenProvider = TokenProvider.CreateManagedServiceIdentityTokenProvider();\r\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingAzureServiceBus(cfg =&gt;\r\n{\r\n    IServiceBusHost busHost = cfg.Host(new Uri(Settings.Host), h =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        h.OperationTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);\r\n        h.TokenProvider = tokenProvider;\r\n        h.TransportType = Settings.TransportType;\r\n    });\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithin Azure, the MSI is configured with all 3 Service Bus permissions (Owner, Sender and Receiver) - as decribed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-managed-service-identity#built-in-rbac-roles-for-azure-service-bus).\r\n\r\nWhen the application starts authentication seems to happen successfully but when MassTransit begins to listen on the specific queues we create it fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n    MassTransit.Azure.ServiceBus.Core.Transport.ReceiveTransport Error: 0 :\r\n    ReceiveTransport Faulted: sb://hostname.servicebus.windows.net/some-custom-queue, \r\n    Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.UnauthorizedException: Generic: Failed during RBAC check, \r\n    please make sure service resource provider is registered on your tenant.\r\n\r\nPoints to note:\r\n\r\n - The application _does_ create the temporary bus queue, and there are no errors to do with accessing it.\r\n - The application _does **not**_ create our custom queues.\r\n - If the MSI permissions are removed then no queues are created and the error is different: `Authorization failed for specified action: Manage,EntityWrite.`\r\n - For what it&#39;s worth we are using the AmqpWebSockets transport type.\r\n\r\nIt seems weird that the temporary queue is created but not our application-specific ones.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is this... have I done anything wrong or is this something that is not yet available for MassTransit using Service Bus with MSI?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288680/rbac-issues-using-masstransit-with-azure-service-bus-and-msi-authentication","title":"RBAC issues using MassTransit with Azure

set; }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSo there is a single line added to `CreateHostBuilder` here, to the `Configure` method, and a new `ConfigChunk` class at the bottom, to match the schema of a section in *appsettings.json*.\r\n\r\nFinally, an extension of the parameters to the Worker constructor to let it consume the SettingsChunk:\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class Worker : BackgroundService\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly ILogger&lt;Worker&gt; _logger;\r\n        private readonly ConfigChunk _config;\r\n\r\n        public Worker(ILogger&lt;Worker&gt; logger, ConfigChunk config)\r\n        {\r\n            _logger = logger;\r\n            _config = config;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)\r\n        {\r\n            while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)\r\n            {\r\n                _logger.LogInformation(&quot;Worker running at: {time}&quot;, DateTimeOffset.Now);\r\n                await Task.Delay(1000, stoppingToken);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAs alluded to, this works fine in NET Core 2, but in 3 it fails with:\r\n\r\n&gt;Unable to resolve service for type &#39;WorkerService1DeleteMe.ConfigChunk&#39;

Because of that, MTI comes as 0020 instead of 0200. This also messes up the bitmap since the bit set for field 17-18-19-20 is not bitmap for 21-22-23-24. As expected, when I run this, unpack method shows bit 23 as 017. This of course works fine if I send message 020000002000000000001770 (additional 0 at the end). \r\n\r\n\r\nShould I be using something other than ISOUtil.hex2byte?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288662/isoutil-hex2byte-appending-0-to-left-of-my-message","title":"ISOUtil.hex2byte appending 0 to left of my

I have pasted here only the light version of this (just to show you the problem). In the full version I used as well fluentscheduler and there is a lot of code that connects to postgress, get some data and do some stored procedures, but this is not the problem. The problem is that even this small code that you can see above doesn&#39;t work at all. You can create this program now if you start new console application and just paste it there (and of course add topshelf from nuget). If you start it, it should work, but if you install this as service this is not working at all...\r\n\r\nHere are as well steps that I did when installing as service:&lt;br&gt;\r\n1) open CMD as administrator&lt;br&gt;\r\n2) go to the directory with debug&lt;br&gt;\r\n3) install it that way: ConsoleCRP.exe install&lt;br&gt;\r\n4) start the service: net start servicetest&lt;br&gt;\r\n5) if you want to stop the service: net stop servicetest&lt;br&gt;\r\n6) if you want to unistall: ConsoleCRP.exe uninstall&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the result:&lt;br&gt;\r\nConfiguration Result:&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Success] Name servicetest&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Success] DisplayName scheduler&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Success] Description This is automatic scheduler&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Success] ServiceName servicetest&lt;br&gt;\r\nTopshelf v4.2.1.215, .NET Framework v4.0.30319.42000&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe servicetest service is now running, press Control+C to exit.&lt;br&gt;\r\nStarting scheduler query check at 08/10/2019 16:31:12\r\n\r\nStarting scheduler query check at 08/10/2019 16:31:17\r\n\r\nStarting scheduler query check at 08/10/2019 16:31:22\r\n\r\nStarting scheduler query check at 08/10/2019 16:31:27\r\n\r\n\r\nSo tell me, what is wrong in that code that it just doesn&#39;t work as a service...??\r\nthank you in advanced for your help!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288648/topshelf-service-starts-but-nothings-works","title":"TopShelf - service starts but nothings works"},{"tags":["azure-active-directory","testcafe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":4287252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af58303a3c5ef242cb45927baf60abdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ewan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4287252/ewan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571059497,"post_id":58288644,"comment_id":103104223,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288644/authentication-with-azuread-via-testcafe-tests#comment103104223_58288644"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":4287252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af58303a3c5ef242cb45927baf60abdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ewan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4287252/ewan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571059572,"post_id":58290174,"comment_id":103104263,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288644/authentication-with-azuread-via-testcafe-tests/58290174#comment103104263_58290174"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28068,"user_id":1658906,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e4748ed2fb97e8a8d4dd6d439625135?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"juunas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1658906/juunas"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570550921,"creation_date":1570550921,"answer_id":58290174,"question_id":58288644,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58290174","body_markdown":"The Azure AD product team has always reminded me that it is a bad idea to try to automate sign in like that.\r\nThey will probably detect that you are a bot and start blocking your requests, even if you succeed.\r\n\r\nInstead, to acquire access tokens you need to use either the client credentials flow (for app-only tokens) or the resource owner password credentials flow (for delegated user tokens).\r\n\r\nClient credentials flow: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow\r\n\r\nROPC flow: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-ropc\r\n\r\nYou have to take good care to secure the credentials used for testing. \r\nAnd use a test tenant if possible.

Those statistics come from explicit `ANALYZE TABLE` or from certain changes to the table, such as &quot;adding more than 10% to the table&quot;.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to sync the stats between the two Masters, so they can drift apart.  Even running `ANALYZE TABLE` on both will not necessarily bring them in sync.  This is because of the &quot;random probes&quot; that are made into the table to concoct the stats.\r\n\r\n`FORCE INDEX` is risky because &quot;what helps today may hurt tomorrow&quot;.\r\n\r\nProbably this is what is happening:  You have a query that is on the borderline between picking one query plan and another.  The Optimizer&#39;s analysis says they are about equivalent, but (for various reasons) they are not.  This could lead to one server doing one thing (fast query plan) and the other doing something else (poor query plan).\r\n\r\nThere is no &#39;reliable&#39; and &#39;consistent&#39; way to solve your problem.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s try to tackle it a different way.

There _may_ be a better index and/or a reformulation of the query that avoids the problem completely, and possibly runs faster than either of your current query plans.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288621/understanding-the-mysql-query-optimizer/58387138#58387138","title":"Understanding the MySQL Query Optimizer"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":1416934,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9efc7deb90dc57a2755ecf6e521f0ce1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Code.Working","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1416934/code-working"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571112757,"creation_date":1570545496,"question_id":58288621,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288621","body_markdown":"We use two MySQL servers with the same setup and master-master replication.

an example of how things could go wrong:\r\n\r\nA sufficiently smart compiler could see that `mutex.lock()` cannot possibly change the `list.empty()` return value and thus skip the inner `if` check completely, eventually leading to a `pop_back` on a list that had its last element removed after the first `if`.\r\n\r\nWhy can it do that? There is no synchronization in `list.empty()`, thus if it were changed concurrently that would constitute a data race. The standard says that programs shall not have data races, so the compiler will take that for granted (otherwise it could perform almost no optimizations whatsoever).

And I&#39;m not talking about load speed, but the actual JavaScript functionality. I&#39;m using a few `addEventListener` to handle basic stuff like showing and hiding `divs`, including an overlay `div` with transparent opacity. When I click the button which has the `addEventListener` linked to it, it takes sometimes up to two seconds to show and/or hide the `divs`. Sometimes it won&#39;t even do it and I&#39;ll have to click the button again. I won&#39;t share the entire JS file here, but I can assure it&#39;s pretty basic. What I want to know is if there&#39;s someway to track the execution speed of the JavaScript code... Like, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s something in the actual JS code, or it&#39;s slow because the brownser is taking a long time to rendering it.

Set up a Blob Storage Trigger so that whenever something is written to your local storage, the trigger will be called. Blob trigger described [here][2]. \r\n 3. Once you can hit a breakpoint in your Azure Function when a Blob is added to your local emulator, you&#39;ll need to get the bytes and extract the text using a PDF ripper of your choice.

So, that when other will use my library DLL they can just call my method to access the VAULT Server. \r\nNow, if I try to add my DLL to other API project then still that project needs to add the VAULTSHARP library from NUGET to make it work.\r\nAlso, the requirement is to not to expose VaultSharp to the client so that this need to be included inside my DLL.\r\nMay I please know how to achieve that?\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t mark it as duplicate with irrelevant topic as mine is not a WPF solution.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/rajanadar/VaultSharp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288566/how-to-merge-third-party-dll-into-own-dll","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How to merge third party DLL into own DLL"},{"tags":["r-markdown","knitr"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":19658,"user_id":8416610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cmim3CrZ9Wo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjs/hnKTOHALc6M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ralf Stubner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8416610/ralf-stubner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570612543,"post_id":58288563,"comment_id":102964246,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288563/changing-decimal-and-group-mark-in-rmarkdown-render#comment102964246_58288563"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":448,"user_id":2813067,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80d842d07dea5a430cccf89de63654b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erich Neuwirth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2813067/erich-neuwirth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570809232,"post_id":58325276,"comment_id":103044521,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288563/changing-decimal-and-group-mark-in-rmarkdown-render/58325276#comment103044521_58325276"},{"owner":{"reputation":19658,"user_id":8416610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cmim3CrZ9Wo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjs/hnKTOHALc6M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ralf Stubner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8416610/ralf-stubner"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":448,"user_id":2813067,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80d842d07dea5a430cccf89de63654b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erich Neuwirth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2813067/erich-neuwirth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570809394,"post_id":58325276,"comment_id":103044600,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288563/changing-decimal-and-group-mark-in-rmarkdown-render/58325276#comment103044600_58325276"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19658,"user_id":8416610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cmim3CrZ9Wo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjs/hnKTOHALc6M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ralf Stubner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8416610/ralf-stubner"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570717696,"creation_date":1570717696,"answer_id":58325276,"question_id":58288563,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58325276","body_markdown":"Quoting `?locales`\r\n\r\n&gt; Setting &quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot; to any value other than &quot;C&quot; may cause R to function anomalously, so gives a warning.

For one of the test methods, call it `func testConfirmLastCellContent() { ... }`, I want to confirm that there exists a `staticText` child element having a value of `&quot;98765&quot;` within a `UITableViewCell` (I put the text value in in the `textLabel.text` property of the table view cell). There are 4 table view cells listed above this cell. Each of them has a `String` value of `&quot;12345&quot;` for its `textLabel.text`, except for the second cell, which has the same text value as the last: `&quot;98765&quot;`.\r\n\r\nThe `String` values for the `textLabel.text` property of each cell, then, looks like this:\r\n\r\n - `&quot;12345&quot;`\r\n - `&quot;98765&quot;`\r\n - `&quot;12345&quot;`\r\n - `&quot;12345&quot;`\r\n - `&quot;98765&quot;`\r\n\r\nThese `textLabel.text` values are the *only* visual sub-elements within the table view cells respectively.\r\n\r\nIf I create a simple `XCUIElementQuery` like so...\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet staticTextForLastCell = XCUIApplication().staticTexts[&quot;98765&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and assert its existence as `true` like so...\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nXCTAssert(staticTextForLastCell.exists == true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then the test will *pass*, but how do I know I got the last cell? Obviously, I cannot know from that query, because it could be pulling from the 2nd cell.\r\n\r\nThus far, I cannot find an `XCTest` class/method to get ahold of the last `UITableViewCell` specifically and query its details.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to get the last cell and confirm its `textLabel.text` value is something I expect. How can I do this?\r\n\r\n**Note:** I cannot add/subtract/change textual, visual, etc. elements on any of the table view cells.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nI should also note that the `UITableViewCell`s are generated dynamically by the app being tested.

(AFAIK, `histogram2d` will only accept x and y aligned `bins`)  \r\n\r\nMy data is 2 huge lists of points (10k~100k each), the coordinates of which are given in a cartesian coordinate system (actually a projected CRS because these are real-world locations) but they are organized in a regular grid that is not aligned to X and Y axis (rotated) and that may or may not be orthogonal. The binning grid will be derived from it so it will be a (rotated) regular quadrilaterals grid.  \r\n\r\nI have seen that `matplotlib` has a `QuadMesh` object ([see here](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/api/collections_api.html#matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh)) so I&#39;m being hopeful but I&#39;m not sure how to handle this in `NumPy`.    \r\n\r\nBasically this is what I want to achieve:  \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/FWBqJ.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288518/numpy-histogram2d-with-a-rotated-non-orthogonal-binning-grid","title":"NumPy histogram2d with a rotated, non-orthogonal binning grid"},{"tags":["mysql","excel","vba"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6651,"user_id":5414798,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5973717abda4c9d855c8399cc9407799?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nathan_Sav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5414798/nathan-sav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570545632,"post_id":58288512,"comment_id":102941984,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288512/open-a-connection-where-there-is-a-password-run-time-error-2147221241-800401#comment102941984_58288512"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12080565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-muEYIzSV9MI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4fhSRGjihFpMNGkTgvxeatOK0Kg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rupesh Ghosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12080565/rupesh-ghosh"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6651,"user_id":5414798,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5973717abda4c9d855c8399cc9407799?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nathan_Sav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5414798/nathan-sav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570546324,"post_id":58288512,"comment_id":102942401,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288512/open-a-connection-where-there-is-a-password-run-time-error-2147221241-800401#comment102942401_58288512"},{"owner":{"reputation":98748,"user_id":478884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLckc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Williams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/478884/tim-williams"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570547355,"post_id":58288512,"comment_id":102942949,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288512/open-a-connection-where-there-is-a-password-run-time-error-2147221241-800401#comment102942949_58288512"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12080565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-muEYIzSV9MI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4fhSRGjihFpMNGkTgvxeatOK0Kg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rupesh Ghosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12080565/rupesh-ghosh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570547964,"post_id":58288512,"comment_id":102943271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288512/open-a-connection-where-there-is-a-password-run-time-error-2147221241-800401#comment102943271_58288512"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12080565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-muEYIzSV9MI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4fhSRGjihFpMNGkTgvxeatOK0Kg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rupesh Ghosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12080565/rupesh-ghosh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570632629,"post_id":58290013,"comment_id":102975511,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288512/open-a-connection-where-there-is-a-password-run-time-error-2147221241-800401/58290013#comment102975511_58290013"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":63981,"user_id":1422451,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sFFvX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Parfait","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1422451/parfait"},"last_editor":{"reputation":63981,"user_id":1422451,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sFFvX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Parfait","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1422451/parfait"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570550603,"last_edit_date":1570550603,"creation_date":1570550263,"answer_id":58290013,"question_id":58288512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58290013","body_markdown":"Consider the below best practices in VBA:\r\n\r\n1. Always `Debug\\Compile` code after code changes. In fact, VBA should have raised or highlighted or red-lettered the syntax issue of line continuation as soon as your cursor leaves the problem line. See added `&amp;_` below. But possibly this is a typo in your post.\r\n\r\n        &quot;Password=****;&quot;  &amp; _\r\n        &quot;Option=3;&quot;\r\n\r\n2. Use appropriate [error handling](http://www.cpearson.com/excel/ErrorHandling.htm) especially when interacting with APIs like ADO that can raise runtime exceptions for more informative messages:\r\n\r\n     &lt;!-- language: vba --&gt;\r\n\r\n        Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()\r\n        On Error Goto ErrHandle\r\n\r\n              &#39;...code...\r\n           \r\n        ExitHandle:\r\n           Set con = Nothing  &#39; RELEASE ALL set OBJECTS\r\n           Exit Sub\r\n\r\n        ErrHandle:\r\n           Msgbox Err.Number &amp; &quot;: &quot; &amp; Err.Description\r\n           Resume ExitHandle\r\n        End Sub\r\n \r\n3. Use the industry best practice standard of SQL parameterization whenever you import data between application layer (i.e., VBA) and database (i.e., MySQL). Among [security](https://xkcd.com/327/) reasons, it is more efficient, readable, and maintainable as you avoid messy quotes and concatenation. In fact, your current code misses a last single quote:\r\n\r\n     &lt;!-- language: vba --&gt;\r\n\r\n        &quot; ... &#39; &quot; &amp; row.Cells(3).Value &amp; &quot; &#39;,&#39; &quot; &amp; row.Cells(5).Value &amp; &quot;)&quot;\r\n\r\n   Most DB-APIs like ADO support [parameterization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ado/reference/ado-api/parameters-collection-ado?view=sql-server-2017). Though implementation will differ beyond VBA to other languages and beyond MySQL to other databases, the core concept is the same involving a prepared statement with parameter placeholders that are later binded with literal values.

Authenticating the user requires that the Firebase SDK calls to the Firebase servers to validate the user&#39;s credentials. This may take some time, so instead of blocking your application code (which would lead to a bad user experience), your code is allowed to continue, and Firebase handles this client-to-server call in the background. Then when the call completes it calls your auth state handler with the update authentication state for the user.\r\n\r\nYou can always call `Auth.auth().currentUser` to get the current authentication state of the user. But if you do this at application startup, the call to the server likely hasn&#39;t completed yet, and you&#39;ll get `nil` back, since there isn&#39;t an authenticated user. This *may* be exactly what you want (for example: to display the authentication state), but sometimes you&#39;ll actually want to wait until the authentication has completed (for example: if you want to navigate to a different screen where you allow the user to enter their credentials). In the latter case you&#39;ll want to use `Auth.auth().addStateDidChangeHandler` to wait for the authentication to complete, to ensure you only navigate to the next screen once you&#39;re sure the state is up to date.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288511/what-is-an-authstatedidchangelistenerhandle/58288627#58288627","title":"What is an AuthStateDidChangeListenerHandle?"}],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":5721628,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZ2tQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Ma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5721628/jonathan-ma"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58288627,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570545516,"creation_date":1570545173,"question_id":58288511,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288511","body_markdown":"I am looking at the documentation for Firebase Auth in order to get my native iOS app&#39;s authentication to work properly.

But when the tests are complete, `git stash pop` will find the old stash, leading to at the very least a headache.\r\n\r\nSo my actual `pre-commit` hook looks like:\r\n\r\n    #/bin/sh\r\n    \r\n    hasChanges=$(git diff)    \r\n    if [ -n &quot;$hasChanges&quot; ]; then\r\n        git stash push --keep-index\r\n    fi\r\n    \r\n    #\r\n    # testing...\r\n    #\r\n    \r\n    if [ -n &quot;$hasChanges&quot; ]; then\r\n        git stash pop\r\n    fi\r\n    \r\n    exit $testSuccess\r\n\r\nBasically, use `git diff` to see if there are any changes to tracked files. If there are, stash and later pop them. Otherwise, don&#39;t bother with the stash operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash#Documentation/git-stash.txt-Testingpartialcommits","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288499/git-pre-commit-pre-push-hook-to-run-unit-tests-on-commits-with-uncommited-chang/58292837#58292837","title":"Git pre-commit/pre-push hook to run unit tests on commits, with uncommited changes on the working tree"}],"owner":{"reputation":785,"user_id":2175231,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4I57P.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wasabi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2175231/wasabi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58292837,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570657976,"creation_date":1570545129,"question_id":58288499,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288499","body_markdown":"I currently have a simple `pre-commit` hook for my project (in R, though that&#39;s incidental to this question) which runs unit tests:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/sh\r\n    a=$(Rscript tests/testthat.R)\r\n    exit $a\r\n\r\nWhere `tests/testthat.R` is a wrapper file that handles all the tests.\r\n\r\nThis hook has a problem, though: if I make partial commits (such that there are still changes which remain uncommitted), the tests will run on the current state of the working tree, including the uncommitted changes.\r\n\r\nSo, let&#39;s say I finish &quot;Step 1&quot; of something I&#39;m doing but forget to commit it. I then start on &quot;Step 2&quot;, but then realize I forgot to commit &quot;Step 1&quot;. If &quot;Step 2&quot; is currently in a broken state due to my unfinished changes, I won&#39;t be able to do a partial commit for &quot;Step 1&quot; because the tests will detect that &quot;Step 2&quot; is defective.\r\n\r\nSo, is there a way for the hook to run on the version which is actually being committed? My thought would be a hook which effectively temporarily checks out a commit, runs the tests on that checkout, deletes the checkout, and then defines whether to allow the commit to go through. But given that this hook triggers before the commit is done, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s impossible to check it out.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d also be open to a `pre-push` hook. This seems more plausible since the hook receives the SHA&#39;s for the commits being pushed, so my idea above seems more reasonable: get the latest SHA, create a temporary directory, checkout that SHA, run the tests, delete the directory. But then my question becomes whether that&#39;s actually the suggested method or if I&#39;m overcomplicating things due to my ignorance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288499/git-pre-commit-pre-push-hook-to-run-unit-tests-on-commits-with-uncommited-chang","title":"Git pre-commit/pre-push hook to run unit tests on commits, with uncommited changes on the working tree"},{"tags":["python","flask","openpyxl"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4706,"user_id":32846,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2872c4aad0f3cfdb6421c36527fb868c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Giles Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/32846/giles-thomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570642536,"post_id":58288497,"comment_id":102980398,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288497/how-do-i-receive-an-excel-file-as-input-using-flask-and-read-it-using-openpyxl#comment102980398_58288497"},{"owner":{"reputation":4706,"user_id":32846,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2872c4aad0f3cfdb6421c36527fb868c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Giles Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/32846/giles-thomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570642536,"post_id":58288497,"comment_id":102980400,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288497/how-do-i-receive-an-excel-file-as-input-using-flask-and-read-it-using-openpyxl#comment102980400_58288497"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12182787,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jyTKe9bXG7o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdfQXUkstgpRjdZv-2Fd7wJvrxLYw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ali Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182787/ali-z"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4706,"user_id":32846,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2872c4aad0f3cfdb6421c36527fb868c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Giles Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/32846/giles-thomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571010014,"post_id":58288497,"comment_id":103087317,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288497/how-do-i-receive-an-excel-file-as-input-using-flask-and-read-it-using-openpyxl#comment103087317_58288497"},{"owner":{"reputation":4706,"user_id":32846,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2872c4aad0f3cfdb6421c36527fb868c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Giles Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/32846/giles-thomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571065159,"post_id":58288497,"comment_id":103107278,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288497/how-do-i-receive-an-excel-file-as-input-using-flask-and-read-it-using-openpyxl#comment103107278_58288497"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12182787,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jyTKe9bXG7o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdfQXUkstgpRjdZv-2Fd7wJvrxLYw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ali Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182787/ali-z"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12182787,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jyTKe9bXG7o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdfQXUkstgpRjdZv-2Fd7wJvrxLYw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ali Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182787/ali-z"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570548209,"creation_date":1570545124,"last_edit_date":1570548209,"question_id":58288497,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288497","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve created a python script that loads an excel file up from my computer and, after working with the information inside it using openpyxl, saves a new excel file. **The script works on my computer.** For longevity purposes, I want to make the script into a website, using pythonanywhere or something similar to it (incorporating flask seemed like the best way to convert my script into a website). However, I am having trouble finding a way to accept a file from the user, as I have very little experience using flask.

I am running into a little problem that I cannot figure out. The first do-while works as intended and will go through until it gets a valid input.

The program will ask the user for their experience if it is between 3-11 they are qualified. If not, it will tell them they are not qualified and ask to re-enter a value. Same thing with performance. If they enter a number less than or equal to 11 it will procede to generate the random int (level) at which point level will be used to asses their bonus. \r\n```import java.io.*;\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\nimport java.util.Random;\t \r\n\r\nclass assignment {\t \r\n\t public static void main( String args[]){\r\n      //\r\n      int bonus;\r\n      int x;\r\n      //\r\n      Random rand = new Random();\r\n      //\r\n      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner for name\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;); // ask for name\r\n      String name = input.nextLine(); // assign name to variable\r\n      System.out.println( name ); // output name \r\n      // \r\n      Scanner input2 = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner for yearsexp\r\n      System.out.println(name + &quot;, Enter the years of your experience: &quot;); // ask for yearsexp\r\n      int yearsexp = 0 ; \r\n      int performance = 0;\r\n          \r\n      do \r\n      {\r\n      yearsexp = input2.nextInt(); // assign yearsexp to variable\r\n      System.out.println( yearsexp); // out yearsexp\r\n      try\r\n         {\r\n         if (yearsexp &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; yearsexp &lt;24)// acceptable critera\r\n            {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;You are qualified&quot;);// output\r\n            x=2; // x = 2 to close do while\r\n            }\r\n         else\r\n         {\r\n         throw new Exception ();\r\n         }\r\n         }\r\n       catch (Exception e1)\r\n         {\r\n         System.out.println(&quot;You have entered an invalid number!

will work normally.  For example, when a user clicks on one of those buttons, how does it visually indicate which action they&#39;ve selected?  That&#39;s what radio buttons and checkboxes are for.  When you click a plain button it just....gets clicked.  But then nothing happens unless it it has `type=&quot;submit&quot;` (the default) or has some JavaScript event handler attached to it.  I don&#39;t think button &quot;values&quot; are submitted in forms unless it&#39;s the submit button itself.\r\n\r\nIf you insist you could probably make it work with some JavaScript, but probably better to use the appropriate form element type.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58288474/request-args-does-not-have-all-form-data/58289034#58289034","title":"Request.args does not have all form data"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11256657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac215897e079804aa36715e6069bd115?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sprmap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11256657/sprmap"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570546772,"creation_date":1570545056,"question_id":58288474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58288474","body_markdown":"I am trying to submit a form to my Flask application.

Let&#39;s call one of those `Tree`. The tree in turn contains, for example, symbols and has certain algebraical rules associated with them, which I have defined via `__add__` etc.\r\n\r\nI then work with mathematical expressions containing these `Tree`-objects. E.g.\r\n\r\n    x = symbols(&#39;x&#39;)\r\n    y = symbols(&#39;y&#39;)\r\n    z = symbols(&#39;z&#39;)\r\n    tree1 = Tree(x, y)\r\n    \r\n    cool_quantity = x + y + tree1\r\n\r\nI would now like to substitute one of the symbols, e.g. `x`, with another symbol, e.g. `z`:\r\n\r\n    cool_quantity_subs = cool_quantity.subs({x: z})\r\n\r\n**Problem:** I have noticed that when I do this, the substitution is also done *inside* the Tree object (see minimal working example below). I think the reason for this is that the properties are defined as free symbols through inheritance from sympy.Expr.\r\n\r\n**Question:** Is there a way to do a sympy substitution only &#39;&#39;at the top level&#39;&#39;? That is to substitute all symbols directly contained in the expression but not within custom objects?\r\n\r\n**Full minimal working example** (unfortunatly sympsi is necessary to run this, but I think the problem is generic for sympy with custom classes.

The Noda Time equivalent of `TimeSpan` isn&#39;t `Period`; it&#39;s `Duration`, which *is* a struct.

are a number of ways you can do this.\r\n\r\nIf you are absolutely sure that at the moment the code runs, the value of `contract.LegalReviewDate` is a string with a date formatted appropriately (see [this answer by CMS to Why does Date.parse give incorrect results?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2587398/215552) for more information on cross-browser supported formats), you can use the `as` operator to tell TypeScript you are confident of its validity:\r\n\r\n    contract.LegalReviewDate = new Date(contract.LegalReviewDate as string);\r\n\r\nYou can also use type guards to make sure that your assumptions are correct:\r\n\r\n    if (typeof contract.LegalReviewDate === &#39;string&#39;) {\r\n        contract.LegalReviewDate = new Date(contract.LegalReviewDate as string);\r\n    }\r\n    if

contract.LegalReviewDate = new Date(contract.LegalReviewDate.valueOf());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr as @jcalz mentions, use two separate properties or objects.
