Regarding a Asp.Net core application this does also include everything that happens within the programm.cs and startup.cs classes.\r\nAs pointed out you can see more information in the stdout (if enabled) or the Event Log. To access these, go to Advances Tools and either go to &quot;Debug Console -&gt; CMD&quot; where you can see all the files or &quot;Tools -&gt; Diagnostic&quot; Dump to Download a Zip which contains (among other things) these two files. In both cases it is in the LogFiles folder.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**Fix the Crash**\r\n\r\nNow in the logfile it states that it couldn&#39;t find a specified file. In my case that was a certificate I tried to load with this line of code:\r\n\r\n    var cert = new X509Certificate2(Path.Combine(_environment.ContentRootPath, &quot;Example.pfx&quot;), &quot;MyPassword&quot;);\r\n\r\nAs I found out via another SO question, if you deploy via Azure DevOps to Azure you have to set the corresponding KeyStore Flags. With the adjustment to this code it works as expected:\r\n\r\n        var cert = new X509Certificate2(&quot;Example.pfx&quot;, &quot;MyPassword&quot;,\r\n                                        X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet |\r\n                                        X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet |\r\n                                        X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable);\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/troubleshoot-azure-iis?view=aspnetcore-3.0\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciMvc.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158056/how-to-deploy-blazor-app-to-azure-via-azure-devops/58172277#58172277","title":"How to deploy Blazor App to Azure via Azure DevOps"}],"owner":{"reputation":1130,"user_id":2838509,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ddc514bdff431b6db641bba4d96d7658?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NPadrutt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2838509/npadrutt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1130,"user_id":2838509,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ddc514bdff431b6db641bba4d96d7658?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NPadrutt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2838509/npadrutt"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569862864,"creation_date":1569781773,"last_edit_date":1569827697,"question_id":58158056,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158056","body_markdown":"I have an Blazor Application which I build and want to deploy via Azure DevOps. \r\nSo far that leads to a 500.30 startup error after the deployment when deployed via Azure but it works when I deploy directly out of Visual Studio via Web Deploy. \r\n\r\nThis is the yaml of my deployment task:\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4\r\n      displayName: &#39;Deploy Azure App Service&#39;\r\n      inputs:\r\n        azureSubscription: &#39;$(Parameters.ConnectedServiceName)&#39;\r\n        appType: &#39;$(Parameters.WebAppKind)&#39;\r\n        WebAppName: &#39;$(Parameters.WebAppName)&#39;\r\n        packageForLinux: &#39;$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*Server.zip&#39;\r\n        JSONFiles: &#39;**/appsettings.json&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do have another asp.net core WebApp (just one with razor pages) in the same solution which was built and published with the same pipeline before.

But when published via Visual Studio they are in the wwwroot. Do I have to configure something specially for Blazor?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I did find out, that the issue is in my startup.cs. The reason I don&#39;t see the files has probably to do with the permission system of the folder. I also did find out that I can get a dump with the logfiles and the eventlog where more information are via Kudu:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/w15sx.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158056/how-to-deploy-blazor-app-to-azure-via-azure-devops","title":"How to deploy Blazor App to Azure via Azure DevOps"},{"tags":["git","ms-word","pandoc"],"owner":{"reputation":8615,"user_id":1655567,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08d134d1cb7ddb592471df1b356e2bd4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Konrad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1655567/konrad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569781752,"creation_date":1569781752,"question_id":58158051,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158051","body_markdown":"Faced with an unfortunate need to version MS Word documents I have implemented the following configuration\r\n\r\n### `~/.gitconfig`\r\n\r\n    # Help MS Word document versioning\r\n    [diff &quot;pandoc&quot;]\r\n    \ttextconv=pandoc --to=markdown\r\n    \tprompt = false\r\n\r\n### `./repo/.gitattributes`\r\n\r\n    # Version control MS Word\r\n    *.docx diff=pandoc\r\n    *.docm diff=pandoc\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nWhen I try to run `git diff Big-Problematic-Document.docm`\r\n\r\n    19:17 $ git diff Big-Problematic-Document.docm\r\n    UTF-8 decoding error in /var/folders/7x/kwc1y_l96t55_rwlv35mg8xh0000gn/T//uPSuEc_Big-Problematic-Document.docm at byte offset 22 (c1).\r\n    The input must be a UTF-8 encoded text.\r\n    fatal: unable to read files to diff\r\n\r\n## Diagnosis\r\n\r\n -

I&#39;ve found that `QVariant::userType()` always returns the actual meta type, whereas just `type()` seems fairly useless (even the docs are convoluted trying to explain how it works).\r\n\r\nTo add to the confusion, `QVariant::Type` seems to be deprecated... if you click the &quot;QVariant::Type&quot; link in the [docs for `type()`][1] it goes to the &quot;obsolete members&quot; section. Where that enum isn&#39;t even listed.\r\n\r\nActually `QMetaType` doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; the `QList&lt;int&gt;` type either until it is used (or registered).  Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tqDebug() &lt;&lt; QMetaType::type(&quot;QList&lt;int&gt;&quot;);  // prints 0\r\n\tQList&lt;int&gt; list{1,2,3};\r\n\tQVariant v = QVariant::fromValue(list);\r\n\tqDebug() &lt;&lt; QMetaType::type(&quot;QList&lt;int&gt;&quot;);  // prints 1028 on my test project, yours may vary\r\n```\r\nOr, if registered specifically:\r\n```\r\n\tqDebug() &lt;&lt; qRegisterMetaType&lt;QList&lt;int&gt; &gt;(&quot;QList&lt;int&gt;&quot;);  // prints 1028\r\n\tqDebug() &lt;&lt; QMetaType::type(&quot;QList&lt;int&gt;&quot;);  // prints 1028\r\n\tQList&lt;int&gt; list{1,2,3};\r\n\tQVariant v = QVariant::fromValue(list);\r\n\tqDebug() &lt;&lt; QMetaType::type(&quot;QList&lt;int&gt;&quot;);  // still 1028\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qvariant.html#type","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158034/qlist-in-qvariant-qvarianttype-returns-weird-type/58178040#58178040","title":"QList in QVariant, QVariant::type() returns weird type"}],"owner":{"reputation":1359,"user_id":1837084,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/67dya.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Oleg Antonyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1837084/oleg-antonyan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":88,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58178040,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569905705,"creation_date":1569781667,"question_id":58158034,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158034","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to store `QList&lt;int&gt;` in `QVariant` and then do a typecheck to determine exact type of value stored in `QVariant` (for serialization).\r\n`QVariant::type()` works fine with scalar types like `int` or `QString`, but this is what I got with `QList&lt;int&gt;`:\r\n\r\n    QList&lt;int&gt; list{1,2,3};\r\n    QVariant v = QVariant::fromValue&lt;QList&lt;int&gt;&gt;(list);\r\n    qDebug() &lt;&lt; v.type() &lt;&lt; &quot;|&quot; &lt;&lt; v.typeName() &lt;&lt; &quot;|&quot; &lt;&lt; v.userType() &lt;&lt; &quot;|&quot; &lt;&lt; QVariant::typeToName(v.type());\r\n\r\nProduces:\r\n\r\n    QVariant::QWidget* | QList&lt;int&gt; | 1030 | QWidget*\r\n\r\nWhere this `QVariant::QWidget*` even came from?

This form always gives preference to a lexically scoped regex declaration, dispatching directly to it as if it were a function. If there is no such lexical regex (or lexical method) in scope, the call is dispatched to the current grammar, assuming there is one.\r\n\r\n&gt; ...\r\n\r\n&gt; A leading `.` explicitly calls a method as a subrule; the fact that the initial character is not alphanumeric also causes the named assertion to not capture what it matches.\r\n\r\n&gt; ...\r\n\r\n&gt; A call to `&lt;foo&gt;` will fail if there is neither any lexically scoped routine of that name it can call, nor any method of that name that be reached via method dispatch.

It preferentially resolves to an early bound *lexical* (`my`/`our`) routine/rule named `&amp;bar`. Otherwise it resolves to a late bound attempt to call a *has* (`has`) method/rule named `bar`. If it succeeds it stores the match under a capture named `bar`.\r\n\r\n* `&lt;.bar&gt;` calls a *has* (`has`) method/rule named `bar` if it finds one. It does not capture.\r\n\r\n* `&lt;bar=.bar&gt;` calls a *has* (`has`) method/rule named `bar` if it finds one. If it succeeds it stores the match under a capture named `bar`. In other words, it&#39;s the same as `&lt;bar&gt;` except it only attempts to call a *has* method named `.bar`; it doesn&#39;t first attempt to resolve to a lexical `&amp;bar`.\r\n\r\n* `&lt;&amp;bar&gt;` and `&lt;.&amp;bar&gt;` mean the same thing. They call a lexical routine named `&amp;bar` and do *not* capture.

Is this expected behavior or a potential bug?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158010/difference-in-capturing-and-non-capturing-regex-scope-in-perl-6-raku","title":"Difference in capturing and non-capturing regex scope in Perl 6 / Raku"},{"tags":["elasticsearch","postman"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11792899,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5VqHSERQBZU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFw/Y4FphXNmTSQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mohan vel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11792899/mohan-vel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570183940,"post_id":58158316,"comment_id":102841895,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158009/index-json-data-into-elasticsearch-using-postman-client-as-attachment/58158316#comment102841895_58158316"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6005,"user_id":290460,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XsEDl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/290460/rob"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6005,"user_id":290460,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XsEDl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/290460/rob"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569784076,"last_edit_date":1569784076,"creation_date":1569783721,"answer_id":58158316,"question_id":58158009,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58158316","body_markdown":"You need to change the content type of body to JSON\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nHere is also gif showing how to change the content type of the request:\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/G9csO.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/foHdS.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158009/index-json-data-into-elasticsearch-using-postman-client-as-attachment/58158316#58158316","title":"index json data into elasticsearch using PostMan client as attachment"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11792899,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5VqHSERQBZU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFw/Y4FphXNmTSQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mohan vel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11792899/mohan-vel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6005,"user_id":290460,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XsEDl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/290460/rob"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58158316,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569784076,"creation_date":1569781530,"last_edit_date":1569783773,"question_id":58158009,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158009","body_markdown":"I am trying to attach data json and tried to index the data into elastic search using postman client\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;error&quot;: &quot;Content-Type header [text/plain;charset=UTF-8] is not supported&quot;,\r\n        &quot;status&quot;: 406\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPOST method - http://localhost:9200/product/default/_bulk?pretty\r\n\r\nPOST method - http://localhost:9200/product/default/_bulk?pretty\r\n\r\nJson data in attachment like\r\n\r\n    {&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1}}\r\n    {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Wine - Maipo Valle Cabernet&quot;,&quot;price&quot;:152,&quot;in_stock&quot;:38,&quot;sold&quot;:47,&quot;tags&quot;:[&quot;Alcohol&quot;,&quot;Wine&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Aliquam augue quam, sollicitudin vitae, consectetuer eget, rutrum at, lorem.

db.myCollection.getShardDistribution()\r\n\r\nShard shard0000 at 127.0.0.1:27017\r\n data : 2.65MiB docs : 4402 chunks : 7\r\n estimated data per chunk : 387KiB\r\n estimated docs per chunk : 628\r\n\r\nShard shard0001 at 127.0.0.1:27018\r\n data : 6.02MiB docs : 10002 chunks : 8\r\n estimated data per chunk : 770KiB\r\n estimated docs per chunk : 1250\r\n\r\nTotals\r\n data : 8.67MiB docs : 14404 chunks : 15\r\n Shard shard0000 contains 30.57% data, 30.56% docs in cluster, avg obj size on shard : 631B\r\n Shard shard0001 contains 69.42% data, 69.43% docs in cluster, avg obj size on shard : 631B\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst I don&#39;t understand why I see 14,404 documents instead of 10,000 that I inserted.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, the next day, I come and run ```db.myCollection.getShardDistribution()``, and suddenly I see a completely different picture. The data suddenly became well distributed.\r\n\r\nSo I started experimenting and found out that if I run the following commands:\r\n```sh.startBalancer()\r\nuse config \r\ndb.settings.update(\r\n   { _id: &quot;balancer&quot; },\r\n   { $set: { activeWindow : { start : &quot;11:06&quot;, stop : &quot;11:07&quot; } } },\r\n   { upsert: true }\r\n)\r\n```\r\nAnd wait for that time window to pass the data is suddenly making sense:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmongos&gt; db.myCollection.getShardDistribution()\r\n\r\nShard shard0000 at 127.0.0.1:27017\r\n data : 2.65MiB docs : 4402 chunks : 7\r\n estimated data per chunk : 387KiB\r\n estimated docs per chunk : 628\r\n\r\nShard shard0001 at 127.0.0.1:27018\r\n data : 3.36MiB docs : 5600 chunks : 8\r\n estimated data per chunk : 431KiB\r\n estimated docs per chunk : 700\r\n\r\nTotals\r\n data : 6.02MiB docs : 10002 chunks : 15\r\n Shard shard0000 contains 44.03% data, 44.01% docs in cluster, avg obj size on shard : 631B\r\n Shard shard0001 contains 55.96% data, 55.98% docs in cluster, avg obj size on shard : 630B\r\n```\r\nIn my Java code that inserts 10000 documents, all I do is generate 10,000 Document objects and run an ```insertMany(documents)``` in the end. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  List&lt;Document&gt; documents = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n       \r\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++) {\r\n     Document document = new Document();\r\n     document.append(&quot;name&quot;, generateName())\r\n                    ...\r\n     documents.add(document);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  collection.insertMany(documents);\r\n```\r\nSo what is going on here?\r\n\r\nNote: I set the max chunk size to 1MB just to experiment with sharding\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158003/mongodb-uneven-document-sharding-and-migration-windows","title":"MongoDB uneven document sharding - and Migration Windows"},{"tags":["image","tensorflow","deep-learning","classification","faster-rcnn"],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":6899607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d58d99d7dca84eafe5b66fadef71204?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xollad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6899607/xollad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":27,"user_id":6899607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d58d99d7dca84eafe5b66fadef71204?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xollad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6899607/xollad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569783071,"creation_date":1569781452,"last_edit_date":1569783071,"question_id":58158002,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158002","body_markdown":"I am working on a project where I have to build a classifier for almost 220 classes using TensorFlow (version 1.13.1).\r\nThe classes are cropped images of products of different angles.

I&#39;m wondering if I went down the wrong path initially by doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            string dir;\r\n            string serialNumber;\r\n            //string infile;\r\n            string outfile;\r\n            string featureName;\r\n            string result;\r\n\r\n            // Prompt the user to navigate to and select a directory where RPT files reside\r\n            FolderBrowserDialog folderDlg = new FolderBrowserDialog();\r\n            folderDlg.ShowNewFolderButton = true;\r\n            // Show the FolderBrowserDialog.\r\n            DialogResult folder = folderDlg.ShowDialog();\r\n            if (folder == DialogResult.OK)\r\n            {\r\n                // dir is the full path to the file, excluding the filename\r\n                dir = folderDlg.SelectedPath;\r\n                fileNameTextBox.Text = folderDlg.SelectedPath;\r\n                Environment.SpecialFolder root = folderDlg.RootFolder;\r\n\r\n                // Get all the RPT files in the specified directory; do NOT look through sub-directories\r\n                //string[] Files = Directory.GetFiles(dir, &quot;*.RPT&quot;, SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly);\r\n\r\n                foreach (string filename in Directory.GetFiles(dir, &quot;*.RPT&quot;, SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly))\r\n                {\r\n                    // serialnumber is the filename WITHOUT the extension and WITHOUT the path to the file included.\r\n                    serialNumber = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(filename);\r\n                    \r\n                    // Create an output CSV file for each serial number; put in same directory as RPT files.\r\n                    outfile = dir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + serialNumber + &quot;.CSV&quot;;\r\n                    //}\r\n\r\n                    var lines = File.ReadAllLines(filename);\r\n                    var csv = new StringBuilder();\r\n\r\n                    // In first row of every file, put serial number\r\n                    var topLine = string.Format(&quot;{0},{1}&quot;, &quot;&quot;, serialNumber);\r\n                    csv.AppendLine(topLine);\r\n\r\n                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; lines.Length; i++)\r\n                    {\r\n                        // Lines containg the string &quot;---&quot; are result lines.

to be asking this question again, but I really need this problem solved (about to reach my max data limit on shinyapps.io). Here is the link to my previous question [Previous Stack Question][1]\r\nHere is the link to my demo app. [Demo App Hosted On ShinyApps.io][2] You will notice the app does not time out. For example here is my logs for this app just for today. [![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nI have tried everything that was recommended to me from my last question as well as including the `timeOut` parameter in the `shinymanager::secure_server()` function. \r\n\r\nWhat seems to be the problem is, shinyapps.io puts a timer for inactivity on the UI. Once the UI is inactive it then starts a timeout on the `R` process. However, in our case the UI does not start up until authentication. This means our server keeps running. \r\n\r\nSomething like a set timeout (`setTimeout()`) would be a great alternative. For example, if the user does not authenticate within 5 minutes, time out. I initially tried a while loop, but it did not turn out as planned.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way to time out the server if there is no activity. \r\nHere is a toy example of what my code looks like.\r\nLastly, here is a link to the shinymanager package on github.

For\r\n    example in your case you could use chunksize equal to a million, you\r\n    would get 90 chunks and you could operate on each chunk\r\n    individually.\r\n 2. `dtype` parameter: with this parameter you can specify the data type of each column simply by passing a dictionary like this: `{‘a’: np.float32, ‘b’: np.int32, ‘c’: ‘Int32’}`&lt;br&gt;Pandas could use 64-bit data types, while 32bit might be enough for you. With this trick you could save 50% of the space.\r\n\r\n## Yuor case study\r\nTry this code:\r\n\r\n    df_chunks = pd.read_csv(&#39;test.csv&#39;, chunksize=1000000, iterator=True, \r\n                             parse_dates=[&#39;timestamp&#39;], error_bad_lines=False,\r\n                             dtype={&quot;ordinal&quot;:&#39;int32&#39;, &quot;latitude&quot;: &#39;float32&#39;, &quot;longitude&quot;:&#39;float32&#39;})\r\n    for chunk in df_chunks:\r\n        # chunk = chunk.apply(...) # process the single chunk \r\n        for day in [&#39;Monday&#39;, &#39;Tuesday&#39;, &#39;Wednesday&#39;, &#39;Thursday&#39;, &#39;Friday&#39;, &#39;Saturday&#39;, &#39;Sunday&#39;]:\r\n            day_df = chunk.loc[chunk[&#39;day_of_week&#39;] == day]\r\n            day_df.to_csv(f&#39;{day}.csv&#39;, mode=&#39;a&#39;, index=0, header=False)\r\n\r\nThis way you work on one chunk of data at a time and never work with all the data together. The `mode=&#39;a&#39;` tells pandas to append.\r\n\r\n__Note1__:\r\nYou do not need `pandas.concat` here. The only thing **iterator** and `chunksize=1000000` does is to give you a reader object that *[iterates][4]* 1000000-row DataFrames instead of reading the whole thing. Using concat you lose all the advantages of using *iterators* and loading the whole file into memory exactly like using csv laws without specifying chunksize.\r\n\r\n__Note2__: If the `&#39;MemoryError&#39;` error persists, try smaller chunksize.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dataframe-api.html#dask.dataframe.read_csv\r\n  [2]:

accept-charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; data-remote=&quot;true&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search[search_term]&quot;

&lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\nWhich to me looks as I would expect. I have also attempted a rails 6 style form as per :\r\n\r\n    &lt;%= form_with(url: &quot;/search_controller/search&quot;, method: &quot;post&quot;) do %&gt;\r\n      &lt;%= label_tag(:q,

did not explicitly initialize your `std::vector&lt;int&gt; listInt` member. This means the default constructor of `std::vector&lt;int&gt;` will be used. **It initializes a vector with initial size of 0**, thus accessing it with index `0` is invalid.\r\n\r\nTo give a initial size to your list, you should do:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nClass1::Class1() : listInt(/* the initial size */) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives you a vector with size of `/* the initial size */` and all elements initialized to zero.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the size by dynamically adding elements, use `push_back` or `emplace_back`:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nlistInt.push_back(/* element to add */);\r\nlistInt.emplace_back(/* element to add */);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth append an element to the end of the vector and increase the vector&#39;s size by one. \r\n\r\nThe difference is that `emplace_back` constructs the new element in-place using the parameters you passed to it, but `push_back` always copies (or move) the element. In your case (`std::vector&lt;int&gt;`), they make no difference.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157949/vector-as-a-private-member-of-a-class-defined-with-pointer-no-error-but-strange/58157994#58157994","title":"Vector as a Private member of a Class defined with pointer: no error but strange behavior"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12138326,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/422307feb3515d6c971b118e96822be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AqPoGuy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12138326/aqpoguy"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58157994,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569782796,"creation_date":1569780959,"question_id":58157949,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157949","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t understand why the following code doesn&#39;t work: no error, it just send me the following results:\r\n\r\nHello world!\r\nProcess returned -1073741819 (0xC0000005)   execution time : 1.656 s\r\nPress any key to continue.\r\n\r\nI defined listInt as a vector in private member.

are pulling in a **collection** for your `$eventid` variable in this line:\r\n\r\n    $eventid =

numbering in total 1.  To get the id of the *first* event after your start date, try the following:\r\n\r\n    $event = Event::where(&#39;startdate&#39;,&#39;&gt;&#39;, now())-&gt;first();\r\n    $eventid = isset($event)? $event-&gt;id : 0;\r\n\r\nYou could chain this and put the id at the end (`-&gt;first()-&gt;id`), but you may not have an event after this starting date, and thus it would fail.\r\n\r\nThe difference in this answer vs your original code, is that by using `first`, you pull a single object that will have an `id` field.  Doing it with `get()` as you did, it will be a collection, and not have an id field, and thus will fail your `where()` method on the **Speaker** query.\r\n\r\nNote, you may also wish to revise the query parameters.  The way you have it now, and the way I wrote it with `first()` will give you the first event after the startdate. You may want something further down the line if you have multiple events. You could add more detail on the query if this is the case.

So I think there is an issue with this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my console when i execute flutter build apk\r\n\r\n```\r\nGabriels-MacBook-Pro:Safer jumpbotron$ flutter build apk --release\r\nYou are building a fat APK that includes binaries for android-arm, android-arm64.\r\nIf you are deploying the app to the Play Store, it&#39;s recommended to use app bundles or split the APK to reduce the APK size.\r\n    To generate an app bundle, run:\r\n        flutter build appbundle --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64\r\n        Learn more on: https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle\r\n    To split the APKs per ABI, run:\r\n        flutter build apk --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64 --split-per-abi\r\n        Learn more on:  https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits#configure-abi-split\r\nInitializing gradle...                                              1.3s\r\nResolving dependencies...                                           4.0s\r\nregisterResGeneratingTask is deprecated, use registerGeneratedResFolders(FileCollection)\r\nregisterResGeneratingTask is deprecated, use registerGeneratedResFolders(FileCollection)\r\nregisterResGeneratingTask is deprecated, use registerGeneratedResFolders(FileCollection)\r\nNote: /Users/jumpbotron/Documents/programming/installations/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/cloud_firestore-0.12.9+2/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/firebase/cloudfirestore/CloudFirestorePlugin.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.\r\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.                    \r\nNote: /Users/jumpbotron/Documents/programming/installations/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/cloud_firestore-0.12.9+2/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/firebase/cloudfirestore/CloudFirestorePlugin.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.\r\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.                      \r\nNote: /Users/jumpbotron/Documents/programming/installations/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/connectivity-0.4.3+6/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/connectivity/ConnectivityPlugin.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.\r\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.                    \r\nNote: /Users/jumpbotron/Documents/programming/installations/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/firebase_core-0.4.0+6/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/firebase/core/FirebaseCorePlugin.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.\r\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.                      \r\nNote: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.              \r\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.                      \r\nRRemoved unused resources: Binary resource data reduced from 256KB to 233KB: Removed 8%\r\nRunning Gradle task &#39;assembleRelease&#39;...                                \r\nRunning Gradle task &#39;assembleRelease&#39;...

Once detachment is done, entities may be fetched once again, which would ensure that fresh data is read from the database.\r\n\r\nSo, we see that EF Core’s out of the box (OOB) first-level caching mechanism is far from perfect. It leads to clunky code which is prone to errors and there is fairly a good chance of the code base becoming convoluted and unmaintainable in the long run. A few of the other drawbacks of EF Core OOB first-level caching mechanism are:\r\n\r\n - As more objects and their references are loaded into memory, the memory consumption of the context may increase exponentially – ironically leading to performance issues, for which we had started using EF core first-level cache in the first place.\r\n - Possible memory leaks when disposal of context not done properly when it is not required.\r\n - The probability of running into concurrency related issues increases as the gap between the time when the data is queried and updated grows.\r\n\r\nSo as  you can see given the need of scaling for Distributed applications , it is highly recommended to go for usage of Caching Providers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157908/does-dbcontext-need-memorycache-or-redis-in-net-core/58162986#58162986","title":"Does DbContext need MemoryCache or Redis in Net Core?"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12109818"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":140,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58162986,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570391476,"creation_date":1569780518,"last_edit_date":1570391476,"question_id":58157908,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157908","body_markdown":"We have multiple lookup tables in a SQL Server database.

These other properties will be used while getting  results/output but I didn&#39;t wanted these to be searchable or filterable(meaning, didn&#39;t wanted to index).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a Mapping class\r\n```\r\n public class EsMappingContract\r\n{\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;doi&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string Doi { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;displayName&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string DisplayName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;itemType&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string ItemType { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;fileReference&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string FileReference { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere&#39;s the Indexing Class\r\n```\r\npublic class EsIndexingContract\r\n{\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;doi&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string Doi { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;displayName&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string DisplayName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;itemType&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string ItemType { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;fileReference&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string FileReference { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;citationTitle&quot;, Ignore = true)]\r\n\tpublic string CitationTitle { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;translatedPublicationTitle&quot;, Ignore = true)]\r\n\tpublic string TranslatedPublicationTitle { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;alternatePublicationTitle&quot;, Ignore = true)]\r\n\tpublic string AlternatePublicationTitle { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\t[PropertyName(&quot;publicationSubTitle&quot;, Ignore = true)]\r\n\tpublic string PublicationSubTitle { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t knew that ```[Ignore]``` will ignore the properties while indexing also and thus I had to go for this approach. I would have liked some other decorator that would have indicated ES to ignore while creating Mapping but should not be ignored on indexing, if the properties had value.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help!! Hope this helps somebody in future.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157898/c-elasticsearch-nest-v7-x-ignore-true-not-working-on-fields/58168975#58168975","title":"c# - ElasticSearch-Nest v7.x &quot;Ignore = true&quot; not working on fields"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10427882,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ne8tV7VA47A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/DVDe2V54wqw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Avinash Prasad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10427882/avinash-prasad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10427882,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ne8tV7VA47A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/DVDe2V54wqw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Avinash Prasad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10427882/avinash-prasad"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58168975,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569850276,"creation_date":1569780474,"last_edit_date":1569825702,"question_id":58157898,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157898","body_markdown":"I am trying to do indexing of certain fields from POCO class and decorating some of the properties as &quot;Ignore = true&quot; and those fields should not be indexed but should be stored.

Looking at it from a application point of view:\r\n\r\n1. You don&#39;t need TURN to discover your own public address. Without NAT your address is not changed by the network and your local address is your public address. You just need to let your software ask the OS what the currently configured addresses are.\r\n\r\n2. With IPv6 it&#39;s usually not the gateway giving out addresses to connected devices. The gateway only communicates the network prefix (a /64) to the network, and all devices choose their own addresses (usually multiple addresses per device).\r\n\r\nDHCPv6 does exist, but it is usually not used to configure IPv6 addresses on devices. It may be used in stateless mode to configure domain names, DNS resolvers etc, but that is not related to assigning addresses.\r\n\r\nSo the device chooses its own addresses within the prefix communicated by the gateway. How does it choose?\r\n\r\nOriginally devices used their interface MAC address for the suffix (using the modified EUI-64 algorithm). The problem with this was that if you had a lap for example, online services that you connect to could track your device. Because no matter what network you connect to, the last 64 bits of your address would contain your unique MAC address. That way it was possible to track your device from work to home to your favourite coffee place etc.\r\n\r\nThese days the OS uses privacy extensions to make your IPv6 address untraceable. Often there is a stable address that is linked to the network prefix, so that every time you connect to the same network you get the same address. That address is useful for peer-to-peer communication.\r\n\r\nBut they went further than that. There is often also a set of privacy addresses that (semi)randomly change over time. Your device might generate a new address every day, or maybe even every hour. That makes it even harden for online services to determine whether there is a single device that has changed it&#39;s privacy address, or whether there are multiple devices. Because this address changes over time it&#39;s good for short-lived outbound connections, but not so useful to accept inbound connections on. For that use the stable address I mentioned in the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\nProbably the most difficult bit is how to ask the OS about the available addresses. Looking at my own macOS box I see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nen2: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500\r\n\tether c8:e0:eb:5c:af:61\r\n\tinet6 fe80::1074:8568:e447:d9e3%en2 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x12\r\n\tinet6 2a02:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:3e:873f:837:1417 prefixlen 64 autoconf secured\r\n\tinet6 2a02:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:b19c:71c5:1de8:8fde prefixlen 64 autoconf temporary\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see both the long-term `secured` address and the short-term `temporary` address.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing which OS you are developing for and in which programming language I can&#39;t help you further. Please adjust your question to include that information.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157848/static-and-public-ip-addresses-for-regular-computers/58157967#58157967","title":"Static and public IP addresses for regular computers"}],"owner":{"reputation":596,"user_id":9658326,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db63227eb79fa6bec101b58b04e51438?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JacopoStanchi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9658326/jacopostanchi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":596,"user_id":9658326,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db63227eb79fa6bec101b58b04e51438?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JacopoStanchi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9658326/jacopostanchi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569788914,"creation_date":1569780138,"last_edit_date":1569788914,"question_id":58157848,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157848","body_markdown":"I want to do a messaging application on the browser using WebRTC, but I want to get rid of every third party like STUN and TURN servers (I also want to get rid of signaling servers but first things first). I want the users to keep their contacts in the browser `localStorage` in a key-value way: name of the person =&gt; IP address. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t really care *how* the users find their own public IP address (they can do an `ipconfig` as there is no web API to retrieve it) nor *how* they distribute it (they can use use a centralized service like Messenger to give their public IP address to their friends, or they can use a QR code on their business card).\r\n\r\nBut the main issue I have is that I want these public IP addresses to be static, because I don&#39;t want to notify all my friends to update their contact file every time my gateway changes my public IP address.\r\n\r\nIn IPv4, there are too few available addresses (only 4 billions), so the public static addresses are all reserved to website and residential gateways. Whenever I want to access the Internet, my gateway opens a specific port for my computer. For example, if my gateway has the public address `1.2.3.4`, the &quot;public address&quot; of my computer would be temporarily `1.2.3.4:3000`. This process is called NAT. To find one&#39;s &quot;public address&quot;, one must send a request to a STUN server which would respond with what IPv4 address and what port it sees. But the gateway closes the connection of the port at some point, so that&#39;s not a public static address like I want.\r\n\r\nBut in IPv6 it&#39;s different, the number of possible addresses is ridiculously high (2^128), so we could theorically give one static public address to each computer in the world. NAT would basically be useless (I&#39;m not talking about firewalls here). But again, there is a problem, in IPv6 you have one address that is static but not public, and you have one or more addresses that are public but not static. So nothing has really changed from IPv4, and it still doesn&#39;t solve my problem.\r\n\r\nI have 2 questions:\r\n\r\n- How to have a public and static address for regular computers? I don&#39;t want my users to meddle with their router/ISP or install anything on their computer.\r\n- Why don&#39;t we all already have static and public IPv6 addresses? Is there a design choice behind this?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157848/static-and-public-ip-addresses-for-regular-computers","title":"Static and public IP addresses for regular computers"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7818}
