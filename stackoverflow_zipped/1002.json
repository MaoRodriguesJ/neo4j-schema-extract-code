To access the properties anywhere you can just do `Config.ConnectionString`.\r\n\r\nTo actually populate the `Config` class, you can specify separate classes to populate them and run it in the start up. For standard .NET:\r\n\r\n    public class ConfigSetup\r\n    {\r\n        public static void SetupConfig()\r\n        {\r\n            Config.ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;ConnectionString&quot;];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor .NET core in Startup.cs:\r\n\r\n    public IConfiguration _config { get; }\r\n    \r\n    public Startup(IHostingEnvironment env)\r\n    {\r\n        _environmentPath = env.ContentRootPath;\r\n    \r\n        _config = new ConfigurationBuilder().SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath).AddJsonFile(&quot;appSettings.json&quot;).Build();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)\r\n    {\r\n        Config.ConnectionString = _config[&quot;ConnectionString&quot;];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo you may have several `ConfigSetup`s for each project type but only need to run the one which is relevant to the current project.

That is, between every two values, there is a `Null`.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to check that each subtree satisfies suitable *requirements*: we can *refine* the requirements at each `Node`, remembering which values we are between, then *test* them at each `Null`. As there is a `Null` between every in order pair of values, we will have tested that all in order (left-to-right) pairs are non-decreasing.\r\n\r\nWhat is a requirement? It&#39;s a *loose* lower and upper bound on the values in the tree. To express requirements, including those at the leftmost and rightmost ends, we may extend any ordering with `Bot`tom and `Top` elements, as follows:\r\n\r\n    data TopBot a = Bot | Val a | Top deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)\r\n\r\nNow let us check that a given tree satisfies the requirements of being both in order and between given bounds.\r\n\r\n    ordBetween :: Ord a =&gt; TopBot a -&gt; TopBot a -&gt; BinaryTree a -&gt; Bool\r\n      -- tighten the demanded bounds, left and right of any Node\r\n    ordBetween lo hi (Node l x r) = ordBetween lo (Val x) l &amp;&amp; ordBetween (Val x) hi r\r\n      -- check that the demanded bounds are in order when we reach Null\r\n    ordBetween lo hi Null         = lo &lt;= hi\r\n\r\nA binary search tree is a tree that is in order and between `Bot` and `Top`.\r\n\r\n    isBSTree :: Ord a =&gt; BinaryTree a -&gt; Bool\r\n    isBSTree = ordBetween Bot Top\r\n\r\nComputing the *actual* extremal values in each subtree, bubbling them outwards, gives you more information than you need, and is fiddly in the edge cases where a left or right subtree is empty. Maintaining and checking the *requirements*, pushing them inwards, is rather more uniform.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304077/find-whether-a-tree-is-a-binary-search-tree-in-haskell/58305672#58305672","title":"Find whether a tree is a binary search tree in Haskell"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":50315,"user_id":849891,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYKQi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Will Ness","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/849891/will-ness"},"last_editor":{"reputation":50315,"user_id":849891,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYKQi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Will Ness","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/849891/will-ness"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570663797,"last_edit_date":1570663797,"creation_date":1570641362,"answer_id":58309178,"question_id":58304077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58309178","body_markdown":"We can proceed left-to-right over the tree like this:\r\n\r\n    isBSTtreeG :: Ord a =&gt; BinaryTree a -&gt; Bool\r\n    isBSTtreeG t = gopher Nothing [Right t]\r\n        where\r\n        gopher  _   []                        =  True\r\n        gopher  x   (Right Null:ts)           =  gopher x ts\r\n        gopher  x   (Right (Node lt v rt):ts) =  gopher x (Right lt:Left v:Right rt:ts)\r\n        gopher Nothing   (Left v:ts)          =  gopher (Just v) ts\r\n        gopher (Just y)  (Left v:ts)          =  y &lt;= v &amp;&amp; gopher (Just v) ts\r\n\r\nInspired by [John McCarthy&#39;s `gopher`](https://dreamsongs.com/10ideas.html).\r\n\r\nThe explicit push-down list can be eliminated with continuation-passing,\r\n\r\n    isBSTtreeC :: Ord a =&gt; BinaryTree a -&gt; Bool\r\n    isBSTtreeC t = gopher Nothing t (const True)\r\n        where\r\n        gopher  x   Null           g  =  g x \r\n        gopher  x   (Node lt v rt) g  =  gopher x lt (\\case\r\n                                           Nothing -&gt; gopher (Just v) rt g\r\n                                           Just y  -&gt; y &lt;= v &amp;&amp; gopher (Just v) rt g)\r\n\r\nMaintaining just one, *largest-so-far* element, is enough.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304077/find-whether-a-tree-is-a-binary-search-tree-in-haskell/58309178#58309178","title":"Find whether a tree is a binary search tree in Haskell"}],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":12036912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Bs1MMku7W04/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcRX-T31D-fLdCF5w6i9pacNreJ9w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jayyyyyy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12036912/jayyyyyy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":50315,"user_id":849891,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYKQi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Will Ness","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/849891/will-ness"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":274,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"answer_count":4,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1570663797,"creation_date":1570623864,"last_edit_date":1570631389,"question_id":58304077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58304077","body_markdown":"      type BSTree a = BinaryTree a\r\n\r\n      data BinaryTree a = Null | Node (BinaryTree a) a (BinaryTree a)\r\n                          deriving Show\r\n\r\n      flattenTree :: BinaryTree a -&gt; [a]\r\n      flattenTree  tree = case tree of\r\n          Null -&gt; []\r\n          Node left val right -&gt; (flattenTree left) ++ [val] ++ (flattenTree right)\r\n\r\n      isBSTree :: (Ord a) =&gt; BinaryTree a -&gt; Bool\r\n      isBSTree btree = case btree of\r\n          Null -&gt; False\r\n          tree -&gt; (flattenTree tree) == sort (flattenTree tree)\r\n\r\n  What I want to do is to write a function to determine whether the given tree is a binary search tree, my method is to group all of the values in a list and import `Data.List` and then sort the list to find whether they are equal, but it is a little complicated.

Prefer composition over inheritance (_especially_ if the thing you intend to derive from is not polymorphic). Have `SteadyTime` expose a `time_point` member if you need to, or wrap its interface manually.

If the tag doesn&#39;t exist, then upon clicking enter, the text the user has entered should trigger a `CREATE, &quot;tags&quot;, { data: {name: &lt;entered value&gt; } }` on the data adapter and the result should be included in the choices (preferably being chosen already)\r\n\r\nSomething like this https://jedwatson.github.io/react-select/ (scroll down to where it says **Custom tag creation**)\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nMaybe the functionality should be decoupled from the data adapter.

When I do the OR between these numbers, I should get the result as -0b10110 but instead I am getting -0b10010.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304037/bitwise-operation-set-nth-bit-for-negative-number","title":"bitwise operation set nth bit for negative number"},{"tags":["sitecore","sitecore8"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":101,"user_id":7234310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/783bc88e82f5aa457a18fd4ade3f50a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yuriy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7234310/yuriy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571027103,"post_id":58332368,"comment_id":103089933,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304035/how-i-can-to-create-a-custom-page-for-error-code-404/58332368#comment103089933_58332368"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":458,"user_id":1526493,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xPPb0SCX854/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGbI/rdpY4lKUkkM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dave Goosem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1526493/dave-goosem"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570750334,"creation_date":1570750334,"answer_id":58332368,"question_id":58304035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58332368","body_markdown":"You can have both standard .NET error pages configured within the web.config (recommened you use transforms to modify your web.config) \r\n\r\n    &lt;system.webServer&gt;       \r\n        &lt;httpErrors xdt:Transform=&quot;Remove&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;httpErrors errorMode=&quot;DetailedLocalOnly&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;remove statusCode=&quot;404&quot; subStatusCode=&quot;-1&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;remove statusCode=&quot;500&quot; subStatusCode=&quot;-1&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;error statusCode=&quot;404&quot; prefixLanguageFilePath=&quot;&quot; path=&quot;404.html&quot; responseMode=&quot;File&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;error statusCode=&quot;500&quot; prefixLanguageFilePath=&quot;&quot; path=&quot;Error.html&quot; responseMode=&quot;File&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/httpErrors&gt;\r\n&lt;/system.webServer&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can also then configure sitecore to set custom error pages by patching the following Sitecore config settings:\r\n\r\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n        &lt;sitecore&gt;\r\n         &lt;settings&gt;            \r\n            &lt;setting name=&quot;RequestErrors.UseServerSideRedirect&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;patch:attribute name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;true&lt;/patch:attribute&gt;\r\n            &lt;/setting&gt;\r\n            &lt;setting name=&quot;ItemNotFoundUrl&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;patch:attribute name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;/Error/404&lt;/patch:attribute&gt;\r\n            &lt;/setting&gt;\r\n            &lt;setting name=&quot;LayoutNotFoundUrl&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;patch:attribute name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;/Error/404&lt;/patch:attribute&gt;\r\n            &lt;/setting&gt;\r\n            &lt;setting name=&quot;LinkItemNotFoundUrl&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;patch:attribute name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;/Error/404&lt;/patch:attribute&gt;\r\n            &lt;/setting&gt;\r\n            &lt;setting name=&quot;NoAccessUrl&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;patch:attribute name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;/Error.aspx&lt;/patch:attribute&gt;\r\n            &lt;/setting&gt;\r\n          &lt;/settings&gt;\r\n        &lt;/sitecore&gt;\r\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n\r\nThe one you&#39;re looking for is the ItemNotFoundUrl which as long as you set to a legitimate Sitecore Url (so a content page for your 404) you can then have a content managed page for when the error can be handled by Sitecore.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304035/how-i-can-to-create-a-custom-page-for-error-code-404/58332368#58332368","title":"How I can to create a custom page for error code 404?"}],"owner":{"reputation":101,"user_id":7234310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/783bc88e82f5aa457a18fd4ade3f50a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yuriy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7234310/yuriy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570750334,"creation_date":1570623691,"question_id":58304035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58304035","body_markdown":"Could you tell me please, how I can do it in Sitecore?

as I understand it you need to create a PDF from the stream and then use the PDF to read the content.\r\n\r\nSo firstly we need to create a PDF from a MemoryStream, but wait we only have a Stream so we need to convert it to a MemoryStream like so:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static void CopyStream(Stream input, Stream output)\r\n{    \r\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[16*1024];\r\n    int read;\r\n    while((read = input.Read (buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) &gt; 0)\r\n    {\r\n        output.Write (buffer, 0, read);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Create MemoryStream\r\nvar ms = new MemoryStream();\r\nCopyStream(streamFromDatabase, ms);\r\n\r\n// Create PDF from MemoryStream\r\nvar pdf = PdfReader.Open(ms);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now we can read the text from it like so:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar sb = new StringBuilder();\r\n\r\nforeach (var page in pdf.Pages)\r\n{\r\n     sb.Append(string.Join(&quot;&quot;, page.ExtractText().ToArray()));\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304025/how-to-convert-a-stream-that-contains-a-pdf-to-text/58304268#58304268","title":"How to convert a

Some properties are an object itself. The problem is that the generated page looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Nav\r\n\r\n1. Page\r\n   a. init\r\n   b. loadModules\r\n   c. beforeUnload\r\n   d. events\r\n2. Header\r\n   a. navLinks\r\n   b. init\r\n   c. selectLink\r\n   d. events\r\n...\r\n```\r\nWe can see that `header` is outside of `Page` in the generated documentation and I wanted its to be inside because I have 7 other objects like this and the documentation became hard to use.\r\n\r\nIs my problem caused by the JSDoc comments or should I use something else than objects (such as a class)? I used object because the script became easier to read and I can access to every functions ans properties at any time.\r\n\r\nI hope I have made myself quite clear (and that I didn&#39;t make too many mistakes).\r\nHave a nice day.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58303978/should-i-keep-using-object-instead-of-class-some-problems-with-jsdocs","title":"Should I keep using object instead of class?
