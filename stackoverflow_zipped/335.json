The goal is to have a button that generates a certain amount of tiles based off of a number in a spin box. I have gotten it to work mostly and clicking the &#39;generate&#39; button will generate a new number of tiles if the spin box value is changed to a larger number, as expected, however if I change the spin box to a smaller number, the old tile generation can be seen behind the new. I would expect that the `canvas.delete(&#39;all&#39;)` to take of the previous canvas objects. \r\n\r\nI have tried to solve this problem by not redefining the canvas inside of the function which I have a feeling is causing the problem, but then I am not able to redraw the canvas boundaries so the maximum number of tiles that can be generated will be constrained by the initially drawn canvas size. Normally I would think that I could return canvas from the function, but since it is attached to the button through the command functionality and a lambda function, I am not sure how to go about doing that.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport tkinter as tk\r\n\r\n\r\ndef generate_start(window, canvas, num_tiles):\r\n    canvas.delete(&#39;all&#39;)\r\n    canvas = tk.Canvas(window, width=40*num_tiles, height=40)\r\n    canvas.grid(row=1, columnspan=num_tiles)\r\n    for i in range(num_tiles):\r\n        tile_width = 40\r\n        x1 = i * tile_width\r\n        y1 = 0\r\n        x2 = (i + 1)*tile_width - 1\r\n        y2 = tile_width - 1\r\n        canvas.create_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill=&#39;blue&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nwindow = tk.Tk()\r\nwindow.title(&#39;GUI&#39;)\r\n\r\ntk.Label(window, text = &quot;Number of starting tiles:&quot;).grid(row=0)\r\ndefault_start_num = 6\r\nvar = tk.IntVar(value=default_start_num)\r\nstart_num = tk.Spinbox(window, from_=1, to=100, \r\n           textvariable=var)\r\nstart_num.grid(row=0, column=1)\r\n\r\ncanvas = tk.Canvas(window, width=40*default_start_num, height=40)\r\ncanvas.grid(row=1, columnspan=default_start_num)\r\n\r\ngenerate_btn = tk.Button(window, text=&#39;Generate&#39;, \r\n          command=lambda: generate_start(window, canvas, int(start_num.get())))\r\ngenerate_btn.grid(row=0, column=2)\r\n\r\nwindow.mainloop()\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458516/python-tkinter-gui-delete-canvas-objects-defined-within-function-at-the-click-o","title":"Python Tkinter GUI: Delete canvas objects defined within function at the click of a button"},{"tags":["mongodb","rest","api","parameters"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":6746584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Py8v2veLUhk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACA/H2iZhbg4SrQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jon Erik Solheim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6746584/jon-erik-solheim"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571496887,"creation_date":1571496887,"answer_id":58464901,"question_id":58458515,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58464901","body_markdown":"Sorry, but this was due to an aggressive cache on a particular service, should be working fine now.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458515/get-request-with-query-string-params-to-restdb-api-always-response-the-same-an/58464901#58464901","title":"Get request with query string params to (restdb) API always response the same answer, even when params change"}],"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":9408631,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/076e283817099a3de849732ea42b5001?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rdhox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9408631/rdhox"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571567689,"accepted_answer_id":58464901,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571496887,"creation_date":1571434717,"question_id":58458515,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458515","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s my header:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Accept: &#39;application/json&#39;,\r\n    &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;,\r\n    &#39;Cache-Control&#39;: &#39;no-cache&#39;,\r\n    &#39;x-apikey&#39;: &#39;some-api-key&#39;,\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I send a GET request with the query `/users?q={&quot;firstname&quot;: {&quot;$regex&quot;: &quot;jo&quot;}}` after refreshing the page with ctrl+f5, the response match the query.

Each items in array contains text and &quot;remove&quot; button and clearly, &quot;remove&quot; button will remove item from the list in array based on specific id.

However, my goal is to have modal popup modal with confirmation on deletion with message after clicking on &quot;remove&quot; button to Something like this... [ Modal confirmation #1 - codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/kx6yx12l1r?fontsize=14) or [Modal confirmation #2 by Chris Geirman - codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/embed/10o12zzk63?fontsize=14) view more [Stackoverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46838227/6387458).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, example with links does not use react-hooks, reducers or, contextAPI. So, I tried on my own and came real close to perfect conclusion. The Modal did pop-up with confirmation on deletion message with two buttons beneath (remove &amp; cancel) after clicking on remove button from array. Unfortunately, it does not delete the correct item, or in other word delete on specific item by id.  For example, Let say there are 4 items in array. If I wanted to remove the first Item which is at top the of array (&quot;Array One&quot;), this will end up deleting items at the bottom (&quot;Array Four&quot;). To get better insight, Have a look on example inside my [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/misty-architecture-5xn3h?fontsize=14).\r\n\r\nI am struggling finding solution on deleting specific item by id after pop-up modal. Spend few days on it and I could not come up any of it. I need help? What did I do wrong? Any solutions, recommendation or better suggestions?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458503/react-modal-with-confirm-deletion-from-array-map","title":"React - Modal with Confirm Deletion from array map"},{"tags":["rest","api"],"owner":{"reputation":144,"user_id":5768272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":21,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1097548193590796/picture?type=large","display_name":"Adrian Humphrey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768272/adrian-humphrey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571451083,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571434609,"creation_date":1571434609,"question_id":58458499,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458499","body_markdown":"Here is what I am trying to do.

the problem is when you scroll after the starting point of Horizontal scroll section, upward, since the scrolling can easily bypass the starting point which implements the whole code and translation of X,it may jump 20px, or 10px, or 5 px, the wrapper keeps the Xtrasnlation which it had before scrolling up causing the whole element being left out from being trasnlated by the script, since scrolling up or scrolling down isn&#39;t being done 1 pixel at every scroll event. So How do we fix it? \r\nWe can extend our starting or ending point by just few hundred pixels so even if we bypass the previous starting or ending points caused by our scrolling down from ending point or scrolling up from our starting point we can still have access to scrolltop - the starter element&#39;s offsetTop and define if it is lower than 0 so lets the translation of X of wrapper element to be 0 or if it is bigger than where the end point is it should be equal to -translation of X equal to ending point.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458480/how-to-fix-horizontal-scrolling-script-which-i-wrote-in-vanilla-javascript/58474191#58474191","title":"How to fix Horizontal scrolling script which I wrote in vanilla JavaScript"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11719224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0faeea65dfac2c39bbaf6e92b0ab1e99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AbeIsWatching","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11719224/abeiswatching"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":120,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58474191,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571583150,"creation_date":1571434521,"question_id":58458480,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458480","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve made up this Horizontal scrolling page based on some idea from YouTube, everything works fine, the logic is also fine, but the translation of x has a problem, sometimes it translates X too much or sometime lower than what it should, there must be a change made on translateThisMuch const, but I cannot think of anything, any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\nthis is the link to the code &lt;https://codepen.io/AbramPlus/pen/RwwoPrW&gt;\r\nNotice how when it goes from different parts of the scrolling sections to others, there is still some of the other ones left in the view port.\r\nthis is the JS code.\r\n\r\n    const spacer = document.querySelector(&quot;.spacer&quot;);\r\n    const spacerSecond = document.querySelector(&quot;.spacerSecond&quot;);\r\n    const wrapper = document.querySelector(&quot;.wrapper&quot;);\r\n    const windowEffect = document.querySelector(&quot;.windowEffect&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    const horizontalScrollEnabler = () =&gt;

There is no way to disable this.\r\n\r\nTo output HTML you can use `v-html`. However, that is not equivalent to `{{ ... }}` as `v-html` needs to be hung off an element and cannot be used to create partial content.\r\n\r\nSo you can write this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;p v-html=&quot;&#39;Result: &#39; + sleepyTime&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other option, and usually the preferred option, is to keep the markup in the template. That would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;p&gt;Result:\r\n  &lt;h1 v-if=&quot;someNumber &lt; 5&quot;&gt;It&#39;s okay to go back to bed.&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n  &lt;h3 v-else-if=&quot;someNumber &lt; 7&quot;&gt;One more hours plus a cup of coffee&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n  &lt;h2 v-else-if=&quot;someNumber &lt; 9&quot;&gt;2 more hours and 2 cups of coffee.&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n  &lt;h1 v-else&gt;Drill 3 cups of coffee.

first issue with this query:\r\n\r\n    SELECT name, count(*) as count \r\n    FROM TABLE X\r\n    GROUP BY id\r\n    HAVING count &gt; X.data;\r\n\r\nis that you have `name` in the `SELECT` but `id` in `GROUP BY`.  *Because you are grouping by `id`*, I assume that there are multiple values in `X`.  Hence, this is incorrect syntax.\r\n\r\nThere are some cases where this is allowed by the standard -- and even in some databases.  However, that requires that `id` be unique in the table (the technical jargon is that the columns in the `SELECT` are *functionally dependent* on the columns in the `GROUP BY`).\r\n\r\nThe next issue is the use of `count` in the `HAVING` clause.  This is fine conceptually.  However, not all databases may support it.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have `x.data` in the `HAVING` clause.  If that is functionally dependent on a subset of the `GROUP BY` keys, then the usage conforms with the standard.

is actually very easy using  the current `apache poi 4.1.0` ;-).\r\n\r\nThere is an example for creating line charts in https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/xssf/usermodel/examples/. This one can take as basis.\r\n\r\nThe only things you need to know additional is that dates are stored as numeric values in `double` precision. So the category axis values come `fromNumericCellRange` and not `fromStringCellRange`. And if really a date axis is needed instead of a category axis, `XDDFDateAxis` must be created instead of `XDDFCategoryAxis`.\r\n\r\nBut.\r\n\r\nAdditional problems result from `Microsoft`s weird decisions  to make things default in `Excel` versions later than 2007. In `Excel` versions later than 2007  category axes are no more text axes type by default. Even date axes are no more date axes type by default. Instead they are &quot;auto&quot; type dependent on the data. So we need explicitly set that we do not want that auto type. \r\nAlso axes number formats are no more linked to the source. So we need set even that explicitly.\r\n\r\nComplete example:\r\n\r\n    import java.io.FileOutputStream;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.*;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.DataFormat;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.*;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.*;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.ss.util.CellRangeAddress;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.ss.util.CellReference;\r\n     \r\n    import java.util.GregorianCalendar;\r\n     \r\n    class CreateExcelLIneChartDataAxis {\r\n     \r\n     private static void addLineChart(XSSFSheet sheet, CellRangeAddress anchorRange, \r\n      CellRangeAddress[] titleRanges, CellRangeAddress[] dataRanges, PresetColor[] lineColors) {\r\n    \r\n      XSSFDrawing drawing = sheet.createDrawingPatriarch();\r\n      XSSFClientAnchor anchor = drawing.createAnchor(0, 0, 0, 0, \r\n       anchorRange.getFirstColumn(), \r\n       anchorRange.getFirstRow(),\r\n       anchorRange.getLastColumn(),\r\n       anchorRange.getLastRow()\r\n      );\r\n      XSSFChart chart = drawing.createChart(anchor);\r\n      XDDFChartLegend legend = chart.getOrAddLegend();\r\n      legend.setPosition(LegendPosition.BOTTOM);\r\n    \r\n      XDDFCategoryAxis bottomAxis = chart.createCategoryAxis(AxisPosition.BOTTOM);\r\n      // if a date axis is needed instead of a category axis, comment the above and uncomment the next\r\n      //XDDFDateAxis bottomAxis = chart.createDateAxis(AxisPosition.BOTTOM);\r\n    \r\n      XDDFValueAxis leftAxis = chart.createValueAxis(AxisPosition.LEFT);\r\n      leftAxis.setCrosses(AxisCrosses.AUTO_ZERO);\r\n      leftAxis.setCrossBetween(AxisCrossBetween.BETWEEN);\r\n      XDDFChartData data = chart.createData(ChartTypes.LINE, bottomAxis, leftAxis);\r\n      data.setVaryColors(false);\r\n      //XDDFDataSource&lt;String&gt;

I would just create a new dataframe for each attribute and jump back and forth between them as necessary.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to use pandas for very quick lookups and calculations of data.\r\n\r\nOr is there a better more pandas-ish way to do this?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458416/multi-dimensional-dataframe-or-multiple-2d-dataframes","title":"Multi-dimensional dataframe or multiple 2D dataframes"},{"tags":["python","apache-spark","pyspark","user-defined-functions"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1252,"user_id":11908107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gg8x4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"slava-kohut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908107/slava-kohut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571665677,"post_id":58461731,"comment_id":103306009,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458415/pandas-scalar-udf-failing-illegalargumentexception/58461731#comment103306009_58461731"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":12025466,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCsJQF1tc0hLQUdHlxURbYSdRQuT5Z4A63sItklag=k-s128","display_name":"Vignesh dvp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12025466/vignesh-dvp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36,"user_id":12025466,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCsJQF1tc0hLQUdHlxURbYSdRQuT5Z4A63sItklag=k-s128","display_name":"Vignesh dvp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12025466/vignesh-dvp"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571473642,"last_edit_date":1571473642,"creation_date":1571472636,"answer_id":58461731,"question_id":58458415,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58461731","body_markdown":"Pyarrow rolled out a new version 0.15 on october 5 which causes pandas Udf to throw error.\r\nSpark needs to upgrade to be compatible with this(which might take some time).\r\nYou can follow the progress here https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-29367?filter=allissues\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n\r\n1) **You need to install Pyarrow 0.14.1 or lower.** &lt; sc.install_pypi_package(&quot;pyarrow==0.14.1&quot;) &gt;\r\n(or) \r\n2) Set the environment variable **ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT=1** from where you are using Python","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458415/pandas-scalar-udf-failing-illegalargumentexception/58461731#58461731","title":"Pandas scalar UDF failing, IllegalArgumentException"}],"owner":{"reputation":1252,"user_id":11908107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gg8x4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"slava-kohut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908107/slava-kohut"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1252,"user_id":11908107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gg8x4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"slava-kohut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908107/slava-kohut"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58461731,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571859551,"creation_date":1571434011,"last_edit_date":1571859551,"question_id":58458415,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458415","body_markdown":"First off, I apologize if my issue is simple.

For example:\r\n```\r\nEmpty DataFrame\r\nColumns: [department, 01/01/2017, 01/01/2018, 01/01/2019]\r\n```\r\nThis would be populated with:\r\n```\r\nColumns: [department, 01/01/2017, 01/01/2018, 01/01/2019]\r\nwidgets, 67, 54, 33\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe content will be populated from another dataframe that is constructed like:\r\n```\r\nColumns: [department, date, productid]\r\nwidget, 5/20/2018, 1234567\r\nwidget, 7/7/2019, 78987\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I am creating a dataframe, obtaining the data for each range (by filtering another data frame) then populating.  The user will be specifying how many years of ranges should be reported on in the final dataframe.  There is another script that returns the list of dates to use:\r\n```\r\n#generate a list of years within report range\r\ntimeframes_yrs = pd.date_range(start_date,end_date, freq=&#39;12MS&#39;).strftime(&#39;%m/%d/%Y&#39;).tolist()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears there are a few ways I can go about this:\r\n1.  Using a for loop, dynamically assign new variables to dataframes which filter things out.  At some point merge all of these on departments.  Something like (oversimplified example):\r\n```\r\nx=0\r\nfor yr in timeframes_yrs:\r\n    filter_dates[x] = df[(df[&#39;date&#39;] &gt; yr)] \r\n    x=x+1\r\n#iterate through the new variables and merge them here\r\n```\r\n2.  In the for loop, I could merge the dataframe at the end of the loop.  Something like (oversimplified example):\r\n```\r\nfor yr in timeframes_yrs:\r\n    filter_dates = df[(df[&#39;date&#39;] &gt; yr)] \r\n    #merge the result here\r\n```\r\n3.  I could set up the dataframe with the dynamic date columns, iterate through then populate the rows/values below\r\n\r\nFrom what I have read, dynamic variables are a bad idea.  Unless there is some other tool in Pandas I am not aware of or more &quot;Pythonic&quot; way of doing this (e.g. converting the data to a dictionary, series etc. then passing back in), I am not sure how to attack this problem.  Is there any other way to do this I am missing?  Should I be leaving the &quot;for&quot; loop out of this and attempting it just using tools available in Pandas (creating a new column using &quot;query&quot; or similar)?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458397/building-a-dataframe-with-dynamic-date-ranges-using-filtered-results-from-anothe","title":"Building a dataframe with dynamic date ranges using filtered results from another dataframe"},{"tags":["excel","google-form","survey","qualtrics","sna"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11476485,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c4983a4bca7a83548466f5ee4aecea8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wavetree","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11476485/wavetree"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571433873,"creation_date":1571433873,"question_id":58458392,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458392","body_markdown":"Is there a survey platform for example, Qualtrics or Google Forms that will allow me to create a participant editable table?

But perhaps it&#39;d be better to take a step back and ask why you&#39;re doing this?\r\n\r\nSince you used a Django tag, can we assume you&#39;re running a Django application from some other process (for instance, an Apache WSGI application)? Then, by way of example, you&#39;d simply define these variables in /etc/apache2/envvars, then they&#39;d be available to the Apache process (and thus this code within a Django application). Similarly, defining your variables in /etc/environment might benefit you. It just depends on the invocation / deployment structure of your application.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, storing your variables in a `.env` file and reading that (instead of doing the a `subpprocess` call to a Shell script, which isn&#39;t secure) using a module like [`django-dotenv`](https://github.com/jpadilla/django-dotenv) and doing something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif not os.environ.get(&#39;DB_PASSWORD&#39;): \r\n    import dotenv\r\n    dotenv.read_dotenv(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), &quot;.env&quot;), True)\r\n\r\nDB_PASSWORD = os.environ.get(&#39;DB_PASSWORD&#39;, &#39;&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould also be a good approach.

But requirements in the library account and a user account, could share the same external_id (ie. &quot;REQ-23&quot;), so it is not an unique key on the Requirement table.\r\n\r\nThere is a RelatedRequirement table, that maps requirements that are related.\r\n\r\nBelow, I want to get the related requirements that belong to a user account, by making an account_id check in my has_many scope.\r\n\r\n**Database side:**\r\n```\r\naccount\r\n  id\r\n\r\nproject\r\n  id\r\n  account_id\r\n\r\nrequirement\r\n  id\r\n  project_id\r\n  external_id\r\n\r\nrelated_requirements\r\n   external_id\r\n   related_external_id\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Model side:**\r\n```\r\nclass RelatedRequirement &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :requirement,,\r\n    foreign_key: :external_id,\r\n    class_name: &quot;Requirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n\r\n  belongs_to :related_requirement,\r\n    foreign_key: :related_external_id,\r\n    class_name: &quot;Requirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Requirement &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n belongs_to :project\r\n  has_one :account, through: :project\r\n\r\n  has_many :related_requirement_mappings,\r\n    foreign_key: :external_id,\r\n    class_name: &quot;RelatedRequirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n\r\n  has_many :related_requirements,\r\n    # === this works ===\r\n    #-&gt; { joins(:project).where(projects: {account_id: 2 }) },\r\n    # === this doesn&#39;t work ===\r\n    -&gt; { joins(:project).where(projects: {account_id: project.account_id }) },\r\n    through: :related_requirement_mappings, \r\n    foreign_key: :related_external_id, \r\n    class_name: &quot;Requirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**My questions:**\r\n\r\n 1. Main question, I would like to be able to get the related_requirements within the same account using the has_many :related_requirements above, but I am unable to get to the associated account_id in my scope,\r\n```\r\n&gt;req = Requirement.find(1)\r\n&gt;req.related_requirements  \r\n\r\n  Requirement Load (81.3ms)  SELECT &quot;requirements&quot;.* FROM &quot;requirements&quot;\r\nNameError (undefined local variable or method `project&#39; for #&lt;Requirement::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x00007fe3f0b1ac20&gt;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I currently could do however, is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Requirement &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n\r\nhas_many :related_requirements,\r\n    #-&gt; { joins(:project).where(prjects: {account_id: project.account_id }) },\r\n    through: :related_requirement_mappings, \r\n    foreign_key: :related_external_id, \r\n    class_name: &quot;Requirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n\r\nscope :for_account, -&gt; (account) { joins(:project).where(projects: {account_id: account.id}) }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;req = Requirement.find(1)\r\n&gt;req.related_requirements.for_account(req.account)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks a bit silly, since it looks like I am calling an instance method on req, and I should be able to access req&#39;s account from inside related_requirements, without having to define this extra for_account scope.\r\n\r\n 2. Since the external_id is not a unique field, the belongs_to requirement in the RelatedRequirement table actually could map to multiple requirements, but it just returns one.  Ideally, I would want to add a scope condition (based on another database field cloned) that indicate it&#39;s from the library account.  However, if I do that, then the above related_requirements query would break, since the scope condition would be included in the query, and no longer return the related_requirements of the user account, I am interested.  I am unsure as to how come the condition I specify in the RelatedRequirement scope, is somehow applied in the scopes I am defining for Requirement when I am not explicitly invoking it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass RelatedRequirement &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :requirement,\r\n    -&gt; { where cloned: nil },\r\n    foreign_key: :external_id,\r\n    class_name: &quot;Requirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n\r\n  belongs_to :related_requirement,\r\n    -&gt; { where cloned: nil },\r\n    foreign_key: :related_external_id,\r\n    class_name: &quot;Requirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Requirement &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :project\r\n  has_one :account, through: :project\r\n\r\n  has_many :related_requirement_mappings,\r\n    foreign_key: :external_id,\r\n    class_name: &quot;RelatedRequirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n\r\n  has_many :related_requirements,\r\n    # -&gt; { joins(:project).where(projects: {account_id: project.account_id }) },\r\n    through: :related_requirement_mappings, \r\n    foreign_key: :related_external_id, \r\n    class_name: &quot;Requirement&quot;,\r\n    primary_key: :external_id\r\n\r\n  scope :for_account, -&gt; (account) { joins(:project).where(projects: {account_id: account.id}) }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nirb(main):060:0&gt; r.related_requirements.to_sql\r\n=&gt; &quot;SELECT \\&quot;requirements\\&quot;.* FROM \\&quot;requirements\\&quot; INNER JOIN \\&quot;related_requirements\\&quot; ON \\&quot;requirements\\&quot;.\\&quot;external_id\\&quot; = \\&quot;related_requirements\\&quot;.\\&quot;related_external_id\\&quot; WHERE \\&quot;related_requirements\\&quot;.\\&quot;external_id\\&quot; = &#39;REQ-1&#39; AND \\&quot;requirements\\&quot;.\\&quot;cloned\\&quot; IS NULL&quot;\r\n\r\nirb(main):061:0&gt; r.related_requirements.for_account(r.account)\r\n=&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::AssociationRelation []&gt;\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458383/has-many-scope-with-a-condition-check-on-a-nested-association","title":"has_many scope with a condition check on a nested association"},{"tags":["sharepoint","office365","microsoft-flow"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":11041457,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UEfw9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gerrit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11041457/gerrit"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571778973,"creation_date":1571778973,"answer_id":58512424,"question_id":58458380,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58512424","body_markdown":"Yes, the file is created once the author starts working on the news.

While Googling, I saw several recommendations to use MS Flows for sending members email notifications when new posts are added, but none mentioned this issue.\r\n\r\nThe reason for using MS Flow instead of built-in SharePoint functionality is (1) it appears neither being a group member nor &quot;following&quot; a site triggers email notifications, (2) I don&#39;t have admin privileges to set up site alerts, (3) based on the nature of the authors, we don&#39;t believe authors will remember to click &quot;Send by email&quot; (and we don&#39;t want to manually monitor that), and (4) based on the nature of our user base, we doubt most users will take the time to configure their SharePoint notifications. \r\n\r\nThank you if anyone has expertise to share.\r\n\r\n\r\n(MS Flow below - even if the Flow is inaccurate, it is still triggered right after an author initiates a new blog post and before the author clicks &quot;Post News.&quot;)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7bobW.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458380/microsoft-flow-emails-members-of-an-office-365-group-prematurely-when-a-news-pos","title":"Microsoft Flow emails members of an Office 365 group prematurely when a news post is added in SharePoint"},{"tags":["css","angular","typescript","sass","ngx-datatable"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":3551664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9912ff122939e10b563924b64004470d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Munge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3551664/munge"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":3551664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9912ff122939e10b563924b64004470d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Munge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3551664/munge"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571434140,"creation_date":1571433799,"last_edit_date":1571434140,"question_id":58458379,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458379","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently working on a project that is using ngx-datatables and I&#39;m having some problem with getting the table structure correct.

Or at least only the box.\r\n\r\nThe box:\r\n\r\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/XolUDjZ.png)\r\n\r\nHow I want it to look like after doing some magic:\r\n\r\n![img](https://imgur.com/LbppdUd.png)\r\n\r\nThis is where it was cropped from:\r\n\r\n![img](https://imgur.com/YAEt6U2.png)\r\n\r\nIf you view the first image on a black background, you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s still a white band beyond the boxed field. It can be cropped smaller or larger by getting its bounding box&#39;s stats, and adding the padding into it.\r\n\r\nThis is the naive and my first approach. The problem here is:\r\n\r\n* It cannot account for different line widths too much without affecting the characters inside. Say, you put in -9 as padding. It will work mostly well enough on boxes with ~9px line width, but anything beyond the ~9px are left inside. This causes some leftover pixels, which ultimately affects the accuracy of my application. \r\n* On the other hand, any boxed field with line width significantly lower than 9 may then have the characters inside destroyed too.\r\n\r\nMy second attempt is [removing the contour](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/09/removing-contours-image-using-python-opencv/) with a mask. However, it didn&#39;t turn out as expected.\r\n\r\nThe code in extracting the contours is really long so just assume `stats` contains the `contours` returned from `contours, _ = cv2.findContours`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# loop in each contour in stats\r\nfor i in range(len(stats)):\r\n    # get the stats of the bounding rectangle \r\n    x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(stats[i])\r\n\r\n    # draw the field contour into the mask\r\n    cv2.drawContours(mask, [stats[i]], -1, 0, -1)\r\n\r\n    # remove the contour from the original image\r\n    section = cv2.bitwise_and(section, section, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n    # crop the boxed field\r\n    field = crop_by_origin(x, y, w, h, padding=p)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what I get:\r\n\r\n![img](https://imgur.com/yi3q7MA.png)\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand why it didn&#39;t work? Maybe it&#39;s because in the site his example is on a black background? Maybe it doesn&#39;t work with &quot;transparent&quot; contours? Is this even possible?\r\n\r\nHow to fix this? Any other possible solutions around here?\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\n\r\nI tried another image with @nathancy&#39;s answer and this is what came up:\r\n\r\n![img](https://imgur.com/zctTjt0.png)\r\n\r\nThe result:\r\n\r\n![img](https://imgur.com/N0NhKcA.png)\r\n\r\nI tried playing around with the horizontal line kernel but it didn&#39;t work out as intended, is there a way to make this more dynamic?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458378/how-to-remove-external-hollow-contours-from-the-image-without-affecting-the-inte","title":"How to remove external hollow contours from the image without affecting the internal contours"},{"tags":["machine-learning","optimization","neural-network","deep-learning","loss-function"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11939525,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oykmXQYCuHk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reMQlLok-v3NiQgeKW0PNEF58XA9g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Julian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11939525/julian"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571433752,"creation_date":1571433752,"question_id":58458375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458375","body_markdown":"I want to combine two neural networks N1 and N2 into a new one by combining their loss functions.\r\nThe logits of each model, before they are fed through the softmax-activation, are combined.\r\nI tried *multiplying*, *averaging* and *take the maximum* of each prediction (per class).\r\n\r\nTraining N1 and N2 individually, N1 gets about 60% acc, N2 gets about 78% acc.\r\n\r\nWhen I combine them, the approach with average and multiplication both yield about 90% acc, which is nice.\r\nHowever, the maximum approach only gets to about 77%.\r\n\r\nI now want to understand why this is the case.

can easily accomplish this by leveraging a special parameter in bash and by simplifying your perl regular expression. I can explain them both a bit further:\r\n\r\n**Bash/Zsh Special Parameter**\r\n\r\nSee the man page for more info. (https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#Special-Parameters)\r\n\r\nIn bash you can access all of the arguments passed to a function using the `$*` special parameter, this allows you to easily handle a variable number of parameters. In your case, you want to search for and highlight each of the passed values. The nice thing about the `$*` is that it will separate the parameters by whatever value is set for the `IFS` variable.\r\n\r\n**Multi-Matching Regular Expression**\r\n\r\nRather than duplicate the matching logic by adding extra rules, you can simply use an `OR` conditional in your expression to search for multiple words in your document. This is done by adding a pipe (`|`) between the words you are searching for.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together, we can use a function like this to support searching for multiple words in a document.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction highlight() {\r\n  IFS=&#39;|&#39;\r\n  perl -pe &quot;s/$*/\\e[1;31;43m$&amp;\\e[0m/g&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly simple example and it will even work correctly if your target string contains spaces like this:\r\n\r\n`highlight &quot;my string&quot;`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458364/how-to-highlight-multiple-matches/58458917#58458917","title":"How to highlight multiple matches?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11273,"user_id":241142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc690e6057d0756358e2d80409a945b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"iconoclast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/241142/iconoclast"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571438349,"creation_date":1571433679,"question_id":58458364,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458364","body_markdown":"I have a shell function (which I use in Zsh, but it should work in Bash) that highlights matching text in output, so I can quickly find things.\r\n\r\n    function highlight() {\r\n      perl -pe &quot;s/$1/\\e[1;31;43m$&amp;\\e[0m/g&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is very handy, but it only works with a single argument.

been stuck on this project for the better part of the week and while I have been grinding through syntax errors.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the project is to read through the headers and stopping at a certain column and finding certain characteristics like the min, max and average of the column. However, I am having a tough time with memory allocation for this job. I have been unable to further my code so far because I keep getting an error labeled `Segmentation Fault: 11`.\r\n\r\nThe bolded section is what I have narrowed the problem down to. I know there is a memory problem but I cannot see why fgets is not reading in the first line of the file from within the function. The file does not return NULL either and is able to be accessed. Dynamic arrays are an option but I am a beginner and very unfamiliar with them. \r\n\r\n```c\r\n\r\ndouble getMin(char csvfile[], char column[])\r\n{\r\n    int counter= 0;\r\n    int counter2= 0;\r\n

We are able to display the message. We should be able to expand the notifications (like how we can expand in Android phone) as per Kindle documentation &quot;You can expand notifications with two lines at the bottom to view more content and actions. Swipe down with two fingers or pinch outward to expand.&quot; But we are unable to do that. Below is the Android code we used to display the notification.\r\n\r\n    Notification notificationBuilder = new Notification.Builder(this)\r\n                    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.cast_ic_notification_0)\r\n                    .setContentTitle(notificationTitle)\r\n                    .setContentText(notificationMsg)\r\n                    .setAutoCancel(true)\r\n                    .setLargeIcon(bitmap)\r\n                    .setStyle(new Notification.BigPictureStyle().bigPicture(bitmap))\r\n                    .setContentIntent(pendingIntent)\r\n                    .build();\r\n    \r\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {\r\n        NotificationChannel channel = new NotificationChannel(channelId,\r\n              &quot;Channel human readable title&quot;,\r\n               NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH);\r\n               notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    Random rand = new Random();\r\n    int notification_ID = rand.nextInt();\r\n    notificationManager.notify(notification_ID /* ID of notification */, notificationBuilder);\r\n\r\nUsing this code, always first notification in the notification manager is getting displayed in big view and remaining notifications are in small view. But as per the requirements we need to display all the notifications in small view by default and when user tries to expand, it should be displayed in big view in all the device types we support (Android, Kindle, IOS). We are unable to do that. First notification is always getting displayed as big view, remaining notifications as small and we can&#39;t expand the smaller notifications to see the big view. When we dismiss the first one, second notification is getting displayed as big view without user expanding it. Can anyone please help us to solve below queries.\r\n\r\n 1. Is it possible to expand the notifications by user on kindle? \r\n 2. If we display the big view, can we hide the Large Icon through code? (Because we have large Icon and big view image are same. So if we are displaying the big view, we need to hide the large Icon and we are unable to do that)\r\n 3.

So the reader has to use the horizontal slider, in which case it is not possible to simultaneously see both the end of a long code line and the shorter code lines that follow. This makes it more difficult to find the bugs.\r\n\r\nThis being C++ hence object-oriented programming, we can delegate the decision of whether a character is part of the chosen ones to some ad hoc object, of say a _CharTester_ class. The `CharTester` object receives at creation time a string containing all &quot;chosen&quot; characters. This way, the algorithm that computes the requested numbers can be much shorter.\r\n\r\nThe CharTester object can delegate all the hard work to the string [find method](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/find).\r\n\r\nThe source code to create this auxiliary object would go for example like this:\r\n\r\n        static const char  EnglishConsonantList[] =\r\n            &quot;bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXZ&quot;;\r\n        CharTester  cht(EnglishConsonantList);\r\n\r\nA nice thing with the above coding style is that, if some official Grammatical Committee decides that from now on, Y will be a consonant instead of a vowel, the required changes in your source code are minimal. And your teacher is possibly not above saying such as &#171; _Now that you&#39;ve done it for consonants, please do it for vowels._ &#187; - this in order to force you to realize how flexible your source code exactly is. \r\n\r\n\r\nThus we are lead to the following code, where the most interesting piece is the `goodCharCounts()` function, which returns an `std::vector` object containing the requested numbers.\r\n\r\n    \r\n    #include  &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    #include  &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include  &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    \r\n    using  std::string;\r\n    using  std::cout;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class CharTester {\r\n    public:\r\n        CharTester(const string&amp; list) : goodCharList(list)\r\n        {};\r\n        bool isGoodChar(char ch) const;\r\n    \r\n    private:\r\n        string  goodCharList;    // list of &quot;chosen&quot; characters\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    bool CharTester::isGoodChar(char ch) const\r\n    {\r\n        // hard work there:\r\n        bool isGood = (goodCharList.find(ch) != string::npos);\r\n    \r\n        return isGood;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    // THE ALGORITHM:\r\n    \r\n    std::vector&lt;int&gt;  goodCharCounts(const CharTester&amp; cht, const std::string&amp; str)\r\n    {\r\n        std::vector&lt;int&gt;  posVec;\r\n    \r\n        int  counter = 0;\r\n        // loop on all characters of the input string\r\n        for (char ch : str) {\r\n            bool isGood = cht.isGoodChar(ch);\r\n    \r\n            if (isGood) {\r\n                counter++;\r\n            }\r\n            else if (counter &gt; 0) {\r\n                // end of current &quot;chosen&quot; group, so must register it\r\n                posVec.push_back(counter);\r\n                counter = 0;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        if (counter &gt; 0) {\r\n            // register last &quot;chosen&quot; group\r\n            posVec.push_back(counter);\r\n            counter = 0;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return  posVec;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe can test the algorithm by adding the following main program:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    // test one string and print the results:\r\n    void doUnitTest(const CharTester&amp; cht, const string&amp; str)\r\n    {\r\n        std::vector&lt;int&gt;  counts = goodCharCounts(cht, str);\r\n    \r\n        cout &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; &quot; --&gt; &quot;;\r\n        // loop on all numbers:\r\n        for (int n : counts) {\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39;;\r\n        }\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    // possible lists of &quot;chosen&quot; characters :\r\n    \r\n    //-- const wchar_t FrenchVowelList[]      = L&quot;AEIOUY&#192;&#194;&#201;&#202;&#200;&#207;&#212;&#219;&#217;aeiouy&#224;&#226;&#233;&#234;&#232;&#239;&#244;&#251;&#249;&quot;;\r\n    //-- const wchar_t RussianVowelList[]     = L&quot;АЕИОЭЙЫЮЯЁУаеиоэйыюяёу&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    static const char  EnglishVowelList[] =  &quot;aeiouyAEIOUY&quot;;\r\n    static const char  EnglishConsonantList[] =\r\n        &quot;bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXZ&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        CharTester  cht(EnglishConsonantList);  \r\n    \r\n        doUnitTest(cht, &quot;computers&quot;);\r\n        doUnitTest(cht, &quot;Some computers are cheap.
