Everything else is unspecified. From the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary) (emphasis added): \r\n\r\n&gt; The order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is **stable between mutations** but is otherwise unpredictable.\r\n\r\n*Note:* This applies only to printing/enumerating the dictionary *within a single program run.* As @matt said, the order is randomized on each program run. And this is because the [`Hasher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hasher) is randomized:\r\n\r\n&gt; Do not save or otherwise reuse hash values across executions of your program. Hasher is usually randomly seeded, which means it will return different values on every new execution of your program. The hash algorithm implemented by Hasher may itself change between any two versions of the standard library.\r\n\r\n\r\nHash randomization was enforced in Swift 4.2, with the implementation of [SE 0206 Hashable Enhancements](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0206-hashable-enhancements.md):\r\n\r\n&gt; To implement nondeterminism, Hasher uses an internal seed value initialized by the runtime during process startup. The seed is usually produced by a random number generator, but this may be disabled by defining the SWIFT_DETERMINISTIC_HASHING environment variable with a value of 1 prior to starting a Swift process.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431186/does-a-swift-dictionary-preserve-same-order-if-content-is-not-changed-regardless/58431387#58431387","title":"Does a Swift Dictionary preserve same order if content is not changed regardless the number of runs?"}],"owner":{"reputation":18418,"user_id":1084174,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsASP.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sazzad Hissain Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1084174/sazzad-hissain-khan"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58431387,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571314026,"creation_date":1571310465,"question_id":58431186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431186","body_markdown":"According to the question answered in [here][1]\r\n\r\n&gt;A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in an collection with no defined ordering.\r\n\r\nThus,\r\n\r\n    //First Attempt\r\n    var dict : Dictionary = [&quot;name1&quot; : &quot;Loy&quot;, &quot;name2&quot; : &quot;Roy&quot;]\r\n            println(dict)\r\n    \r\n    //output:\r\n    [name2: Roy, name1: Loy]\r\n    \r\n    //Second Attempt\r\n    var dict : Dictionary = [&quot;name2&quot; : &quot;Loy&quot;, &quot;name1&quot; : &quot;Roy&quot;]\r\n            println(dict)\r\n    \r\n    //output:\r\n    [name2: Loy, name1: Roy]\r\n\r\n\r\n**My question is,**\r\n\r\nIs it guaranteed that if the content of the Dictionary is not changed the order will remain same?\r\n\r\nFor example for above example, First Attempt always returns the same order whatever the number of runs?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29603477/1084174","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431186/does-a-swift-dictionary-preserve-same-order-if-content-is-not-changed-regardless","title":"Does a Swift Dictionary preserve same order if content is not changed regardless the number of runs?"},{"tags":["node.js","mongodb"],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":7102721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf0546d23ce232f850fc3253e5c55bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"test team","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7102721/test-team"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571310455,"creation_date":1571310455,"question_id":58431183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431183","body_markdown":"I am creating a social web using Node js and mongoDB.

I have try to do this process on a Coroutine but the same happens.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431182/detect-changes-on-a-mesh-in-unity","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"Detect Changes on a mesh in Unity"},{"tags":["r","dplyr"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4332,"user_id":10994855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJZpB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Humpelstielzchen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10994855/humpelstielzchen"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571310925,"post_id":58431181,"comment_id":103203192,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431181/what-causes-a-longer-object-length-is-not-a-multiple-of-shorter-object-length#comment103203192_58431181"},{"owner":{"reputation":11785,"user_id":7727429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dXTYc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrew Gustar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7727429/andrew-gustar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310994,"post_id":58431181,"comment_id":103203235,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431181/what-causes-a-longer-object-length-is-not-a-multiple-of-shorter-object-length#comment103203235_58431181"},{"owner":{"reputation":1767,"user_id":1908650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f316929a9cb85ac26281f87cae2f56f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mohan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1908650/mohan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4332,"user_id":10994855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJZpB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Humpelstielzchen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10994855/humpelstielzchen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571311138,"post_id":58431181,"comment_id":103203314,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431181/what-causes-a-longer-object-length-is-not-a-multiple-of-shorter-object-length#comment103203314_58431181"},{"owner":{"reputation":1767,"user_id":1908650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f316929a9cb85ac26281f87cae2f56f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mohan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1908650/mohan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11785,"user_id":7727429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dXTYc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrew Gustar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7727429/andrew-gustar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571311154,"post_id":58431181,"comment_id":103203319,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431181/what-causes-a-longer-object-length-is-not-a-multiple-of-shorter-object-length#comment103203319_58431181"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4332,"user_id":10994855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJZpB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Humpelstielzchen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10994855/humpelstielzchen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4332,"user_id":10994855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJZpB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Humpelstielzchen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10994855/humpelstielzchen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571311776,"last_edit_date":1571311776,"creation_date":1571311385,"answer_id":58431481,"question_id":58431181,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58431481","body_markdown":"`dplyr` thinks columnwise not rowwise.

Yeah, you can&#39;t do that with a `const` variable. Use `var timer = ...` instead of `const timer = ...`\r\n 2. `document.getElementById(&#39;input&#39;).value`. Open up your browsers inspector (something like ctrl+shift+I in firefox, or just right mouse click on your webpage and than &#39;Inspect ...&#39;). You will see in the Console tab that there is no such element with that ID: input. Change your `&lt;input ...` tag to `&lt;input id=&#39;input&#39; ...` to make that work.\r\n 3. Same as the above error, my inspection window&#39;s console says: `ReferenceError: selectInput is not defined`. You use `selectInput` in `timer = selectInput`, but it hasn&#39;t been defined yet. Yeah well, it is defined in your eventlistener for the button, but that&#39;s a local scope. Outside of that scope, it is not defined. So to solve this, you can define `selectInput` at top of your code:\r\n ```\r\n    ...\r\n    const remain = document.createElement(&#39;p&#39;);\r\n    var selectInput;\r\n    document.body.appendChild(remain);\r\n    const startGame = button.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        selectInput = document.getElementById(&#39;input&#39;).value;     // We don&#39;t need to define it here again, because we want to use the outer scope variable of selectInput\r\n        remain.textContent = `${selectInput} Seconds Left`;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var timer = selectInput;\r\n    ...\r\n ```\r\n 4. Next console error gives us: `ReferenceError: countUp is not defined`. I think you meant: `setInterval(() =&gt; {` instead of `countUp(() =&gt; {`.\r\n 5. Your countdown is wrong: `remain.textContent = &#39;${selectInput} Seconds Left&#39;;` (replace &#39; with backticks, but I don&#39;t know how to escape them in StackOverflows markdown language). You are here trying to show the value of `selectInput`, but that value will always be the same. I think you want to show the value of `timer`, because that&#39;s the one you are decrementing, just the row before!\r\n 6. The next thing that will happen is that this value will be NaN... Also, you&#39;re timer already starts counting, even when the button isn&#39;t pressed. To solve this, move the `const time = setInterval(() =&gt; {....})` function inside the eventhandler of the button. Do the same with the `if (selectInput === &quot;&quot;) {...}` part. Those are all code that must only be executed afther the button is pressed.\r\n\r\nSo your final code will look like this, if you&#39;ve listened to my previous points:\r\n```\r\n    const button = document.getElementById(&quot;btn&quot;);\r\n    const remain = document.createElement(&#39;p&#39;);\r\n    var selectInput;\r\n    document.body.appendChild(remain);\r\n    const startGame = button.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        selectInput = document.getElementById(&#39;input&#39;).value;\r\n        remain.textContent = `${selectInput} Seconds Left`;\r\n\r\n        var timer = selectInput;\r\n        const time = setInterval(() =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(time);\r\n            timer -= 1;\r\n            remain.textContent = `${timer} Seconds Left`;\r\n            if (timer === 0) {\r\n                clearInterval(time);\r\n                remain.textContent = &#39;The end game&#39;;\r\n            }\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n\r\n        if (selectInput === &quot;&quot;) {\r\n            clearInterval(time);\r\n            remain.textContent = &#39;enter in second&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd your HTML:\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt; presser&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;input id=&quot;input&quot; type=&quot;number&quot; placeholder=&quot;Set Seconds&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;button id=&quot;btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;click&quot;&gt;Start!&lt;/button&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;amitie.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s working, but the code is not pretty. A lot more improvements can be done, but if I&#39;m going to improve it all, than you won&#39;t recognize our own code and what you did wrong. For your goal now, it&#39;s working. \r\n\r\nTry to follow some coding tutorials for JavaScript.

needs to be a result of an operation involving `params`. You can&#39;t compute a gradient just knowing the values of two tensors. You need to know the relationship as well. This is why pytorch builds a computation graph when you perform tensor operations. For example, say the relationship is\r\n\r\n    cost = torch.sum(params)\r\n\r\nthen we would expect the gradient of `cost` with respect to `params` to be a vector of ones regardless of the value of `params`.\r\n\r\nThat could be computed as follows. Notice that you need to add the `requires_grad` flag to indicate to pytorch that you want `backward` to update the gradient when called.\r\n\r\n    # Initialize independent variable. Make sure to set requires_grad=true.\r\n    params = torch.tensor((1, 73, 240), requires_grad=True)\r\n\r\n    # Compute cost, this implicitly builds a computation graph which records\r\n    # how cost was computed with respect to params.\r\n    cost = torch.sum(params)\r\n\r\n    # Zero the gradient of params in case it already has something in it.\r\n    # This step is optional in this example but good to do in practice to\r\n    # ensure you&#39;re not adding gradients to existing gradients.\r\n    if params.grad is not None:\r\n        params.grad.zero_()\r\n\r\n    # Perform back propagation. This is where the gradient is actually\r\n    # computed. It also resets the computation graph.\r\n    cost.backward()\r\n\r\n    # The gradient of params w.r.t to cost is now stored in params.grad.\r\n    print(params.grad)\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n    tensor([1., 1., 1.])","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431156/compute-gradient-between-a-scalar-and-vector-in-pytorch/58439319#58439319","title":"Compute gradient between a scalar and vector in PyTorch"}],"owner":{"reputation":947,"user_id":2402501,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zOXsA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bryce Ramgovind","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2402501/bryce-ramgovind"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571341309,"creation_date":1571310345,"question_id":58431156,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431156","body_markdown":"I am trying to replicate code which was written using Theano, to PyTorch.

Two things come to mind:\r\n\r\nFirstly: I don&#39;t know if wordpress defines `valuemoney_format`, the default php-provided function is [`money_format`][1].  \r\nSecondly: you have to make sure that the locale you want to set via `set_locale` is defined on the machine.  You can check that with executing `locale -a | grep LOCALE` in a terminal and checking the output list.\r\n\r\nIn my case, `en_GB` is /not/ defined, but `en_GB.utf8` is.\r\n\r\nExample `psysh`-Session:\r\n\r\n````\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; function format_value_money($value){\r\n        return money_format(&#39;%i&#39;, $value) . &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; setlocale(LC_ALL, &#39;en_GB&#39;);\r\n=&gt; false\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; setlocale(LC_ALL, &#39;en_GB.utf8&#39;);\r\n=&gt; &quot;en_GB.utf8&quot;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; format_value_money(1000);\r\n=&gt; &quot;GBP1,000.00\\n&quot;\r\n````\r\n\r\nCheck for the locale:\r\n````\r\n❯ locale -a | grep en_GB\r\nen_GB.utf8\r\n````\r\nFurther question: Are you sure about `%i`?  That&#39;s the international format, resulting in the GBP prefix in the example above.  If you use `%n` instead, the in the UK more accepted and expected `&quot;&#163;1,000.00\\n&quot;` would be the formatted value.\r\n\r\nAddendum: If you need to create a locale, this is how:\r\n````\r\n&gt; sudo locale-gen en_GB\r\n&gt; sudo update-locale\r\n````\r\n\r\n  [1]:

But now it stays disabled.

Add `&lt;ExcludeFromSingleFile&gt;true&lt;/ExcludeFromSingleFile&gt;` to the `App1.config` file to keep it out of the bundle. \r\n2. Manually add a `MyApp.exe.config` file with the production settings and add `&lt;CopyToPublishDirectory&gt;Always&lt;/CopyToPublishDirectory&gt;` to have it published to the `Publish` directory. Transformations won&#39;t run, so make sure it contains everything that&#39;s needed.\r\n3. Finally load the file explicitly to avoid a bug in the application&#39;s base path resolution\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar hostFile=Path.GetDirectoryName(Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName);\r\nConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(hostFile+&quot;.config&quot;);\r\n```\r\nTo load the published file, as if it were any other file\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3, even for Windows Forms, doesn&#39;t use `app.config`. .NET Core&#39;s configuration system is described in [Configuration in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) and despite the name, applies to every .NET Core application. It&#39;s far more powerful too, loading configuration from multiple sources, including files (even INI), databases, Azure or AWS setting stores etc.\r\n\r\nAdding an `Application Configuration File` to a new Windows Forms project, both in VS 2019 and the command line creates an `App1.config` file with no special meaning as far as VS or .NET Core are concerned. Creating an `AppName.exe.config` requires actually creating a new `AppName.exe.config` file with the production settings.\r\n\r\nThe only way to read an Old-style `.config` file is to explicitly load it with [ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.configurationmanager.openexeconfiguration?view=netframework-4.8#System_Configuration_ConfigurationManager_OpenExeConfiguration_System_String_). This simply loads the file and parses it. One could pass any file path, or specify a ConfigurationUserLevel which simply resolves to a file location based on the executable&#39;s base directory. \r\n\r\n*And here&#39;s where the trouble starts. There&#39;s [a bug.*](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/7491)\r\n\r\nWith Single-file executables, all files are bundled in a single host file with the `.exe` extension. When that file runs for the first time, it unpacks its contents to `AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\`, in a new folder named for the application. [By design](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/686205657ace53b3e6d568cb098be302f6974956/accepted/single-file/design.md), the application&#39;s base directory should be the *host&#39;s* path, where the single .exe is. Unfortunately, [there&#39;s a bug](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/7491) and the base directory remains the location of the bundle and the `.dll` that&#39;s actually run by the host.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why \r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(System.Configuration.ConfigurationUserLevel.None).FilePath \r\n``` \r\n\r\nreturns `C:\\Users\\myUser~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\ConsoleApp_NetCore\\nk5sdmz5.ym1\\ConsoleApp_NetCore.dll.config` and I&#39;d bet `AppContext.BaseDirectory` returns `C:\\Users\\myUser~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\ConsoleApp_NetCore\\nk5sdmz5.ym1\\`\r\n\r\nThe *workaround* for this is to retrieve the host&#39;s path and load the settings file explicitly. This means we can now use any file name. If we keep the old convention of naming the file `appname.exe.config`, we can just append `.config` to the host&#39;s full path:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar hostFile=Path.GetDirectoryName(Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName);\r\nConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(hostFile+&quot;.config&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\n This has to be done with the .NET Core File provider too.

UPDATE accounts\r\n       SET balance = balance + 1000\r\n     WHERE account_no = 200;\r\n     \r\n    INSERT INTO account_changes(account_no,flag,amount,changed_at) \r\n    VALUES(100,&#39;-&#39;,1000,datetime(&#39;now&#39;));\r\n     \r\n    INSERT INTO account_changes(account_no,flag,amount,changed_at) \r\n    VALUES(200,&#39;+&#39;,1000,datetime(&#39;now&#39;));\r\n     \r\n    COMMIT;*\r\n\r\nI want to do above in C/C++ program using C/C++ APIs of sqlite\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431083/is-there-any-sqlite-api-c-api-alternative-to-begin-transaction-and-commit","title":"Is there any sqlite API (C API) alternative to

See an example below:\r\n```js\r\nfunction runScraper() {\r\n  var resultRange = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getRange(&quot;B1:B260&quot;);\r\n  var urlRange = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getRange(&quot;A1:A260&quot;);\r\n  for (var i=1; i&lt;=urlRange.getHeight(); i++) {\r\n    var currentValue = resultRange.getCell(i, 1).getValue();\r\n    if (currentValue !== &quot;&quot;) continue;\r\n    \r\n    var url = urlRange.getCell(i, 1).getValue();\r\n    var result = scrape(url);\r\n    resultRange.getCell(i, 1).setValue(result);\r\n    Utilities.sleep(10000);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for implementing the `scrape(url)` function, the implementation depends on which API are you using and what is the data transport format used (JSON, XML...). For that I recommend you check the following links:\r\n\r\n+ **URLFetchApp.fetch()**: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app#fetch(String,Object)\r\n+ **XMLService**: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/xml-service\r\n+ **Working with external APIs**: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/external\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nGoogle Apps Scripts have a maximum runtime of [6 minutes](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas#current_limitations). If you wait 10 seconds for each call and issue a total of 260 calls, the maximum runtime will be exceeded. For that, in the code above I implemented  a check that will verify that the row that is working on has not been scraped yet. If it has already been scraped, it will just go straight to the next one. That will allow you to easily re-run the script and continue from the point it last stopped (due to timeout).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431056/how-to-create-a-function-sleepmiliseconds-in-a-google-sheet-to-delay-or-pause/58434227#58434227","title":"How to create a function sleep(miliseconds) in a google sheet to delay or pause a formula in a range"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":2070334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/o91i1.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ilia Eframovicht","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2070334/ilia-eframovicht"},"last_editor":{"reputation":617,"user_id":12152337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0a63fcf6cc90b9937ef23d7dcc88829?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carlesgg97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152337/carlesgg97"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571323211,"creation_date":1571310015,"last_edit_date":1571323211,"question_id":58431056,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431056","body_markdown":"In a google sheet I have:\r\n\r\n`Range B1:B260`\r\n\r\n\r\nI have the Function:\r\n```\r\n(ImportXML(A1;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n(ImportXML(A2;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n(ImportXML(A3;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n(ImportXML(A260;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI Need to delay the time between the calculation because If I perform this simultaneously, I Will Get `#REF!` because limits in APIs and `=ImportXML()`\r\n\r\nIt will be fine if I delay 10 seconds per cell calculation\r\n\r\nI tried creating a `=LEN()` function to only perform the calculation in a cell just if the number of characters is bigger than X...

\r\nWhat are the differences in functionality and intended usage between `TcpListener.AcceptSocket(Async)` and `TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient(Async)`? Specifically, is `NetworkStream` of particular note?\r\n\r\n**Full detail and background**\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to get to grips with the .NET socket functionality in order to write a server which maintains persistent TCP-IP connections for 2-way communication with multiple clients over a pre-defined protocol.\r\n\r\nInitially Google led me to [MS&#39; Asynchronous Socket Example][1], which is heavily featured in SO questions on the topic.\r\n\r\nDigging deeper into questions and answers, I saw people recommend using `TcpClient` / `TcpListener` over `Socket`.\r\n\r\nNow `TcpListener` has (blocking and asynchronous versions of) two methods: `AcceptSocket`\r\n and `AcceptTcpClient`. MS&#39; documentation briefly suggests the latter is simpler and the former gives more control but doesn&#39;t explain why or how. I can see from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23852969/accepttcpclient-vs-acceptsocket and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/685995/tcpclient-vs-socket-in-c-sharp the latter gives access to a `NetworkStream` via `TcpClient` while the former exposes `Send` / `Receive` methods on `Socket` but that doesn&#39;t really explain why one is preferred.\r\n\r\nSo what are the differences and how should one choose which to use? Are there use-cases each is designed for? Why do both exist?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/asynchronous-server-socket-example\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431004/when-should-tcplistener-acceptsocket-be-preferred-over-tcplistener-accepttcpclie","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"When should TcpListener.AcceptSocket be preferred over TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient?"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-mvc","asp.net-web-api"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":5334191,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gaZ2GJ9PG1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARM/81w9_b_schg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"yob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5334191/yob"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310007,"post_id":58431003,"comment_id":103202647,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431003/how-to-return-badrequest-with-object#comment103202647_58431003"},{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":8994637,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c158af99f83e9e7603f81d06e25260ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Satheesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8994637/satheesh"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":117,"user_id":5334191,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gaZ2GJ9PG1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARM/81w9_b_schg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"yob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5334191/yob"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310335,"post_id":58431003,"comment_id":103202844,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431003/how-to-return-badrequest-with-object#comment103202844_58431003"},{"owner":{"reputation":141442,"user_id":5233410,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ehMg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nkosi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5233410/nkosi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310742,"post_id":58431003,"comment_id":103203081,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431003/how-to-return-badrequest-with-object#comment103203081_58431003"},{"owner":{"reputation":117,"user_id":5334191,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gaZ2GJ9PG1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARM/81w9_b_schg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"yob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5334191/yob"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571316263,"post_id":58431003,"comment_id":103206371,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431003/how-to-return-badrequest-with-object#comment103206371_58431003"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9661,"user_id":581076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQGy0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tymtam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/581076/tymtam"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571310192,"creation_date":1571310192,"answer_id":58431115,"question_id":58431003,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58431115","body_markdown":"Here is one way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nResponse.StatusCode = 400;\r\nreturn Content(&quot;Something here&quot;);\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431003/how-to-return-badrequest-with-object/58431115#58431115","title":"How to Return BadRequest with Object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":8994637,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c158af99f83e9e7603f81d06e25260ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Satheesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8994637/satheesh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15231,"user_id":1220550,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1osH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1220550/peter-b"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571310695,"accepted_answer_id":58431115,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571310393,"creation_date":1571309838,"last_edit_date":1571310393,"question_id":58431003,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431003","body_markdown":"In my api reponse i need to return BadRequest Response with Object which is given by user.

The rules are as follows:  \r\n\r\nTwo nodes are compatible if either the `f-mkt` of one node is different from all those of another node `picks` or if they are the same for at least one, then its `pick` should also be the same with that of the other node. For example in the graph below, node 1 has one `f-mkt` of `125*41` which is also found in node 3, however since its pick `123*41*2` is also the same as that in node 3, they are compatible.  \r\nHowever node 2 and node 3 are not compatible because, there is a `f-mkt` of `124*40` in both, but the `pick 123*40*1` in node 2 is not found in node 3, making them incompatible. So the max combined `pot` of the graph is max of(node 1 + node 2, node 1 + node 3), which in this case is 50 + 90 = 130.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the combined `pot` of the graph is taking the maximum of

connected subgraph, and enforcing the rules above in that subgraph before taking the sum of the subgraph&#39;s `pot`s, then the maximum of all subgraphs. \r\n\r\nTo achieve that, I need to have to do comparisons as described above, but I can&#39;t even get the below simple test to work:\r\n1\r\n`g.V(1).as(&#39;v&#39;).map{out().where(values(&#39;f-mkt&#39;).is(within(it.get().value(&#39;f-mkt&#39;))))}`\r\n\r\ni get this as response:\r\n\r\n`[VertexStep(OUT,vertex), TraversalFilterStep([PropertiesStep([f-mkt],value), IsStep(within([123*41]))])]`\r\n\r\nSo how do I dynamically pass that value from the parent node to the where step?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431002/using-a-parent-vertex-property-to-filter-out-going-vertices","title":"Using a parent vertex property to filter out going

So I&#39;m assuming there must  be a way to achieve nested JSON in the API.\r\n\r\nThis is what I want to achieve:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;Apps&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;ItemID&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;AppReport&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports&quot;: [\r\n                    {\r\n                        &quot;Reports_ItemID&quot;: &quot;11&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Reports_Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport/SubReport&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Reports_Name&quot;: &quot;SubReport&quot;\r\n                    },\r\n                    {\r\n                        &quot;Reports_ItemID&quot;: &quot;12&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Reports_Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport/SubReport2&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Reports_Name&quot;: &quot;SubReport2&quot;\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;ItemID&quot;: &quot;2&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport2&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;AppReport2&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports&quot;: [\r\n                    {\r\n                        &quot;Reports_ItemID&quot;: &quot;22&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Reports_Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport/SubReport&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Reports_Name&quot;: &quot;SubReport&quot;\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment it&#39;s coming out as a flat `Array` of `Objects`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;Apps&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;ItemID&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;AppReport&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports_ItemID&quot;: &quot;11&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports_Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport/SubReport&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports_Name&quot;: &quot;SubReport&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;ItemID&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;AppReport&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports_ItemID&quot;: &quot;12&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports_Path&quot;: &quot;/AppReport/SubReport2&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Reports_Name&quot;: &quot;SubReport2&quot;\r\n            },\r\n\r\n            ...\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a class of the Stored Procedure in the API that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n    namespace API.Stored_Procedures\r\n    {\r\n        public partial class SP_GetApps\r\n        {\r\n            public System.Guid ItemID { get;

In fact, in the end, you are just sending a byte array. The other options get converted to bytes before sending.\r\n\r\nA string is converted to bytes by transforming it into bytes using utf-8 (or some other encoding specified by the content-type header).\r\n\r\nA map of string to string is encoded to first as `x-www-form-urlencoded` and then to bytes. That encoding can, of course, only encode strings.\r\n\r\nSo the answer to your question really depends on where/how the server expects to receive the fields. If it&#39;s expecting them in a form, then it&#39;s your responsibility to convert, say, a boolean into whatever string the server expects. Maybe that&#39;s &#39;true&#39;/&#39;false&#39; or &#39;1&#39;/&#39;0&#39; or something else. Make your map like this:\r\n\r\n    int someInt;\r\n    bool someBool;\r\n    var formData = &lt;String, String&gt;{\r\n      &#39;an_int_value&#39; : someInt.toString(),\r\n      &#39;a_bool_value&#39; : someBool.toString(), // assuming &#39;true&#39;/&#39;false&#39; is OK\r\n    };\r\n\r\nAlso consider the possibility that your server requires a completely different encoding, like JSON. Then you would convert your map to JSON, then pass that as a string, setting the content-type appropriately.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431209/how-to-send-boolean-value-or-int-value-in-a-http-request-body/58437509#58437509","title":"How to send boolean value or int value in a http request body?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":10829101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eNjsK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mohamed Adel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10829101/mohamed-adel"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571337561,"creation_date":1571337561,"answer_id":58438889,"question_id":58431209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58438889","body_markdown":"**Try this approach which I use in my projects** \r\n\r\n      void apiPost(){\r\n    \r\n        var body = jsonEncode(\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;string&quot;:&quot;test&quot;,\r\n              &quot;bool&quot;:true,\r\n              &quot;int&quot;:1\r\n            });\r\n    \r\n        http.post(&quot;url here&quot;,body: body,headers: {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;}).then((response) {\r\n          Map map = json.decode(response.body);\r\n        });\r\n      }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431209/how-to-send-boolean-value-or-int-value-in-a-http-request-body/58438889#58438889","title":"How to send boolean value or int value in a http request body?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12053772,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cfb4dbcfff277246d8c8cca5628641d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mohit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12053772/mohit"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58437509,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571370003,"creation_date":1571310545,"last_edit_date":1571370003,"question_id":58431209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431209","body_markdown":"How to send a boolean value or an integer in http request body in dart?

From the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary) (emphasis added): \r\n\r\n&gt; The order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is **stable between mutations** but is otherwise unpredictable.\r\n\r\n*Note:* This applies only to printing/enumerating the dictionary *within a single program run.* As @matt said, the order is randomized on each program run. And this is because the [`Hasher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hasher) is randomized:\r\n\r\n&gt; Do not save or otherwise reuse hash values across executions of your program. Hasher is usually randomly seeded, which means it will return different values on every new execution of your program.

The seed is usually produced by a random number generator, but this may be disabled by defining the SWIFT_DETERMINISTIC_HASHING environment variable with a value of 1 prior to starting a Swift process.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431186/does-a-swift-dictionary-preserve-same-order-if-content-is-not-changed-regardless/58431387#58431387","title":"Does a Swift Dictionary preserve same order if content is not changed regardless the number of runs?"}],"owner":{"reputation":18418,"user_id":1084174,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsASP.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sazzad Hissain Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1084174/sazzad-hissain-khan"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58431387,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571314026,"creation_date":1571310465,"question_id":58431186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431186","body_markdown":"According to the question answered in [here][1]\r\n\r\n&gt;A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in an collection with no defined ordering.\r\n\r\nThus,\r\n\r\n    //First Attempt\r\n    var dict : Dictionary = [&quot;name1&quot; : &quot;Loy&quot;, &quot;name2&quot; : &quot;Roy&quot;]\r\n            println(dict)\r\n    \r\n    //output:\r\n    [name2: Roy, name1: Loy]\r\n    \r\n    //Second Attempt\r\n    var dict : Dictionary = [&quot;name2&quot; : &quot;Loy&quot;, &quot;name1&quot; : &quot;Roy&quot;]\r\n            println(dict)\r\n    \r\n    //output:\r\n    [name2: Loy, name1: Roy]\r\n\r\n\r\n**My question is,**\r\n\r\nIs it guaranteed that if the content of the Dictionary is not changed the order will remain same?\r\n\r\nFor example for above example, First Attempt always returns the same order whatever the number of runs?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29603477/1084174","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431186/does-a-swift-dictionary-preserve-same-order-if-content-is-not-changed-regardless","title":"Does a Swift Dictionary preserve same order if content is not changed regardless the number of runs?"},{"tags":["node.js","mongodb"],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":7102721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf0546d23ce232f850fc3253e5c55bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"test team","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7102721/test-team"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571310455,"creation_date":1571310455,"question_id":58431183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431183","body_markdown":"I am creating a social web using Node js and mongoDB.

Yeah, you can&#39;t do that with a `const` variable. Use `var timer = ...` instead of `const timer = ...`\r\n 2. `document.getElementById(&#39;input&#39;).value`. Open up your browsers inspector (something like ctrl+shift+I in firefox, or just right mouse click on your webpage and than &#39;Inspect ...&#39;). You will see in the Console tab that there is no such element with that ID: input. Change your `&lt;input ...` tag to `&lt;input id=&#39;input&#39; ...` to make that work.\r\n 3. Same as the above error, my inspection window&#39;s console says: `ReferenceError: selectInput is not defined`. You use `selectInput` in `timer = selectInput`, but it hasn&#39;t been defined yet. Yeah well, it is defined in your eventlistener for the button, but that&#39;s a local scope. Outside of that scope, it is not defined. So to solve this, you can define `selectInput` at top of your code:\r\n ```\r\n    ...\r\n    const remain = document.createElement(&#39;p&#39;);\r\n    var selectInput;\r\n    document.body.appendChild(remain);\r\n    const startGame = button.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        selectInput = document.getElementById(&#39;input&#39;).value;     // We don&#39;t need to define it here again, because we want to use the outer scope variable of selectInput\r\n        remain.textContent = `${selectInput} Seconds Left`;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var timer = selectInput;\r\n    ...\r\n ```\r\n 4. Next console error gives us: `ReferenceError: countUp is not defined`. I think you meant: `setInterval(() =&gt; {` instead of `countUp(() =&gt; {`.\r\n 5. Your countdown is wrong: `remain.textContent = &#39;${selectInput} Seconds Left&#39;;` (replace &#39; with backticks, but I don&#39;t know how to escape them in StackOverflows markdown language). You are here trying to show the value of `selectInput`, but that value will always be the same. I think you want to show the value of `timer`, because that&#39;s the one you are decrementing, just the row before!\r\n 6. The next thing that will happen is that this value will be NaN... Also, you&#39;re timer already starts counting, even when the button isn&#39;t pressed. To solve this, move the `const time = setInterval(() =&gt; {....})` function inside the eventhandler of the button. Do the same with the `if (selectInput === &quot;&quot;) {...}` part. Those are all code that must only be executed afther the button is pressed.\r\n\r\nSo your final code will look like this, if you&#39;ve listened to my previous points:\r\n```\r\n    const button = document.getElementById(&quot;btn&quot;);\r\n    const remain = document.createElement(&#39;p&#39;);\r\n    var selectInput;\r\n    document.body.appendChild(remain);\r\n    const startGame = button.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        selectInput = document.getElementById(&#39;input&#39;).value;\r\n        remain.textContent = `${selectInput} Seconds Left`;\r\n\r\n        var timer = selectInput;\r\n        const time = setInterval(() =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(time);\r\n            timer -= 1;\r\n            remain.textContent = `${timer} Seconds Left`;\r\n            if (timer === 0) {\r\n                clearInterval(time);\r\n                remain.textContent = &#39;The end game&#39;;\r\n            }\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n\r\n        if (selectInput === &quot;&quot;) {\r\n            clearInterval(time);\r\n            remain.textContent = &#39;enter in second&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd your HTML:\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt; presser&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;input id=&quot;input&quot; type=&quot;number&quot; placeholder=&quot;Set Seconds&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;button id=&quot;btn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;click&quot;&gt;Start!&lt;/button&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;amitie.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s working, but the code is not pretty. A lot more improvements can be done, but if I&#39;m going to improve it all, than you won&#39;t recognize our own code and what you did wrong. For your goal now, it&#39;s working. \r\n\r\nTry to follow some coding tutorials for JavaScript.

needs to be a result of an operation involving `params`. You can&#39;t compute a gradient just knowing the values of two tensors. You need to know the relationship as well. This is why pytorch builds a computation graph when you perform tensor operations. For example, say the relationship is\r\n\r\n    cost = torch.sum(params)\r\n\r\nthen we would expect the gradient of `cost` with respect to `params` to be a vector of ones regardless of the value of `params`.\r\n\r\nThat could be computed as follows. Notice that you need to add the `requires_grad` flag to indicate to pytorch that you want `backward` to update the gradient when called.\r\n\r\n    # Initialize independent variable. Make sure to set requires_grad=true.\r\n    params = torch.tensor((1, 73, 240), requires_grad=True)\r\n\r\n    # Compute cost, this implicitly builds a computation graph which records\r\n    # how cost was computed with respect to params.\r\n    cost = torch.sum(params)\r\n\r\n    # Zero the gradient of params in case it already has something in it.\r\n    # This step is optional in this example but good to do in practice to\r\n    # ensure you&#39;re not adding gradients to existing gradients.\r\n    if params.grad is not None:\r\n        params.grad.zero_()\r\n\r\n    # Perform back propagation. This is where the gradient is actually\r\n    # computed.

Two things come to mind:\r\n\r\nFirstly: I don&#39;t know if wordpress defines `valuemoney_format`, the default php-provided function is [`money_format`][1].  \r\nSecondly: you have to make sure that the locale you want to set via `set_locale` is defined on the machine.  You can check that with executing `locale -a | grep LOCALE` in a terminal and checking the output list.\r\n\r\nIn my case, `en_GB` is /not/ defined, but `en_GB.utf8` is.\r\n\r\nExample `psysh`-Session:\r\n\r\n````\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; function format_value_money($value){\r\n        return money_format(&#39;%i&#39;, $value) . &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; setlocale(LC_ALL, &#39;en_GB&#39;);\r\n=&gt; false\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; setlocale(LC_ALL, &#39;en_GB.utf8&#39;);\r\n=&gt; &quot;en_GB.utf8&quot;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; format_value_money(1000);\r\n=&gt; &quot;GBP1,000.00\\n&quot;\r\n````\r\n\r\nCheck for the locale:\r\n````\r\n❯ locale -a | grep en_GB\r\nen_GB.utf8\r\n````\r\nFurther question: Are you sure about `%i`?  That&#39;s the international format, resulting in the GBP prefix in the example above.  If you use `%n` instead, the in the UK more accepted and expected `&quot;&#163;1,000.00\\n&quot;` would be the formatted value.\r\n\r\nAddendum: If you need to create a locale, this is how:\r\n````\r\n&gt; sudo locale-gen en_GB\r\n&gt; sudo update-locale\r\n````\r\n\r\n  [1]:

But now it stays disabled.

Add `&lt;ExcludeFromSingleFile&gt;true&lt;/ExcludeFromSingleFile&gt;` to the `App1.config` file to keep it out of the bundle. \r\n2. Manually add a `MyApp.exe.config` file with the production settings and add `&lt;CopyToPublishDirectory&gt;Always&lt;/CopyToPublishDirectory&gt;` to have it published to the `Publish` directory. Transformations won&#39;t run, so make sure it contains everything that&#39;s needed.\r\n3. Finally load the file explicitly to avoid a bug in the application&#39;s base path resolution\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar hostFile=Path.GetDirectoryName(Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName);\r\nConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(hostFile+&quot;.config&quot;);\r\n```\r\nTo load the published file, as if it were any other file\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3, even for Windows Forms, doesn&#39;t use `app.config`. .NET Core&#39;s configuration system is described in [Configuration in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) and despite the name, applies to every .NET Core application. It&#39;s far more powerful too, loading configuration from multiple sources, including files (even INI), databases, Azure or AWS setting stores etc.\r\n\r\nAdding an `Application Configuration File` to a new Windows Forms project, both in VS 2019 and the command line creates an `App1.config` file with no special meaning as far as VS or .NET Core are concerned. Creating an `AppName.exe.config` requires actually creating a new `AppName.exe.config` file with the production settings.\r\n\r\nThe only way to read an Old-style `.config` file is to explicitly load it with [ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.configurationmanager.openexeconfiguration?view=netframework-4.8#System_Configuration_ConfigurationManager_OpenExeConfiguration_System_String_). This simply loads the file and parses it. One could pass any file path, or specify a ConfigurationUserLevel which simply resolves to a file location based on the executable&#39;s base directory. \r\n\r\n*And here&#39;s where the trouble starts. There&#39;s [a bug.*](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/7491)\r\n\r\nWith Single-file executables, all files are bundled in a single host file with the `.exe` extension. When that file runs for the first time, it unpacks its contents to `AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\`, in a new folder named for the application. [By design](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/686205657ace53b3e6d568cb098be302f6974956/accepted/single-file/design.md), the application&#39;s base directory should be the *host&#39;s* path, where the single .exe is. Unfortunately, [there&#39;s a bug](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/7491) and the base directory remains the location of the bundle and the `.dll` that&#39;s actually run by the host.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why \r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(System.Configuration.ConfigurationUserLevel.None).FilePath \r\n``` \r\n\r\nreturns `C:\\Users\\myUser~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\ConsoleApp_NetCore\\nk5sdmz5.ym1\\ConsoleApp_NetCore.dll.config` and I&#39;d bet `AppContext.BaseDirectory` returns `C:\\Users\\myUser~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\ConsoleApp_NetCore\\nk5sdmz5.ym1\\`\r\n\r\nThe *workaround* for this is to retrieve the host&#39;s path and load the settings file explicitly. This means we can now use any file name. If we keep the old convention of naming the file `appname.exe.config`, we can just append `.config` to the host&#39;s full path:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar hostFile=Path.GetDirectoryName(Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName);\r\nConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(hostFile+&quot;.config&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\n This has to be done with the .NET Core File provider too.

UPDATE accounts\r\n       SET balance = balance + 1000\r\n     WHERE account_no = 200;\r\n     \r\n    INSERT INTO account_changes(account_no,flag,amount,changed_at) \r\n    VALUES(100,&#39;-&#39;,1000,datetime(&#39;now&#39;));\r\n     \r\n    INSERT INTO account_changes(account_no,flag,amount,changed_at) \r\n    VALUES(200,&#39;+&#39;,1000,datetime(&#39;now&#39;));\r\n     \r\n    COMMIT;*\r\n\r\nI want to do above in C/C++ program using C/C++ APIs of sqlite\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431083/is-there-any-sqlite-api-c-api-alternative-to-begin-transaction-and-commit","title":"Is there any sqlite API (C API) alternative to

See an example below:\r\n```js\r\nfunction runScraper() {\r\n  var resultRange = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getRange(&quot;B1:B260&quot;);\r\n  var urlRange = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getRange(&quot;A1:A260&quot;);\r\n  for (var i=1; i&lt;=urlRange.getHeight(); i++) {\r\n    var currentValue = resultRange.getCell(i, 1).getValue();\r\n    if (currentValue !== &quot;&quot;) continue;\r\n    \r\n    var url = urlRange.getCell(i, 1).getValue();\r\n    var result = scrape(url);\r\n    resultRange.getCell(i, 1).setValue(result);\r\n    Utilities.sleep(10000);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for implementing the `scrape(url)` function, the implementation depends on which API are you using and what is the data transport format used (JSON, XML...). For that I recommend you check the following links:\r\n\r\n+ **URLFetchApp.fetch()**: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app#fetch(String,Object)\r\n+ **XMLService**: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/xml-service\r\n+ **Working with external APIs**: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/external\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nGoogle Apps Scripts have a maximum runtime of [6 minutes](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas#current_limitations). If you wait 10 seconds for each call and issue a total of 260 calls, the maximum runtime will be exceeded. For that, in the code above I implemented  a check that will verify that the row that is working on has not been scraped yet. If it has already been scraped, it will just go straight to the next one. That will allow you to easily re-run the script and continue from the point it last stopped (due to timeout).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58431056/how-to-create-a-function-sleepmiliseconds-in-a-google-sheet-to-delay-or-pause/58434227#58434227","title":"How to create a function sleep(miliseconds) in a google sheet to delay or pause a formula in a range"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":2070334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/o91i1.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ilia Eframovicht","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2070334/ilia-eframovicht"},"last_editor":{"reputation":617,"user_id":12152337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0a63fcf6cc90b9937ef23d7dcc88829?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carlesgg97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152337/carlesgg97"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571323211,"creation_date":1571310015,"last_edit_date":1571323211,"question_id":58431056,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58431056","body_markdown":"In a google sheet I have:\r\n\r\n`Range B1:B260`\r\n\r\n\r\nI have the Function:\r\n```\r\n(ImportXML(A1;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n(ImportXML(A2;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n(ImportXML(A3;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n(ImportXML(A260;&quot;//a/@href&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI Need to delay the time between the calculation because If I perform this simultaneously, I Will Get `#REF!` because limits in APIs and `=ImportXML()`\r\n\r\nIt will be fine if I delay 10 seconds per cell calculation\r\n\r\nI tried creating a `=LEN()` function to only perform the calculation in a cell just if the number of characters is bigger than X...
