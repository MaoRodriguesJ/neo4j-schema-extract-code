But two non-atomic RMWs could step on each other so don&#39;t work &quot;as-if&quot; the C++ abstract machine was running the source code, so it&#39;s not an option for the compiler to emit asm that does that.\r\n\r\nBut if the compiler knows an object is always written, it can pretty much do whatever it wants because a legal program can&#39;t observe the difference: that would involve data-race UB.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n&gt; A little more specifically, could the processor speculatively execute the write (when the condition will eventually evaluate to false), another thread observe the write as having occurred, and then the first thread discarding the speculative write?\r\n\r\n**No, speculation doesn&#39;t escape the core doing the speculation.**  Otherwise when mis-speculation is detected, all cores would have to roll back their state!\r\n\r\nThis is one of the primary reasons for store buffers existing: to decouple OoO speculative *execution* of stores from *commit* to L1d cache (which is when the store becomes globally visible to other cores).  And to decouple execution from cache-miss stores which is useful even on in-order non-speculative CPUs.\r\n\r\n**Stores don&#39;t commit to L1d until after the store instruction has retired from the out-of-order core (i.e. is known to be non-speculative)**.  Retired stores that haven&#39;t committed yet are sometimes called &quot;graduated&quot; to distinguish them from other store-buffer entries that could potentially be discarded if the core needs to roll back to retirement state.\r\n\r\n**This allows hardware speculative execution without inventing writes.**\r\n\r\n(see also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54876208/size-of-store-buffers-on-intel-hardware-what-exactly-is-a-store-buffer for more details.  Fun fact: some CPUs, specifically PowerPC, can do store-forwarding of graduated stores between SMT threads on the same physical core, making stores visible to some cores before they become *globally* visible.  But only for graduated stores, otherwise possible mis-speculation could leak out.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn C++, a `std::mo_release` store forces the compiler to use sufficient barriers or release-store instructions (e.g. a normal `mov` on x86 is a release-store, or `stlr` on AArch64 is a sequential-release store).  Or whatever other mechanism to make sure the asm guarantees runtime ordering *at least* as strong as the C++ abstract machine guarantees.\r\n\r\nC++ defines its standard in terms of sequenced-before / after, not barriers, but on any given platform implementations / the ABI standardize on some mapping from std::atomic operations to asm sequences.

Therefore it does not matter at all if the server is in your control. You could only be sure that no man in the middle attacks occur if everything between client and server would be in your control too.

As you can tell I&#39;m quite new to all this stuff so please be gentle with my ignorance!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/AaronLiddiment\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937496/c-arduino-how-to-reference-a-global-from-inside-a-class","title":"C++/Arduino How to reference a global from inside a class"},{"tags":["terraform","terragrunt"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13715,"user_id":281848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w7nJW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Atkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/281848/martin-atkins"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568741314,"creation_date":1568741314,"answer_id":57979293,"question_id":57937493,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57979293","body_markdown":"Terraform does not allow varying module sources like this because module installation happens during `terraform init` and thus must make all of its decisions statically before evaluating the main code, similarly to how dependency installation works in many other languages.\r\n\r\nA different way to meet your goal of giving the production automation a different view of modules than other callers (such as developers) is to use Terraform&#39;s native module registry mechanism and its associated service discovery protocol.\r\n\r\nTo do this requires running a service that implements [the registry protocol](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/api.html), which is essentially just an extra level of indirection over module sources that allows them to be decided by the remote server rather than hard-coded in the configuration. If you have your module registry running at `terraform.example.com` then your module source strings might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule &quot;s3_module&quot; {\r\n  source = &quot;terraform.example.com/any-namespace/s3/aws&quot;\r\n\r\n  bucket_name = &quot;thereoncewasakingguardinghisgardenallalone&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe registry protocol can return module source addresses of any type that Terraform supports, including `git::` for git repositories. Therefore you could set up the registry so that the above module address leads to a normal Git repository so that it&#39;s convenient for developers.\r\n\r\nBy default, Terraform will use [its service discovery protocol](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/remote-service-discovery.html) to find the location of the registry API for `terraform.example.com`. You should set up the main service discovery document to refer to the registry that would be used outside of production, in order to avoid the need for manual configuration on each developer&#39;s system.\r\n\r\nIn your production system -- where presumably Terraform is running in some sort of automation -- you can use a [CLI Configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/cli-config.html) setting to override the discovery of `terraform.example.com` to point to a different registry API that is more appropriate for your production environment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Note that this goes in the _CLI configuration_, which is *not* the\r\n# same thing as the .tf files that describe your infrastructure.\r\n\r\nhost &quot;terraform.example.com&quot; {\r\n  services = {\r\n    &quot;modules.v1&quot; = &quot;https://production-terraform.example.com/modules/&quot;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that CLI configuration in place, Terraform will interpret `terraform.example.com` differently and use this other registry API instead, where you can potentially arrange for it to select only packaged modules in an AWS S3 bucket, or whatever other constraint seems appropriate for production.\r\n\r\nTerraform Cloud and Enterprise have a built-in private module registry, but you can deploy anything that talks the same protocol on your own infrastructure and use it instead if you set up the service discovery protocol correctly. HashiCorp doesn&#39;t have an official private registry you can run yourself, but there are some community implementations of the protocol and the most important parts of the protocol (listing available versions and finding a download URL) are simple enough that they can be backed by a static website served from AWS S3, or similar.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937493/is-it-possible-to-to-variableize-the-source-path-for-a-module-in-terraform/57979293#57979293","title":"Is it possible to to &quot;variableize&quot; the source path for a module in Terraform?"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8353770,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6f3495847ad0a93f36d63c400b2d0d6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kilmore","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8353770/kilmore"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568741314,"creation_date":1568479730,"question_id":57937493,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57937493","body_markdown":"Is it possible to use a variable for the module source in Terraform or Terragrunt.

between user control (ex: Plans ==&gt; Create) the main view (GridMain)  is empty again (due to GridMain.Clear() method).\r\n\r\nThe thing I want is that the view is still there when I do the switching.\r\nI&#39;m still new to WPF and it&#39;s difficult to follow MVVM patterns so I just try simple methods. \r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

The problem is, that large amount of them rely to be called in specific order or at specific time to have correct data from other getters. Looks like vue dev tools is trying to access those values, calling the getters not in expected order so some values are not correct and the app is throwing errors. Because of this I cannot use the dev tools and cannot find a simple way around it.\r\nHere is simple snippet reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\nThis code will run just fine, but once you open dev tools, it tries to access the getter selselectedPrice which returns error until we have some data.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;

I don&#39;t want to scrape the information directly off the HTML in the website because it seems slow and inefficient, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to retrieve the raw data that the website retrieves before displaying it as HTML content. \r\n\r\nThe website will call something like `https://.../RetrieveReport`, and an HTML page will immediately be returned to the client side. I&#39;m wondering if there is any way to peer into the handler on the asp.net side to understand where it is getting the raw data from. Please let me know if this is possible. Thanks in advance :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937457/is-there-a-method-to-access-hidden-files-from-asp-net-server","title":"Is there a method to access hidden files from ASP.NET Server?"},{"tags":["angularjs","api","xmlhttprequest"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10056,"user_id":5640649,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab190da855988ffae29d287c7d55ebbe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lealceldeiro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5640649/lealceldeiro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568490006,"post_id":57937454,"comment_id":102292968,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937454/http-get-api-response-is-undefined-in-angularjs#comment102292968_57937454"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":5561325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W2FeMXTDqkM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/ns61vsAY91g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"nhuyngo nhuyngo95","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5561325/nhuyngo-nhuyngo95"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568516621,"post_id":57938829,"comment_id":102296634,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937454/http-get-api-response-is-undefined-in-angularjs/57938829#comment102296634_57938829"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":148517,"user_id":1175966,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d3d9dfbd040f9cbc1a6b82f0da2b345?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"charlietfl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1175966/charlietfl"},"last_editor":{"reputation":148517,"user_id":1175966,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d3d9dfbd040f9cbc1a6b82f0da2b345?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"charlietfl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1175966/charlietfl"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568504717,"last_edit_date":1568504717,"creation_date":1568491157,"answer_id":57938829,"question_id":57937454,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938829","body_markdown":"Your service code has two returns so what is actually getting returned is the `$http` promise not the `deferred.promise`.\r\n\r\nSo currently in the service `then()` nothing is returned and thus you get  `undefined`  in the controller `then()`\r\n\r\nTry changing it to:\r\n\r\n    var getApproval = function (employee) {   \r\n        // return $http promise\r\n        return $http({\r\n            method: &#39;GET&#39;,\r\n            url: ICLAIM_DOMAIN + &#39;/api/approval-chain/get-matrix?username=&#39;

When that happens you&#39;ll be able to do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#![feature(trait_alias)]\r\n\r\ntrait X = Fn(u32) -&gt; u32;\r\n\r\nfn f() -&gt; impl X {\r\n    |x: u32| x\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[(playground)][2]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlternatively, when [Permit impl Trait in type aliases][3] lands, you&#39;ll be able to make `impl trait` a *type* alias. This is slightly different though. When we alias with `type X = impl Trait`, the compiler will ensure that every usage of `X` is actually the same concrete type. That would mean that, in your case, you wouldn&#39;t be able to use this with multiple different closures, since every closure has its own unique type.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]\r\n\r\ntype X = impl Fn(u32) -&gt; u32;\r\n\r\nfn f() -&gt; X {\r\n    |x: u32| x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[(playground)][4]\r\n\r\nHowever, this *won&#39;t compile*.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]\r\n\r\ntype X = impl Fn(u32) -&gt; u32;\r\n\r\nfn f() -&gt; X {\r\n    |x: u32| x\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Even a closure with exactly the same form has a different type.\r\nfn g() -&gt; X {\r\n    |x: u32| x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: concrete type differs from previous defining opaque type use\r\n  --&gt; src/lib.rs:10:1\r\n   |\r\n10 | / fn g() -&gt; X {\r\n11 | |     |x: u32| x\r\n12 | | }\r\n   | |_^ expected `[closure@src/lib.rs:7:5: 7:15]`, got `[closure@src/lib.rs:11:5: 11:15]`\r\n   |\r\nnote: previous use here\r\n  --&gt; src/lib.rs:6:1\r\n   |\r\n6  | / fn f() -&gt; X {\r\n7  | |     |x: u32| x\r\n8  | | }\r\n   | |_^\r\n```\r\n\r\n[(playground)][5]\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to trait aliases, which would allow a different concrete type to be used with every function returning `impl TraitAlias`. See the RFCs that introduced [this syntax][6] and [existential types in general][7] for more.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUntil one of those two features lands, you can get similar behavior to the trait alias with what is essentially a hack.

This way, I could control the rotations, etc. with just surrounding each with a transform widget. But, I would like to create something more open. I mean, I would like to have a widget I could configure with a number of rings, pass the arcs that contains and angles and later be able to use something like: widget.rotateRing(0, 90&#186;). And let the widget take care of everything.\r\n\r\nIs there any way of doing this in flutter without having a mega spagetti of animcontrolers, widgets and canvas?

For example, the following works in FiPy,\r\n```\r\nfrom fipy import Grid1D, CellVariable, Viewer\r\nfrom fipy import TransientTerm, numerix, DiffusionTerm\r\nfrom fipy import LinearLUSolver\r\n\r\nm = Grid1D(nx=100, Lx=numerix.pi / 4.)\r\n\r\nv = CellVariable(mesh=m)\r\nv[:] = m.x**2\r\n\r\neqn = TransientTerm() == DiffusionTerm(numerix.sin(m.x))\r\nvi = Viewer(v, colorbar=None)\r\nvi.plot()\r\nsolver = LinearLUSolver()\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    eqn.solve(v, dt=0.1, solver=solver)\r\n    vi.plot()\r\n    print(&#39;step&#39;, i)\r\n\r\ninput(&#39;stopped&#39;)\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn the above, the diffusion coefficient is a function of space. The `m.x` is a `CellVariable` that holds the cell center positions. `numerix` is used which enables operations on FiPy variables in the same way as Numpy does for Numpy arrays.\r\n\r\nNow, in the above question there is a `sin(x)` outside of the derivative which is not allowed in FiPy. Everything needs to fit inside of the derivative to work with FiPy. So, we need to rewrite the term so that all the coefficients are inside of the derivative.

The closest thing that I found was on the [FAQ][1], where they suggest rewriting additional terms as a `ConvectionTerm`. However, I believe this only applies to the case where the additional terms are functions of the solution variable rather than the independent variable. For example, I am trying to solve a 1D diffusion equation with the following diffusion term (where derivatives are w.r.t. to the independent variable x, and y is the solution variable):\r\n\r\n    D * sin(x) * Div_x {sin(x) * Grad_x {y}}\r\n\r\nI feel that this is a pretty simple expression, but I can&#39;t find how to express it in FiPy notation.

For example a little program that would close X first amount of taskbar items, starting from the right\r\n\r\n• Shutting down all instances with a batch or the like, however, I would then have to reopen demos, which would be fine if not for situations where they&#39;d have lots of trades pending, where shutting them down, could end up having unintended consequences\r\n\r\n**Thing I have tried:**\r\n\r\nUsing a program like Unlocker, to attempt shutting down the instances, by selecting the folders within which the terminals are in. This however didn’t work, as the .exes are buried deep within other subfolders, so I can’t just select multiple terminal folders inside of “C:\\Program Files (x86)”  and kill the processes\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n• All instances are called terminal.exe inside of Task Manager\r\n\r\n• Any other types of solutions are much welcome\r\n\r\n[![Terminals, accessed from a remote

A bit-vector is simply a sequence of bits, without any attached semantics as to how to treat it as a number.\r\n\r\nIt is the operations, however, that distinguish signedness. This is why you have `bvslt` and `bvult`; for signed and unsigned less-than comparison, for instance. You might want to read the logic description here: http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/theories-FixedSizeBitVectors.shtml\r\n\r\nLong story short, all the solver is telling you is that the result contains these bits; how you interpret that as an unsigned word or a signed 2&#39;s complement number is totally up to you. Note that this perfectly matches how machine arithmetic is done in hardware, where you simply have registers that contain bit-sequences. It&#39;s the instructions that treat the values according to whatever convention they might choose to do so.\r\n\r\nI hope that&#39;s clear; feel free to ask about a specific case; posting full programs is always helpful as well, so long as they abstract away from details and describe what you&#39;re trying to do.\r\n\r\nAlso see this earlier question that goes into a bit more detail: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838424/how-to-model-signed-integer-with-bitvector\r\n\r\nAvoiding overflow/underflow\r\n---------------------------\r\nYou *can* ask z3 to avoid overflow/underflow during bit-vector arithmetic. However, this will require adding extra assertions for each operation you want to perform, so it can get rather messy. (Also, looks like you want to use Klee; I&#39;m not sure if Klee allows you to do this to start with.) The technique is explained in detail in this paper: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/z3prefix.pdf\r\n\r\nIn particular, you want to read through Section 5.1: Authors describe how to &quot;annotate&quot; each arithmetic operation and assert that it does not overflow explicitly. For instance, if you want to make sure addition doesn&#39;t overflow; you first zero-extend your bit-vectors from 32-bits to 33-bits; do the addition, and check if the 33-bit of the result is `1`. To avoid overflow, you simply write an assertion saying that bit cannot be `1`. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n; Two 32-bit variables\r\n(declare-fun x () (_ BitVec 32))\r\n(declare-fun y () (_ BitVec 32))\r\n\r\n; Zero-Extend them to 33-bits\r\n(define-fun x33 () (_ BitVec 33) (concat #b0 x))\r\n(define-fun y33 () (_ BitVec 33) (concat #b0 y))\r\n\r\n; Add them\r\n(define-fun  extendedAdd () (_ BitVec 33) (bvadd x33 y33))\r\n\r\n; Get the sign bit\r\n(define-fun signBit () (_ BitVec 1) ((_ extract 32 32) extendedAdd))\r\n\r\n; Assert that the addition won&#39;t overflow:\r\n(assert (= signBit #b0))\r\n\r\n; Regular addition result:\r\n(define-fun addResult () (_ BitVec 32) ((_ extract 31 0) extendedAdd))\r\n\r\n; Now you can use addResult as the result of x+y; and you&#39;ll\r\n; be assured that this addition will never overflow\r\n\r\n(check-sat)\r\n(get-model)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d also have to check for underflow at each operation. Further adding complexity. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, this can get very hairy and the rules for multiplication are actually quite tricky. To simplify this z3 actually provides built-in primitives for multiplication overflow-checking, called:\r\n\r\n- `bvsmul_noovfl`: True only if signed multiplication doesn&#39;t overflow\r\n- `bvsmul_noudfl`: True only if signed multiplication doesn&#39;t underflow\r\n- `bvumul_noovfl`: True only if unsigned multiplication doesn&#39;t overflow\r\n\r\nThere is no predicate for checking if an unsigned multiplication can underflow because that cannot happen. But the point remains: You have to annotate each operation and explicitly assert the relevant conditions. This is best done by a higher-level API during code generation, and some z3 bindings do support such operations. (For instance, see http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv-8.4/docs/Data-SBV-Tools-Overflow.html for how the Haskell layer on top of SMT-solvers handles this.) If you&#39;ll do this at scale, you probably want to build some mechanism that automatically generates for you as doing it manually would be extremely error-prone.\r\n\r\nOr you can switch and use `Int` type, which never overflows! But then, of course, you&#39;re no longer modeling an actual running program but reasoning about actual integer values; which might be acceptable depending on your problem domain.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937374/is-there-a-way-to-specify-the-the-domain-of-a-variable-when-defining-it-using-an/57937544#57937544","title":"Is there a way to specify the the domain of a variable when defining it using an array?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12067620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b06db79d0a5993de5a764aeb148cb28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tjfy1992","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067620/tjfy1992"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12067620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b06db79d0a5993de5a764aeb148cb28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tjfy1992","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067620/tjfy1992"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568566320,"creation_date":1568478680,"last_edit_date":1568515800,"question_id":57937374,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57937374","body_markdown":"My program reads the constraints from a smt2 file, and all the variables are defined as an array. For example\r\n```\r\n(declare-fun x () (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8) ) )\r\n(declare-fun y () (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8) ) )\r\n(assert (bvslt  (concat  (select  x (_ bv3 32) ) (concat  (select  x (_ bv2 32) ) (concat  (select  x (_ bv1 32) ) (select  x (_ bv0 32) ) ) ) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv3 32) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv2 32) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv1 32) ) (select  y (_ bv0 32) ) ) ) ) ) )\r\n(check-sat)\r\n(exit)\r\n```\r\nSome other constraints are omitted. Sometimes the solver gives a value of x as:\r\n```\r\n(store (store (store ((as const (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8))) #xfe)\r\n                     #x00000002\r\n                     #x00)\r\n              #x00000001\r\n              #xff)\r\n       #x00000003\r\n       #x80)\r\n```\r\nAccording to the definition, each element of the array is a hex value, so the value should be 0x8000fffe. This value is beyond the upper bounds of integer in C++. When I covert it back to int, it is a negative value. So I guess Z3 treats all variables defined by an array as unsigned int. \r\nFor example, if the constraint is x &gt; y, the solver may give\r\nx = 0x8000fffe\r\nand \r\ny = 0x00000001. The values satisfy the constraint in unsigned comparison, but when conducting a signed comparison, x is negative and y is positive so it is wrong. I am wondering if there is a way to tell the solver that the numbers are signed when defining them as an array?   \r\n\r\nAdded 22:26:43 09/14/2019\r\nI got two smt2 files, one is\r\n```\r\n(set-logic QF_AUFBV )\r\n(declare-fun x () (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8) ) )\r\n(declare-fun y () (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8) ) )\r\n(assert (bvslt  (concat  (select  x (_ bv3 32) ) (concat  (select  x (_ bv2 32) ) (concat  (select  x (_ bv1 32) ) (select  x (_ bv0 32) ) ) ) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv3 32) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv2 32) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv1 32) ) (select  y (_ bv0 32) ) ) ) ) ) )\r\n(check-sat)\r\n(exit)\r\n```\r\nThe constraint is simply x &lt; y.\r\nThe other one is\r\n```\r\n(set-logic QF_AUFBV )\r\n(declare-fun x () (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8) ) )\r\n(declare-fun y () (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8) ) )\r\n(assert (let ( (?B1 (concat  (select  y (_ bv3 32) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv2 32) ) (concat  (select  y (_ bv1 32) ) (select  y (_ bv0 32) ) ) ) ) ) (?B2 (concat  (select  x (_ bv3 32) ) (concat  (select  x (_ bv2 32) ) (concat  (select  x (_ bv1 32) ) (select  x (_ bv0 32) ) ) ) ) ) ) (let ( (?B3 (bvsub  ?B1 ?B2 ) ) ) (and  (and  (and  (and  (and  (=  false (=  (_ bv0 32) ?B2 ) ) (=  false (=  (_ bv0 32) ?B1 ) ) ) (=  false (bvslt  ?B1 ?B2 ) ) ) (=  false (=  (_ bv0 32) ?B3 ) ) ) (=  false (bvslt  ?B3 ?B2 ) ) ) (=  (_ bv0 32) (bvsub  ?B3 ?B2 ) ) ) ) ) )\r\n(check-sat)\r\n(exit)\r\n```\r\nwhich is \r\n```\r\n [(!

Converted to decimal, we have x=2147549180, and y=131068. So y-x-x is-4294967296, not decimal 0. The solver thinks it is satisfied bacause 4294967296 is \r\n```\r\n1 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\r\n```\r\nin binary, where the &quot;1&quot; is the 33rd bit, and will be removed. So -4294967296 is considered 0x00 in the memory. This is the reason I asked this question. X and y should be integers, so 0x8000fffe is -0x0000fffe, aka -65534. And y is 131068. And y-x-x is apparently not 0. So in terms of integer, the values don&#39;t satisfy the constraints. The expression y - x - x seems to be computed in unsigned rules.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937374/is-there-a-way-to-specify-the-the-domain-of-a-variable-when-defining-it-using-an","title":"Is there a way to specify the the domain of a variable when defining it using an array?"},{"tags":["c#"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":75060,"user_id":880990,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/123d02be3a4fb6074b72b7e28bc05bad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Olivier Jacot-Descombes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/880990/olivier-jacot-descombes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":75060,"user_id":880990,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/123d02be3a4fb6074b72b7e28bc05bad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Olivier Jacot-Descombes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/880990/olivier-jacot-descombes"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568577268,"last_edit_date":1568577268,"creation_date":1568479051,"answer_id":57937421,"question_id":57937373,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57937421","body_markdown":"Because the last condition `if (b * b - 4 * a * c &lt; 0)` has no else case and there is no return statement following it.\r\n\r\nThis condition might always true because of your logic, but C# doesn&#39;t know that.

These values will never be used. Better declare the variables where they are used (in the local code block) and initialize them directly with the right value. Their scope will be limited to this code block. This means that for instance `x1` does not exist after the first if-statement and will therefore never have an undetermined value.\r\n\r\n&quot;if x1 is less than x2&quot; sounds more natural than &quot;if x2 is greater than x1&quot;, since you want to know which one the smallest is.

The textarea input needs to be submitted to PHP on the server more or less simultaneously with its use by the local javascript. Ideally, both the javascript function and the $_POST submission to the server would be triggered by the same button click, but I have not been able to get this to work because use of the textarea input by the javascript function prevents it being submitted to the server and vice versa (both these actions need the same data apparently causing interference. I have successfully worked around this problem by triggering the DOM submit() to the server with an onmouseout attribute on the input button.\r\n\r\nThe problem I now have is that the page refreshes wiping away the input values when the textarea input is submitted to the server. I don&#39;t want this to happen: I want the selection from the dropdown list to remain selected, and the text that was input to the textarea to remain in the textarea to ramain after submission. I have tried with the elements inside FORM tags and outside - page gets refreshed wiping away the values either way. There are many similar questions and suggested solutions posted on StackExchange, but after spending many hours trying many of them, I have yet to find one that works for me. Basically, they fall into to categories: ones that prevent the submit such as preventDefault and return false, and ones that don&#39;t prevent the refresh or don&#39;t work at all such as various javascript/jquery submit methods. To me, such submit methods beg the question of how does the server know anything about the method used to send the submit (other than whether it is GET or POST)? Doesn&#39;t the php code on the server receive the same $_POST array regardless of the method used to send it? How would it know the difference between an html form submit, a DOM submit or a javascript/jquery submit? It is not surprising that they all trigger the same page refresh in response.\r\n\r\nIt seems like there surely should be some simple way to retain the form values after submit because surely there are many times one would want to do this.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am no fan of jquery, I found ajax to be much easier before jquery was created. That said, at this point I would appreciate anything that works.

In case of falling into swapping, the O/S orchestrated ( i.e. outside of your domain of control ) swap-flows come at costs ~ 1,000 x ~ 10,000 x worse ... and block by having top priority any other attempts to computate and read/write into RAM during that periods of time, so another reason no one would ever want these to ever happen during computing )&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\r\nUsing **`multiprocessing.get_all_start_methods()`** will show all the options the localhost O/S can provide for elimination ( small-scale mitigation ) of unwanted excessive RAM-allocations.\r\n\r\nUsing **`len( os.sched_getaffinity(0) )`** control instead of the `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` used above, will eliminate localhost over-subscribing the number of free-to-use CPU-cores ( also having less copies of &quot;just&quot;-`[CONCURRENT]`-RAM-copies, that have to wait its scheduler-ordered turn, before their RAM/CPU-execution gets turn... ), if O/S affinity-mapping policy restricts user-programs from using all the platforms indicated hardware cores.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe &quot;awful&quot; **`for`**-based &quot;outer&quot;-iterator may always get improved, yet the core strategy is more important:\r\n\r\nMay refactor the code into a [tag:distributed-system] computing :\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nA clean and performance focused [tag:distributed-system] computing approach may balance the real-world costs against the net-performance-gains one will enjoy, after spending such costs.\r\n\r\nMany &quot;syntax-in-mind&quot; approaches fail to scale well above some **principal** growing-sizes - first, by experiencing a Sin of Eviction from In-CACHE computing into  feeling the real costs-of-RAM ( which were not observed in schoolbook examples and demos ), next come the costs of In-RAM data-flow, for larger and larger data-sizes, last, but not least, come the costs of naive expectations from multiprocessing ( which, depending on O/S and version, may introduce generation add-on costs of allocating many full-python-session-replicas, that may crash the memory-error - as would in the posted case above )\r\n\r\nGiven 10 servers have 16 cores and 128 GB RAM each, the promising move in concept will test the sizing of the python-proces when computing the **`prestart()`** with data and next spawn not more &quot;workers&quot; inside a server than till they all fit into RAM ( to avoid swapping ), next create a messaging/signaling meta-layer to orchestrate smart parameter-passing of that many jobs across this pool-of-distributed workers, using any of the high-performance, low latency tool, like ZeroMQ or nanomsg are, and design the workflow so as you never pass a single piece of data twice ( as the add-on costs of parameter passing grows worse than O(n), due to system and O/S properties ), so never move a piece of data twice in a performance-motivated system.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nFollowing these few simple rules does not come cheap, yet there are no faster ways ( the less they come for free ... )\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937313/multiprocessing-pool-apply-async-eats-up-memory/57958514#57958514","title":"Multiprocessing pool.apply_async eats up memory"}],"owner":{"reputation":513,"user_id":969328,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bba8760290b8624d4b83c425599d6cbf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sliter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/969328/sliter"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21847,"user_id":3666197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79fc6c23061326c7e6a6f82a1663634b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user3666197","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3666197/user3666197"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568646570,"creation_date":1568478231,"last_edit_date":1568639718,"question_id":57937313,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57937313","body_markdown":"**Use case:**\r\n\r\n 1. 2 billion combinations of parameters to be processed with 10 servers(16 cores 128GB RAM)\r\n 2.
