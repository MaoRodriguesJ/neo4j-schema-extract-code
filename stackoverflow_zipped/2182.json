In this case the user is the service account.  Using scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file with a service account doesn&#39;t make much sense really as you the developer own the service account and there by own its drive account.  so really just give it full access using scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive there is no real reason for you to limit it.    If you had a normal application using Oauth2 you would only request the access you need to the users drive account.\r\n\r\n&gt;I need to be able to expand the service account&#39;s visibility to include files in at least 1 folder the user has not created. I can&#39;t get this through normal folder sharing as best I can tell.\r\n\r\nI am not sure i understand this.  Assuming that when you say &quot;user&quot; you mean the service account. I am going to assume this folder is part of your gsuite system.  In which case you simply need to have your Gsuite admin set up [domain wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-auth#perform_g_suite_domain-wide_delegation_of_authority) to the service account and it will have access.  This is a way of granting the service account permissions to access data on your gsuite account kind of like adding a new user to the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8UCL8.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021681/google-drive-api-granting-access-to-files-in-a-folder-to-service-account/58025221#58025221","title":"Google Drive API - Granting Access to Files in a Folder to Service Account"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12093498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pYPi5-c4PqY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdNyK8hyrjJMUC5ekTqmYHdWoNefg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Apexing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093498/apexing"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12093498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pYPi5-c4PqY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdNyK8hyrjJMUC5ekTqmYHdWoNefg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Apexing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093498/apexing"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569015965,"creation_date":1568952733,"last_edit_date":1569015965,"question_id":58021681,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021681","body_markdown":"I am using a service account to connect to the Google Drive of a G Suite.

import pandas as pd\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; data = {\r\n       &quot;ID1&quot;: [1, 2, 5, 1],\r\n       &quot;ID2&quot;: [1, 1, 3, 3],\r\n       &quot;ID3&quot;: [4, 3, 2, 4],\r\n       &quot;Visits&quot;: [500, 100, 200, 200],\r\n       &quot;Investment&quot;: [1000, 200, 400, 200]\r\n    }\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(data))\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df.show()\r\n\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+\r\n|ID1|ID2|ID3|Visits|Investment|\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+\r\n|  1|  1|  4|   500|      1000|\r\n|  2|  1|  3|   100|       200|\r\n|  5|  3|  2|   200|       400|\r\n|  1|  3|  4|   200|       200|\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce we have DataFrame that we can operate on we have to define a function which will return list of unique IDs from columns `ID1`, `ID2` and `ID3`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyspark.sql.functions as F\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, IntegerType\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; @F.udf(returnType=ArrayType(IntegerType()))\r\n... def ids_list(*cols):\r\n...    return list(set(cols))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it&#39;s time to apply our `udf` on a DataFrame.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df = df.withColumn(&#39;ids&#39;, ids_list(&#39;ID1&#39;, &#39;ID2&#39;, &#39;ID3&#39;))\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df.show()\r\n\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+---------+\r\n|ID1|ID2|ID3|Visits|Investment|      ids|\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+---------+\r\n|  1|  1|  4|   500|      1000|   [1, 4]|\r\n|  2|  1|  3|   100|       200|[1, 2, 3]|\r\n|  5|  3|  2|   200|       400|[2, 3, 5]|\r\n|  1|  3|  4|   200|       200|[1, 3, 4]|\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+---------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make use of `ids` column we have to explode it into separate rows and drop `ids` column.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df = df.withColumn(&quot;ID&quot;, F.explode(&#39;ids&#39;)).drop(&#39;ids&#39;)\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df.show()\r\n\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+---+\r\n|ID1|ID2|ID3|Visits|Investment| ID|\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+---+\r\n|  1|  1|  4|   500|      1000|  1|\r\n|  1|  1|  4|   500|      1000|  4|\r\n|  2|  1|  3|   100|       200|  1|\r\n|  2|  1|  3|   100|       200|  2|\r\n|  2|  1|  3|   100|       200|  3|\r\n|  5|  3|  2|   200|       400|  2|\r\n|  5|  3|  2|   200|       400|  3|\r\n|  5|  3|  2|   200|       400|  5|\r\n|  1|  3|  4|   200|       200|  1|\r\n|  1|  3|  4|   200|       200|  3|\r\n|  1|  3|  4|   200|       200|  4|\r\n+---+---+---+------+----------+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally we have to group our DataFrame by `ID` column and calculate sums.

If you&#39;re not familiar with template terminology, it might be better to learn templates before trying to understand that &quot;reference-collapsing context&quot;. Or maybe a brief run-down would be adequate. I&#39;ll err on the side of explaining things.\r\n\r\n&gt;     template&lt;typename T&gt;\r\n&gt;     class Widget {\r\n&gt;          typedef T&amp; LvalueRefType;\r\n&gt;          ...\r\n&gt;     };\r\n\r\nThis is a [class template](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template). It is a blueprint for defining classes, without actually defining one. Before using this blueprint, a type must be specified for use within the blueprint (represented by `T` in this example).\r\n\r\n&gt;     Widget&lt;int&amp;&gt; w;\r\n\r\nThis defines a variable (`w`) whose class is generated using the blueprint. Remember that the blueprint requires a type to be specified? This example specifies `int&amp;` as that type. Why `int&amp;`? _*shrug*_ It&#39;s the type Scott Meyers wants to use. Authors get to decide arbitrary things like that. Don&#39;t worry about it.\r\n\r\nSo what happens when you specify a type? The blueprint is copied, and substitutions are made in the copy. In this case, each instance of `T` is replaced by `int&amp;`, giving a specific class definition. This class definition is called an instantiated class named `Widget&lt;int&amp;&gt;`. You won&#39;t see this definition anywhere; it&#39;s something the compiler works out. However, if you&#39;re willing to be a bit lax with valid C++ syntax, the following suggests what the class definition would look like:\r\n\r\n    class Widget&lt;int&amp;&gt; {\r\n         typedef int&amp; &amp; LvalueRefType;\r\n         ...\r\n    };\r\n\r\nIn the `typedef` line, the `T` from the template was replaced by `int&amp;`. I also added a space after it to separate it from the ampersand that follows it (`T&amp;` and `T &amp;` mean the same thing). This brings us to the next line of code from the article:\r\n\r\n&gt;     typedef int&amp; &amp; LvalueRefType;\r\n\r\nLook familiar? The whole point of the setup was to get this weird-looking code that appears to make use of a reference to a reference (to an `int`). Now we get to reference-collapsing. You cannot take a reference to a reference, yet the language authors did not want to automatically invalidate this sort of template use. So there&#39;s a clause somewhere in the language specification that says that in this sort of situation, the compiler should adjust the instantiated class by getting rid of one of the ampersands in the troublesome line.\r\n\r\nWhen you remove an ampersand from the line we&#39;re dealing with, you get the final line of code you quoted. This is effectively what the compiler will use when it generates the definition of `Widget&lt;int&amp;&gt;`.\r\n\r\n&gt;     typedef int&amp; LvalueRefType;\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s a rather quick and incomplete look at templates, with just enough detail to (hopefully) make sense of that part of the article.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021648/how-are-these-codes-related-to-each-other/58036642#58036642","title":"How are these codes related to each other?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11959927,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1540d4e432fe3c327f46a91594f7a484?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rts2003","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11959927/rts2003"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569030030,"creation_date":1568952382,"question_id":58021648,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021648","body_markdown":"I am reading Scott Meyers&#39; [article](https://isocpp.org/blog/2012/11/universal-references-in-c11-scott-meyers) on universal references, and I don&#39;t quite get this part:\r\n&gt; A third reference-collapsing context is typedef formation and use.

I have a requirement to programatically DELETE and POST user accounts without any human interaction, it will run apart of a pipeline and use either an api key or some sort of secret to perform this\r\n\r\n1) i have created an API key in a google project with access to Admin SDK API. i have enabled API access as i am super user. i have enabled admin sdk api for project. still cannot even perfrom GET to retrieve a user information.\r\n2) i have created an OAuth 2.0 credential with both ID and secret - i cant figure out how to pass these credentials into a request i cant find documentation on how to use them either\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET \\\r\n&#39;https://www.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1/users/EXAMPLE@COMPANY.work?key=apiKeyWithAdminSdkPriviledge&#39; \\\r\n&gt;   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39;\r\n\r\nRESPONSE-\r\n{\r\n &quot;error&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;errors&quot;: [\r\n   {\r\n    &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;global&quot;,\r\n    &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;required&quot;,\r\n    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Login Required&quot;,\r\n    &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;header&quot;,\r\n    &quot;location&quot;: &quot;Authorization&quot;\r\n   }\r\n  ],\r\n  &quot;code&quot;: 401,\r\n  &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Login Required&quot;\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\ni expect that somehow i might have to return a session token and use that session token to GET, POST, DELETE etc, which is fine, but i just cannot find any documentation on how to do this. all i find from google are the commands which are barely helpful without showing you how to pass credentails","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021633/how-to-use-admin-sdk-and-authenticate-using-oauth2-0-via-curl-automation","title":"How to use admin.sdk and authenticate using OAuth2.0 via curl (automation)"},{"tags":["zsh"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2313,"user_id":5101148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc92fb51fd3b1f946847ccd36d63aee6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Simba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5101148/simba"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2313,"user_id":5101148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc92fb51fd3b1f946847ccd36d63aee6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Simba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5101148/simba"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569027019,"last_edit_date":1569027019,"creation_date":1568973470,"answer_id":58026062,"question_id":58021632,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58026062","body_markdown":"General solution: split with `IFS`.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nfunction lcontains() {\r\n  local IFS=&#39;:&#39;\r\n  local found=1  # 1=not found, 0=found\r\n  local e\r\n  for e in $(echo &quot;$1&quot;)\r\n  do\r\n    if [[ $2 == $e ]]\r\n    then\r\n      found=0\r\n      break\r\n    fi\r\n  done\r\n\r\n  return $found\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nZSH only solution: split by [Parameter Expansion Flag `s`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Parameter-Expansion-Flags)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nfunction lcontains() {\r\n  local found=1  # 1=not found, 0=found\r\n  local e\r\n  for e in &quot;${(@s#:#)1}&quot;\r\n  do\r\n    if [[ $2 == $e ]]\r\n    then\r\n      found=0\r\n      break\r\n    fi\r\n  done\r\n\r\n  return $found\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021632/how-to-add-a-dir-to-zsh-path/58026062#58026062","title":"How to add a dir to zsh PATH"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4906,"user_id":1934428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/072774c5d4204a1c2385560e6114a887?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1934428","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1934428/user1934428"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568990629,"creation_date":1568990629,"answer_id":58030599,"question_id":58021632,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58030599","body_markdown":"If you need splitting on space in zsh, you have to say this explicitly.

Just check if you are following all these.\r\n\r\nIf you have a new project and it does not have git initialized then do: -\r\n\r\n    git init\r\n\r\nthen whenever you do some changes in the project folder and save it just go back to git and do:-\r\n\r\n    git status\r\n\r\nif it shows some file names in red that means those files have been changed and now you need to stage the changes you want to commit.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to stage a single file then copy that file path shown in the bash window and do \r\n\r\n    git add &lt;file name&gt;\r\n\r\nor else if you want to stage all the changes then do \r\n\r\n    git add .\r\n\r\nnext step is to commit the staged changes to do that just write:-\r\n\r\n    git commit -m &quot;&lt;your commit message here&gt;&quot;\r\n\r\none shortcut method of staging all the files and commiting them is \r\n\r\n    git commit -am &quot;&lt;your commit message here&gt;&quot;\r\n\r\nonce you have commited the files just simply do \r\n\r\n    git push\r\n\r\nSome additional commands that are useful:-\r\n\r\n    git branch --- to know the current branch you are on\r\n    git checkout &lt;branchname&gt;  --- to switch to some other branch\r\n    git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt;  --- to create a new branch\r\n    git gc --prune=now  ---- to clear all the references\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021616/unable-to-add-files-due-to-git-due-to-a-checkout-issue/58022737#58022737","title":"Unable to add files due to git due to a checkout issue"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":10476299,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2159061721016701/picture?type=large","display_name":"Pratik Pathare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10476299/pratik-pathare"},"last_editor":{"reputation":900809,"user_id":6309,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7aa22372b695ed2b26052c340f9097eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VonC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6309/vonc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58022737,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568960236,"creation_date":1568952158,"last_edit_date":1568954675,"question_id":58021616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021616","body_markdown":"I am unable to add any files to git when I give command &#39;`git add .`&#39; in a Git bash session.  \r\nIt shows error:\r\n\r\n    &#39;EG&#39; does not have a commit checked out. \r\n     fatal : adding files failed.\r\n\r\nI am unable to do any operation in Git now.\r\n\r\nI tried all `git checkout` commands, deleted branches.  \r\nI even deleted git bash from my system. \r\n\r\nTried to search commits in Git GUI but there too I found nothing.  \r\nDid all this but to no success.

Got a weird problem in running gunicorn with supervisor to serve a flask application. Before I start stating my problem, just want to say that I&#39;m aware of [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26748015/configuring-gunicorn-no-application-module-specified). Nevertheless, my problem was that I could run gunicorn directly in the foreground to server the app. The problem only occurred when I used supervisor. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the structure of my flask application:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyproject/\r\n|---webapp/\r\n|   |---__init__.py    # create_app function is here\r\n|   |--- ...           # other files in webapp\r\n|---wsgi.py\r\n|---manage.py          \r\n|---venv               # gunicorn is in venv/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `wsgi.py` file looks like the following\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom webapp import create_app\r\n\r\napp = create_app()\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    app.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSitting in `myproject` directory, I can launch the app by running\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ venv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 wsgi:app\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I created a `webapp.conf` in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/` directory, as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[program:webapp]\r\ndirectory=/home/&lt;my username&gt;/projects/myproject\r\ncommand=/home/&lt;my username&gt;/projects/myproject/venv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 wsgi:app\r\nuser=&lt;my username&gt;\r\nautostart=true\r\nautorestart=true\r\nredirect_stderr=true\r\nstdout_logfile=&lt;some path&gt;\r\nstderr_logfile=&lt;some path&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I reloaded my `supervisor`, the stdout log file said\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: gunicorn [OPTIONS] [APP_MODULE] gunicorn: error: No application module specified.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is, why do I get an error here if I don&#39;t get an error when running gunicorn directly? What&#39;s the difference?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I then tried to use `systemd` to run the gunicorn following [this post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04), and `systemd` can launch the gunicorn service normally.\r\n\r\nAny idea what I did wrong with `supervisor`?

The preconfigured Windows environment locks down the operating system from administrative access, software installations, changes to the global assembly cache, and so on (see Operating system functionality on Azure App Service). If your application requires more access than the preconfigured environment allows, you can deploy a custom Windows container instead. \r\n\r\nSymbolic link creation: While sandboxed applications can follow/open existing symbolic links, they cannot create symbolic links (or any other reparse point) anywhere.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can check if the files has read-only attribute, to check for this, go to Kudu Console (({yoursite}.scm.azurewebsites.net)) and run attrib somefile.txt, and check if it includes the R (read-only) attribute.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021586/file-system-issue-in-azure-app-service-unable-to-create-directories/58029108#58029108","title":"File system issue in Azure app service - Unable to create Directories"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":752,"user_id":563928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d497d19ac0a5fd8d83923eb185c9d04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Arun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/563928/arun"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569238744,"creation_date":1569238744,"answer_id":58061665,"question_id":58021586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58061665","body_markdown":"I made some changes to my code based on what I read in these links here which gives a good summary of the storage system in Azure app service -\r\n\r\n - https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/benjaminperkins/2017/08/23/how-to-manually-create-a-directory-on-your-azure-app-service/\r\n - https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Understanding-the-Azure-App-Service-file-system\r\n\r\n`D:\\local` directory points to a folder that is accessible only to that instance of the service, instead of what I was using earlier which is shared among instances - `D:\\home`. \r\n\r\nSo I changed the code to resolve the `%Temp%` environment variable, which resolved to `D:\\local\\Temp` and then used that location to store the downloaded Emails.\r\n\r\nSo far multiple testing runs have been executed without any exceptions related to the file system.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021586/file-system-issue-in-azure-app-service-unable-to-create-directories/58061665#58061665","title":"File system issue in Azure app service - Unable to create Directories"}],"owner":{"reputation":752,"user_id":563928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d497d19ac0a5fd8d83923eb185c9d04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Arun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/563928/arun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569238744,"creation_date":1568951868,"last_edit_date":1568957296,"question_id":58021586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021586","body_markdown":"We have a dotnet core application hosted in Azure app service (Windows machine) in our production environment.

created an app using Expo, and when running on Android, `onPress` requires a long press to actually respond. It happens with `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableWithoutFeedback`, `TouchableNativeFeedback` from `react-native` and `Button` from `react-native-elements`. \r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t matter the type of action I perform when `onPress` is triggered; my app tries to `navigate`, but even a simple `alert` requires a long press. Below is the code of one of the components I use, including its style. Many answers in SO mention about positioning and zIndex, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be my problem.\r\n\r\n    &lt;TouchableOpacity\r\n                style={{\r\n                    width: &#39;15%&#39;,\r\n                    height: 100,\r\n                    color: &#39;white&#39;,\r\n                    borderTopWidth: 1,\r\n                    borderBottomWidth: 1,\r\n                    borderColor: &#39;#333333&#39;,\r\n                    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\r\n                    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\r\n                    flex: 1,\r\n                    flexDirection: &#39;column&#39;\r\n                }}\r\n                onPress={() =&gt; this.onMenuButtonClick(item)}&gt;\r\n                &lt;View&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Icon name={item.icon} color={item.colorIcon} /&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Text style={{ color: &#39;white&#39; }}&gt;{item.name}&lt;/Text&gt;\r\n                &lt;/View&gt;\r\n            &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\r\n\r\nThis happens only in Android, both on emulator and device. When deploying the app to iOS works fine.\r\n\r\nWeird thing is that the back arrow for the navigation component works fine, a simple press does the work, but any of the afore mentioned components I&#39;m using won&#39;t work when just pressed.\r\n\r\nAny clue?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an expo snack replicating the problem https://snack.expo.io/@pollirrata/cae485","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021581/onpress-responding-to-a-long-press-only","title":"onPress responding to a long press only"},{"tags":["scala","apache-spark","apache-spark-mllib","xgboost","json4s"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":12094369,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA6xey8wqMyO6hl27n62esV6_-XgUvJXgUwrWuieg=k-s128","display_name":"zhanwei lim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12094369/zhanwei-lim"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568967387,"creation_date":1568967387,"answer_id":58024468,"question_id":58021580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58024468","body_markdown":"Xgboost version 0.82 is not compatible with Spark 2.4.

I want it to already come **pre-hydrated** with the fetched data.\r\n\r\nFor reference, my Apollo initializations look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// apollo/with-data.js\r\n\r\nimport React from &quot;react&quot;;\r\nimport PropTypes from &quot;prop-types&quot;;\r\nimport { ApolloProvider, getDataFromTree } from &quot;react-apollo&quot;;\r\nimport initApollo from &quot;./init-apollo&quot;;\r\n\r\nexport default ComposedComponent =&gt; {\r\n  return class WithData extends React.Component {\r\n    static displayName = `WithData(${ComposedComponent.displayName})`;\r\n    static propTypes = {\r\n      serverState: PropTypes.object.isRequired\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\r\n      const headers = ctx.req ? ctx.req.headers : {};\r\n      let serverState = {};\r\n\r\n      // Evaluate the composed component&#39;s getInitialProps()\r\n      let composedInitialProps = {};\r\n      if (ComposedComponent.getInitialProps) {\r\n        composedInitialProps = await ComposedComponent.getInitialProps(ctx);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // Run all graphql queries in the component tree\r\n      // and extract the resulting data\r\n      if (!process.browser) {\r\n        const apollo = initApollo(headers);\r\n        // Provide the `url` prop data in case a graphql query uses it\r\n        const url = { query: ctx.query, pathname: ctx.pathname };\r\n\r\n        // Run all graphql queries\r\n        const app = (\r\n          &lt;ApolloProvider client={apollo}&gt;\r\n            &lt;ComposedComponent url={url} {...composedInitialProps} /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;\r\n        );\r\n        await getDataFromTree(app);\r\n\r\n        // Extract query data from the Apollo&#39;s store\r\n        const state = apollo.getInitialState();\r\n\r\n        serverState = {\r\n          apollo: {\r\n            // Make sure to only include Apollo&#39;s data state\r\n            data: state.data\r\n          }\r\n        };\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return {\r\n        serverState,\r\n        headers,\r\n        ...composedInitialProps\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n      super(props);\r\n      this.apollo = initApollo(this.props.headers, this.props.serverState);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;ApolloProvider client={this.apollo}&gt;\r\n          &lt;ComposedComponent {...this.props} /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// apollo/init-apollo.js\r\n\r\nimport { InMemoryCache } from &#39;apollo-cache-inmemory&#39;;\r\nimport { ApolloClient } from &#39;apollo-client&#39;;\r\nimport { ApolloLink } from &#39;apollo-link&#39;;\r\nimport { onError } from &#39;apollo-link-error&#39;;\r\nimport { HttpLink } from &#39;apollo-link-http&#39;;\r\nimport fetch from &#39;isomorphic-fetch&#39;;\r\n\r\nlet apolloClient = null;\r\n\r\n// Polyfill fetch() on the server (used by apollo-client)\r\nif (!process.browser) {\r\n  global.fetch = fetch;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst create = (headers, initialState) =&gt; new ApolloClient({\r\n  initialState,\r\n  link: ApolloLink.from([\r\n    onError(({ graphQLErrors, networkError }) =&gt; {\r\n      if (graphQLErrors) {\r\n        graphQLErrors.forEach(({ message, locations, path }) =&gt; console.log(\r\n          `[GraphQL error]: Message: ${message}, Location: ${locations}, Path: ${path}`,\r\n        ));\r\n      }\r\n      if (networkError) console.log(`[Network error]: ${networkError}`);\r\n    }),\r\n    new HttpLink({\r\n      // uri: &#39;https://dev.schandillia.com/graphql&#39;,\r\n      uri: process.env.CMS,\r\n      credentials: &#39;same-origin&#39;,\r\n    }),\r\n  ]),\r\n  ssrMode: !process.browser, // Disables forceFetch on the server (so queries are only run once)\r\n  cache: new InMemoryCache(),\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default function initApollo(headers, initialState = {}) {\r\n  // Make sure to create a new client for every server-side request so that data\r\n  // isn&#39;t shared between connections (which would be bad)\r\n  if (!process.browser) {\r\n    return create(headers, initialState);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Reuse client on the client-side\r\n  if (!apolloClient) {\r\n    apolloClient = create(headers, initialState);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return apolloClient;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: I tried incorporating the official withApollo example at https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-apollo into my project but it throws an invariant error on `getDataFromTree()`:\r\n\r\n&gt; Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.\r\n\r\nI used the exact same code as in the example repo, for the `/init/apollo.js`, `/components/blog/PostList.jsx`, and `/pages/Blog/jsx` files. The only difference in my specific case is that I have an explicit `_app.jsx` that reads as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* eslint-disable max-len */\r\n\r\nimport &#39;../static/styles/fonts.scss&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;../static/styles/style.scss&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;../static/styles/some.css&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport CssBaseline from &#39;@material-ui/core/CssBaseline&#39;;\r\nimport { ThemeProvider } from &#39;@material-ui/styles&#39;;\r\nimport jwt from &#39;jsonwebtoken&#39;;\r\nimport withRedux from &#39;next-redux-wrapper&#39;;\r\nimport App, {\r\n  Container,\r\n} from &#39;next/app&#39;;\r\nimport Head from &#39;next/head&#39;;\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { Provider } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport makeStore from &#39;../reducers&#39;;\r\nimport mainTheme from &#39;../themes/main-theme&#39;;\r\nimport getSessIDFromCookies from &#39;../utils/get-sessid-from-cookies&#39;;\r\nimport getLanguageFromCookies from &#39;../utils/get-language-from-cookies&#39;;\r\nimport getUserTokenFromCookies from &#39;../utils/get-user-token-from-cookies&#39;;\r\nimport removeFbHash from &#39;../utils/remove-fb-hash&#39;;\r\n\r\nclass MyApp extends App {\r\n  static async getInitialProps({ Component, ctx }) {\r\n    let userToken;\r\n    let sessID;\r\n    let language;\r\n\r\n    if (ctx.isServer) {\r\n      ctx.store.dispatch({ type: &#39;UPDATEIP&#39;, payload: ctx.req.headers[&#39;x-real-ip&#39;] });\r\n\r\n      userToken = getUserTokenFromCookies(ctx.req);\r\n      sessID = getSessIDFromCookies(ctx.req);\r\n      language = getLanguageFromCookies(ctx.req);\r\n      const dictionary = require(`../dictionaries/${language}`);\r\n      ctx.store.dispatch({ type: &#39;SETLANGUAGE&#39;, payload: dictionary });\r\n      if(ctx.res) {\r\n        if(ctx.res.locals) {\r\n          if(!ctx.res.locals.authenticated) {\r\n            userToken = null;\r\n            sessID = null;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      if (userToken &amp;&amp;

The APIs are used by the frontend to read/write data from Elasticsearch (ES). The said endpoints are described below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. /api/storeCities # parses a CSV and writes 100,000 documents to the cities index in ES\r\n2. /api/fetchCities # fetches 100,000 documents from the cities index in ES\r\n3. /api/fetchStates # fetches 100,000 documents from the states index in ES\r\n4. /api/fetchCountries # fetches 100,000 documents from the countries index in ES\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Q1.** For all the fetch endpoints above, I have no problem/latency fetching data into the UI. Since node supports 1000s of concurrent requests, there shouldn&#39;t be any problem multiple users calling the same API (?).\r\n\r\n**Q2a.** Whenever someone calls the `/api/storeCities` endpoint, node parses a CSV file and writes data to ES. However during this process, all other endpoints stop responding and there&#39;s huge lag from all the `fetch` endpoints. Since node is non-blocking, why is the `WRITE` operation affecting the `READ` ones? Is this a problem on the ES front?\r\n\r\n**Q2b.** I am also using the node `Cluster` module so there are multiple instances of my Express app. However, the lag still persists when someone calls the `/api/storeCities` endpoint. It seems like node is blocking all the `READ` calls from ES until the `WRITE` call is finished.\r\n\r\nI am unable to pinpoint where the problem is, node or ES?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021558/handling-requests-on-express-server","title":"Handling requests on Express server"},{"tags":["c#",".net-core","vpn","l2tp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":709,"user_id":1732224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/804540c928a4a4783c914ca871a38eed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Fer Garc&#237;a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1732224/fer-garc%c3%ada"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569034023,"post_id":58021556,"comment_id":102475318,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021556/is-there-any-way-to-creat-a-vpn-sever-by-dotnet-core-i-want-control-network-tra#comment102475318_58021556"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11642108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s384nSefnhk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdUwtA0deAmTijTb3D_AP7xOPsHxw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"lulianqi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11642108/lulianqi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":709,"user_id":1732224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/804540c928a4a4783c914ca871a38eed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Fer Garc&#237;a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1732224/fer-garc%c3%ada"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569089840,"post_id":58021556,"comment_id":102486105,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021556/is-there-any-way-to-creat-a-vpn-sever-by-dotnet-core-i-want-control-network-tra#comment102486105_58021556"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11642108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s384nSefnhk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdUwtA0deAmTijTb3D_AP7xOPsHxw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"lulianqi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11642108/lulianqi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11642108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s384nSefnhk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdUwtA0deAmTijTb3D_AP7xOPsHxw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"lulianqi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11642108/lulianqi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569031874,"creation_date":1568951668,"last_edit_date":1569031874,"question_id":58021556,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021556","body_markdown":"I want creat a vpn sever（L2TP） by dotnet core (the moblie will connect it).\r\nSo i can control specifies traffic redirection my sever.\r\nI have searched in the internet , but can not find any answer.\r\n\r\n1:I have looked up the docs.microsoft ,not find any class can help my creat vpn server.\r\n2:I have tried to look for third party lib ,olso failed。\r\n\r\nDo I have to implementation L2TP myself ？\r\nIs there any tool i can use in dotnot core ?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021556/is-there-any-way-to-creat-a-vpn-sever-by-dotnet-core-i-want-control-network-tra","title":"is there any way to creat a vpn sever by dotnet core (i want control network traffic in my application)"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","turbolinks","ruby-on-rails-6","authenticity-token"],"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":8897013,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f57438fb7d0ee1c49f779a3b7e7102e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user8897013","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8897013/user8897013"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568951610,"creation_date":1568951610,"question_id":58021553,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021553","body_markdown":"Long story short: Having trouble with one single form (out of many) generating an InvalidAuthenticityToken, and not sure if it has to do with turbolinks since I&#39;ve removed all references and uninstalled the gem.\r\n\r\nI want to try [this solution](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/24257#issuecomment-411458554) but the code generating the new/second token doesn&#39;t seem to be working.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestios for solving this problem would be greatly appreciated.

I want to make sure that the charge goes through successfully before I change data on my server that points to the Stripe subscription. \r\n\r\nIt looks like this:\r\n\r\n    stripe_response = @purchase_service.charge_stripe\r\n    purchase = @purchase_service.create_purchases(stripe_response)\r\n\r\nSo in the first line, my `purchase_service` is charging stripe. In the second line, I create a new `Subscription` record, and use the Stripe response to set `stripe_subscription_id` on the new record.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that as soon as the Stripe charge goes through, half the time the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event for the Stripe subscription comes in before before the `stripe_subscription_id` is set on my server&#39;s subscription record. So in my webhooks controller, when I try to find my subscription by the `stripe_subscription_id`, it hasn&#39;t been set yet. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried wrapping it in a begin/rescue block, and retrying if it fails to find the subscription. But all that does is makes the purchase action go longer. So I guess this means the webhook action is being interrupting my controller&#39;s action and is being processed in the same execution thread? (correct me if I&#39;m wrong)\r\n\r\nIf that&#39;s the case, what&#39;s the best way to make sure the webhook action gets run separately? I tried running it in a new thread, but all that does is runs separately with the same data as it had when the new thread was spawned. I know this is probably concurrency 101, but I&#39;ve never taken the time to dive too deep. Is this something I can fix in the runtime? Or do I have to reconfigure my server?

I tried to use MapStruct but I don&#39;t think it works with Groovy (I didn&#39;t get an error, it just didn&#39;t do anything, so I assume it only works with Java sources).\r\n\r\nSo I end up writing the mapping logic by myself:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\n@Component\r\nclass ModelMapper {\r\n\tDeployment toModel(DeploymentEntity deploymentEntity) {\r\n\t\tnew Deployment(\r\n\t\t\tname: deploymentEntity.name,\r\n\t\t\tnamespace: deploymentEntity.namespace\r\n\t\t)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tDeploymentEntity toEntity(Deployment deployment) {\r\n\t\tnew DeploymentEntity(\r\n\t\t\tname: deployment.name,\r\n\t\t\tnamespace: deployment.namespace\r\n\t\t)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is: is there a better/more idiomatic way of doing these things in Groovy?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021532/groovy-mapping-data-objects","title":"Groovy: mapping data objects"},{"tags":["docker","centos7","yum"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5455,"user_id":8192635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcaf44c9ff9eeeb51fc78c816891d75a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LinPy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8192635/linpy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568955917,"post_id":58021529,"comment_id":102446886,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021529/docker-ce-not-showing-up-in-yum-list-available-with-repo-installed#comment102446886_58021529"},{"owner":{"reputation":2442,"user_id":676102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c61b1abf00a198c71982e38640aad3c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vorticity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/676102/vorticity"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5455,"user_id":8192635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcaf44c9ff9eeeb51fc78c816891d75a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LinPy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8192635/linpy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568957184,"post_id":58021529,"comment_id":102447213,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021529/docker-ce-not-showing-up-in-yum-list-available-with-repo-installed#comment102447213_58021529"}],"owner":{"reputation":2442,"user_id":676102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c61b1abf00a198c71982e38640aad3c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vorticity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/676102/vorticity"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2442,"user_id":676102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c61b1abf00a198c71982e38640aad3c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vorticity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/676102/vorticity"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568952439,"creation_date":1568951344,"last_edit_date":1568952439,"question_id":58021529,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021529","body_markdown":"Edit: I&#39;d still like an answer to this question if possible, but I have managed to work around it by directly installing the individual rpms rather than relying on yum to do it for me.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m struggling with installing docker-ce on a CentOS 7 box.

Hope someone could help me on this or providing any other solution would be great too, thank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021520/how-to-wait-and-get-return-value-from-viewmodel-using-caliburn-micro-activateite","title":"How to wait and get return value from ViewModel using Caliburn Micro ActivateItem"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8498,"user_id":10323798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/723926e5087b067e92d4d877d604a304?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NelsonGon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568951387,"post_id":58021516,"comment_id":102446040,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021516/how-to-append-each-year-from-original-separate-files-to-new-merge-dataset#comment102446040_58021516"},{"owner":{"reputation":222780,"user_id":1855677,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SASvH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"42-","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1855677/42"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568951780,"post_id":58021516,"comment_id":102446115,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021516/how-to-append-each-year-from-original-separate-files-to-new-merge-dataset#comment102446115_58021516"},{"owner":{"reputation":26475,"user_id":3817004,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bHP3g.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Uwe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3817004/uwe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569653025,"post_id":58021516,"comment_id":102673540,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021516/how-to-append-each-year-from-original-separate-files-to-new-merge-dataset#comment102673540_58021516"},{"owner":{"reputation":22569,"user_id":3773011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hmfxy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Makyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3773011/makyen"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571098172,"post_id":58021516,"comment_id":103118739,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021516/how-to-append-each-year-from-original-separate-files-to-new-merge-dataset#comment103118739_58021516"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12027573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a8ddd9ee6b12b08e1442b8ce2b9499f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wendy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12027573/wendy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568953717,"post_id":58021649,"comment_id":102446456,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021516/how-to-append-each-year-from-original-separate-files-to-new-merge-dataset/58021649#comment102446456_58021649"},{"owner":{"reputation":26475,"user_id":3817004,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bHP3g.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Uwe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3817004/uwe"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12027573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a8ddd9ee6b12b08e1442b8ce2b9499f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wendy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12027573/wendy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568960614,"post_id":58021649,"comment_id":102448303,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021516/how-to-append-each-year-from-original-separate-files-to-new-merge-dataset/58021649#comment102448303_58021649"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1057,"user_id":1530491,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ed61a7cbca35cb2eaf166264e3fd290?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jake2389","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1530491/jake2389"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568952386,"creation_date":1568952386,"answer_id":58021649,"question_id":58021516,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58021649","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s what I used:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nfiles &lt;- Sys.glob(&quot;*.dat&quot;) #

I&#39;ll show you how to do using `rack-cors` gem:\r\n\r\n - Add `gem &#39;rack-cors&#39;` in your `Gemfile`\r\n - Run the command `bundle i`\r\n - In your `config/application.rb` file, add the following lines:\r\n\r\n        config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do\r\n          allow do\r\n            origins &#39;*&#39;\r\n            resource &#39;*&#39;, headers: :any, methods: [:get, :post, :options]\r\n          end\r\n        end\r\n\r\n - Now restart your rails server\r\n - You can also see above instructions and more details [here][2]\r\n\r\nNow make the API call again without forcing `.json` at the end of the URL and it should work.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors#installation","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021497/why-does-rails-not-recognize-accept-application-json-in-the-request-header/58025323#58025323","title":"Why does rails not recognize `Accept: application/json` in the request header?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10252006,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hWfVH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"abhchand","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10252006/abhchand"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568970706,"creation_date":1568950990,"question_id":58021497,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021497","body_markdown":"I have some frontend javascript that makes an asynchronous http request to my backend rails server.

I&#39;ll send Doc Brown to get you back to 2019. I mean, seriously, Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s high time to upgrade your VS and SQL Server? \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, In SQL Server, `Timestamp` is a [synonym][1] to [`RowVersion`][2].  \r\nFrom documentation: \r\n&gt; [rowversion] Is a data type that exposes automatically generated, unique binary numbers within a database. rowversion is generally used as a mechanism for version-stamping table rows. **The storage size is 8 bytes.** The rowversion data type is just an incrementing number and does not preserve a date or a time. \r\n\r\n(emphasis mine)\r\n\r\nAlso, from the same documentation page:\r\n\r\n&gt;  **Note**\r\n\r\n&gt; The timestamp syntax is deprecated. This feature is in maintenance mode and may be removed in a future version of Microsoft SQL Server. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature.\r\n\r\nBTW, `RowVersion` is automatically generated - so unless your parameter is an `out` parameter, I see no reason to use it in a parameter.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-type-synonyms-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/rowversion-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021491/what-is-the-value-of-dbparameter-size-if-dbparameter-dbtype-is-binary/58023371#58023371","title":"What is the value of DbParameter.Size if DbParameter.DbType is Binary?"}],"owner":{"reputation":728,"user_id":4339178,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/43cbab81a770647bdbb3597f8ffa574f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"srh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4339178/srh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58023371,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568963239,"creation_date":1568950901,"question_id":58021491,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021491","body_markdown":"I am working with Visual Studio 2010, .Net Framework 4 and SQL Server 2008 R2. \r\n\r\nI have a table and one of its column&#39;s data type is `timestamp`.

the warning already suggested, you should do this,\r\n```\r\nshow={achieveDreams &amp;&amp; achieveDreams.length === 0 ? true : false}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** I doubt this condition `achieveDreams &amp;&amp; achieveDreams.length === 0`.\r\n\r\nWhat this condition is, **if `achieveDreams` (has value / is not null) AND `achieveDreams.length === 0`**. \r\n\r\nSo I think this condition always be `false`, your condition should be this,\r\n```\r\nshow={achieveDreams &amp;&amp; achieveDreams.length !== 0 ? true : false}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nFrom the [docs][1], \r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t see any usecase as you are using, from the docs we can see you have only 2 option&#39;s of using modal.\r\n\r\n1. Via data attributes,\r\n\r\n   `&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;modal&quot; data-target=&quot;#myModal&quot;&gt;Launch modal&lt;/button&gt;`\r\n\r\n2. Via JavaScript,\r\n\r\n    `Bootstrap.modal(&#39;#myModal&#39;, options);`\r\n\r\nSo, your attempt of using `show` prop on modal is stand&#39;s invalid here. **Using `show` prop on modal has no effect on your modal, you should remove it**. \r\n\r\nYour modal is getting displayed due to `Bootstrap.modal(&#39;#myModal&#39;, options);` in `componentDidMount`.\r\n\r\nYou should have condition in `componentDidMount` like,\r\n```\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n  //considering `achieveDreams` is in state only, \r\n  //if `achieveDreams` is coming from `props` you should use `this.props.achieveDreams &amp;&amp; this.props.achieveDreams.length !== 0`\r\n  if(this.state.achieveDreams &amp;&amp; this.state.achieveDreams.length !== 0){ \r\n     Boostrap.modal(&quot;#signupModal&quot;, &#39;toggle&#39;)\r\n  }   \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Update 2**\r\n\r\nAs per the comment *&quot;achieveDreams false&quot; &quot;achieveDreams.lenth 0&quot; The modal must be appear when the above is true.*\r\n\r\nYou condition must be this,\r\n```\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n  //considering `achieveDreams` is in state only, \r\n  //if `achieveDreams` is coming from `props` you should use `this.props.achieveDreams &amp;&amp; this.props.achieveDreams.length === 0`\r\n  if(this.state.achieveDreams &amp;&amp; this.state.achieveDreams.length === 0){ \r\n     Boostrap.modal(&quot;#signupModal&quot;, &#39;toggle&#39;)\r\n  }   \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Demo][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://bootstrap-4-react.com/#documentation/components/modal\r\n  [2]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-xcnacp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021481/how-can-i-add-a-condition-in-a-modal-using-bootstrap-4-react/58021539#58021539","title":"How can i add a condition in a modal using bootstrap-4-react?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12060410,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28f7adad570048d958dceb51441deb3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jaimeduque17","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12060410/jaimeduque17"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569017667,"post_id":58021566,"comment_id":102473189,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021481/how-can-i-add-a-condition-in-a-modal-using-bootstrap-4-react/58021566#comment102473189_58021566"},{"owner":{"reputation":1222,"user_id":8904424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oh5L9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Piyush Zalani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8904424/piyush-zalani"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12060410,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28f7adad570048d958dceb51441deb3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jaimeduque17","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12060410/jaimeduque17"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569214735,"post_id":58021566,"comment_id":102509216,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021481/how-can-i-add-a-condition-in-a-modal-using-bootstrap-4-react/58021566#comment102509216_58021566"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1222,"user_id":8904424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oh5L9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Piyush Zalani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8904424/piyush-zalani"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568951752,"creation_date":1568951752,"answer_id":58021566,"question_id":58021481,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58021566","body_markdown":"As far as I can see achieveDreams is not defined, please try to use `this.state.achieveDreams &amp;&amp;

For any given list, take the head of this list and match it against the rest of list. There are two possibilities during this matching: i) You are successful i.e. you match, and if so, you collect the matched value and continue looking for more values, or ii) You fail, i.e. you don&#39;t match, and if so, you stop immediately and return the so far matched result with  rest of, not-inspected, list. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n&gt;        collectF :: (Eq a) =&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; ([a], [a])\r\n&gt;        collectF f [] = ([], [])\r\n&gt;        collectF f (x : xs) \r\n&gt;         | f x = let (ys, zs) = collectF f xs in (x : ys, zs)\r\n&gt;         | otherwise = ([], x : xs)\r\n\r\n2. Now that you have the collectF function, you can use it recursively on input list. In each call, you would get a successful list with rest of, not-inspected, list.

are different approaches to this problem. One is [pure SQL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1877874/how-to-fill-date-gaps-in-mysql) for example.\r\n\r\nBut I would say a PHP based solution is simpler. Basically you need to get your data into *array*, then create a loop that outputs the desired months order, and have a condition that sees whether we have a corresponding row in our array and outputs ether the actual data or a zero accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe only tricky part is to have such an array that would let us check the data availability. For this we have to *index* it with month numbers. Not a big deal actually\r\n\r\n    $sql = &quot;SELECT month(date_created), count(a.ticket_num) ...&quot;;\r\n    $res = $mysqli($sql);\r\n    $data = [];\r\n    while($row = mysqli_fetch_row($res)) {\r\n        $data[$row[0]] = $row[1];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow `$data` is an array indexed by the month number. The rest is a primitive loop\r\n\r\n    foreach (range(1,12) as $month) {\r\n        echo $data[$month] ?: 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOn a side note I would like to advertise using PDO as opposed to mysqli for your database interactions as this case clearly displays the superiority of the former. Using PDO we can get the indexed array right away, without an explicit loop, thanks to a [special fetch mode](https://phpdelusions.net/pdo/fetch_modes#FETCH_KEY_PAIR):\r\n\r\n    $sql = &quot;SELECT month(date_created), count(a.ticket_num) ...&quot;;\r\n    $data = $data = $pdo-&gt;query($sql)-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_KEY_PAIR);\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s all!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021454/how-to-add-not-existing-record-and-return-it-with-zero-value-in-mysqli/58021967#58021967","title":"How to add not existing record and return it with zero value in Mysqli"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12093352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7835fb6eebcbd165e89dc9ac6a4a4e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"QUIET","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093352/quiet"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568970600,"creation_date":1568950585,"last_edit_date":1568970600,"question_id":58021454,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021454","body_markdown":"**QUERY:**\r\n\r\n     SELECT month(date_created), count(a.ticket_num) \r\n                FROM ticket as a \r\n                LEFT JOIN user_management as b on b.engineer_id = a.ticket_engineer \r\n                WHERE b.tl_id = &#39;sample_id&#39;\r\n                AND year(date_created) = &#39;2019&#39;\r\n                GROUP BY extract(year from date_created), extract(month from date_created)\r\n\r\n**SAMPLE OUTPUT:**\r\n\r\n      month | ticket_num\r\n    ----------------------\r\n        2   |     12\r\n        4   |     24\r\n        6   |     78\r\n\r\n**EXPECTED SAMPLE OUTPUT:**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n     month | ticket_num\r\n    ----------------------\r\n        1   |     0\r\n        2   |     12\r\n        3   |     0\r\n        4   |     24\r\n        5   |     0\r\n        6   |     78\r\n\r\nAs you can see the above expected output, i&#39;m trying to place all existing month in the first column and set all the count to zero if not existed in the second column.

**Note :** I recommend reading [this][1] article about completion-handlers and how they actually function in swift .\r\n\r\n \r\n**How to fix your case:** \r\n\r\nSince you&#39;re using `enum`, and you want the fetching function inside the variable it self for some reason you can only fix this by creating a critical section with `DispatchSemaphores`. \r\n\r\nI created a small demo for you to understand how it works, and i also recommend [this][2] article. \r\n\r\n**Demo:**\r\n\r\n     var name: String {\r\n        let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)\r\n        var name = &quot;no value&quot;\r\n            DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2.0) {\r\n                name = &quot;new Value&quot;\r\n                semaphore.signal()\r\n        }\r\n        semaphore.wait()\r\n        return name\r\n    }\r\n Your code should be something like this . \r\n\r\n      var name: String {\r\n            let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)\r\n            var name:String?\r\n            let uid = Auth.auth().currentUser?.uid\r\n            Database.database().reference().child(&quot;users&quot;).child(uid!).observeSingleEvent(of: .value, with: { (snapshot) in\r\n                if let dictionary = snapshot.value as?
