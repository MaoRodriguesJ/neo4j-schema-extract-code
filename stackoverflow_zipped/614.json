Actually, my ground truth can be shifted locally from 2-3 pixels and so, I would like to calculate the cross entropy using an uncertainty on the &quot;pixelwise&quot; comparison.\r\n\r\nTo do that, I process as the following:\r\nI defined the wanted uncertainty, here 2 pixels. I can then, crop 2 pixels at each side of the ground truth. The prediction is also cropped at different position, simulating a &quot;shift&quot; between prediction and ground truth.\r\nNext, I have to calculate the loss between this &quot;shifted&quot; prediction and ground truth, saved it and go to the next &quot;shifted&quot; prediction. Doing that, I have a loss calculated with different shift values.\r\n\r\nIf I understood correctly the cross entropy function from tensorflow, the pixelwise comparison between GT and prediction should be minimal if the prediction is good. So, I can calculate the average loss between the prediction and GT, using the minimal value for each component of the cross entropy tensors.\r\n\r\n    with tf.variable_scope(&#39;loss_layer&#39;):\r\n        Unc = 2\r\n        labelsCropped = tf.image.crop_to_bounding_box(labels, Unc, Unc, 256-Unc*2, 256-Unc*2)\r\n        labels_flat = tf.reshape(labelsCropped, [-1, depth])\r\n        Allcross_entropy_loss = []\r\n        for x in range(2*2):\r\n            for y in range(2*2):\r\n                logitsCropped = tf.image.crop_to_bounding_box(logits, x, y, 256-Unc*2, 256-Unc*2)\r\n                logits_flat = tf.reshape(logitsCropped, [-1, depth])\r\n                Allcross_entropy_loss += [tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(targets = labels_flat, logits = logits_flat, pos_weight=98.22)]\r\n                loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_min(tf.stack(Allcross_entropy_loss), 0))\r\n\r\nBy the way, this produce a loss equal to 0 very fast (~100 iterations which is too much fast to be real, my previous model are calculated over 20 000 iterations (20 epochs and 1000 iterations/epoch, to have a loss of ~0.4). I expect something wrong here but I don&#39;t know how to display the output of each function, for example, I would like to know if the `reduce_min` function give a minimal tensors of 252x252 or just 1 value. If it return 1 value, it&#39;s wrong.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395211/calculate-loss-value-over-several-tensors","title":"calculate loss value over several tensors"},{"tags":["ssh","cpanel"],"owner":{"reputation":2485,"user_id":1528268,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gjxfO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"omer Farooq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1528268/omer-farooq"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571144010,"creation_date":1571144010,"question_id":58395210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58395210","body_markdown":"I used a hostname while installing cpanel which i want to remove now.

But its to get my point across about how to do it.\r\n\r\nI hope it fits your needs and you get whatever you are working on working.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395161/sort-value-intoarray/58396297#58396297","title":"Sort value intoarray"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36386,"user_id":9097906,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RmIqt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Littlefoot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9097906/littlefoot"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571150672,"creation_date":1571150672,"answer_id":58397283,"question_id":58395161,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58397283","body_markdown":"It would have helped if you posted table description, so I&#39;ll just guess that this (`objects_table` CTE) is what you have and what you&#39;d want to get (line #8 onward):\r\n\r\n    SQL&gt;

have my main .net core application called **AppOne**. In its appsettings.json I define which api&#39;s it should be able to call. For example:\r\n\r\n    &quot;ApiSettings&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;UrlToCall&quot;: &quot;http://test&quot;,\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen there is my intermediate and shared project library, called **InfraApp** that makes the call itself to the Api.\r\nThere might be a second app called **AppTwo** where the url is different.\r\nBoth **AppOne** and **AppTwo** reference the **InfraApp** since the logic is common and call the code in there to make the actual call. However the settings (that specifies which url to call) are specific to the api&#39;s themselves and therefore cannot be specified in the **InfraApp**.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s consider only **AppOne** so far.\r\nSuch settings are registered through the Options pattern (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-3.0) into the startup.cs:\r\n\r\n    services.AddOptions();\r\n    var apiSettings = Configuration.GetSection(&quot;ApiSettings&quot;);\r\n    services.Configure&lt;ApiSettings&gt;(apiSettings);\r\n\r\nand I have my ApiSettings class:\r\n\r\n    public class ApiSettings\r\n    {\r\n        public string UrlToCall { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhat is the correct way to pass such ApiSettings to the **InfraApp** ? **InfraApp** doesn&#39;t know anything about ApiSettings since this is defined in the **AppOne**.

One solution is to use vertex and pixel shaders. My understanding problem starts here.\r\n\r\n**Vertex shader:**\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI guess I should draw 2 triangles (2 triangles makes a rectangle, or a quad).\r\nDirectX is using left handed coordinate system, but I guess it&#39;s irrelevant here, because I&#39;m dealing with 2D sprites, right?\r\nFor the same reason, I assume I can ignore the `world-&gt;view-&gt;projection ` transformations, right? Actually, I only need translation here in order to place the sprite at the right place on the screen, right?\r\n\r\nShould the coordinates of these two triangles match the sprite dimensions, plus translation?\r\n**In what order should I provide these vertices?** Should the origin of the coordinate system be in the center of the sprite, or should the origin be at the top left corner of the sprite?\r\n\r\nAs an example, if I have 80x70 sprite, what would be the vertex values?&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**The real vertices:** (X, Y, Z - with no translation applied)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n    1. -40, -35, 0\r\n    2. -40,  35, 0\r\n    3.  40, -35, 0\r\n    4.  40,  35, 0\r\n    5. -40,  35, 0\r\n    6.  40, -35, 0\r\n\r\nIs that correct?\r\n\r\nThe rasterization step should call pixel shader once for each pixel in the sprite. The output of the vertex shader will be input for the pixel shader. Does that mean the pixel shader should have access to the sprite in order to return the correct pixel value when called?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395111/how-are-vertex-shader-and-pixel-shader-related","title":"How are vertex shader and pixel shader related?"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","express","download","adm-zip"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10800,"user_id":6870228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13425c63b585e3bba05d30509e9e2b00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Keith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6870228/keith"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571144165,"post_id":58395108,"comment_id":103135979,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395108/archive-multiple-files-with-node-and-download-it-immediately#comment103135979_58395108"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9389861,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iLSVT31YDtE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOA/1iW7uFPkMzQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nika Andriadze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9389861/nika-andriadze"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571216583,"creation_date":1571216583,"answer_id":58409599,"question_id":58395108,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58409599","body_markdown":"Ok, don&#39;t know why I got downvoted, but here&#39;s the answer on how I managed to create temporary archive, download it and delete it.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s back-end\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Create a ZIP of files uploaded by a club\r\nrouter.get(\r\n  &quot;/download-zip/&quot;,\r\n  (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n      zip.addLocalFile(/*ADD THE FILES TO ZIP*/);\r\n\r\n      zip.writeZip(\r\n        `temp/zips/temp-file.zip`,\r\n        err =&gt; {\r\n          if (err) {\r\n            console.log(err);\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          res.download(\r\n            `uploads/club-zips/test-file.zip`,\r\n            function(err) {\r\n              if (!err) {\r\n                //delete file after it&#39;s been downloaded\r\n                fs.unlinkSync(\r\n                  `uploads/club-zips/test-file-${req.params.club_id}.zip`\r\n                );\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          );\r\n        }\r\n      );\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I use on front.

has multiple URLs that correspond to multiple H1s scraped from the page.\r\nI would like to have the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl    text    h1_1   h1_2\r\nurl 1  text 1  h1     h1\r\nurl 2  text 2  h1     h1\r\n...    ...     ...    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan someone help me out? \r\n\r\nEdit: note that the H1 column from the second dataframe is not present in the first dataframe.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395101/pandas-pivot-and-join-dataframes","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Pandas - Pivot and join

There are lots of different approaches:\r\n\r\n- Using a &quot;magic&quot; non-NULL value.\r\n- Using a separate boolean/tinyint column.\r\n- Using an EAV (entity-attribute-value) model.\r\n- Storing the values as JSON or XML (similar to your NOSQL approach).\r\n\r\n(and no doubt other methods.)\r\n\r\nFor your example with the middle name, I find it hard to imagine a scenario where someone is known to have a middle name, but the name (or initial) is not known.  So, `NULL` seems quite appropriate. \r\nThis applies to phone numbers, emails addresses, preferred honorifics and so on.\r\n\r\nIn practice, I don&#39;t find that this is a major concern.  `NULL` seems to work well for most columns.

If you want to try the `python` example you need to import `tesseract` but first things first to install `tesseract` on your OS and add it to your `PATH`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395079/transform-an-image-of-handwritten-notes-to-text/58395237#58395237","title":"Transform an image of handwritten notes to text"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":10907559,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Dm0Q6QV7O4M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYa4vzR1n1hgruWUnyQ2zZG2-0ENA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"elk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10907559/elk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571147046,"post_id":58395511,"comment_id":103137852,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395079/transform-an-image-of-handwritten-notes-to-text/58395511#comment103137852_58395511"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":12193049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xV8ET.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alvaro Arranz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12193049/alvaro-arranz"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571144914,"creation_date":1571144914,"answer_id":58395511,"question_id":58395079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58395511","body_markdown":"There are many OCRs out there and some perform better than others.

Naively I was first trying to extract the definition into a function, but this doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n       function getQuery(path) {\r\n            return {\r\n                query: accountByPath,\r\n                variables() {\r\n                    return {path: path}\r\n                },\r\n                subscribeToMore: {\r\n                    document: updateAccountSubscription,\r\n                    variables() {\r\n                        return {\r\n                            path: path,\r\n                        }\r\n                    },\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        export default {\r\n            props: [&#39;path&#39;],\r\n            apollo: {\r\n                account: () =&gt; getQuery(this.path)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    &lt;/script&gt; \r\n\r\nSo, how can I reuse the same query definition including variables and subscription?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395077/vue-apollo-share-query-definition-between-components","title":"vue-apollo share query definition between components"},{"tags":["vba","ms-word","office-addins"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6651,"user_id":5414798,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5973717abda4c9d855c8399cc9407799?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nathan_Sav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5414798/nathan-sav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571144359,"post_id":58395072,"comment_id":103136104,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395072/ms-word-add-in-constant-has-different-values-during-start-up-autoexec#comment103136104_58395072"},{"owner":{"reputation":19416,"user_id":3077495,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZE6fb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cindy Meister","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3077495/cindy-meister"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571147847,"post_id":58395072,"comment_id":103138377,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395072/ms-word-add-in-constant-has-different-values-during-start-up-autoexec#comment103138377_58395072"},{"owner":{"reputation":1840,"user_id":882697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6482112c346023e2b8fe64bff964a3c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Plouff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/882697/plouff"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6651,"user_id":5414798,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5973717abda4c9d855c8399cc9407799?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nathan_Sav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5414798/nathan-sav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571149834,"post_id":58395072,"comment_id":103139558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395072/ms-word-add-in-constant-has-different-values-during-start-up-autoexec#comment103139558_58395072"},{"owner":{"reputation":1840,"user_id":882697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6482112c346023e2b8fe64bff964a3c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Plouff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/882697/plouff"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":19416,"user_id":3077495,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZE6fb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cindy Meister","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3077495/cindy-meister"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571150049,"post_id":58395072,"comment_id":103139693,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395072/ms-word-add-in-constant-has-different-values-during-start-up-autoexec#comment103139693_58395072"},{"owner":{"reputation":6651,"user_id":5414798,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5973717abda4c9d855c8399cc9407799?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nathan_Sav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5414798/nathan-sav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571309042,"post_id":58395072,"comment_id":103202076,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395072/ms-word-add-in-constant-has-different-values-during-start-up-autoexec#comment103202076_58395072"}],"owner":{"reputation":1840,"user_id":882697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6482112c346023e2b8fe64bff964a3c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Plouff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/882697/plouff"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571143563,"creation_date":1571143563,"question_id":58395072,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58395072","body_markdown":"I am developping a Word Add-Ins that customizes the Ribbon.\r\n\r\nActually, I have 2 add-ins.

of subclasses and implementing classes **cannot throw more checked exceptions than the methods they override or implement** because this would violate the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle). The reason is that according to the interface, calls to `accept` are not required to handle exceptions, so existing implementations cannot be be substituted by some implementations that would require the caller to handle the exception. The Java compiler enforces this constraint.\r\n\r\nThe typical solution is to re-map exceptions to an *specific subtype of* `RuntimeException`, so that exceptions can be caught polymorphically without the risk of catching things like `NullPointerException`.

The composition (and/or) along with other features they provide really makes life easier.\r\n\r\nI have been using them extensively for quite sometime, until recently I got stuck with one of the use-cases with respect to exception handling (for checked exceptions) : \r\n\r\n**Background :**\r\nI want my predicate implementations to be able to throw out some checked exceptions, which the caller should be able to catch and act upon accordingly. (Some `PredicateExecutionFailedException`). Since there is no such exception being thrown in JDK&#39;s `java.util.Predicate` definition, I cannot throw any such exception from my implementation. I feel this is a missing piece which would have given more flexibility to the client calling the predicates. Below is the snippet from JDK 1.8.\r\n\r\n    @FunctionalInterface\r\n    public interface Predicate&lt;T&gt; {\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * Evaluates this predicate on the given argument.\r\n         *\r\n         * @param t the input argument\r\n         * @return {@code true} if the input argument matches the predicate,\r\n         * otherwise {@code false}\r\n         */\r\n        boolean test(T t);\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * Returns a composed predicate that represents a short-circuiting logical\r\n         * AND of this predicate and another.

have set up simple tests with Parallel Boost Graph Library (PBGL), which I have never used before, and observed entirely unexpected behaviour I would like to explain.\r\n\r\nMy steps were as follows:\r\n \r\n- Dump test data in METIS format (a kind of social graph with 50 mln vertices and 100 mln edges);\r\n  \r\n- Build modified PBGL example from graph_parallel\\example\\dijkstra_shortest_paths.cpp\r\n    \r\n    - Example was slightly extended to proceed with Eager, Crauser and delta-stepping algorithms. \r\n\r\n       Note: building of the example required some obscure workaround about the MUTABLE_QUEUE define in crauser_et_al_shortest_paths.hpp (example code is in fact incompatible with the new mutable_queue)\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n    int lookahead = 1;  \r\n    delta_stepping_shortest_paths(g, start, dummy_property_map(), get(vertex_distance, g), get(edge_weight, g), lookahead);  \r\n    dijkstra_shortest_paths(g, start, distance_map(get(vertex_distance, g)).lookahead(lookahead));  \r\n    dijkstra_shortest_paths(g, start, distance_map(get(vertex_distance, g)));\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run \r\n\r\n    mpiexec -n 1 mytest.exe mydata.me  \r\n    mpiexec -n 2 mytest.exe mydata.me  \r\n    mpiexec -n 4 mytest.exe mydata.me  \r\n    mpiexec -n 8 mytest.exe mydata.me\r\n\r\nThe observed behaviour:  \r\n\r\n- &lt;b&gt;-n 1&lt;/b&gt;:  \r\n    mem usage: 35 GB in 1 running process, which utilizes exactly 1 device thread (processor load 12.5%)  \r\n    delta stepping time: about 1 min 20 s  \r\n    eager time: about 2 min  \r\n    crauser time: about 3 min 20 s.  \r\n\r\n- &lt;b&gt;-n 2&lt;/b&gt;: \r\n    crash in the stage of data load.\r\n\r\n- &lt;b&gt;-n 4&lt;/b&gt;:  \r\n    mem usage: 40+ Gb in roughly equal parts in 4 running processes, each of which utilizes exactly 1 device thread  \r\n    calculation times are unchanged in the margins of observation error.  \r\n\r\n- &lt;b&gt;-n 8&lt;/b&gt;:  \r\n    mem usage: 44+ Gb  in roughly equal parts in 8 running processes, each of which utilizes exactly 1 device thread  \r\n    calculation times are unchanged in the margins of observation error.\r\n\r\nSo, except the unapropriate memory usage and very low total performance the only changes I observe when more MPI processes are running are slightly increased total memory consumption and linear rise of processor load.\r\nThe fact that initial graph is somehow partitioned between processes (probably by the vertices number ranges) is nevertheless evident.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with this test (and, probably, my idea of MPI usage in whole)?\r\n\r\nMy enviromnent:  \r\n- one Win 10 PC with 64 Gb and 8 kernels;  \r\n- MS MPI 10.0.12498.5;  \r\n- MSVC 2017, toolset 141;  \r\n- boost 1.71  \r\n\r\nN.B.

Here is a little example of how to do that:\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\t  public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {\r\n\t\t  \t      \t\t  \r\n\t\t    \r\n\t\t  float distanceInMeters =  destLocation.distanceTo(location);\r\n\r\n          // Distance in miles\t\t  \r\n\t\t  double distance_to_dest = (distanceInMeters/1609.344);\r\n\t\t  int distance_to_dest_int = (int)(distance_to_dest * 100);\r\n\t\t  distance_to_dest = ((double)distance_to_dest_int/100.00);\r\n\r\n\t\t  tvMilesToGo.setText(String.format(&quot;%.2f&quot;, distance_to_dest) + &quot;mi&quot;);\r\n\t\t    \r\n          // About 1/10th of a mile\r\n\t\t  if ((distanceInMeters &gt; 149) &amp;&amp; (distanceInMeters &lt; 176)) {\r\n\t\t    \r\n              // I played an alarm sound when close to the target destination\r\n\t          //if (alarmPlayer.isPlaying()) {\r\n\t          //  \talarmPlayer.stop();\r\n\t          //}   \r\n\t          //alarmPlayer.start();\r\n\r\n\t    \t    Marker marker = mMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions()\r\n\t            .position(new LatLng(destLocation.getLatitude(), destLocation.getLongitude()))\r\n\t            .title(“Arrived”)\r\n\t            .snippet(“You have arrived at your destination!”)\r\n\t            .icon(red_descriptor));\r\n\r\n            Marker.showInfoWindow;\r\n\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t    \r\n\t\t     \r\n\t  }\r\n\r\nNote, in your case, you would probably only ever want to add a marker once, so, you would probably want to set a flag such as markerIsVisible = true once you add it to the map, and then check before adding the marker if (markerIsVisible == false) {add the marker, markerIsVisible = true}","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395015/want-to-know-about-google-map-pop-ups-or-snippet-upon-exact-location/58436901#58436901","title":"Want to know about google map pop ups or snippet upon exact location"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9659352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed0962de441426fdc43ae979dab1d7b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mujju hussain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9659352/mujju-hussain"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571328986,"creation_date":1571143378,"question_id":58395015,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58395015","body_markdown":"I want to develop an app on google map that could notify me with some information set by the user when I am close to the exact location.

To check if that works, is possible this way, too:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nstream_context_get_default([&#39;http&#39; =&gt; [&#39;header&#39; =&gt; &#39;Accept: application/xml&#39;]]);\r\n$buffer = file_get_contents($url);\r\necho $buffer, &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n~~~\r\nThe output is not that beautified then (I guess if the data is more, the JSON wouldn&#39;t be that easy to read as well as it also would grew larger):\r\n~~~\r\n&lt;GetRateController.Rate xmlns:i=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/Savings.Controllers&quot;&gt;&lt;GRate&gt;3670.00&lt;/GRate&gt;&lt;PRate&gt;0.00&lt;/PRate&gt;&lt;SRate&gt;50.00&lt;/SRate&gt;&lt;/GetRateController.Rate&gt;\r\n~~~\r\nThis might be similar to when opening the URL in the browser. This is because the browser also sends the `Accept` request header and it contains XML as well:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nBecause browser normally accept XML as well (albeit they prefer HTML over it).\r\n\r\nSo in the end it depends what *you* prefer. Either the [JSON which is less verbose compared to XML](http://json.org/) (see the very first example code above) or if you want to use XML with SimpleXML:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\n$url = &quot;http://api.srinivasajewellery.com/getrate/getrate&quot;;\r\nstream_context_get_default([&#39;http&#39; =&gt; [&#39;header&#39; =&gt; &#39;Accept: application/xml&#39;]]);\r\n$xml = simplexml_load_file($url) or die(&quot;not open&quot;);\r\n\r\necho &#39;$GRate: &#39; . $xml-&gt;GRate, &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n~~~\r\nOutput:\r\n~~~\r\n$GRate: 3670.00\r\n~~~\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58394989/how-to-get-data-from-an-phrase-in-remote-xml-in-php/58400171#58400171","title":"How to get data from an phrase in remote XML in php?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11987222,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDVDE1XAgONUAbenHFUuVKaEH2FV3Gaua82DgkQNA=k-s128","display_name":"Sathyaprakash Murugan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11987222/sathyaprakash-murugan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58395172,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571161975,"creation_date":1571143299,"question_id":58394989,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58394989","body_markdown":"I wanna get the data from an XML file on remote site from a particular node.
