If we use `forecast` package&#39;s `ets()` with ETS(M,A,M) as our model of choice, it will rightly complain that we have wrongly-chosen ETS(M,A,M), which is inappropriate for time series that contain zeroes. \r\nI then did a simple experiment whereby I perform translation on the time series values, just to avoid the zeroes in the beginning. \r\n```\r\n&gt; trans &lt;- 1\r\n&gt; myts_trans &lt;- ts(as.numeric(myts) + trans, frequency = frequency(myts), start = start(myts))\r\n&gt; autoplot(myts_trans, series = &quot;DATA&quot;) + autolayer(forecast(ets(myts_trans, model = &quot;MAM&quot;, damped = FALSE)), PI=FALSE, series=&quot;FCT)\r\n```\r\nWith this, I get a forecast that looks quite reasonable, except for the fact that I think it has a trend that is a bit too strong (besides the *outlier* element in the 4th year, the time series seems to show a seasonality pattern with no trend). \r\n\r\nBut then, when I started to play around with other translation amount, I started  to get very weird forecast values. For e.g., with `trans &lt;- 1000`, I get the following (unexpectedly-high) forecast results:\r\n\r\n[forecast from ETS(M,A,M) with translation = 1000][1]\r\n\r\nIf you further play around with the translation value, you&#39;d see that we can get wildly different forecast values using the same ETS(M,A,M) method. For e.g., with translation = 2000, you get similarly very-high forecast values as translation = 1000 (but the exact numbers differ), but if you set translation = 10000, you will get again a reasonable forecast, just like the case when you use translation = 1.\r\n\r\nWorth noting that when I used the `smooth` package (with the `es()` function), I get more-or-less similarly strange forecasts using certain translation values (though the exact values differ significantly) compared to `ets()`.\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n\r\n1. What could be the explanation that caused such a strange result of ETS(M,A,M). Is it due to the *flat* first year? Consequently: Are multiplicative seasonality/errors ETS not suitable then for these kinds of time series data?\r\n\r\n2. Shouldn&#39;t it be expected that performing translation on a time series would not change the *shape* of the forecast values when using a certain method (i.e., I would expect that the forecast values would be equal to the forecast values of the untranslated data + some fixed amount)?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KmUSl.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201757/what-is-the-explanation-for-the-following-strange-behavior-of-the-forecast-from","title":"What is the explanation for the following strange behavior of the forecast from ETS(M,A,M)?"},{"tags":["python","flask","oauth","oauth-2.0","authlib"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1387,"user_id":389412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e7b5cf5ab38553aff21e25d8cb838a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lepture","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/389412/lepture"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570606792,"post_id":58201756,"comment_id":102961247,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201756/lepture-authlib-client-not-work-for-oauth2-authorization-code-flow#comment102961247_58201756"},{"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":1729247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c653817f922237933507b57d026d503e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eduardo Lopes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1729247/eduardo-lopes"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1387,"user_id":389412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e7b5cf5ab38553aff21e25d8cb838a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lepture","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/389412/lepture"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570642237,"post_id":58201756,"comment_id":102980265,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201756/lepture-authlib-client-not-work-for-oauth2-authorization-code-flow#comment102980265_58201756"},{"owner":{"reputation":1387,"user_id":389412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e7b5cf5ab38553aff21e25d8cb838a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lepture","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/389412/lepture"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570716728,"post_id":58201756,"comment_id":103008436,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201756/lepture-authlib-client-not-work-for-oauth2-authorization-code-flow#comment103008436_58201756"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":1729247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c653817f922237933507b57d026d503e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eduardo Lopes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1729247/eduardo-lopes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570725274,"post_id":58314899,"comment_id":103013188,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201756/lepture-authlib-client-not-work-for-oauth2-authorization-code-flow/58314899#comment103013188_58314899"},{"owner":{"reputation":1387,"user_id":389412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e7b5cf5ab38553aff21e25d8cb838a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lepture","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/389412/lepture"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":41,"user_id":1729247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c653817f922237933507b57d026d503e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eduardo Lopes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1729247/eduardo-lopes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570781382,"post_id":58314899,"comment_id":103030067,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201756/lepture-authlib-client-not-work-for-oauth2-authorization-code-flow/58314899#comment103030067_58314899"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1387,"user_id":389412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e7b5cf5ab38553aff21e25d8cb838a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lepture","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/389412/lepture"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570676985,"creation_date":1570676985,"answer_id":58314899,"question_id":58201756,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314899","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t know the whole code.

Here are the basic steps to mount a bucket and run RMAN:\r\n\r\n1. Create a bucket `oracle_bucket`. Check that it doesn&#39;t have a retention policy defined on it (it looks like gcsfuse has some issues with retention policies). \r\n\r\nPlease have a look at [mounting.md][3] that describes credentials for GCS. For example, I created a service account with Storage Admin role and created a JSON key for it.\r\n\r\n2. Next, set up credentials for gcsfuse on your machine. In my case, I set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path to JSON key from step 1. Run:\r\n```\r\nsudo su - oracle  \r\nmkdir ./mnt_bucket  \r\ngcsfuse --dir-mode 755 --file-mode 777 --implicit-dirs --debug_fuse oracle_bucket ./mnt_bucket\r\n```\r\nFrom gcsfuse docs:\r\n&gt; Important: You should run gcsfuse as the user who will be using the\r\n&gt; file system, not as root. Do not use sudo.\r\n\r\n3. Configure RMAN to create a backup in `mnt_bucket`. For example: \r\n```\r\nconfigure controlfile autobackup format for device type disk to &#39;/home/oracle/mnt_bucket/%F&#39;; \r\nconfigure channel device type disk format &#39;/home/oracle/mnt_bucket/%U&#39;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. After you run `backup database` you&#39;ll see a backup files created in your GCS bucket.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/docs/mounting.md","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201714/rman-backup-into-google-cloud-storage/58491238#58491238","title":"RMAN backup into Google Cloud Storage"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":9288136,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0KqF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rohith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9288136/rohith"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1710,"user_id":9146820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d96a2da87bb66419c9bd5e71dbcc94ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Maxim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9146820/maxim"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571755530,"creation_date":1570020031,"last_edit_date":1570032086,"question_id":58201714,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201714","body_markdown":"I want to take Oracle database backup using RMAN directly into the Google Cloud Storage\r\n\r\nI am unable to find the plugin to use to take the RMAN backups into Cloud Storage.

am processing messages from a vendor as a stream of data and want to store msgSeqNum locally in a local file. Reason:\r\n\r\nThey send msgSeqNum to uniquely identify each message. And they provide a &#39;sync-and-stream&#39; functionality to stream messages on reconnecting from a given sequence number. Say if the msgSeqNum starts from 1 and my connection went down at msgSeqNum 50 and missed the next 100 messages (vendor server&#39;s current msgSeqNum is now 150), then when I reconnect to the vendor, I need to call &#39;sync-and-stream&#39; with msgSeqNum=50 to get the missed 100 messages.\r\n\r\nSo I want to understand how I can persist the msgSeqNum locally for fast access. I assume \r\n\r\n1) Since the read/writes happen frequently i.e. while processing every message (read to ignore dups, write to update msgSeqNum after processing a msg), I think it&#39;s best to use Java NIO&#39;s &#39;MappedByteBuffer&#39;? \r\n\r\n2) Could someone confirm if the below code is best for this where I expose the mapped byte buffer object to be reused for reads and writes and leave the FileChannel open for the lifetime of the process?

However, the table has many different sections, and each section has a heading.\r\n\r\nI need the results to be grouped. The header should be displayed ONLY if there are one or more matching results within the rows of that section.\r\n\r\nI have tried to use getElementsByClassName and use separated tables instead of a single one with many headings. I have also tried to get elements by id with a list of many ids. \r\n\r\nNothing worked, probably because of bad overall implementation, but even if it had, then I wouldn&#39;t know how to exclude the headings of tables with no matching results.

It reads a line from `ARGV` into `$_`. `ARGV` is a special file handle that reads from the each of the files specified as arguments (or STDIN if no files are provided).\r\n2. If EOF has been reached, the loop and therefore the program exits.\r\n3. It replaces the first occurrence of `enforcing` with `disabled`.\r\n4. It prints out the modified line to the default output handle. Because of `-i`, this is a handle to a new file with the same name as the one from which the program is currently reading.*\r\n5. Repeat.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n    $ cat a\r\n    foo\r\n    bar enforcing the law\r\n    baz\r\n    enforcing enforcing\r\n    \r\n    $ perl -pe&#39;s/enforcing/disabled/&#39; -i a\r\n    \r\n    $ cat a\r\n    foo\r\n    bar disabled the law\r\n    baz\r\n    disabled enforcing\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\\* &amp;mdash; In old versions of Perl, the old file has already been deleted at this point, but it&#39;s still accessible as long as there&#39;s an open file handle to it. In very new versions of Perl, this writes to temporary file that will later overwrite the file from which the program is reading.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201662/perl-in-command-line-perl-p-i-e-some-text-path/58201971#58201971","title":"Perl in command line: perl -p -i -e &quot;some text&quot; /path"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":180368,"user_id":7552,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b60298053f87465641c1b1192338c8cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"glenn jackman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7552/glenn-jackman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1570034604,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570034604,"creation_date":1570034604,"answer_id":58205826,"question_id":58201662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58205826","body_markdown":"To find out *exactly* what Perl is going to do, you can use [the `O` module](https://perldoc.pl/O)\r\n\r\n    perl -MO=Deparse -p -i -e &quot;s/enforcing/disabled/&quot; file\r\n\r\noutputs\r\n\r\n    BEGIN { $^I = &quot;&quot;; }\r\n    LINE: while (defined($_ = readline ARGV)) {\r\n        s/enforcing/disabled/;\r\n    }\r\n    continue {\r\n        die &quot;-p destination: $!\\n&quot; unless print $_;\r\n    }\r\n    -e syntax OK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201662/perl-in-command-line-perl-p-i-e-some-text-path/58205826#58205826","title":"Perl in command line: perl -p -i -e &quot;some text&quot; /path"}],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":11225028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a362b5c8966644c015c1db766488541f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Luk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11225028/luk"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58201971,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570034604,"creation_date":1570019830,"question_id":58201662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201662","body_markdown":"I am not familiar with perl.

So not on the entire website. \r\n\r\n**What have I tried?** \r\n**1:** Fixed positioning, but then it shows up on the `entire page`, `z-index` does not work with `fixed`. \r\n**2:** `Relative` positioning on the `parent` and `absolute` on the child but then the `object div` does not go down the page when I scroll.\r\n\r\n**Visual representation::**\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n**On scroll down:**\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jaNzw.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/sqnnA.png\r\n\r\n**React Component:**\r\n\r\n    &lt;div className=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div className=&quot;container--object&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;img src={object}/&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n**CSS**\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      min-height: 100vh;\r\n      position: relative;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .container--object {\r\n      position: absolute;\r\n      top: 50px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy parent component is the homepage.

Then they were trying to prevent me from using NPM due to previous Devs may have touched `jQuery` source code.\r\n\r\nSo here is the question: now there are 3 things about `jQuery` for me:\r\n\r\n1. the minified `jQuery 3.1.1` exists in the local file\r\n\r\n2. minified `jQuery 3.1.1` downloaded by NPM\r\n\r\n3. `jQuery` restored in pipeline\r\n\r\nAre they the same? I&#39;ve compared 1 and 2 use a code comparison tool and they are exactly the same, meaning in this case 1 has not been touched by previous dev.

Because you do not specify, my best guess is the program attempts to read a set of arguments from the command line, eg:\r\n\r\n    argv[0]          argv[1]   argv[2]   argv[3]\r\n    &lt;program&gt;.exe    1         +         2\r\n\r\nThen convert the values read into variables, and perform a math operation using two numerics and a math operator such as `+` or `-`.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is the basic goal, the following example simplifies your existing code to perform these steps.  Note corrections to the argument input count test, and lower down, the looping indexes:  \r\n\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    /// test using:\r\n

a component library, almost always one or multiple components like `Dashboard` are exported as a module (in your case with UMD also on the global scope) and the package consumer provides the React runtime. That also means, you can rely on the React environment in the library - just pass in props to your root component from the client.\r\n\r\nIf you really wanted to call a public method on a class component imperatively from another component, you could do that with [refs][1], as you said.\r\n\r\n[Playground][6]\r\n\r\nDashboard with public `changeColor` method:\r\n```\r\nclass Dashboard extends React.Component&lt;{}, State&gt; {\r\n  ...\r\n  changeColor = (): void =&gt; {\r\n    this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({\r\n      colorToggled: !prevState.colorToggled\r\n    }));\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(for function components there is [useImperativeHandle][2])\r\n\r\nAdd a ref to Dashboard and invoke `changeColor`:\r\n```\r\nconst App = () =&gt; {\r\n  let compRef = React.createRef&lt;ColorComp&gt;();\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; compRef.current!.changeColor()}&gt;\r\n        Toggle color\r\n      &lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;ColorComp ref={compRef} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are possibly much more alternatives, to name only a few: \r\n\r\n- [Custom DOM events][3] (compare [Microfrontends][5]),\r\n- [window.postMessage][4] communication between window objects, \r\n- Register a method callback on `window` in `componentDidMount`\r\n\r\nThese have to be justified somehow, as they add complexity and coupling to the architecture. So I would stick to the first section (via props and/or refs), unless you really have special requirements.\r\n\r\nHope, that helps.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#accessing-refs\r\n  [2]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useimperativehandle\r\n  [3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events\r\n  [4]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage\r\n  [5]: https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html\r\n  [6]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?jsx=2#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAKjgQwM5wEoFNkGN4BmUEIcARFDvmQNwBQokscA3nJQHYAmWUcAvnCIlylPDAC0XErToNw0eGQB0AelQwAngBssqZblSpZdLWCxwAyjGQwLAXlZ04cXBG3QAKhADmP3VwAXHAARhDuOBz0-PR0uNpo6AAiaAAWYchQXC5YAB523OjY4soAwiSQHFgcMAA8LPwANFY2dgB8Ti4atg6dLq7uXr7+WEFCyNqoWM4CsS6cPFAAFACUffNYMACuUBxwSzP9cLVcwABurglGAHLIIFj2ZACCYGBkbYdHx6kAjG3lHj4MGGAWCLGsUGAHB8SxgqWA+m6dgMgyg3j8ARW-Fqql+Hy+x1UpzO+P6K3oLn4chcuFSyGhWAB0DgjlWwTOEGA2XsHRYnzhCOUUxg1h6SzAlDOorsLI6Sz5BLcgPRIzGAEIJVgpa0sCjlSDRp9+CtyTMYnQqXEIBwNHAXmAWfs1jy+rp4G5wNgCI7ivgDGI7F7ailUOkIJkuG1VhT2JsdnsDkcTudSUmQlsYMC9tbStpgLgANb2FirWUDT1YAgGHacGBqgx0hlM5ZY1NfFW6AaAz4uHHpzPWtu9kNhiOxgjFj1gL2CVRtGgsVRIWoAcQ8IQm5XAcDniFUVKTRJTM1N5roC14S1q9p3bWa0lwW3uNWUPk2AFFdM+YAAhTQASS4JYKHCGAyBNeggA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201621/how-do-i-make-a-class-component-method-accessible-outside-of-the-component-in-re/58205390#58205390","title":"How do I make a class component method accessible outside of the component in React and Typescript?"}],"owner":{"reputation":420,"user_id":11584105,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ca483fc805e5996f52c4f8565be7f27?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mr. Robot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11584105/mr-robot"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58205390,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570048281,"creation_date":1570019619,"last_edit_date":1570048281,"question_id":58201621,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201621","body_markdown":"I need to be able to call a class component&#39;s methods outside of the class as I am building a component library that compiles to `umd` and then is available via the `window` object.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the methods in my classes are private but I want to make them &#39;callable&#39; from outside.

So in other words, the order of the items pulled out doesn&#39;t matter (for the example, 1, 1, 4 pulled from the first index starting with array1 would be considered the same as 4, 1, 1 pulled from the first index starting with array3 and working backwards).  \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    //Example: \r\n\r\n    //in this case, N = 3 and M = 5, 3, 4 for array1, array2, and array3, respectively \r\n\r\n    array1 = [1, 3, 5, 6, 7];\r\n    array2 = [1, 5, 3];\r\n    array3 = [4, 3, 7, 9];\r\n\r\n    //Example output using arrays above:\r\n    [1, 1, 4]\r\n    [3, 1, 4]\r\n    [5, 1, 4]\r\n    [6, 1, 4]\r\n    [7, 1, 4]\r\n    [1, 5, 4]\r\n    [1, 3, 4]\r\n    [3, 5, 4]\r\n    //etc...\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect the output of each recursive call to be one item from each Array, resulting in a unique combination of items.\r\n\r\nFor example, each call would output an array of N length, with one value from each array.

I do `graph = JanusGraphFactory.open(..../janusgraph-hbase-solr.properties)` and create `g = graph.traversal()`\r\n\r\nI am able to create my own vertex and edges and list them, but not able to list anything related to atlas ie: entities etc. \r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?\r\nI want to connect to existing atlas setup and traverse the graph with gremlin cli. \r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201585/connecting-to-apache-atlas-hbase-solr-setup-with-gremlin-cli","title":"Connecting to apache atlas + hbase + solr setup with gremlin cli"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html","epub","turnjs"],"owner":{"reputation":1051,"user_id":10214713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30d986174a6e05955dc870ef323d8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alireza Bideli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10214713/alireza-bideli"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1051,"user_id":10214713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30d986174a6e05955dc870ef323d8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alireza Bideli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10214713/alireza-bideli"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"bounty_amount":50,"bounty_closes_date":1572339286,"answer_count":0,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571734486,"creation_date":1570019480,"last_edit_date":1570429571,"question_id":58201584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201584","body_markdown":"I have an .epub file that does not have any effect or animation while user turns between the pages \r\n\r\n\r\nI use [Turn.js][1] library for it be it does not work .I can not open it with eBook readers softwares.\r\n\r\nHere is my Epub folder Directory \r\n\r\n**Before** add Turn.js library\r\n\r\n [![befor][2]][2]   \r\n\r\n  **After** add Turn.js library  \r\n [![after][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here is my **chap_0001.xhtml** Html code\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;How to Win Every Argument&lt;/title&gt;\r\n        &lt;link href=&quot;style/style.css&quot;
