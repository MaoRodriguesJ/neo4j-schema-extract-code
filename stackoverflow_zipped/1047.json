An array denotes the bulb number from 0 to (N-1). Initially all bulbs are turned off and are switched on from index 0 of array.

GAS has different syntaxes; GCC normally puts it in `.syntax unified` mode IIRC, so that&#39;s the context for inline asm)\r\n\r\n`ADD r2,r2,#3` is exactly identical to `ADD r2,#3` for assemblers that accept both.  Keil&#39;s assembler may not, IDK.\r\n\r\nKeil vs. GAS / GCC use different directives, but mostly the same syntax for instructions I think.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSome thumb instruction encodings only have room to encode 2 operands, so they are like `dst += immediate` not `dst = src + immediate` at the machine-code level.  At the asm source level, Keil documents it as `ADDS Rd, Rd, #imm` (in the page you linked).\r\n\r\nThe other 16-bit encoding of `adds` only has a 3-bit immediate (`0..7`), but uses those bits to allow encoding a separate destination, `adds Rd, Rn, #imm`.\r\n\r\n(Note that `add` instead of `adds` generally requires a 32-bit instruction, so don&#39;t do that unless you need to preserve flags.)\r\n\r\nI mention this because your previous questions were about Cortex-M.  GAS probably still accepts `add r2, #3` when assembling in ARM mode.

What is the best way to signal to Sonarqube that that method never returns, so that the subsequent static analysis is a little more accurate?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293294/hint-to-sonarqube-that-a-java-method-never-returns","title":"hint to Sonarqube that a Java method never returns"},{"tags":["python","mapping","interpolation","timedelta","gantt-chart"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570565526,"post_id":58293293,"comment_id":102950896,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293293/map-python-timedelta-objects-onto-numerical-interval#comment102950896_58293293"},{"owner":{"reputation":556,"user_id":2143578,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7cfb98ea957d0c10697ea721726c7f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zubo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2143578/zubo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570566664,"post_id":58293293,"comment_id":102951394,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293293/map-python-timedelta-objects-onto-numerical-interval#comment102951394_58293293"},{"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570566905,"post_id":58293293,"comment_id":102951499,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293293/map-python-timedelta-objects-onto-numerical-interval#comment102951499_58293293"}],"owner":{"reputation":556,"user_id":2143578,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7cfb98ea957d0c10697ea721726c7f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zubo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2143578/zubo"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570564824,"creation_date":1570564824,"question_id":58293293,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293293","body_markdown":"I have a bunch of `timedelta` objects. \r\n\r\n - I want to visualize them by showing them as bars on a common linear time axis (think something like [Gantt charts][1]).  \r\n\r\n - The end product should be an SVG with a defined total width W (so a time axis with width W, and boxes above it, visualizing the timedeltas). \r\n\r\n - The solution should be as precise as possible. \r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the best way to do this? \r\n\r\nSo far, the best way I&#39;ve come up with is to \r\n\r\n 1. *somehow extract an absolute numerical value from all `timedelta` objects (something like Unix Epoch time maybe)*\r\n \r\n 2. *use the first and last timestamp to define the time range*\r\n\r\n 3. create a mapping function from the absolute, interpolating the values (something like [this][2]) \r\n\r\n 4. map the absolute values onto the defined SVG width\r\n\r\n 5. create the SVG objects using `svgwrite` \r\n\r\nAfter googling for a bit, steps 1 and 2 seem problematic - I&#39;m not even sure `timedelta`s have an absolute numeric value. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Pert_example_gantt_chart.gif\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1969296/2143578","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293293/map-python-timedelta-objects-onto-numerical-interval","title":"Map Python timedelta objects onto numerical interval"},{"tags":["c#","azure-devops","code-coverage","vstest"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6706,"user_id":368354,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3bzWq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lennart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/368354/lennart"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570600329,"creation_date":1570600329,"answer_id":58297802,"question_id":58293290,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58297802","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t say what exactly is wrong with your excluded paths, but I know that the syntax is very finnicky.

It would sometimes show the update and other times not.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport {compose, graphql} from &quot;react-apollo&quot;;\r\nimport gql from &quot;graphql-tag&quot;;\r\nimport React from &quot;react&quot;;\r\n\r\nexport const EditCard = (props) =&gt; {\r\n        const handleSave = () =&gt; {\r\n            props.update({\r\n                givenName :&#39;someGivenName&#39;,\r\n                //middleName omitted on purpose \r\n                familyName :&#39;someFamilyName&#39;,\r\n            });\r\n        };\r\n    return (\r\n        &lt;&gt;...more stuff here...&lt;/&gt;\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const card = gql`\r\n    fragment card on Identity{\r\n        givenName\r\n        middleName\r\n        familyName\r\n    }\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport const CardsGraphQL = gql`\r\n    query GerCards {\r\n        cards: listIdentitys(filter: {type: {eq: &quot;CARD&quot;}}) {\r\n            items {\r\n                ...card\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ${card}\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport const UpdateCardGraphQL = gql`\r\n    mutation UpdateCard($input: UpdateIdentityInput!) {\r\n        updateObject: updateIdentity(input: $input) {\r\n            ...card\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ${card}\r\n`;\r\n\r\n\r\nexport const selectConfig = () =&gt; {\r\n    return {\r\n        options: {\r\n            fetchPolicy: &#39;cache-and-network&#39;,\r\n        },\r\n        props: (props) =&gt; {\r\n            return {\r\n                cards: props.data.cards ? props.data.cards.items : [],\r\n            };\r\n        },\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const updateConfig = (query) =&gt; {\r\n    return {\r\n        options: {\r\n            update: (cache, {data: {updateObject}}) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n                // Read query from cache\r\n                const data = cache.readQuery({query});\r\n\r\n                // Add updated object to the cache\r\n                data.cards.items = data.cards.items.map(item =&gt; item.id === updateObject.id ? updateObject : item);\r\n\r\n                //Overwrite the cache with the new results\r\n                cache.writeQuery({query, data});\r\n\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        props: (props) =&gt; {\r\n            return {\r\n                update: (input) =&gt; {\r\n                    props.mutate({\r\n                        variables: {input},\r\n                        optimisticResponse: () =&gt; ({\r\n                            updateObject: input,\r\n                        }),\r\n                    });\r\n                },\r\n            };\r\n        },\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default compose(\r\n    graphql(CardsGraphQL, selectConfig),\r\n    graphql(UpdateCardGraphQL, updateConfig(CardsGraphQL)))\r\n(EditCard);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor GraphQL this mutation seems to run without problems and the result in the dynamoDB is what I expect:\r\n\r\n{\r\ngivenName :&#39;someGivenName&#39;,\r\nfamilyName :&#39;someFamilyName&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\nHowever the cache is not always updated with the mutation result and the apollo-client shows the warning:\r\n\r\n&quot;Missing field middleName in {...&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I add the middleName field, the warning goes away and the cache updates correctly but the result in the dynamoDB is:\r\n\r\n{\r\ngivenName :&#39;someGivenName&#39;,\r\nmiddleName : null,\r\nfamilyName :&#39;someFamilyName&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis approach results in additional complexity in my client that I would like to avoid maintaining.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else have this problem?

Tap OK to allow the volume \r\nto be increased above safe levels\r\nCancel OK\r\n```\r\nI couldn&#39;t find any documentation about this in the the android developer portal, all I could find are some  random articles citing the European regulations like this [one](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-automatically-disable-the-high-volume-warning-without-root/):\r\n```\r\nAccording to regulations set by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standarisation (CENELEC), all electronic devices capable of media playback sold after February 2013 must have a default output volume level of a maximum 85 dB. Users can choose to override the warning to increase the volume to a maximum of 100 dB, but in doing so the warning must re-appear after 20 hours of music playback.\r\n``` \r\n So I need to figure out reliably what that number is, so I don&#39;t ever result in a volume change that would show this dialog, but I also don&#39;t want to just use step 9 as the max volume and, then find out that it&#39;s not the right value for another phone. Does the android API expose the max safe stream volume anywhere? If not, then do they at least document the step number that corresponds to it for different phone?\r\n\r\nThanks!

So I configured Session Factory, jpaVendorAdapter, DataSource, PlatformTransactionManager beans.\r\n\r\nPlatformTransactionManager looks like:\r\n\r\n        @Bean(name = &quot;transactionManager&quot;)\r\n        public PlatformTransactionManager hibernateTransactionManager() {\r\n            HibernateTransactionManager transactionManager = new HibernateTransactionManager();\r\n    //        JpaTransactionManager transactionManager = new JpaTransactionManager();\r\n    \r\n            transactionManager.setSessionFactory(sessionFactory().getObject());\r\n    //        transactionManager.setDataSource(this.dataSource());\r\n    \r\n            return transactionManager;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSo, this configuration doesn&#39;t allow Spring Data save method works correctly. It doesn&#39;t throws any exception when I execute It, but It doesn&#39;t insert data as well, only update table structure. From the other hand If I use \r\n\r\n    JpaTransactionManager transactionManager = new JpaTransactionManager();\r\n\r\ninstead of HibernateTransactionManager It works fine, but other methods, that use my autowired Session Factory give me an exception: &quot;javax.persistence.TransactionRequiredException: no transaction is in progress&quot;\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    @Transactional\r\n    public List find() {\r\n        return this.getCSession().createNativeQuery(&quot;SELECT CAST(animals.rabbit.id as VARCHAR) AS id, name FROM animals.rabbit&quot;).getResultList();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, I&#39;m interesting to use both these methods.

It does not remove the keyword from the string.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293234/c-find-keywords-in-a-string-and-remove-it","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"c# find keywords in a string and remove it"},{"tags":["python","join","datatables","fits"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4548,"user_id":6817835,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YoeSY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"aws_apprentice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6817835/aws-apprentice"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570564732,"post_id":58293233,"comment_id":102950596,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293233/combing-two-fits-tables-on-a-single-column-entry-using-python#comment102950596_58293233"},{"owner":{"reputation":10162,"user_id":982257,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRf2i.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iguananaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/982257/iguananaut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570639891,"post_id":58293233,"comment_id":102979179,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293233/combing-two-fits-tables-on-a-single-column-entry-using-python#comment102979179_58293233"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10162,"user_id":982257,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRf2i.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iguananaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/982257/iguananaut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570640147,"post_id":58306723,"comment_id":102979287,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293233/combing-two-fits-tables-on-a-single-column-entry-using-python/58306723#comment102979287_58306723"},{"owner":{"reputation":10162,"user_id":982257,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRf2i.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iguananaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/982257/iguananaut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570640265,"post_id":58306723,"comment_id":102979342,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293233/combing-two-fits-tables-on-a-single-column-entry-using-python/58306723#comment102979342_58306723"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":510,"user_id":6105404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQZmQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"npross","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6105404/npross"},"last_editor":{"reputation":510,"user_id":6105404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQZmQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"npross","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6105404/npross"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571221080,"last_edit_date":1571221080,"creation_date":1570632167,"answer_id":58306723,"question_id":58293233,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58306723","body_markdown":"Turns out turning the lists into DataFrames and then doing a `pandas` merge, does work very well::\r\n\r\n    from   pandas import DataFrame\r\n    from astropy.table import Table\r\n \r\n    list_a_table = Table(list_a)\r\n    list_a_df    = DataFrame(np.array(list_a_table))\r\n    list_b_table = Table(list_b)\r\n    list_b_df    = DataFrame(np.array(list_b_table))\r\n\r\n    df_merge = pd.merge(list_a_df, list_b_df, on=&quot;name&quot;)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293233/combing-two-fits-tables-on-a-single-column-entry-using-python/58306723#58306723","title":"Combing two FITS tables on a single column entry using Python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10162,"user_id":982257,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRf2i.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iguananaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/982257/iguananaut"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570641474,"creation_date":1570641474,"answer_id":58309198,"question_id":58293233,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58309198","body_markdown":"Assume &quot;List_a&quot; and &quot;List_b&quot; are both tables, and that you want to get the &quot;ages&quot; from &quot;List_b&quot; for entries where both &quot;List_a&quot; and &quot;List_b&quot;, you can use Pandas as in your approach.  But Astropy also has a built-in [`join` operation](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/operations.html#join) for tables.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m guessing you have something akin to:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from astropy.table import Table\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; tab_a = Table({&#39;NAME&#39;: [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;]})\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; tab_b = Table({&#39;NAME&#39;: [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;], &#39;AGE&#39;: [1, 3, 4]})\r\n\r\nIf you are reading from a FITS file you can use, for example [`Table.read`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/unified.html#getting-started-with-table-i-o) to read a FITS table into a `Table` object (among other approaches).\r\n\r\nThen you can use `join` to join the two tables where their name is the same:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from astropy.table import join\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; tab_c = join(tab_a, tab_b, keys=&#39;NAME&#39;)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; tab_c\r\n    &lt;Table length=2&gt;\r\n    NAME  AGE\r\n    str1 int64\r\n    ---- -----\r\n       A     1\r\n       C     3\r\n\r\nI think that maybe be what you&#39;re asking.\r\n\r\nYou could then write this out to a an ASCII format (similar to in your example) like:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; tab_c.write(sys.stdout, format=&#39;ascii.no_header&#39;)\r\n    A 1\r\n    C 3\r\n\r\n(Here you could replace `sys.stdout` with a filename; I was just using it for demonstration purposes).  As you can see there are many [built-in output formats for Tables](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/unified.html#built-in-table-readers-writers), though you can also define your own.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of goodies like this already in Astropy that should save you in many cases from reinventing the wheel when it comes to table manipulation and file format handling--just peruse the docs to get a better feel :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293233/combing-two-fits-tables-on-a-single-column-entry-using-python/58309198#58309198","title":"Combing two FITS tables on a single column entry using Python"}],"owner":{"reputation":510,"user_id":6105404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQZmQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"npross","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6105404/npross"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10162,"user_id":982257,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRf2i.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iguananaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/982257/iguananaut"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58306723,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571221080,"creation_date":1570564560,"last_edit_date":1570640294,"question_id":58293233,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293233","body_markdown":"I read in two .FITS tables and place them into &quot;list_a&quot; and &quot;list_b&quot;.

The question is how and where to go from UIKit coordinates to Metal&#39;s clip-space coordinates.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start by defining these different spaces. Note that below, I actually *am* using NDC coordinates for the sake of simplicity, since in this particular case, we aren&#39;t introducing perspective by returning vertex positions with `w != 1`. (Here I&#39;m referring to the `w` coordinate of the clip-space position; in the following discussion, `w` always refers to the view width).\r\n\r\n[![UIKit to Metal NDC transform][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWe pass the vertices into our vertex shader in whatever space is convenient (this is often called _model space_). Since we&#39;re working in 2D, we don&#39;t need the usual series of transformations to world space, then eye space. Essentially, the coordinates of the UIKit view are our model space, world space, and eye space all in one.\r\n\r\nWe need some kind of orthographic projection matrix to move from this space into clip space. If we strip out the unnecessary parts related to the z axis and assume that our view bounds&#39; origin is (0, 0), we come up with the following transformation:\r\n\r\n[![UIKit to NDC transformation as a matrix][2]][2] \r\n\r\nWe could pass this matrix into our vertex shader, or we could do the transformation prior to sending the vertices to the GPU. Considering how little data is involved, it really doesn&#39;t matter at this point. In fact, using a matrix at all is a little wasteful, since we can just transform each coordinate with a couple of multiplies and an add. Here&#39;s how that might look in a Metal vertex function:\r\n\r\n    float2 inverseViewSize(1.0f / width, 1.0f / height); // passed in a buffer\r\n    float clipX = (2.0f * in.position.x * inverseViewSize.x) - 1.0f;\r\n    float clipY = (2.0f * -in.position.y * inverseViewSize.y) + 1.0f;\r\n    float4 clipPosition(clipX, clipY, 0.0f, 1.0f);\r\n\r\nJust to verify that we get the correct results from this transformation, let&#39;s plug in the upper-left and lower-right points of our view to ensure they wind up at the extremities of clip space (by linearity, if these points transform correctly, so will all others):\r\n\r\n[![Some sample points transformed][3]][3]\r\n\r\nThese points appear correct, so we&#39;re done. If you&#39;re concerned about the apparent distortion introduced by this transformation, note that it is exactly canceled by the [viewport transformation](https://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_transform.html#wincoord) that happens prior to rasterization.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/es7CO.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/b1OKV.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/r342B.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293221/convert-screen-coordinates-to-metals-normalized-device-coordinates/58293992#58293992","title":"Convert screen coordinates to Metal&#39;s Normalized Device Coordinates"}],"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":1812195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1897fa02fb55f803c8028012045696ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Saumya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1812195/saumya"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570568808,"creation_date":1570564501,"question_id":58293221,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293221","body_markdown":"I am trying to render a 2D triangle using user touches.

When a frame is dropped, this causes the program to display the last &quot;good&quot; frame which results in the display freezing. This is probably a hardware or bandwidth issue but we can alleviate some of this with software. Here are some possible changes:\r\n\r\n**1. Set maximum buffer size**\r\n\r\nWe set the `cv2.videoCapture()` object to have a limited buffer size with the `cv2.CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE` parameter. The idea is that by limiting the buffer, we will always have the latest frame. This can also help to alleviate the problem of frames randomly jumping ahead.\r\n\r\n**2. Set frame retrieval delay**\r\n\r\nCurrently, I believe the `read()` is reading too fast even though it is in its own dedicated thread. This may be one reason why all the frames appear to pool up and suddenly burst in the next frame. For instance, say in a one second time interval, it may produce 15 new frames but in the next one second interval, only 3 frames are returned. This may be due to the network packet frame loss so to ensure that we obtain constant frame rates, we simply add a delay in the frame retrieval thread. A delay to obtain roughly `~30` FPS does a good job to &quot;normalize&quot; the frame rate and smooth the transition between frames incase there is packet loss. \r\n\r\n**Note:** We should try to match the frame rate of the stream but I&#39;m not sure what the FPS of the webcam is so I just guessed `30` FPS. Also, there is usually a &quot;direct&quot; stream link instead of going through a intermediate webserver which can greatly improve performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you try using a saved `.mp4` video file, you will notice that there is no jitter. This confirms my suspicion that the problem is most likely due to network latency. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom threading import Thread\r\nimport cv2, time\r\n\r\nclass ThreadedCamera(object):\r\n    def __init__(self, src=0):\r\n        self.capture = cv2.VideoCapture(src)\r\n        self.capture.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE, 2)\r\n       \r\n        # FPS = 1/X\r\n        # X = desired FPS\r\n        self.FPS = 1/30\r\n        self.FPS_MS = int(self.FPS * 1000)\r\n        \r\n        # Start frame retrieval thread\r\n        self.thread = Thread(target=self.update, args=())\r\n        self.thread.daemon = True\r\n        self.thread.start()\r\n        \r\n    def update(self):\r\n        while True:\r\n            if self.capture.isOpened():\r\n                (self.status, self.frame) = self.capture.read()\r\n            time.sleep(self.FPS)\r\n            \r\n    def show_frame(self):\r\n        cv2.imshow(&#39;frame&#39;, self.frame)\r\n        cv2.waitKey(self.FPS_MS)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n    src = &#39;https://videos3.earthcam.com/fecnetwork/9974.flv/chunklist_w1421640637.m3u8&#39;\r\n    threaded_camera = ThreadedCamera(src)\r\n    while True:\r\n        try:\r\n            threaded_camera.show_frame()\r\n        except AttributeError:\r\n            pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4c0ca.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293187/opencv-real-time-streaming-video-capture-is-slow-how-to-drop-frames-or-get-sync/58386085#58386085","title":"OpenCV real time streaming video capture is slow.

Am I missing a solution for these simple requirements?\r\n\r\nThere is no simple solution. You would basically need to have each app have its own copy of the shared data (to deal with potential uninstalls) and have some sort of synchronization protocol so each app in the suite can inform others about changes to their copy of the data.\r\n\r\nUsing SAF is the simplest approach for your scenario. Or, move the data off the device into &quot;the cloud&quot;.\r\n\r\n&gt; My understanding is that this also forces the user to pick something he should have no knowledge of \r\n\r\nIt is the user&#39;s device. It is the user&#39;s storage. If you put files in a user-visible location on the user&#39;s storage, **they are the user&#39;s files**.

Then when you leave the page the `StreamSubscription` is canceled in the `.dispose()` method. If the `Observable` that the `StreamSubscription` is listening too already has a value then the `StreamSubscription` skips the first value by using `.skip(1)`.\r\n\r\nWhen I leave the page, and `dispose()` is called, I have confirmed that the stream is closed. Then when I go back to the page the `StreamSubscription` is created using the `.skip(1)` method, which is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever, from there on out the new `StreamSubscription` created with `.skip(1)` never receives any data. It&#39;s as if I didn&#39;t even setup the subscription. It doesn&#39;t do this if I take the `.skip(1)` out.\r\n\r\nI have experimented and it seems that if I don&#39;t cancel the subscription in the `.dispose()` method then everything works fine. But it&#39;s when I do cancel it that it doesn&#39;t work. And like I said, if I take out the `.skip(1)` it all works fine. I can keep the `.cancel()` in the dispose method and there are no problems.\r\n\r\nWhat is causing this behavior?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293163/calling-cancel-on-streamsubscription-prevents-additional-subscriptions","title":"Calling .cancel() on StreamSubscription prevents additional subscriptions"},{"tags":["r","loops","for-loop","group-by"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16611,"user_id":6851825,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H8RgwclGboU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE4/ozMptPuddJ0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jon Spring","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6851825/jon-spring"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570564791,"post_id":58293160,"comment_id":102950622,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293160/processing-a-data-frame-in-r-by-subgroup-is-it-possible-to-get-rid-of-the-for#comment102950622_58293160"},{"owner":{"reputation":597,"user_id":3245256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d0358a02c42afeea4b4bb3920e6337b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3245256","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3245256/user3245256"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":16611,"user_id":6851825,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H8RgwclGboU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE4/ozMptPuddJ0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jon Spring","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6851825/jon-spring"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570566178,"post_id":58293160,"comment_id":102951170,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293160/processing-a-data-frame-in-r-by-subgroup-is-it-possible-to-get-rid-of-the-for#comment102951170_58293160"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":31327,"user_id":210673,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fGuXb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aaron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/210673/aaron"},"last_editor":{"reputation":31327,"user_id":210673,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fGuXb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aaron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/210673/aaron"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570575978,"last_edit_date":1570575978,"creation_date":1570575329,"answer_id":58294973,"question_id":58293160,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58294973","body_markdown":"Maybe this example is too simple, but in this case, the only thing you need to pull out is the imputation.\r\n\r\n    my_impute &lt;- function(x) {\r\n      which_nas &lt;- which(is.na(x))\r\n      for (na in which_nas) {\r\n        if (na == 1) {\r\n          x[na] &lt;- mean(c(x[na + 1], x[na + 2]), na.rm = TRUE)\r\n        } else if (na == length(x)) {\r\n          x[na] &lt;- mean(c(x[na - 2], x[na - 1]), na.rm = TRUE)\r\n        } else {\r\n          x[na] &lt;- mean(c(x[na - 1], x[na + 1]), na.rm = TRUE)\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      x\r\n    }\r\n  \r\nThen you just need to group appropriately and impute and summarize.\r\n\r\n    x2 &lt;- x %&gt;% group_by(group) %&gt;% mutate_at(v_vars, my_impute) %&gt;%\r\n      group_by(group, attrib) \r\n    full_join(x2 %&gt;% summarize_at(v_vars, mean),\r\n              x2 %&gt;% summarize_at(n_vars, sum))\r\n\r\nMy usual method for things like this, where similar calculations need to be on a bunch of columns, is to put it in long format.

Add the Xamarin Forms project to all your projects.\r\n2. Create an interface `ICustomClientHandler` in the Core project\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Net.Http;\r\n\r\nnamespace Test\r\n{\r\n    public interface ICustomClientHandler\r\n    {\r\n        HttpClientHandler GetHandler();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Then create a `CustomClientHandler` in the Droid project, which will be the Android part of the dependency service that will help you retrieve the native AndroidClientHandler\r\n```\r\nusing System.Net.Http;\r\nusing Xamarin.Android.Net;\r\nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;\r\nusing Xamarin.Forms;\r\nusing Test;\r\n[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(Test.Droid.CustomClientHandler))]\r\nnamespace Test.Droid\r\n{\r\n    public class CustomClientHandler : ICustomClientHandler\r\n    {\r\n        public HttpClientHandler GetHandler()\r\n        {\r\n            return new AndroidClientHandler();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Implement an iOS version as well in a similar way, but it will instead `return new HttpClientHandler();`\r\n5. Finally, use the code as shown, in your Core project:\r\n```\r\nvar clientHandler = DependencyService.Get&lt;ICustomClientHandler&gt;().GetHandler();\r\npublic static MobileServiceClient MobileServiceAndroid =\r\n            new MobileServiceClient(AppConstants.AZURE_PRODUCTION_WEB_API_URL, clientHandler);\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223264/11104068\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/native-views/code","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293151/xamarin-android-cannot-pull-table-from-azure-database-in-android-10-q/58297222#58297222","title":"Xamarin.Android Cannot pull table from Azure database in Android 10 Q"}],"owner":{"reputation":144,"user_id":10530848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/q35D5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Razvan Emil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10530848/razvan-emil"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1096,"user_id":11104068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gueSe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saamer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11104068/saamer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570732158,"creation_date":1570564156,"last_edit_date":1570732158,"question_id":58293151,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293151","body_markdown":"I did read that because lack of support for Netcore 2.1 the \r\n\r\n    myItemsList = await App.MobileServiceAndroid.GetTable&lt;MyTable&gt;().ToListAsync();\r\n\r\ndoes not currently work on Android, and there is a workaround to pass an HttpClientHandler() in the constructor of the MobileServiceClient, and so I did like this:\r\n\r\n    public static MobileServiceClient MobileServiceAndroid =\r\n                new MobileServiceClient(AppConstants.AZURE_PRODUCTION_WEB_API_URL, new HttpClientHandler());\r\n\r\nBut this is incomplete,its still not working, what exactly do I have to do to make this work, any guidance is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293151/xamarin-android-cannot-pull-table-from-azure-database-in-android-10-q","title":"Xamarin.Android Cannot pull table from Azure database in Android 10 Q"},{"tags":["php","symfony","symfony4"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":12184013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTtlF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Awk_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184013/awk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570566842,"post_id":58293595,"comment_id":102951474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293150/array-of-checkboxes-give-unexpected-values-at-submit-event/58293595#comment102951474_58293595"},{"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":43,"user_id":12184013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTtlF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Awk_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184013/awk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570566950,"post_id":58293595,"comment_id":102951519,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293150/array-of-checkboxes-give-unexpected-values-at-submit-event/58293595#comment102951519_58293595"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570605464,"last_edit_date":1570605464,"creation_date":1570566190,"answer_id":58293595,"question_id":58293150,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58293595","body_markdown":"`ChoiceType`, imho, is the wrong form type for this (and it&#39;s a common mistake), since it&#39;s used to select entries from a larger set of entries.

Therefore, the OpenSSL-statement which can be used to decrypt the posted ciphertext is:\r\n\r\n    openssl enc -aes-128-ctr -a -A -in Cipherbase64.txt -out PlainText.txt -K 31323334353637383930303030303030 -iv 31323334353637383930303030303030 -d\r\n\r\nThe decrypted text is: \r\n\r\n    {&quot;sign&quot;:&quot;13adab9285fe86206b73e029ff0d290fc0e31237&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;:1570608017,&quot;logid&quot;:&quot;MTU3MDYwODA2MjAzMjAuMTMzMjE0Nzc2OTIxNTgxNDY=&quot;,&quot;uk&quot;:3012946979,&quot;shareid&quot;:547370362,&quot;fid_list&quot;:&quot;[\\&quot;482622974717034\\&quot;]&quot;,&quot;input&quot;:&quot;aaxb&quot;,&quot;vcode&quot;:&quot;33324238656332346361663334656637323237633636373637643239666664336662393132313032313738303030303030303030303030303031353730363038303530B0D6C0036A1909217D2CDCD5B76B46FB&quot;}\r\n\r\nwhich can be easily verified [here][4].\r\n\r\n[0]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-enc.html\r\n[1]: https://filebin.net/k96dolsetwreu8es\r\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_(CTR)\r\n[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Block_Chaining_(CBC)\r\n[4]: https://cryptii.com/pipes/aes-encryption\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58293148/failed-to-decrypt-aes-encrypted-file-by-javascript-using-openssl/58293644#58293644","title":"Failed to decrypt AES encrypted file by Javascript using OpenSSL"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12184041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33366c8c950e8c2bd58218609d943cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user69485","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184041/user69485"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12184041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33366c8c950e8c2bd58218609d943cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user69485","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184041/user69485"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":85,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58293644,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570984416,"creation_date":1570564150,"last_edit_date":1570984416,"question_id":58293148,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58293148","body_markdown":"The ciphertext is encrypted by Javascript using the AES algorithm in hexadecimal format.
