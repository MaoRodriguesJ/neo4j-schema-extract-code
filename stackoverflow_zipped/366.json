is plain Semantic UI and very lightweight CSS. \r\n\r\nI am trying to put a list, which happens to be acting like a treeview, into a column and make it so that the list becomes scrollable if the height if its content exceeds the height of the parent column. I anticipate this being done with pure CSS. However, I can&#39;t seem to make it work. What am I doing wrong.\r\n\r\nHere is a cut down version - sorry about the billions of divs but thats how Semantic UI list works and I needed enough to make a decent height in the list element.\r\n\r\nRun the snippet to a new window then resize the window making it shorter by dragging the bottom edge upwards. You will see the bottom line of the grid moving to retrain its margin, and the cyan/blue border also moving up because its height=100% of parent and the parent height is being reduced.   When the cyan/blue border meets the magenta list element, we should get a vertical scroll bar somehow. \r\n \r\n\r\nEDIT: It appears that the issue relates to \r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;ui grid celled padded&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\ncombined with \r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter re-confirming I am not going mad and all one needs to do is set style @overflow-y: scroll@ on a plain div example, then returning to the demo below offline and chopping out all SUI bits then re-introducing, I came to this conclusion.\r\n\r\nSo re-coding it with plain \r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;ui grid&quot; style=&quot;height: 90%;&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nand removing the row divs seems to be the way ahead. In my use case I don&#39;t specifically need the grid @celled padded@ options so no harm done.\r\n\r\nHowever, in other cases wouldn&#39;t I want to be able to scroll over-long content in a fixed-height row ? Or am I overthinking this. Time for some coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal demo of the issue follows: \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n

This block executes regardless of the value of the disposing parameter.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; * **A conditional block that frees managed resources**. This block executes if the value of disposing is true.

Freeing these objects explicitly in the Dispose method\r\n&gt; releases them faster than if they were reclaimed non-deterministically\r\n&gt; by the garbage collector.\r\n\r\nSo certainly you should free any managed objects that are also disposable, but you _could_ also release any managed objects that use lots of memory or scarce resources.

It just a way to indicate the end of use of unmanaged resources that your object may be owning.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your object owns an unmanaged resource like for example a TCP socket, you can just let the garbage collector end everything when it runs, but the socket will be potentially alive until that happen, leading to a situation in which you have many open connections at a given time and the server is rejecting new ones.\r\n\r\nThis happens when you have a SqlConnection. When you call Dispose, it actually does not close the socket to SqlServer, but returns the connection to a pool where it can be reused. If you do not dispose SqlConnection, on a concurrent system there will be a moment where those objects are candidates to be garbage-collected, but because they are still there holding a connection, at some point you will have too many connections to SqlServer and it may start rejecting the new ones.\r\n\r\nSimilar thing with a SqlTransaction. If an exception is thrown before you call Commit or Rollback and Dispose is never called, the connection will potentially hold locks on tables, pages, etc... causing performance degradation in other connections.\r\n\r\nEven if you call Dispose, a SqlConnection object is still in memory, waiting to be collected, but unusable because the actual socket was returned to a pool. In fact if you Dispose and call any of its methods, it will throw an ObjectDisposedException, indicating that the object is unusable anymore.\r\n\r\nAnd object that implements IDisposable, either owns unamanged resources, or owns other objects that owns unamanged resources. So if you write a repository class that owns a SqlConnection, you will need to implement a cascade Dispose call.

the objects&#39;s references to null? \r\n\r\nI believe that&#39;s the best you can do at &quot;disposing&quot; of a managed resource, although you don&#39;t achieve anything in the process, as the garbage collector will do the actual heavy lifting, not you setting their references to null. *(The garbage collector will notice that the class itself holding these objects/resources is not used (no references), making this task meaningless)*\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n  [1]:

When you click on one of these category the list of categories is to be replaced with the Recipe List\r\n - Recipe List : displays a list of recipes for food in the Category selected. On clicking a recipe the Recipe List is replaced with the Recipe Details\r\n - Recipe Details : displays the details for the selected recipe\r\n\r\n\r\nI am trying to write this with Oracle Jet. I have created 3 modules\r\n\r\n - CategoryListModule and CategoryListItemModule (takes a categoryId)\r\n - RecipeListModule (takes a categoryId) and RecipeListItemModule (takes a recipeId)\r\n - RecipeDetailsModule (takes a recipeId)\r\n\r\nIn each module, it uses a 3rd party library to get data from the server.  For the first 2 modules, the main module gets a basic the list of items to display (i.e. CategoryList  gets the list of category IDS) and its sub-module gets the full information for that specific item (for example CategoryListItemModule calls the server to get all the display information for that category)\r\n\r\n*CategoryListModule.html*\r\n\r\n    &lt;oj-bind-for-each data=&quot;[[categoryIds]]&quot; as=&quot;categoryId&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;template&gt;\r\n            &lt;div data-bind=&quot;ojModule: \r\n                  {name: &#39;CategoryListItemModule&#39;, \r\n                   params:{categoryId: categoryId} }&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;                \r\n        &lt;/template&gt;\r\n    &lt;/oj-bind-for-each&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n*CategoryListItemModule.html*\r\n\r\n    &lt;div &gt;\r\n        &lt;div data-bind=&quot;text:categoryTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div data-bind=&quot;text:text:categoryDescription&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n*Router in main.js*\r\n\r\nI have created a Router in my main.js as follows\r\n\r\n    self.router = oj.Router.rootInstance;\r\n        self.router.configure({\r\n            &#39;categoryList&#39;: \r\n                {label: &#39;CategoryListModule&#39;, \r\n                 value: &#39;CategoryListModule&#39;, \r\n                 isDefault: true},\r\n            &#39;recipeList&#39;: \r\n                {label: &#39;RecipeListModule&#39;, \r\n                 value: &#39;RecipeListModule&#39;},\r\n            &#39;recipeDetails&#39;: \r\n                {label: &#39;RecipeDetailsModule&#39;, \r\n                value: &#39;RecipeDetailsModule&#39;}\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        var viewModel = {\r\n            router: router\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        Bootstrap.whenDocumentReady().then(\r\n            function() {\r\n                ko.applyBindings(viewModel); \r\n            }\r\n        );\r\n\r\n**ISSUE**\r\n\r\nI do not know how to code the user clicking on a specific category and take the user to the recipe list. \r\n\r\nIn Vue/Angular/React I coded it with a link around the html for the Category List Item that told the router where to go, for example in Vue it was something like the following\r\n\r\n    &lt;router-link :to=&quot;{ name: &#39;recipesList&#39;, params: { categoryId: categoryId}}&quot;&gt;      \r\n        &lt;div&gt;{{categoryTitle}}&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div&gt;{{categoryDescription}}&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/router-link&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI see examples with the Router, but it seems tied to Jet Components which I am not using. For example, in the Cookbook it has the Simple Router example\r\n\r\n    HTML\r\n    &lt;oj-bind-for-each data=&quot;[[router.states]]&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;template&gt;\r\n            &lt;oj-option value=&quot;[[$current.data.id]]&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;span&gt;&lt;oj-bind-text value=&quot;[[$current.data.label]]&quot;&gt;&lt;/oj-bind-text&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n            &lt;/oj-option&gt;\r\n        &lt;/template&gt;\r\n    &lt;/oj-bind-for-each&gt;\r\n\r\n    JAVA SCRIPT\r\n    var router = Router.rootInstance;\r\n    router.configure(\r\n    {\r\n      &#39;pref&#39;:  { label: &#39;Preface&#39;,   value: &#39;This is the Preface.&#39;,\r\n                 isDefault: true },\r\n      &#39;chap1&#39;: { label: &#39;Chapter 1&#39;, value: &#39;This is Chapter 1.&#39; },\r\n      &#39;chap2&#39;: { label: &#39;Chapter 2&#39;, value: &#39;This is Chapter 2.&#39; },\r\n      &#39;chap3&#39;: { label: &#39;Chapter 3&#39;, value: &#39;This is Chapter 3.&#39; }\r\n    });\r\n  \r\n    var viewModel =\r\n    {\r\n      router: router\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\nI presume in this example Oracle Jet framework is handling on the onclick of an item in the lists by the &quot;oj-option&quot; component as i see no &quot;onClick&quot; code anywhere.\r\n\r\nI see you can do event binding in Jet and in code instigate the router to route but I am sure this can not be the correct solution (for example, i could wrap my html with a &lt;div&gt; or &lt;a href&gt; and have an onClick listener in the JavaScript to tell the router to go to the next screen.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how to implement such navigation would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nI have got a lot further with this. I have found out how you can use code to tell the router to route. So in my &quot;CategoryListItemModule.html&quot; I have added an &quot;onClick&quot; to the div\r\n\r\n    &lt;div on-click=&quot;[[onClicked]]&gt;\r\n        &lt;div data-bind=&quot;text:categoryTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div data-bind=&quot;text:text:categoryDescription&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI have changed my router config in &quot;main.js&quot; to \r\n\r\n    self.router = oj.Router.rootInstance;\r\n        self.router.configure({\r\n            &#39;categoryList&#39;: \r\n                {label: &#39;CategoryListModule&#39;, \r\n                 value: &#39;CategoryListModule&#39;, \r\n                 isDefault: true},\r\n            &#39;recipeList/{id}&#39;: \r\n                {label: &#39;RecipeListModule&#39;, \r\n                 value: &#39;RecipeListModule&#39;},\r\n            &#39;recipeDetails&#39;: \r\n                {label: &#39;RecipeDetailsModule&#39;, \r\n                value: &#39;RecipeDetailsModule&#39;}\r\n        });\r\n\r\n\r\nIn &quot;CategoryListItemModule.js&quot; I get the router and implement the &quot;onClicked&quot; method\r\n\r\n    define([&#39;ojs/ojcore&#39;, &#39;ojs/ojrouter&#39;, &#39;knockout&#39;, &#39;],\r\n    function (oj, Router, ko) {\r\n        function AViewModel(params) {\r\n            ....\r\n            router = Router.rootInstance;\r\n            ....\r\n            this.onClicked= function(event) {\r\n                router.go(&#39;recipes/&#39;+ categoryId);\r\n            }\r\n            ....\r\n        };\r\n       ....\r\n\r\nNow when the user clicks on a specific category in the category list (with say id 123), the &quot;onClicked&quot; function is called which tells the router to route to &quot;/recipeList/123 which should load the RecipeListModule with the ID 123 accessible from inside that module.\r\n\r\nHowever this is still not working correctly as the Jet fails to find RecipeListModule .js/RecipeListModule.html as the path it uses to try and find those files in my project has an extra &quot;recipes&quot; in the path.  I have logged the following separate for this issue to simply this final piece.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58490944/oracle-jet-routing-is-adding-extra-folder-in-path-when-trying-to-get-child-modul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58451483/oracle-jet-how-do-i-create-a-master-detail-spa","title":"Oracle Jet how do i create a master detail SPA?"},{"tags":["ios","plist","external-accessory"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":638,"user_id":11767140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Tbfr3YlhoOs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/4_25j9xubwc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Garc&#237;a Bodego","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11767140/david-garc%c3%ada-bodego"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571406229,"post_id":58451481,"comment_id":103241883,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58451481/is-possible-to-change-info-plist-or-only-supported-external-accessory-protocols#comment103241883_58451481"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12238599,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jNYRuJmUPNA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3renKd8r_FYQtRpgN-p4P3khYwGClw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JingleBellAugust","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12238599/jinglebellaugust"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571403727,"creation_date":1571403727,"question_id":58451481,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58451481","body_markdown":"I have &quot;Supported external accessory protocols&quot; that, i think, call the same events.

For how to do this correctly also for cases like e.g. abbreviations, names with titles etc., please refer to other questions on this site, e.g. [this one][1]. This is only a very simple version, based on your conditions, which, I assume, will suffice for your task.\r\n\r\nAs you noticed, your code only works for one type of punctuation, because of the `if/elif/else` construct. But you do not need that at all! If e.g. there is no `?` in the text, then `split(&quot;? &quot;)` will just return the text as a whole (wrapped in a list). You could just remove the conditions, or iterate a list of possible sentence-ending punctuation. However, note that `capitalize` will not just upper-case the first letter, but also lower-case all the rest, e.g. names, acronyms, or words previously capitalized for a different type of punctuation. Instead, you could just `upper` the first char and keep the rest.\r\n\r\n    text = &quot;text with. multiple types? of sentences! more stuff.&quot;\r\n    for sep in (&quot;. &quot;, &quot;? &quot;, &quot;! &quot;):\r\n        text = sep.join(s[0].upper() + s[1:] for s in text.split(sep))\r\n    print(text)\r\n    # Text with. Multiple types? Of sentences! More stuff.\r\n\r\nYou could also use a regular expression to split by _all_ sentence separators at once. This way, you might even be ablt to use `capitalize`, although it will still lower-case names and acronyms.\r\n\r\n    import re\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;&#39;.join(s.capitalize() for s in re.split(r&quot;([\\?\\!\\.] )&quot;, text))\r\n    &#39;Text with. Multiple types? Of sentences!

have a template excel file which already contains all diagrams and tables (empty of course), pivot tables and a namespace reference in the pivot tables `data source`-configuration (`PWRDaten` in my case).\r\nThey all refer to the first empty `data`-sheets, which provides all the data needed for the other sheets.\r\n\r\nNow I am filling the first data-sheet programmatically which should automatically update all the different sheets. It is working fine in VISUAL BASIC...I am setting the namespace and an object range to select the relevant data:\r\n```\r\nobjRange = objXLSSh.range(objXLSSh.cells(1, 1), objXLSSh.cells(47, 47))\r\nobjXLSSh.Names.Add(&quot;PWRDaten&quot;, objRange)\r\n```\r\nAs I said this works perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nBut I am trying to make a JAVA solution with Apache POI...I already achieved the same logic like in my other solution, I also filled the first sheet correctly, but the only thing that is missing is this `namespace reference`. \r\nCan anybody tell me how I can achieve the result explained above?\r\nSo that I can pass the name reference `PWRDaten` and the object (cell) range to the file?\r\nIf that is not possible, how can I mark a cell area for all the sheets which need the data?\r\n\r\nAgain this worked fine for me in Visual Basic so I think there must be a solution in Apache POI too.\r\n\r\nThank you^^\r\n\r\nPS: heres a screenshot of my data sheet and how the pivot

the RDF world, what you&#39;re talking about is referred to as *reification*.\r\n\r\nOne way of reifying RDF stays with the pure &quot;triple&quot; model, by identifying each assertion, and each element of each assertion, something like --\r\n\r\n    _:b1  rdf:type       rdf:Statement ;\r\n          rdf:subject    :moon ;\r\n          rdf:predicate  :consistsOf ;\r\n          rdf:object     :greenCheese .\r\n\r\nAnother way is by shifting to a quad-model, typically using &quot;named graphs&quot; (which are supported by SPARQL).  A named graph may be made up of a single triple, and is often expressed as `{ Subject Predicate Object Graph }`, something like --\r\n\r\n    { :moon :consistsOf :greenCheese _:b1 }\r\n\r\n-- or as `{ Graph { Subject Predicate Object } }` something like --\r\n\r\n    { _:b1 { :moon :consistsOf :greenCheese } }\r\n\r\nWith either of these, you can now say that `_:b1` was asserted by Joe on 1958-12-24, denied by Neil on 1969-07-21, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of collecting single-assertion graphs into multiple-assertion graphs -- for example, describing graph X as being made up of graphs M, N, O, and graph Y being made up of graphs X, P, Q -- such that you can describe (including providing provenance of) a single assertion, a collection of assertions, etc., as appropriate.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58451448/triple-as-subject/58456043#58456043","title":"triple as subject"}],"owner":{"reputation":1737,"user_id":6180031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HRw-01bXV4c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACP8/Mi48YmzBWL0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ZorgoZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6180031/zorgoz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":110754,"user_id":62576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15264f7bf48e10ce32dfa4865a13763c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken White","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62576/ken-white"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58456043,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571505919,"creation_date":1571403605,"last_edit_date":1571420681,"question_id":58451448,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58451448","body_markdown":"[PROV-O][1] allows representing provenance data. But it does this on the same level as any other data in the graph. What I mean is that I can assert that _Dave generated document #01221_, but that tells nothing about the actual provenience of the assertion itself. *What I need is to have assertions about other assertions* inside the same store.\r\n\r\nHere is a real-world scenario: an external application acting on behalf of Dave records some facts in the store during a session that is part of a project which lasts three years. Of course, during this project many other sessions are affecting many other or even those facts. Provenance ontology allows me to assert what happened but only restricted to the nodes. I can&#39;t express which facts were created/modified/deleted during a specific session or activity... and finally get a timeline of the project actions with regards to the facts in the store.\r\n\r\nI even want to go further: I want to store other information about the assertions, like reliability, expiration, and so on. These are neither related to the subject nor the object but to the link between them. In ER that would be an attribute of the relation.\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved by adding assertions about the assertions themselves. As far as I know, in RDF the triplets do not have any standalone identity, neither looks SPARQL to support something like this. Thus I don&#39;t see any chance to achieve what I want with RDF. But is there any other metamodel that has the flexibility of RDF and has support for my needs.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58451448/triple-as-subject","title":"triple as subject"},{"tags":["angular","firebase","firebase-storage","angularfire2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":98,"user_id":3012588,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d28277dd144ddd155068a3d54087e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Eliotjse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3012588/eliotjse"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571512450,"post_id":58451447,"comment_id":103268825,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58451447/i-am-getting-enable-cors-error-while-accesing-stored-file-through-downloadurl#comment103268825_58451447"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12114243,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAPmNlRyC1t82PFXn6V2mKz9yIK-O14xRecUfqyuA=k-s128","display_name":"Gagan K R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12114243/gagan-k-r"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571409284,"creation_date":1571403600,"last_edit_date":1571409284,"question_id":58451447,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58451447","body_markdown":"I Am using AngularFire2 for data transaction between angular and firebase, but I am getting `enable CORS  error` while accesing stored file through its download url.

If we want to see how many unique values of `exercise_id` are within the groups defined by `objective_1` we could use `n_distinct()`:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\noutput %&gt;% \r\n

220\r\n#&gt; 2 Liczby naturalne w dziesiatkowym ukladzie pozycyjnym.    30\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a base option is `table()`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable(output$objective_1)\r\n#&gt; \r\n#&gt;                    Dzialania na liczbach naturalnych. \r\n#&gt;                                                   220 \r\n#&gt; Liczby naturalne w dziesiatkowym ukladzie pozycyjnym. \r\n#&gt;                                                    30\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, I am quite fond of the `tabyl()` function in `library(janitor)`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(janitor)\r\n\r\noutput %&gt;% \r\n  tabyl(objective_1)\r\n#&gt;                                            objective_1   n percent\r\n#&gt;                     Dzialania na liczbach naturalnych. 220    0.88\r\n#&gt;  Liczby naturalne w dziesiatkowym ukladzie pozycyjnym.  30    0.12\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this
