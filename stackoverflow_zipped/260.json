I have a big parent component which include a few child components so each of them render specific set of data.Until now in other components I was strictly updating the parent state only and not duplicating the state at all as I read in the docs and etc.. As now my children render a few inputs each and updates the parent state object. Question - Is that correct or I should duplicate some of the parent state in my children so the inputs use them directly and onBlur action they update the parent? The benefit is that it will render the parent only 1 time onBlur as it is at the moment updating directly the parent state it is rendered on each user input.\r\n\r\nI tried both cases and the performance using the react profiler is more for the duplicating state idea -only because the parent is rendering only once not on each user onchange input. That&#39;s why I want to ask if it&#39;s something wrong. Each other small component which is part of the big one is a PureComponent and don&#39;t do useless rendering.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass TestParent extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            testObject: {\r\n                ...many properties\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\nonChange = (evt) =&gt;

Is there any algorithm that can address this situation? Can someone provide me the codebase to handle this scenario? \r\n\r\nWell, if you are looking for an answer to these questions, the answer is a big emphatic *NO*.\r\n\r\n**What next?**  \r\n\r\n - You will need to invest your time to streamline the test suite; You\r\n   will have to consider this as another project altogether; \r\n - You will need to create a requirement traceability matrix. The requirement\r\n   traceability matrix (RTM) is a table mapping the requirements against\r\n   relevant test cases; \r\n - Preparing RTM as per your current project schedule/milestones will help you gain control; \r\n - You could define the milestones by modules/functionality to better handle the situation. During this process, you will have to include only relevant test cases. As you complete for every functionality/module, you will need to run those test cases to verify and validate the coverage.\r\n\r\nBy performing these activities, you will rebuild the test suite that can improve the chances of success of your project. \r\n\r\n There are continuous integration tools wherein you could identify and engage developers to write/port/migrate your existing test cases. \r\n\r\nThough being an arduous process, in the long-term, your team will start reaping benefits.

I have tried to learn and write the tests and the above code. I am badly stuck at this. Any help is welcome. \r\n\r\nAlso I do not have any ApplicationContext defined for the Controller as I am using it as external jar in another project. Is it possible to create the tests in the same way. \r\n\r\nWe only need to test this one controller with two endpoints. \r\nThanks in advance.\r\n```\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474850/write-unit-test-for-api-endpoint-controller","title":"Write Unit Test for API endpoint Controller"},{"tags":["php"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20606,"user_id":5159168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0oiE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5159168/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571588031,"post_id":58474849,"comment_id":103282758,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474849/making-an-array-with-corresponding-keys-and-values-from-array-of-strings#comment103282758_58474849"},{"owner":{"reputation":5395,"user_id":4964822,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19d22c2bdd8aa03894750a87ef989ff6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vivek_23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4964822/vivek-23"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":20606,"user_id":5159168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0oiE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5159168/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571588071,"post_id":58474849,"comment_id":103282772,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474849/making-an-array-with-corresponding-keys-and-values-from-array-of-strings#comment103282772_58474849"},{"owner":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571588072,"post_id":58474849,"comment_id":103282774,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474849/making-an-array-with-corresponding-keys-and-values-from-array-of-strings#comment103282774_58474849"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12247343,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC5JP9Q7VgISK2mJRSTpmPGQqkRnJOjOsTxYXX-tA=k-s128","display_name":"Yrok Kory","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12247343/yrok-kory"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571588898,"post_id":58474849,"comment_id":103282992,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474849/making-an-array-with-corresponding-keys-and-values-from-array-of-strings#comment103282992_58474849"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20606,"user_id":5159168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0oiE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5159168/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571588249,"post_id":58474877,"comment_id":103282814,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474849/making-an-array-with-corresponding-keys-and-values-from-array-of-strings/58474877#comment103282814_58474877"},{"owner":{"reputation":42742,"user_id":1553888,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01ac05cf8db6f338aef3c2f65e348f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"u_mulder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1553888/u-mulder"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":20606,"user_id":5159168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0oiE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5159168/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571588875,"post_id":58474877,"comment_id":103282981,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474849/making-an-array-with-corresponding-keys-and-values-from-array-of-strings/58474877#comment103282981_58474877"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":42742,"user_id":1553888,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01ac05cf8db6f338aef3c2f65e348f5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"u_mulder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1553888/u-mulder"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571588130,"creation_date":1571588130,"answer_id":58474877,"question_id":58474849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58474877","body_markdown":"In this particular case `explode` is enough:\r\n\r\n    while(!feof($handle)) {\r\n        $values = explode(&#39;,&#39;, fgets($handle, 1024));\r\n        $students[$values[0]] = trim($values[1]);

An explanation of an RID and a list of common ones can be found in [.NET Core RID Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog). The *full* list can be found at the CoreFX repo, in [runtime.json](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/pkg/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/runtime.json). `linux-arm64` is included but that&#39;s only the *base* OS. There are a lot of specific identifiers like `&quot;debian-arm64&quot;`, `&quot;debian.10-arm64&quot;`, `&quot;rhel-arm64&quot;` and `&quot;ubuntu-arm64&quot;`. You&#39;ll have to use the RID that corresponds to your distribution.\r\n\r\nAs the RID catalog explains, a runtime identifier consists of the OS, OS version, architecture and optional extra qualifiers.\r\n\r\n&gt; [os].[version]-[architecture]-[additional qualifiers]\r\n\r\n`ubuntu-arm64` is the generic Ubuntu version for ARM64 while `ubuntu.19.04-arm64` targets Ubuntu 19.04 specifically. \r\n\r\nThere&#39;s no specific version for Raspbian. If you want to target Raspberry in general, you&#39;ll have to use `linux-arm`. If you want to take advantage of the 4GB RAM model, *assuming you already use a 64bit OS* you may be able to target `linux-arm64`.

0)` to match the second case, and\r\n* `gamma = (k &lt; len(k))` to match the third case.\r\n\r\nThen, build up a proper linear combination like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nalpha * sig[k] + beta * sig[k-1] + gamma * (sig[k] - sig[k-1] * (p - np.roll(k, 1)) / (k - np.roll(k, 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nPay attention, that - by the way `beta` and `gamma` are set up above - the calculations of the second and third cases can be combined.

(There is no reason I can see where this should be a two-step process, it is simply not user friendly.) \r\n\r\nProducts have functionality to add fields such as Shipping, Inventory, whether they are digital or physical items, etc... But only during the &quot;edit&quot; phase after the product has been created. **However, these are extremely important fields which are an integral part of eCommerce, and should be included at the time when a Vendor Adds a Product/Service!**\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am not attempting to add any new custom fields!

I have read &amp; researched articles on StackOverflow, used search engines, and contacted the plugin creators. \r\n\r\nThis was the response that I received: \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; In Dokan the add product page is a two-step form. As the attributes\r\n&gt; option is available when you select the product type, so the option is\r\n&gt; available on the edit product page only. In case you need to make the\r\n&gt; two form one single form you will need customization. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I have read your requirement and it seems like you will need some\r\n&gt; details customization.

But I am a little frustrated with the lack of documentation &amp; the fact that I keep breaking my site trying to implement possible solutions in php. I would like to use this as a learning experience to help me understand how php functions better. If you have any guidance or suggestions for how I can accomplish this goal, I would love to hear them!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, my fellow coders!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://makyn.me/artists-dashboard/new-product/\r\n  [2]: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5nj9q17bbher6kx/Screenshot%202019-10-20%2011.15.56.png?dl=0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474787/dokan-add-product-fields-same-as-edit-product-page-combine-into-single-produc","title":"Dokan - ADD Product fields same as EDIT Product page.

Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474927/how-to-get-a-file-out-of-a-compiled-unity-game-that-i-made","title":"How to get a file out of a compiled unity game that I made"},{"tags":["c#",".net","data-structures","trie"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53156,"user_id":51685,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vVhK5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AKX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/51685/akx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571587444,"post_id":58474781,"comment_id":103282605,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474781/is-there-a-trie-equivalent-data-structure-in-net#comment103282605_58474781"},{"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":4333033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1545763430/picture?type=large","display_name":"Deivydas Voroneckis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4333033/deivydas-voroneckis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53156,"user_id":51685,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vVhK5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AKX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/51685/akx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571587591,"post_id":58474781,"comment_id":103282644,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474781/is-there-a-trie-equivalent-data-structure-in-net#comment103282644_58474781"},{"owner":{"reputation":30420,"user_id":311712,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ea76T.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Brabant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/311712/david-brabant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571589535,"post_id":58474781,"comment_id":103283201,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474781/is-there-a-trie-equivalent-data-structure-in-net#comment103283201_58474781"},{"owner":{"reputation":541,"user_id":7755665,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PhvCoVhEXJM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAo/IZp1ulBz1Dc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alireza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7755665/alireza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571589835,"post_id":58474781,"comment_id":103283282,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474781/is-there-a-trie-equivalent-data-structure-in-net#comment103283282_58474781"}],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":4333033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1545763430/picture?type=large","display_name":"Deivydas Voroneckis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4333033/deivydas-voroneckis"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571587361,"creation_date":1571587361,"question_id":58474781,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58474781","body_markdown":"I am looking for trie built-in implementation in .Net framework.\r\nIs there something similar to Trie in .Net data structures?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474781/is-there-a-trie-equivalent-data-structure-in-net","title":"Is there a Trie equivalent data structure in .NET?"},{"tags":["reactjs","asp.net-core","single-page-application"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11912304,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea0118bb8a60ae20300a3db4fcf42f5f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Avoraa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11912304/avoraa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571591971,"post_id":58475291,"comment_id":103283877,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474780/react-import-css-and-js-files/58475291#comment103283877_58475291"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12239028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jMILc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Angelo Giuseppe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12239028/angelo-giuseppe"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571590924,"creation_date":1571590924,"answer_id":58475291,"question_id":58474780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58475291","body_markdown":"When you want to import resources into your React app, you use imports like this:\r\n          \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n    // Import with variable assignation\r\n                   \r\n    import logo from &#39;./logo.png&#39;;

Indeed, in the MVC model express programmers call controllers &quot;routes&quot; (personally I perefer to call them controllers instead of routes in my code). Separating controllers from routes (they both mean the same thing) doesn&#39;t really make sense when viewed from traditional MVC frameworks - but you can if you want.\r\n\r\nTo use `multer` ***as designed*** you need to do it in `index.router.js`:\r\n\r\n**index.router.js**\r\n\r\n    const express = require(&#39;express&#39;);\r\n    const router = express.Router();\r\n    const multer = require(&#39;multer&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    const ctrlUpload = require(&#39;../controllers/upload.controller&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    const storage = multer.diskStorage({\r\n        destination: (req, file, cb) =&gt; {\r\n            cb(null, &#39;uploads/&#39;);\r\n        },\r\n        filename: (req, file, cb) =&gt; {\r\n            cb(null, Date.now()+&#39;-&#39;+file.originalname);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    const upload = multer({ storage });\r\n    \r\n    router.post(&#39;/upload&#39;, upload.single(&#39;img&#39;), ctrlUpload.send);\r\n    \r\n    module.exports = router;\r\n\r\nThen you need to remove all the `multer` related code from `upload.controller.js`\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nYou can however insist on doing it in `upload.controller.js`. The key here is to understand what middlewares are.\r\n\r\nIn Express, a middleware is a function with the prototype:\r\n\r\n    function (req, res, next) { // next is optional\r\n        // middleware logic\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYes, that&#39;s right. The code in your `upload.controller.js` file is a middleware. You are writing a middleware yourself that happens to be at the end of the middleware chain.\r\n\r\nYou see, Express only accepts middlewares. Express has nothing else. Routes are middlewares that happen to be at the end.\r\n\r\nExpress `.use()`, `.get()`, `.post()` and related methods accept an infinite number of arguments. The first is optionally a route specifier (but not necessary) and the rest of the arguments are middlewares. For example:\r\n\r\n    app.get(&#39;/foo&#39;,\r\n      (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n        // first middleware\r\n        next(); // next is what allows processing to continue\r\n      },\r\n      (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n        // second middleware\r\n        next();\r\n      },\r\n      (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n        res.send(&#39;hello&#39;); // controller logic - a controller\r\n                           // is just the last middleware\r\n\r\n        // Note: if you call next() instead of res.send() in a \r\n        // controller express will respond with a 500 internal \r\n        // server error status with whatever string you pass\r\n        // to next() as the error message.\r\n      }\r\n    );\r\n\r\nKnowing this, we know what the function `upload.single(&#39;img&#39;)` returns. **The function does not execute the middleware logic**. Instead it returns the middleware function:\r\n\r\n    let middleware = upload.single(&#39;img&#39;);\r\n\r\n    // middleware is now a function with the prototype:\r\n    // (req, res, next) =&gt; {}\r\n\r\nSo to execute the middleware logic we have to call it (express would automatically call it as part of route processing, just like how it calls your controller function, but if we want to do it ourselves we can).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what you need to do if you want to implement the middleware in `upload.controller.js`:\r\n\r\n\r\n    module.exports.send = (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n      upload.single(&#39;img&#39;)(req, res, () =&gt; {\r\n          // Remember, the middleware will call it&#39;s next function\r\n          // so we can inject our controller manually as the next()\r\n\r\n          console.log(req.body, req.files);\r\n          res.send(&#39;ok&#39;);\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s a lot to unpack. We can make the code easier to understand if we refactor it a little:\r\n\r\n    let middleware = upload.single(&#39;img&#39;);\r\n\r\n    module.exports.send = (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n      // Define the controller here to capture\r\n      // req and res in a closure:\r\n      let controller = () =&gt; {\r\n          console.log(req.body, req.files);\r\n          res.send(&#39;ok&#39;);\r\n      };\r\n\r\n      middleware(req, res, controller); // call the middleware with\r\n                                        // our controller as callback\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut this is very non-standard and would be highly unexpected to an experienced Express.js programmer. I wouldn&#39;t do this even though it&#39;s possible.

Or maybe an alternative approach?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be very little stuff on this topic from what i can see on stack overflow\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/feWOS.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474759/creating-a-view-permanently-underneath-uinavigationbar","title":"Creating a view permanently underneath UINavigationBar"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7543,"user_id":2338547,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f15c197a970cc196e9fad67b6c0a10a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"markspace","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2338547/markspace"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571588942,"post_id":58474751,"comment_id":103283007,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474751/how-to-stop-execution-after-certain-time-in-java#comment103283007_58474751"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7543,"user_id":2338547,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f15c197a970cc196e9fad67b6c0a10a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"markspace","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2338547/markspace"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571588806,"post_id":58474912,"comment_id":103282962,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474751/how-to-stop-execution-after-certain-time-in-java/58474912#comment103282962_58474912"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11715424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1fa14c05946671407fa742cbd90cc973?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pavan Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11715424/pavan-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571589125,"post_id":58474912,"comment_id":103283070,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474751/how-to-stop-execution-after-certain-time-in-java/58474912#comment103283070_58474912"},{"owner":{"reputation":3010,"user_id":1552534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8838a22cdb160d55264fb2cc0d0e9ebe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WJS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552534/wjs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571589768,"post_id":58474912,"comment_id":103283261,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474751/how-to-stop-execution-after-certain-time-in-java/58474912#comment103283261_58474912"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11715424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1fa14c05946671407fa742cbd90cc973?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pavan Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11715424/pavan-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571591628,"post_id":58474912,"comment_id":103283789,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474751/how-to-stop-execution-after-certain-time-in-java/58474912#comment103283789_58474912"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11715424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1fa14c05946671407fa742cbd90cc973?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pavan Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11715424/pavan-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571591771,"post_id":58474912,"comment_id":103283824,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474751/how-to-stop-execution-after-certain-time-in-java/58474912#comment103283824_58474912"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3010,"user_id":1552534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8838a22cdb160d55264fb2cc0d0e9ebe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WJS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552534/wjs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3010,"user_id":1552534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8838a22cdb160d55264fb2cc0d0e9ebe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WJS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1552534/wjs"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571590461,"last_edit_date":1571590461,"creation_date":1571588370,"answer_id":58474912,"question_id":58474751,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58474912","body_markdown":"One possible way is to use `Thread.sleep()`.  Assuming that you don&#39;t mind locking up your program for 30 seconds, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\n    String response=&quot;&quot;;\r\n    int count=5;\r\n    While (count&gt;0) {\r\n        String JOBID=processRequest(request);\r\n        String response=http://pollingUrl/JOBID;\r\n       \r\n        if (!response.equals(&quot;&quot;)) {\r\n          return response; // return response and stop the while loop.\r\n        }\r\n        try {\r\n          Thread.sleep(6000); // 6 seconds\r\n        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {}\r\n       \r\n        count--;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the above won&#39;t work unless the http polling call is non-blocking.  That is, if it waits internally until a response is provided, it won&#39;t work.  But usually when polling calls are done there should be a mechanism to timeout at some point.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  I changed two things.  I moved the sleep *after* the test for a response. And I modified how you were testing for equality (which may have been part of the problem). Use `equals` and not `==` or `!=` for comparing Strings.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474751/how-to-stop-execution-after-certain-time-in-java/58474912#58474912","title":"How to stop execution after certain time in java"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11715424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1fa14c05946671407fa742cbd90cc973?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pavan Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11715424/pavan-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":689,"user_id":11351392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33b7a69ff8d14960b71442fb76a469a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lotor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11351392/lotor"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571590461,"creation_date":1571587144,"last_edit_date":1571589412,"question_id":58474751,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58474751","body_markdown":"I am trying to add a retry logic to a step in java.

It starts worker threads and should block the calling thread until all workers terminate:\r\n\r\n\r\n    fun doSomething() : Result {\r\n\r\n        // producers init thread\r\n        Thread {\r\n            for (i in 0 until NUM_OF_MESSAGES) {\r\n                startNewProducer(i) // each producer is a thread\r\n            }\r\n        }.start()\r\n\r\n        // consumers init thread\r\n        Thread {\r\n            for (i in 0 until NUM_OF_MESSAGES) {\r\n                startNewConsumer() // each consumer is a thread\r\n            }\r\n        }.start()\r\n\r\n\r\n        synchronized(lock) {\r\n            while (numOfFinishedConsumers &lt; NUM_OF_MESSAGES) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    (lock as java.lang.Object).wait()\r\n                } catch (e: InterruptedException) {\r\n                    return@synchronized\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        synchronized(lock) {\r\n            return Result(\r\n                    System.currentTimeMillis() - startTimestamp,\r\n                    numOfReceivedMessages\r\n            )\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI know that `(lock as java.lang.Object).wait()` is ugly and I&#39;d be better off with ReentrantLock, but I intentionally wanted to fall to the most primitive level.\r\n\r\nNow, if I execute this function without coroutine from Android&#39;s main thread, it blocks the calling thread (expected behavior):\r\n\r\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\r\n        someObject.doSomething()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, if I just wrap it in a coroutine which is also executed on main thread, main thread isn&#39;t blocked anymore, but the functionality remains the same:\r\n\r\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\r\n        CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {\r\n            val result = someObject.doSomething()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n 1. I thought that in order for coroutines to work, the functions should be &quot;suspend&quot;, but it&#39;s not the case here. So, what&#39;s the point of &quot;suspend&quot; then?\r\n 2. Call to `(lock as java.lang.Object).wait()` should&#39;ve blocked the main thread. How comes it doesn&#39;t when coroutine is involved? Do coroutines have a mean of &quot;intercepting&quot; such low level interactions?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474749/why-and-how-kotlin-coroutine-prevents-blocking-of-a-thread-even-without-suspen","title":"Why and how Kotlin coroutine prevents blocking of a thread, even without &quot;suspend&quot; keyword?"},{"tags":["php","session"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":4441384,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GQm7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ta_shuo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4441384/ta-shuo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571645303,"creation_date":1571645303,"answer_id":58482205,"question_id":58474745,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482205","body_markdown":"Use javascript to post the click event to index.php:\r\n\r\n    &lt;img src=&quot;get.php?id=1&quot; id=&quot;click_img&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;clickForm&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;click_event&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n        $(&#39;#click_img&#39;).click(function() {\r\n            $(&#39;#clickForm&#39;).submit()\r\n        })\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nindex.php add codes:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n        $_SESSION[&#39;show_video&#39;] = !empty($_SESSION[&#39;show_video&#39;]) || isset($_POST[&#39;click_event&#39;]);\r\n        ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474745/store-the-session-on-a-click-and-refresh-page-to-display-content/58482205#58482205","title":"Store the session on a click and refresh page to display content"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10637310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2189762231264132/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ajdin Alic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10637310/ajdin-alic"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10637310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2189762231264132/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ajdin Alic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10637310/ajdin-alic"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58482205,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571645303,"creation_date":1571587098,"last_edit_date":1571587786,"question_id":58474745,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58474745","body_markdown":"I am trying to implement session one on 1 page (get.php?id=1) (that page should be included in index to display image) which has image inside that file with text &quot;get file&quot; as example.

have made a gamepass for my game and I have made a door that leads to a restricted area that you only can access with the gamepass but if someone who owns the gamepass opens the door then everyone can come in. When a new player joins they are given a boolean value that evaluates to false if the player don&#39;t own the gampass and true if they do own it. The problem is that the boolean value is put in the player that is in the player folder so when I set up a detector to check if the player owns the gamepass the touched event only gives me the information about the player that is in the workspace, and in the workspace player there is no boolean value to check if they have the pass. So somehow i need a way to find the player that is in the players folder using a touched event.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t really have any code to show because I didn&#39;t really think any ideas that I came up with would work and those that I did try didn&#39;t work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474728/roblox-studio-finding-a-player-in-the-players-folder-using-a-touched-event","title":"Roblox studio finding a player in the players folder using a touched event"},{"tags":["android"],"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":10981198,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tmxpD5dn-Ow/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQP3HP_voxBsC-HivIgfsFRqFJNkTA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"G L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10981198/g-l"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571586918,"creation_date":1571586918,"question_id":58474726,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58474726","body_markdown":"Is there a library for the computer program which can receive screen input from the connected Android device and inject touch input events without the need for a computer robot?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474726/how-to-programmatically-communicate-with-android-device-from-computer","title":"How to programmatically communicate with Android device from computer?"},{"tags":["angular"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":121295,"user_id":5485167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWD9t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yurzui","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5485167/yurzui"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571587067,"post_id":58474725,"comment_id":103282498,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474725/cant-resolve-all-parameters-for-authentication-service-angular-7#comment103282498_58474725"},{"owner":{"reputation":1527,"user_id":1645981,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VoK5X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paul van den Dool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1645981/paul-van-den-dool"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":121295,"user_id":5485167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWD9t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yurzui","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5485167/yurzui"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571587265,"post_id":58474725,"comment_id":103282553,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474725/cant-resolve-all-parameters-for-authentication-service-angular-7#comment103282553_58474725"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1527,"user_id":1645981,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VoK5X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paul van den Dool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1645981/paul-van-den-dool"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571588187,"post_id":58474854,"comment_id":103282800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474725/cant-resolve-all-parameters-for-authentication-service-angular-7/58474854#comment103282800_58474854"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12190447,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/705fb33995b802429ffc51c861dcd416?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sandeep Pal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12190447/sandeep-pal"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571587969,"creation_date":1571587969,"answer_id":58474854,"question_id":58474725,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58474854","body_markdown":"Have you included HttpClientModule in the app module?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474725/cant-resolve-all-parameters-for-authentication-service-angular-7/58474854#58474854","title":"Can&#39;t resolve all parameters for Authentication Service (Angular 7)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1037,"user_id":9606851,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oauSz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AbolfazlR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9606851/abolfazlr"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571590237,"creation_date":1571590237,"answer_id":58475199,"question_id":58474725,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58475199","body_markdown":"I had the same issue, \r\nmake sure that you imported `HttpClientModule`  in app.module if yes and you still have that error, remove `{ providedIn: &#39;root&#39;

You are a complete PHP beginner and you need a lot of practice to write standard codes. Don&#39;t worry, keep coding. It will come by time. So here goes some golden learning points for you.\r\n\r\n2. You used while loops which was totally unnecessary here at every place. While loop is or any other loop is used only when you need to fetch all the records (or limited by coding). That&#39;s why its termed a loop. It will keep fetching the data unless it doesn&#39;t finds anymore. You should just use a simple fetch when the goal is to just use the database values individually as per the record you have selected (say record as per `where id = :id`).\r\n\r\n3. You created unnecessary variables which was not needed. You could have directly used those values while writing queries. Parameterized queries are only needed when you are submitting data via a form as there are chances of SQL injection. For hard coding, you can enter direct values. Also, during fetch you created a variable say `$name` to store the value of `$row[&#39;names&#39;]`. Its okay but many developers do not consider it as a good practice as every variable uses a bit of memory (search google for more info). Use just `$row[&#39;names&#39;]` everywhere instead.\r\n\r\n4. `session_start()` was missing at the top of the page. Without it your `$email` variable won&#39;t recognize the session value (email). If you already have it in database.php then fine, but I would recommend it to use individually on every page (considered a good practise) rather than including via an external file.\r\n\r\n5. Please use user id to store in session instead of email as user can change an email which will in future disrupt whole database and its not scalable. On the other hand, the auto incremented user id field is something we never touch and is considered unique. Hence, use user id.\r\n\r\n6. Please do not use just `$email = $_SESSION[&#39;email&#39;]` as it will return an undefined error when user is logged out or the session is destroyed and the user visits that page. Use what I gave below instead. It checks if the `$_SESSION[&#39;email&#39;]` is empty or not and if it is the value will be set to null preventing from undefined error as `$email` is now defined as null. If session exists, it will use the email from the session. Again, please use user id next time instead.\r\n\r\n7. As @nbk said your code confused me and really made no sense at all. Why do you want to fetch the count from same table and then update the same table and all. This makes no sense.\r\n\r\nI still corrected the errors in your way of coding (this might not solve your problem as I didn&#39;t understand your sense of coding at all about counting and updating in same table but copy and paste it/save it somewhere) which should help you learn kind of standard way to code. Please, go through it, understand it and make the necessary changes as required. Hope all this much of writing and effort helps.\r\n\r\nHere is your completely improved code with standard way of coding from start to end:\r\n\r\n    session_start();\r\n    include(&quot;database.php&quot;);\r\n    $email = (!empty($_SESSION[&#39;email&#39;]))?$_SESSION[&quot;email&quot;]:null; // Please set user id here instead of email next time as you need to pass id in many places.\r\n    $done = false;\r\n    \r\n    $product = $connect-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = :id&quot;);\r\n    $product-&gt; bindValue(&#39;id&#39;, $_GET[&#39;id&#39;]);\r\n    $product-&gt; execute();\r\n    $p = $product-&gt;fetch(); // While loop is only needed when you want to fetch and display all the records (like in table format) otherwise NOT.\r\n    \r\n    $basket = $connect-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt FROM basket WHERE name = :name and email = :email and done = :done&quot;);\r\n    $basket-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:name&#39;, $p[&#39;names&#39;]);\r\n    $basket-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:email&#39;, $p[&#39;email&#39;]);\r\n    $basket-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:done&#39;, $done);\r\n    $basket-&gt; execute();\r\n    $b = $basket-&gt;fetch();\r\n    \r\n    if($b[&#39;cnt&#39;] &gt; 0){\r\n      $stmt = $connect-&gt;prepare(&quot;UPDATE basket SET count = :count WHERE name = :name&quot;);\r\n      $stmt-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:count&#39;, $b[&#39;cnt&#39;]);\r\n      $stmt-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:name&#39;, $p[&#39;names&#39;]);\r\n    }else{\r\n      $count = $b[&#39;cnt&#39;]+1;\r\n      $stmt = $connect-&gt;prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO basket(name, email, price, count, reduction)VALUES(:name, :email, :price, :count, :reduction)&quot;);\r\n      $stmt-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:name&#39;, $p[&#39;names&#39;]);\r\n      $stmt-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:email&#39;, $email);\r\n      $stmt-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:price&#39;, $p[&#39;price&#39;]);\r\n      $stmt-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:cost&#39;, $count);\r\n      $stmt-&gt; bindValue(&#39;:reduction&#39;, 0);\r\n    }\r\n    $stmt-&gt; execute();\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474722/why-my-table-is-empty-when-i-have-no-error-in-php-code/58479964#58479964","title":"why my table is empty when i have no error in php code?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12238086,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/90Bep.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12238086/sara"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1041,"user_id":4481000,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukkoc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jainil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4481000/jainil"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571638946,"creation_date":1571586903,"last_edit_date":1571638946,"question_id":58474722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58474722","body_markdown":"    &lt;?php\r\n        session_start();\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;Untitled Document&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuys I make a table for shoping bag and it name is basket.

Since you did not put a semicolon at the end, Julia will call the method [`Base.show`][1] to write an informative text about this value to the current output stream. `OneSampleTTest` is a subtype of `HypothesisTest` which extends `Base.show` method to write the output you see on your console.\r\n\r\nIf you need, for some reason, to store the output of `show` you can use `Base.repr` which would give you the output of `show` as a `String`.\r\n\r\n    julia&gt; result = repr(OneSampleTTest([1,2,3,4,5],3.1));\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; result\r\n    &quot;One sample t-test\\n-----------------\\nPopulation details:\\n    parameter of interest:   Mean\\n    value under h_0:         3.1\\n    point estimate:          3.0\\n    95% confidence interval: (1.0368, 4.9632)\\n\\nTest summary:\\n    outcome with 95% confidence: fail to reject h_0\\n    two-sided p-value:           0.8944\\n\\nDetails:\\n    number of observations:   5\\n    t-statistic:              -0.14142135623730961\\n    degrees of freedom:       4\\n    empirical standard error: 0.7071067811865476\\n&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that you do not need to extract the p-value *by* parsing a text. `OneSampleTTest` implements [`pvalue`][2] method and simply using `pvalue` on your test object will compute and return the p-value.\r\n\r\n    julia&gt; test = OneSampleTTest([1,2,3,4,5],3.1); # this only creates an object, does not compute p-value\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; pvalue(test) # computes and `show`s the value\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/io-network/#Base.show-Tuple%7BAny%7D\r\n  [2]: https://juliastats.github.io/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/methods.html#HypothesisTests.pvalue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474721/julia-language-redirecting-stdout-does-not-affect-every-println-how-to-extra/58477682#58477682","title":"Julia language: Redirecting stdout does not affect every println // How to extract value from stdout"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11508944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0f807f1b26e78d8c97e77165f925f52?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"grimbar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11508944/grimbar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58477682,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571608761,"creation_date":1571586899,"question_id":58474721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58474721","body_markdown":"My original aim was to perform a ttest and gaining a pvalue.\r\nI used [OneSampleTTest](https://juliastats.github.io/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/parametric.html#HypothesisTests.OneSampleTTest) which looked promising yet the results ended up in stdout like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\njulia&gt; OneSampleTTest([1,2,3,4,5],3.1)\r\nOne sample t-test\r\n-----------------\r\nPopulation details:\r\n    parameter of interest:   Mean\r\n    value under h_0:         3.1\r\n    point estimate:          3.0\r\n    95% confidence interval: (1.0368, 4.9632)\r\n\r\nTest summary:\r\n    outcome with 95% confidence: fail to reject h_0\r\n    two-sided p-value:           0.8944\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n    number of observations:   5\r\n    t-statistic:              -0.14142135623730961\r\n    degrees of freedom:       4\r\n    empirical standard error: 0.7071067811865476\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to get hold of this value:\r\n\r\n```two-sided p-value:           0.8944```\r\n\r\nTo redirect an stdout I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54599148/in-julia-1-0-how-do-i-get-strings-using-redirect-stdout) on our website here.

You are applying `fliplr` to `y`, but `y` is a column vector, so __you are not really flipping it__. You should apply [`flipud`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/flipud.html); or [`flip`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/flip.html) if you want it to work for any vector in general.\r\n\r\n 2. From the documentation of [`xcorr`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/xcorr.html):\r\n\r\n &gt; `C = xcorr(A,B)` [...] &gt; If `A `and `B` are of different length, _the shortest one is zero-padded_. \r\n\r\n So, to make the result of `conv` equal to that of `xcorr` you need to __zero-pad__ the shorter vector.\r\n\r\n In the general case, for column vectors `x` and `y` you can use `[x; zeros(numel(y)-numel(x),1)]` instead of `x` and `[y; zeros(numel(x)-numel(y),1)]` instead of `y`. This will extend the shorter vector and leave the other as is. Note that this works because, according to the documentation of [`zeros`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/zeros.html),\r\n\r\n &gt;  `zeros(M,N,P,...)` [...] The size inputs `M`, `N`, and `P`... should be nonnegative integers. _Negative integers are treated as `0`_.\r\n\r\n 3.

Also it is unable to load the json file. \r\n\r\nHere is the flask Chatbot code\r\n\r\n```from flask import Flask, render_template, request\r\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\r\nimport nltk\r\nfrom nltk.stem.lancaster import LancasterStemmer\r\nstemmer = LancasterStemmer()\r\n\r\nimport numpy\r\nimport random\r\nimport tensorflow\r\nimport tflearn\r\nimport pickle\r\n\r\nimport json\r\n\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\n\r\nwith open(&#39;intents.json&#39;) as file:\r\n    data = json.load(file)\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    with open(&quot;data.pickle&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as f:\r\n        words, labels, training, output = pickle.load(f)\r\nexcept:\r\n    words = []\r\n    labels = []\r\n    docs_x = []\r\n    docs_y = []\r\n\r\n    for intent in data[&quot;intents&quot;]:\r\n        for pattern in intent[&quot;patterns&quot;]:\r\n            wrds = nltk.word_tokenize(pattern)\r\n            words.extend(wrds)\r\n            docs_x.append(wrds)\r\n            docs_y.append(intent[&quot;tag&quot;])\r\n\r\n        if intent[&quot;tag&quot;] not in labels:\r\n            labels.append(intent[&quot;tag&quot;])\r\n\r\n    words = [stemmer.stem(w.lower()) for w in words if w != &quot;?&quot;]\r\n    words = sorted(list(set(words)))\r\n\r\n    labels = sorted(labels)\r\n\r\n    training = []\r\n    output = []\r\n\r\n    out_empty = [0 for _ in range(len(labels))]\r\n\r\n    for x, doc in enumerate(docs_x):\r\n        bag = []\r\n\r\n        wrds = [stemmer.stem(w.lower()) for w in doc]\r\n\r\n        for w in words:\r\n            if w in wrds:\r\n                bag.append(1)\r\n            else:\r\n                bag.append(0)\r\n\r\n        output_row = out_empty[:]\r\n        output_row[labels.index(docs_y[x])] = 1\r\n\r\n        training.append(bag)\r\n        output.append(output_row)\r\n\r\n\r\n    training = numpy.array(training)\r\n    output = numpy.array(output)\r\n\r\n    with open(&quot;data.pickle&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as f:\r\n        pickle.dump((words, labels, training, output), f)\r\n\r\ntensorflow.reset_default_graph()\r\n\r\nnet = tflearn.input_data(shape=[None, len(training[0])])\r\nnet = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 8)\r\nnet = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 8)\r\nnet = tflearn.fully_connected(net, len(output[0]), activation=&quot;softmax&quot;)\r\nnet = tflearn.regression(net)\r\n\r\nmodel = tflearn.DNN(net)\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    model.load(&quot;model.tflearn&quot;)\r\nexcept:\r\n    model.fit(training, output, n_epoch=1000, batch_size=8, show_metric=True)\r\n    model.save(&quot;model.tflearn&quot;)\r\n\r\ndef bag_of_words(s, words):\r\n    bag = [0 for _ in range(len(words))]\r\n\r\n    s_words = nltk.word_tokenize(s)\r\n    s_words = [stemmer.stem(word.lower()) for word in s_words]\r\n\r\n    for se in s_words:\r\n        for i, w in enumerate(words):\r\n            if w == se:\r\n                bag[i] = 1\r\n            \r\n    return numpy.array(bag)\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n@app.route(&quot;/&quot;)\r\ndef home():\r\n    return render_template(&quot;index.html&quot;)\r\n\r\n@app.route(&quot;/get&quot;)\r\ndef chat():\r\n    userText = request.args.get(&#39;msg&#39;)\r\n    while True:\r\n            results = model.predict([bag_of_words(userText, words)])[0]\r\n            results_index = numpy.argmax(results)\r\n            tag = labels[results_index]\r\n\r\n            if results[results_index] &gt;
