Instead I want to add them one by one and then do 1 big final compile which I know it will take slightly longer than 5 minutes, but still a lot quicker than 2-3 days. \r\n\r\nFor those of you that may not have used moviepy before I will post a snippet of &quot;my code&quot; that actually works, not in the way I need it to though. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal_clip = CompositeVideoClip([clip, textList[0], textList[1], textList[2]])\r\nfinal_clip.write_videofile(&quot;files/final/TEST.mp4&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works exactly as intended (adding 3 texts), However I dont/can&#39;t know how many texts there will be in each video beforehand so I need to somehow insert a dynamic amount of **textList[]** into the function. \r\n\r\nKind

The client is NOT in possession of the software and can only use it to the extent allowed by the API.\r\n\r\n**My question is**: in the first category above, how is the actual code kept hidden from the client? \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say I&#39;ve built a really awesome analysis engine in Python for analyzing output logs. A corporate client is interested in using it for their internal applications. However, they insist that my engine must run on their own machines for security reasons. If I succumb and give them my Python code, then I will risk my intellectual property. \r\n\r\nIn that case, do I need to rewrite all my code into a compiled language like C++ to obfuscate it during compile time?

I am using Python 3.6.\r\n\r\n    # Example content from the text file\r\n    data = &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;test&#39;&#39;&#39;,\r\n    ..................\r\n    ..................\r\n    example text here(&#39;&#39;&#39;SELECT * FROM table&#39;&#39;&#39;).format(),\r\n    ..................\r\n    ..................\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    # Creating regex pattern\r\n    regex = re.compile(r&quot;(?&lt;=([\\&quot;&#39;]{3}\\b))(?:(?=(\\\\?))\\2.)*?(?=\\1)&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    # Searching for patterns\r\n    pattern = regex.search(data)\r\n    \r\n    # Printing all patterns\r\n    if pattern:\r\n        print(pattern.group()) # prints only &#39;test&#39;\r\n\r\nThe expected output is as provided below:\r\n\r\n    [test, SELECT * FROM table]\r\n\r\n\r\n***UPDATE:***\r\nI modified my regex pattern to `((?:&#39;&#39;&#39;|\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;)\\b)(?:(?=(\\\\?))\\2.)*?(?=\\1)` and it works for the above two cases. However, I also have multiline patterns for which the code doesn&#39;t work. Below are couple of samples for reference. I looked at some of the already asked questions [here][2] and [here][3]. But I am unable to figure out how to reconstruct my pattern to capture both single line and multi-line patterns. Any help on this would be appreciated as I am completely new to regex.\r\n\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    SELECT * from table\r\n    WHERE\r\n    \r\n    A = B\r\n    \r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;SELECT VALUES\r\n    FROM table\r\n    WHERE score = 0&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://regex101.com/r/ky66QN/1\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50137113/python-regex-match-across-multiple-lines\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/587345/regular-expression-matching-a-multiline-block-of-text","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068464/creating-a-regex-pattern-in-python","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Creating a regex pattern in python"},{"tags":["big-o"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":86410,"user_id":16406,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fadf252892475e9b177d5cd5e8b24145?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chris Dodd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/16406/chris-dodd"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569265314,"post_id":58068462,"comment_id":102533040,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068462/why-does-this-algorithm-run-in-on-log-n#comment102533040_58068462"},{"owner":{"reputation":7640,"user_id":286934,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f16a184d26b72795ff243464d715cffe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Progman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/286934/progman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569265519,"post_id":58068462,"comment_id":102533115,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068462/why-does-this-algorithm-run-in-on-log-n#comment102533115_58068462"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":245,"user_id":11979706,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81f60d5f1bab317984fe56dae07757bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AugustinLopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11979706/augustinlopez"},"last_editor":{"reputation":245,"user_id":11979706,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81f60d5f1bab317984fe56dae07757bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AugustinLopez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11979706/augustinlopez"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569267615,"last_edit_date":1569267615,"creation_date":1569267252,"answer_id":58069068,"question_id":58068462,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58069068","body_markdown":"Considering the following:\r\n```\r\nfor i in [1 . . n] do\r\n    j ← i\r\n    while j ≤ n do\r\n        A[j] ← A[j] + 1\r\n        j ← j + i\r\n```\r\nEach time, `j` is incremented with `+i`, not `+1`.

NSManagedObject conformance to ObservableObject was added in beta 5 which also introduced other significant changes, including deprecation of BindableObject (for replacement by ObservableObject).\r\n\r\nSee the SwiftUI section:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_ipados_release_notes/ios_13_release_notes)\r\n\r\nI ran into the same issue and despite NSManagedObject conforming to ObservableObject, it was not emitting notifications for changes. This might have something to do with NSManagedObject properties needing to be wrapped with @NSManaged which cannot be combined with @Published, while the ObservableObject doc states that, by default, an ObservableObject will synthesize objectWillChange publishers for @Published property changes. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject\r\n\r\nI first tried to get around this by bootstrapping a call to `objectWillChange.send()` in overrides to Key-Value methods in my NSManagedObject subclass, which only resulted in incorrect behavior.\r\n\r\nThe solution I went with is the simplest and unfortunately maybe the bulkiest if you need to change a lot of codependent properties in your SwiftUI view. But, so far it is working fine for me and maintains use of SwiftUI as intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIn Swift:\r\n\r\n1. Create an NSManagedObject subclass for your entity.\r\n2. In that subclass, create setter methods for the properties you wish to change from your SwiftUI views and at the beginning of the method add a call to `objectWillChange.send()`, which should look something like this:\r\n\r\n        func setTitle(_ text: String) {\r\n            objectWillChange.send()\r\n\r\n            self.title = text\r\n        }\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nI only advise this as a temporary workaround, as it is not ideal and hopefully will be addressed soon.\r\n\r\nI will be submitting a bug report in FeedbackAssistant and I recommend to anyone else encountering this issue to do the same, so we can get Apple to take another look at this!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068446/nsmanagedobject-changes-do-not-trigger-objectwillchange/58530246#58530246","title":"NSManagedObject changes do not trigger objectWillChange"}],"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":3213985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cdJak.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"whistler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3213985/whistler"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":176,"favorite_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571867372,"creation_date":1569264466,"question_id":58068446,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068446","body_markdown":"I have a Core Data model with an entity generated into class `Task`. I am trying to get the Combine publisher `objectWillChange` from the `NSManagedObject` to send (automatically, without manual work), but it won&#39;t. The task entity has a `name` attribute.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet task = Task(context: container.viewContext)\r\n\t\t\r\nlet taskSubscription = task.objectWillChange.sink(receiveValue: { _ in\r\n\tprint(&quot;Task changed&quot;)\r\n})\r\n\r\ntask.name = &quot;Foo&quot;              // WILL NOT trigger\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I call send manually, the subscription will work:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\ntask.objectWillChange.send()   // Will trigger\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I replace this with a simple `ObservableObject`, it will work as expected:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass DummyTask: ObservableObject {\r\n\t@Published var name: String?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet dummy = DummyTask()\r\nlet dummySubscription = dummy.objectWillChange.sink(receiveValue: { _ in\r\n\tprint(&quot;Dummy changed&quot;)\r\n})\r\n\r\ndummy.name = &quot;Foo&quot;              // Will trigger\r\ndummy.objectWillChange.send()   // Will trigger\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs NSManagedObject bugged?

How should I get SwiftUI to see them?\r\n\r\nThis is using Xcode 11.0 and iOS 13.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068446/nsmanagedobject-changes-do-not-trigger-objectwillchange","title":"NSManagedObject changes do not trigger objectWillChange"},{"tags":["java","stream","java-stream"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":947,"user_id":282956,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f983c270c821736abbd592c466f74ee6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mavriksc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/282956/mavriksc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569264944,"post_id":58068442,"comment_id":102532903,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068442/reorder-elements-in-a-java-stream#comment102532903_58068442"},{"owner":{"reputation":410,"user_id":8748083,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a99efe3bbda3a61907314c7cca2904bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RobOhRob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8748083/robohrob"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569265725,"post_id":58068442,"comment_id":102533201,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068442/reorder-elements-in-a-java-stream#comment102533201_58068442"},{"owner":{"reputation":437,"user_id":4184113,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b79021c172eb8df31b65be4f677682e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4184113","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4184113/user4184113"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":947,"user_id":282956,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f983c270c821736abbd592c466f74ee6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mavriksc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/282956/mavriksc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569266068,"post_id":58068442,"comment_id":102533365,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068442/reorder-elements-in-a-java-stream#comment102533365_58068442"},{"owner":{"reputation":947,"user_id":282956,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f983c270c821736abbd592c466f74ee6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mavriksc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/282956/mavriksc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570720536,"post_id":58068442,"comment_id":103010748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068442/reorder-elements-in-a-java-stream#comment103010748_58068442"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":7100839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5febcfb74f81322249ff0f55ecba27e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg Spiridonov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7100839/oleg-spiridonov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":51,"user_id":7100839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5febcfb74f81322249ff0f55ecba27e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg Spiridonov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7100839/oleg-spiridonov"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569267430,"last_edit_date":1569267430,"creation_date":1569266600,"answer_id":58068920,"question_id":58068442,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58068920","body_markdown":"You can use a comparator to sort your stream elements.

However, I am a little out of my depth here. I have a macro which is automating IE. At one point my macro navigates to a URL that is used to download a report. The URL is almost always the same. However, one digit within the link can sometimes change. The digit in the link that changes can only be `1` or `2`. The `onclick` event of the button to get the report gives an indication which report will be generated. As a result, I need my macro to have an `IF` statement to read the `onclick` and if the `onclick` has `1`, then it will navigate to the link with a `1` or if it is a `2`, it will navigate to the link with a `2`. I have provided the `onclick` details below:\r\n```\r\nLink with &#39;ReporttypeID=1&#39;\r\n\r\n&lt;input name=&quot;btnContinue&quot; class=&quot;primary&quot; id=&quot;btnContinue&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:pop(&#39;Splash.aspx?SplashID=3&amp;amp;../Reports/ReportView.aspx&amp;amp;ReporttypeID=1&amp;amp;lang=EN&amp;amp;ruletypeid=5&amp;amp;ruleid=0&#39;); return false;&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Continue&quot;&gt;```\r\n\r\nLink with &#39;ReporttypeID=2&#39;\r\n\r\n&lt;input name=&quot;btnContinue&quot; class=&quot;primary&quot; id=&quot;btnContinue&quot;

value=&quot;Continue&quot;&gt;```\r\n```\r\nMy code is below, how do I call/reference the onclick id? \r\n```\r\nSub login()\r\n    Application.DisplayAlerts = False\r\n    Dim url As String\r\n    url = UserForm.Path2.Value\r\n\r\n    Dim ie As Object\r\n    Set ie = CreateObject(&quot;InternetExplorer.Application&quot;)\r\n        \r\n    With ie &#39;Open IE\r\n        .navigate url\r\n        ieBusy ie\r\n        .Visible = False\r\n   \r\n        ie.navigate &quot;https://mylink.com/ReporttypeID=1&quot;

future reference, you should work on making your example a good [Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).  This will not only enhance the chances you get a response on Stack Overflow, but very likely make it so you can start fixing problems yourselves.\r\n\r\nFor instance, this is the single function you&#39;re having problems with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#define countOps(n)\r\nstatic long long opsCount;\r\nvoid countOps(long n){\r\n    opsCount += n;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you try to compile just that in a `.cpp` file, it&#39;ll work, though complain about a lack of an entry point.  So, so `#include` must be causing an issue.  The obvious candidate is `CountOps.hpp` where this is declared.  In this case, unless you `#define` `COUNT_OPS`, the header will be just\r\n\r\n```\r\n#define countOps(n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if we put these two pieces together, we have a minimal, reproducible example of your compile error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#define countOps(n)\r\nstatic long long opsCount;\r\nvoid countOps(long n){\r\n    opsCount += n;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, the included file is attempting to `#define` away the countOps function to nothing, and by implementing it, the preprocessor is turning your code into\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic long long opsCount;\r\nvoid {\r\n    opsCount += n;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich makes no sense.  You can fix this by either `#define COUNT_OPS` before you include `CountOps.hpp`, or simply not bothering to try and create this function.  The correct path depends on how this library is meant to be used.\r\n\r\nMy point isn&#39;t to tell you how to fix this problem, but hopefully help you understand how to detect it in the future, so you can understand what&#39;s happening, and why it&#39;s happening, or at least help others trying to help you.\r\n\r\nAnd one final point:  Assume your images won&#39;t ever be seen.  Not only will some users have trouble seeing them, but another user searching for your problem in the future won&#39;t see it, so it lessons the ability for others to learn from your question.  Your compiler will emit these errors at text at some level.  You should copy-n-paste from there.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068362/c-c2447-missing-function-header-old-style-format-list-win32-and-long/58141290#58141290","title":"C++, C2447 &#39;{&#39;: missing function header (old-style format list?), win32 and long"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12109139,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/caadc2da95d6d63821aafa860853465f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dnam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12109139/dnam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":367767,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569618058,"creation_date":1569264043,"last_edit_date":1569530026,"question_id":58068362,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068362","body_markdown":"I&#39;m getting an error while building a solution on existing code for learning.

Just do `p.title`, `a.image`, etc. So, your code should look like: \r\n\r\n    q = Question.new(title: p.title, post: p.post)\r\n\r\n    p.answers.each do |answer|\r\n      q.answers.build(body: answer.body)\r\n      if answer.images\r\n        answer.images.each do |image|\r\n          q.answers.photos.create(image: image)\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nNow, you want to create new photos for the `answer` you instantiated here:\r\n\r\n    q.answers.build(body: answer.body)\r\n\r\nInstead, you&#39;re trying to call `photos` on the enumerable that is returned by `q.answers.photos`. And, naturally, that enumerable (an `ActiveRecord_Associations_CollectionProxy` in this case) doesn&#39;t have that method. So, you&#39;re getting the `undefined method` error. \r\n\r\nYou could try:\r\n\r\n    q = Question.new(title: p.title, post: p.post)\r\n\r\n    p.answers.each do |answer|\r\n      new_answer = q.answers.build(body: answer.body)\r\n      if answer.images\r\n        answer.images.each do |image|\r\n          new_answer.photos.create(image: image)\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nExcept you haven&#39;t saved `new_answer` yet, so it doesn&#39;t have an `id`. In which case, it *may* still error out. \r\n\r\nSo, perhaps: \r\n\r\n    q = Question.new(title: p.title, post: p.post)\r\n\r\n    p.answers.each do |answer|\r\n      new_answer = q.answers.create(body: answer.body)\r\n      if answer.images\r\n        answer.images.each do |image|\r\n          new_answer.photos.create(image: image)\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if you *really* want all those duplicate `Photo`s (maybe you do). But, if you don&#39;t, I think I would do something like: \r\n\r\n    class AnswerPhoto &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n      belongs_to :answer\r\n      belongs_to :photo\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    class Answer &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n      belongs_to :question\r\n      has_many :answer_photos\r\n      has_many :photos, through: :answer_photos\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    class Photo &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n      belongs_to :question\r\n      has_many :answer_photos\r\n      has_many :answers, through: :answer_photos\r\n    end\r\n\r\nIn which case you might do something like: \r\n\r\n    q = Question.new(title: p.title, post: p.post)\r\n\r\n    p.answers.each do |answer|\r\n      new_answer = q.answers.create(body: answer.body)\r\n      new_answer.photos &lt;&lt; answer.photos\r\n    end\r\n\r\nIt looks to me you have some `N+1` querying going on there, so you&#39;ll want to look into `.include`. And, since you&#39;re not really using `answer.photos` as proper ruby objects (you only really want those `id`s), you might look into `.pluck`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068330/rails-add-data-to-relations-relation-table/58068848#58068848","title":"Rails - add data to relation&#39;s relation table"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":2351980,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HLah7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Oğuz &#199;i&#231;ek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2351980/o%c4%9fuz-%c3%87i%c3%a7ek"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58068709,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569267700,"creation_date":1569263875,"question_id":58068330,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068330","body_markdown":"i have ```questions``` , ```answers``` and ```photos``` ```models```.

Testing is a little difficult: Since you have a hard dependency on the Util Class, you cannot easily provide a mock implementation.\r\n 2. Inversion of Control: Dependency injection is not possible when using Utility Classes.\r\n 3. Proxying: Many frameworks depend on dynamic proxies for adding additional functionality to class instances, example Logging level, which is not possible with utility classes.\r\n 4. Single responsibility: Over time, if you are not very strict, these classes tend to accumulate more and more code, which may be not so related to the original methods. The class would lose its original single responsibility.\r\n\r\nRefernce: https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/avoid-utility-classes/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068322/alternative-to-static-util-classes-and-methods-in-java/58068501#58068501","title":"Alternative to static Util Classes and Methods in Java"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":164,"user_id":6297856,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/757a1e850835040157aa8359fd9fca7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ImJustACowLol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6297856/imjustacowlol"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569265919,"creation_date":1569265919,"answer_id":58068759,"question_id":58068322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58068759","body_markdown":"I disagree with the fact that util classes should be avoided. It is perfectly fine to have a class that contains static methods that are purely utilities. Sometimes functions or operations should just be functions or operations. There is not always a need to associate them with some abstract object type or whatever.\r\n\r\nHowever, what I do agree with is that when making util classes, you should strictly define what types of utilities will be provided by the class. If you have a bunch of static methods that are related to doing mathematic operations, you can make a util class `ExtendedMath`. If you are doing a lot of mathematics and  the  class becomes too fat, try to refine it further. Group them by type of mathematics such as `Algebra` and `Vector`. \r\n\r\nIn the end, it is mostly just trying to use common sense. Does it make sense for a function to be part of an object, or can it just be an arbitrary operation?\r\n\r\nIn your case, you have to ask yourself the question: &quot;Do I want to create a hard dependency of my code to the `formatCustomerSet` implementation?&quot;. If you know 100% for sure that you will always format customer sets in the exact same way, and you will never want different formatters then it might be okay to use a static method. If not, then maybe it&#39;s better to put it on a `CustomerSetFormatter` class as a non-static function.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t give you a yes or no answer, as you have to weight the pro&#39;s and the con&#39;s yourself. Just take the following things into account:\r\n\r\n - When you are referencing a static method, you are creating a **hard dependency** to that static method. Sometimes this is okay, sometimes it is not. A core principle of software development is **reuse**. Can you reuse the code that calls the static function in other contexts as well? Or is the static function too context-specific?\r\n - Another core principle in programming is **dependency injection**. Lets say you have `Class A` which requires a customer formatter. What you could do, is you can make a `interface CustomerFormatter`. In `Class A` you then define a constructor: `A(CustomerFormatter formatter)`. What this allows you to do, is to reuse  `Class A` while using different `CustomerFormatter` implementations. This greatly increases the reusability of `Class A`. When using static functions, this is no longer possible.\r\n - Common generic operations (such as the functions defined in `Math`, e.g. `min()`, `max()`, `ceil()` or `floor() `) are completely warranted to be static functions. They do one thing that is used commonly, and one thing only. Generally, you can take functions like that as an example of when a static method is perfectly warranted.\r\n - Is your function a **pure function**? This is a function that *always* gives the exact same output, for any unique input. Subsequent calls to the same functions will always yield the same result if the input stays the same. If this is the case, then it can be perfectly fine to make your method static. If this is not the case, and subsequent calls to the same function give different outputs depending on some arbitraty state or calls that were done previously, then you should consider making it non-static. Making static functions that provide different outputs for the same input because they depend on some state, is generally seen as an **anti-pattern**.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you out a bit.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068322/alternative-to-static-util-classes-and-methods-in-java/58068759#58068759","title":"Alternative to static Util Classes and Methods in Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":1339,"user_id":1523785,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b28dda5cffe5812e52a6388c5e4ce9f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hatellla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1523785/hatellla"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569266953,"creation_date":1569263857,"question_id":58068322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58068322","body_markdown":"Say, I wanted to have this method which takes a Set&lt;Customer&gt; and formats that set into a string according to some logic.

Can someone point me in the right direction for listing the 3 attributes: tier, name, and tank_id into a datatable.
