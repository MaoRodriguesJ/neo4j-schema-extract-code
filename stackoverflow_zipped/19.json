Next step was processing each record to &quot;fictionalize&quot; the data where marked in a configuration file (e.g. First Name, Last Name, Address, SSN, etc).\r\n\r\nThe Windows virtual machine I am running on has 4GB of memory. I am seeing very long running times just trying to copy the data from a source database table to its destination table. I have a few tables that are upwards of 100 million records but most tables are under a million. It looks like my process is hitting a lot of hard faults and using up all available memory.\r\n\r\nI could use a `SqlDataReader` but I need to update the data in each row before writing out to the destination database.. So I am using a `DataTable` that is obviously reading all records into memory. But I am not sure the right way to process records in batches (read first 1000, fictionalize the data, write to destination, then read next 1000 records, etc)? Is there a deterministic way to read records from a table via C#? After a lot of googling I could not find anything definitive.\r\n\r\nCode is:\r\n\r\n```        \r\nDataTable dataTable = new DataTable();\r\n\r\nSqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(&quot;SELECT * FROM &quot; + tableName, srcConn);\r\n\r\nusing (SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd))\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n    da.Fill(dataTable);\r\n\r\n    da.Dispose();\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nCopyAndFictionalizeTable(tableName, fields, dataTable);\r\n\r\nvar transaction = destConn.BeginTransaction();\r\nvar options = SqlBulkCopyOptions.KeepNulls | SqlBulkCopyOptions.KeepIdentity | SqlBulkCopyOptions.TableLock;\r\nusing (SqlBulkCopy bulkData = new SqlBulkCopy(destConn, options, transaction))\r\n{\r\n    \r\n    bulkData.BatchSize = 5000;\r\n    bulkData.BulkCopyTimeout = 0;\r\n    bulkData.DestinationTableName = tableName;\r\n    bulkData.WriteToServer(dataTable);\r\n}\r\ntransaction.Commit();\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528151/using-sqlbulkcopy-to-fictionalize-data-for-a-training-demo-environment-perform","title":"Using SqlBulkCopy to fictionalize data for a training/demo environment - performance issues and how to page"},{"tags":["excel","colors","binary","bar-chart","spreadsheet"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":12119368,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-keVIHk5Yr8s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdMCF_79Q11zyvxq9AVOk-jyVCAXQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12119368/dom"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571856862,"creation_date":1571856862,"answer_id":58529371,"question_id":58528149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58529371","body_markdown":"I based this off of this guide but I&#39;ll detail how it works here on SO as well.\r\n\r\n[https://excel-example.com/charts/conditional-formatting-in-column-bar-charts][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst thing to do is to reformat your data so that the table looks like this\r\n````\r\nName     M      F\r\nJames    3.32    \r\nJohn     3.27\r\nRobert   3.14\r\nMichael  2.63\r\nMary            2.63\r\nWilliam  2.45\r\nDavid    2.36\r\nRichard  1.7\r\nCharles  1.52\r\nJoseph   1.4\r\nThomas   1.38\r\nPatricia        1.07\r\nLinda           1.04\r\nBarbara         0.98\r\nElizabeth       0.94\r\nJennifer        0.93\r\nMaria           0.83\r\nSusan           0.79\r\nMargaret        0.77\r\nDorothy         0.73\r\n````\r\nThe cells in the M column have the following formula which references the name. \r\n````\r\n=IF(A2=&quot;M&quot;,C2,&quot;&quot;)\r\n````\r\nThe cells in the F column have the following formula which references the name as well.\r\n````\r\n=IF(A2=&quot;F&quot;,C2,&quot;&quot;)\r\n````\r\nThen you&#39;ll just highlight your new data set and insert a stacked bar chart.

The structure of the terraform project looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n└── master\r\n    └── apps\r\n        ├── environments\r\n        │   ├── eu\r\n        │   │   ├── eu-prod\r\n        │   │   │   ├── eu-prod.tfstate\r\n        │   │   │   ├── eu-prod.tfstate.backup\r\n        │   │   │   └── eu-prod.tfvars\r\n        │   │   └── eu-staging\r\n        │   │       ├── eu-staging.tfstate\r\n        │   │       ├── eu-staging.tfstate.backup\r\n        │   │       └── eu-staging.tfvars\r\n        │   └── us\r\n        │       ├── us-prod\r\n        │       │   ├── us-prod.tfstate\r\n        │       │   ├── us-prod.tfstate.backup\r\n        │       │   └── us-prod.tfvars\r\n        │       └── us-staging\r\n        │           ├── us-staging.tfstate\r\n        │           ├── us-staging.tfstate.backup\r\n        │           └── us-staging.tfvars\r\n        ├── main.tf\r\n        ├── outputs.tf\r\n        ├── other_resources.tf\r\n        ├── variables.tf\r\n        └── versions.tf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case you can see we have 4 primary &quot;environments&quot; (or stacks). `eu-prod`, `eu-staging`, `us-prod` and `us-staging`. The base `.tf` files, however, are in `master/apps`. That&#39;s the actual HCL used to create each stack. The only thing that varies between stacks is sizes, names, and other vars. We use the cli arguments to specify which set of `.tfvars` to use and which `.tfstate` to write to. \r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the best way to go about migrating this to a remote backend like the `s3` backend? I&#39;ve been able to set the `s3` backend in `main.tf` by doing\r\n\r\n```\r\nterraform {\r\n  backend &quot;s3&quot; {\r\n    bucket               = &quot;foobar-terraform-state&quot;\r\n    key                  = &quot;foobar/terraform.tfstate&quot;\r\n    region               = &quot;us-west-1&quot;\r\n    dynamodb_table       = &quot;foobar-terraform-state-lock&quot;\r\n    encrypt              = true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I can&#39;t figure out how to distinguish between the different stacks. I can set the `.tfvars` for each stack but am unable to specify the keyname dynamically.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528129/migrating-multiple-tfstate-tfvars-files-to-a-s3-backend","title":"Migrating multiple `.tfstate` &amp; `.tfvars` files to a `s3` backend"},{"tags":["react-native","react-native-android","react-native-contacts"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12264610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mClIrBAF5HORiggrlqTokKlIZUhgONZG5cQqHFE=k-s128","display_name":"Sai kumar Chilukuri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12264610/sai-kumar-chilukuri"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571851703,"creation_date":1571851703,"question_id":58528128,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58528128","body_markdown":"How exactly the react-native-contacts getAll method works?

How can I do this?\r\n\r\nThe issues I am facing now is:\r\n\r\n - on load there is no bg color for the tile \r\n - The timings are off\r\n - Once the tile changes from green to orange to green for one iteration, it does not repeat.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the gif: [link][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UqejZKWZ_cy9fucaAqcw6pKBoURUYwhb/view?usp=sharing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528075/link-gif-to-div-using-javascript-timings","title":"Link Gif to Div using javascript timings"},{"tags":["node.js","reactjs","express","heroku"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":588,"user_id":9377366,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/885e8773aad4c9408787bfe8329b663f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Felipe Lanza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9377366/felipe-lanza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571852007,"post_id":58528070,"comment_id":103380627,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528070/login-working-in-localhost-but-error-secret-option-required-for-sessions-when#comment103380627_58528070"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":11337273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce784861c15684a4f6dd7763d42ee2ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"pythonNovice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11337273/pythonnovice"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571851870,"creation_date":1571851870,"answer_id":58528161,"question_id":58528070,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58528161","body_markdown":"Have you added your secret session from your .env file to heroku config?

The frequency can take any value (even more than one). However if you have to match the histogram Y axis with that of probability density then you have to add an argument of &quot;freq=FALSE&quot;.\r\n\r\nFor example in the code below, I have used the cars dataset to demonstrate the effect of using the named argument &quot;freq=&quot;.\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndata_1 &lt;- cars\r\n\r\n## These settings are for plotting two curves side by side\r\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\r\n## Without freq = FALSE\r\nhist(data_1$dist,plot=TRUE,freq=TRUE)\r\nlines(density(data_1$dist),col=&quot;red&quot;)\r\n\r\n## With freq = FALSE\r\nhist(data_1$dist,plot=TRUE,freq=FALSE)\r\nlines(density(data_1$dist),col=&quot;blue&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting image is as below. To the left is the red density curve which is flat because the Y-axis of histogram (which is more than 15) is too large for the probability density to show.
