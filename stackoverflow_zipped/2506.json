These test cases are end-to-end and very time consuming. \r\n\r\nThere is a framework (test automation) to automate these tests, but the framework is solely focused on standardizing the APIs across different endpoints and giving the ability to automate. If the business concerns are very high level, this framework is the opposite.\r\n\r\nI have very little personal knowledge on writing test-automation storage systems or test framework systems and I&#39;m not sure I am going at this the right way as I keep running into design problems that affect implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n# GOAL:\r\n\r\nNon-technical folks describe what should occur in their domain when doing specific interactions, this description persists and the final reporting is shown in this report. The implementation details are hidden, but when any custom action is not previously defined these non-technical folks can request assistance from technical folks in an effort to reduce the load on both individuals as manual testing is very time consuming and expensive. \r\n\r\n\r\n# IMPLEMENTATION:\r\n\r\nMy current iteration has this design with it partially implemented:\r\n\r\n1. Framework code- api calls.\r\n\r\n2. Framework DSL action: input, interacts with raw framework, and provides an output.\r\n\r\n![Action](https://i.imgur.com/T9vGMo0.png)\r\n\r\n3. Connecting components in a manner to build whole tests ex: test this feature and test this scenario using &quot;GIVEN, BEGIN, WHEN syntax&quot;\r\n\r\n![Test-Skeleton](https://i.imgur.com/wgEYvY9.png)\r\n\r\n4. Mutation of tests to create variants and easily add new cases based on pre-existing components.  ex: take test-case &quot;a540e1da-fc67-4d77-93ea-a78cd1e389c9&quot; and modify inputs and expected response. \r\n\r\n\r\nI know have something that takes a user input like this:\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeature: TXN X\r\nScenario: user with TXN X disabled shows no results\r\nGIVEN login_to_system($SYSTEM, $CUSTOMER)\r\nand emulate_user($USER)\r\nWHEN transaction_type_x($ARG1, $ARG2)\r\nand ...\r\nTHEN validate_txn_empty()\r\nand ...\r\n```\r\nValidates format, hooks into existing action-templates and parameters, and generates any skeletons that need user action. \r\n\r\nThe output of this action-\r\n\r\n1. New Action templates\r\n2. A combined test-skeleton (input variables and expected actions unspecified)\r\n3. Test-Mixin (input variables and expected actions for this scenario)\r\n3. An implemented test-case (input variables and expected actions specified)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point the user only needs to:\r\n\r\n1. Specify the input_arguments values\r\n2. Implement the New Action Templates that were created from this action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# PROBLEMS: \r\n\r\nAs this progresses and I get more awareness of the needs of this QA I&#39;m running into some very complicated decisions.\r\n\r\n1. Validating one building block can inter-operate with another and they work well- ex: outputs of one line up with inputs another needs.\r\n2.

Every time GAE hits the `/_ah/start` endpoint for my app it logs a 301 and the following error: `Process terminated because it failed to respond to the start request with an HTTP status code of 200-299 or 404.`\r\n\r\nMy server does have a handler for `/_ah/start` that simply writes a 200 and works fine locally. I also tried adding a handler for all routes in `app.yaml` just to make sure requests to the AppEngine load balancer are actually being routed to my server, but it still isn&#39;t working. I know from the service logs that my server is starting and listening on the correct port but it gets restarted over and over and can&#39;t actually handle any requests because of this issue with the GAE start request.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my `app.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nruntime: go111\r\ninstance_class: B1\r\nbasic_scaling:\r\n  max_instances: 1\r\nhandlers:\r\n- url: /.*\r\n  script:

You can use `requests` to get the html, beautifulsoup will get the `&lt;script&gt;` tag, then you can use `json,loads()` to parse.\r\n\r\n2) go directly to the source. Look at the dev tools and search the XHR to see if you can go directly to the url/API and that generates the data and return the data that way (most likely again in json format).

However I don&#39;t know any other way to get content from a dynamic web page. I thought the difference comes from the time needed for the browser to load elements but it is definitely more than that. Once the browser loads the page(5 seconds) all I had to do is to extract some `&lt;tr&gt;` tags from a table. It took about 3-4 minutes to extract 1016 records which is extremely slow in my opinion. I came to a conclusion that webdriver methods for finding elements such as `find_elements_by_name` are slow. Is `find_elements_by`.. from webdriver much slower than the `find` method in BeautifulSoup? And would it be faster if I get the whole html from the webdriver browser and then parse it with lxml and use the BeautifulSoup?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938852/web-scrapping-with-python-selenium-performance","title":"Web Scrapping with Python Selenium performance"},{"tags":["r","function","time-series"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":11028193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29b1e1445c38f7a8a44f5fc710759978?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeremy S.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11028193/jeremy-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568491482,"post_id":57938849,"comment_id":102293219,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938849/apply-a-function-to-a-time-series#comment102293219_57938849"},{"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568491544,"post_id":57938849,"comment_id":102293232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938849/apply-a-function-to-a-time-series#comment102293232_57938849"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":11028193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29b1e1445c38f7a8a44f5fc710759978?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeremy S.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11028193/jeremy-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568491958,"post_id":57938889,"comment_id":102293311,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938849/apply-a-function-to-a-time-series/57938889#comment102293311_57938889"},{"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":37,"user_id":11028193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29b1e1445c38f7a8a44f5fc710759978?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeremy S.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11028193/jeremy-s"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568492087,"post_id":57938889,"comment_id":102293347,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938849/apply-a-function-to-a-time-series/57938889#comment102293347_57938889"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568492059,"last_edit_date":1568492059,"creation_date":1568491661,"answer_id":57938889,"question_id":57938849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938889","body_markdown":"If we use the `return` with `list` (if the lengths are different) or a `data.frame` it would return\r\n\r\n    return(data.frame(V_A, Vola_A, DD, PD))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    do.call(rbind, apply(data, MARGIN = 1, FUN=function(data)\r\n         cca(V_LCL=data[[&quot;V_LCL&quot;]], \r\n          Vola_LCL=data[[&quot;Vola_LCL&quot;]], Barriere=data[[&quot;Barriere&quot;]], \r\n          rf=data[[&quot;rf&quot;]], HZ=1)))\r\n    #

I can post code if needed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938845/how-to-programatically-save-website-title-and-url-for-speed-dial-buttons-like-op","title":"How to programatically save website title and URL for speed dial buttons like opera or Firefox?"},{"tags":["azure","azure-web-app-service","azure-app-service-plans"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11314,"user_id":141022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/add11e55f296bf74058d1d6b90d1a58b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex KeySmith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/141022/alex-keysmith"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568640039,"post_id":57957555,"comment_id":102327368,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938844/do-app-service-plan-scale-unit-upgrades-await-warm-ups/57957555#comment102327368_57957555"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":960,"user_id":11017035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a74694b6e5d2ff9145f6b0f92b2449a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DixitArora-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11017035/dixitarora-msft"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568639292,"creation_date":1568639292,"answer_id":57957555,"question_id":57938844,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57957555","body_markdown":"With the AppInit feature, as new web app instances are added into rotation, we ensure that the Application Initialization module reports that the **site is fully warmed up before sending it requests from the frontend**. \r\n\r\nTo use the feature, add an applicationInitialization section to your web.config like so:\r\n\r\n&#160;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;system.webServer&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \r\n    &lt;applicationInitialization remapManagedRequestsTo=&quot;/Content/warmup.html&quot;&gt; \r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;add initializationPage=&quot;/api/values/100&quot; /&gt; \r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/applicationInitialization&gt;\r\n    &lt;/system.webServer&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can have multiple initialization pages, and the AppInit module will ensure that all of them return 200 before declaring the site officially warmed up. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, you can (optionally) use the remapManagedRequestsTo attribute to have a friendly page showing that the site is still warming up. &#160;\r\n\r\nThanks to the AppInit feature, this page will not be visible to customers while adding new instances into rotation, however if a process crashes for whatever reason and enters AppInit again, it will come into play.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938844/do-app-service-plan-scale-unit-upgrades-await-warm-ups/57957555#57957555","title":"Do App Service Plan scale unit upgrades await warm ups?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11314,"user_id":141022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/add11e55f296bf74058d1d6b90d1a58b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex KeySmith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/141022/alex-keysmith"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11314,"user_id":141022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/add11e55f296bf74058d1d6b90d1a58b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex KeySmith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/141022/alex-keysmith"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568639816,"creation_date":1568491297,"last_edit_date":1568639816,"question_id":57938844,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938844","body_markdown":"My understanding is that when an App Service &quot;scale unit&quot; - i.e. a collection of virtual machines within an Azure region - gets upgraded, they are upgraded in batches called &quot;upgrade domains&quot; which you share with other tenants.\r\n\r\nWhen an upgrade domain is complete then applications are moved onto it.

The point of using props is that you don&#39;t need to reference the router itself, e.g. via `$router`.\r\n\r\nNext problem, you&#39;re mixing `path` and `params`. That isn&#39;t allows. See https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html. `params` are for named routes.\r\n\r\nI imagine what you&#39;re aiming for is something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nself.$router.replace({ name: &#39;DashboardPatient&#39;, params: { myprops: authUser.email } })\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith router config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  path: &#39;/patient&#39;,\r\n  component: Dash,\r\n  children: [\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;:myprops&#39;, // &lt;--- Adding myprops to the URL \r\n      name: &#39;DashboardPatient&#39;,\r\n      component: DashboardPatient,\r\n      props: true,\r\n      meta: { requiresAuth: true }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that routing is all about building and parsing the URL. So the value of `myprops` needs to be in the URL somewhere. In my example it comes at the end, so you&#39;ll get `/patient/user@example.com` as the URL. If it weren&#39;t in the URL then there&#39;d be no way for the router to populate the prop if the user hit that page directly (or refreshed the page).\r\n\r\nTo hit the same route using a `path` instead of a `name` it&#39;d be something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nself.$router.replace({ path: `patient/${encodeURIComponent(authUser.email)}` })\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even just:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nself.$router.replace(`patient/${encodeURIComponent(authUser.email)}`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally I&#39;d go with the named route so that the encoding is handled automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want to put the data in the URL then routing is not the appropriate way to pass it along. You&#39;d need to use an alternative, such as putting it in the Vuex store.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938840/data-passing-using-props-in-router-is-not-working/57939282#57939282","title":"Data passing using props in router is not

is one of the simplest ways to do this:\r\n\r\n1.  Make your C program print its output on `stdout`. This is the standard stream which is used by `printf()`.\r\n1.  Make your python program read its input from `stdin`. This is the standard stream which is used by `input()`.\r\n1.  Connect both programs on the command line with the pipe symbol `|` like this:\r\n\r\n        c-program | python script.py\r\n\r\nNote that there are more ways to make two programs communicate. And there are more ways to write to `stdout` and to read from `stdin`.\r\n\r\nThe method described works on all major operating systems.\r\n\r\nOne of its biggest advantages is that you can develop each part independent from the other and test it on its own. In example, you can pipe the output of the C program into a file to check later. Similarly you can pipe the input of this or any other file into the python script.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938839/how-can-i-connect-the-output-of-a-c-program-to-a-python-program-at-runtime/57939177#57939177","title":"How can I connect the output of a C program to a python program at runtime"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9302627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97e51e951decd6fd7b3e37c0c3074564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raghav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9302627/raghav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568646966,"post_id":57939473,"comment_id":102331428,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938839/how-can-i-connect-the-output-of-a-c-program-to-a-python-program-at-runtime/57939473#comment102331428_57939473"},{"owner":{"reputation":905,"user_id":802158,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a23bfee82fcbc079905a8e79d9deccb1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Felipe Cruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/802158/felipe-cruz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9302627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97e51e951decd6fd7b3e37c0c3074564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raghav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9302627/raghav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568648400,"post_id":57939473,"comment_id":102332231,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938839/how-can-i-connect-the-output-of-a-c-program-to-a-python-program-at-runtime/57939473#comment102332231_57939473"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":905,"user_id":802158,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a23bfee82fcbc079905a8e79d9deccb1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Felipe Cruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/802158/felipe-cruz"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568497336,"creation_date":1568497336,"answer_id":57939473,"question_id":57938839,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57939473","body_markdown":"The best way to do it is using the [fileinput][1] module as following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport fileinput\r\n\r\nfor line in fileinput.input():\r\n    print(line.rstrip())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis loop will process every input line from `stdin`.\r\n\r\nAn then you could run something like\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat data.csv | python r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938839/how-can-i-connect-the-output-of-a-c-program-to-a-python-program-at-runtime/57939473#57939473","title":"How can I connect the output of a C program to a python program at runtime"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9302627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97e51e951decd6fd7b3e37c0c3074564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raghav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9302627/raghav"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9302627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97e51e951decd6fd7b3e37c0c3074564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raghav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9302627/raghav"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568544218,"accepted_answer_id":57939177,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568574219,"creation_date":1568491249,"last_edit_date":1568574219,"question_id":57938839,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938839","body_markdown":"I have a C program that is generating live data and I am trying to pipe the data to a python program so that I can process it and plot it at run-time.\r\n\r\nI can save the output of C program to a file and then read it into python but I want to do it at run-time.

can replace the “same-type constraint”  by a “subclass constraint” and use the collections `Element` type instead of `Foo` in the implementation:\r\n\r\n    extension Collection where Element: Foo

that this requires `Foo` (and its subclasses) to have a “required init” method:\r\n\r\n    required init(name: String, color: NSColor) \r\n\r\nAnother option is to define a protocol\r\n\r\n    protocol P {\r\n        var name: String { get }\r\n        init(name: String, color: NSColor)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nto which `Foo` (and its subclasses) conform, and use the constraint \r\n\r\n    extension Collection where Element: P \r\n\r\nfor the extension method.\r\n\r\nIn any case, a more concise implementation would be\r\n\r\n    extension Collection where Element: Foo {\r\n        func

}\r\n\r\n*Re your edit:* As a free generic method (instead of an extension method) it would be something like \r\n\r\n    func color&lt;T: P&gt;(items: [T], with colors: [NSColor]) -&gt; [T] {\r\n        return items.flatMap { item in\r\n            colors.map { T(name: item.name, color: $0) }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nusing the protocol defined above.

If you reinstalled the app shortly after uninstalling it, this is the expected behavior on iOS.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is manyfold, so I&#39;ll list a few bits of how Firebase Authentication below:\r\n\r\n1. Firebase Authentication uses two tokens to authenticate the user, a long-lived refresh token, and a short-lived ID token. \r\n\r\n2. The ID token is valid for one hour from when it is minted. Once minted, **an ID token can&#39;t be revoked**, which is why Firebase doesn&#39;t have to perform an expensive extra check on every interaction.\r\n\r\n3. The ID token is persisted on the device, so that restarting the app can quickly pick up the user&#39;s authentication state, as long as the token has not expired. \r\n\r\n4. On iOS the ID token is stored in the user&#39;s keychain, which is not automatically deleted when you delete an app. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27893418/firebase-deleting-and-reinstalling-app-does-not-un-authenticate-a-user\r\n\r\n\r\nGive it another hour or so, and you should see that the user is no longer authenticated. Alternatively, don&#39;t delete the user account, but disable it both in Firebase Authentication **and** in the back-end service that you&#39;re using. For an example of this see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35960546/firebase-still-retrieving-authdata-after-deletion/35961217#35961217 and [five tips to secure your app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvLkkLjHdkw).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938783/deleted-firebase-user-still-can-authenticate/57939346#57939346","title":"Deleted Firebase User still can authenticate"}],"owner":{"reputation":469,"user_id":5843195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gm2rd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"i6x86","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5843195/i6x86"},"last_editor":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57939346,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568496131,"creation_date":1568490707,"last_edit_date":1568492341,"question_id":57938783,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938783","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve manually deleted Firebase User, then removed the app from the device (physical iPhone) and then when I install it, it pass trough the auth check printing the deleted user email and all.\r\nThis is the method I use to check if user exists\r\n\r\n    home: FutureBuilder&lt;FirebaseUser&gt;(future: Provider.of&lt;AuthService&gt;(context).getUser(),\r\n          builder: (context, AsyncSnapshot&lt;FirebaseUser&gt; snapshot) {\r\n        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {\r\n        if (snapshot.error != null) {\r\n        print(&#39;error&#39;);\r\n        return Text(snapshot.error.toString());\r\n        }\r\n        user = snapshot.data;\r\n        print(user.email);\r\n        return snapshot.hasData ?

Take a look at the following code.\r\n\r\nFirst make a parent div with class *form-horizontal* then for each input make a div with class *form-group*\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;form-horizontal&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;h4&gt;Write a Suitable title for your Form&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n        &lt;hr /&gt;\r\n           &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt; @*Create this div for each form input element*@\r\n                    @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.Title, htmlAttributes: new { @class = &quot;control-label col-md-2&quot; })\r\n\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt; @*Based on your requirement you can change the col-md-3 value any where from 1 to 10*@\r\n\r\n                    @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.Title, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = &quot;form-control&quot; } })\r\n                    @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.Title, &quot;&quot;, new { @class = &quot;text-danger&quot; })\r\n\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nSo as you noticed \r\n\r\n 1. for complete form we are having a div parent class form-horizontal\r\n 2. for each input element we will have a form-group div class\r\n 3. within each form-group we will have 2 elements label and a div with class col-md-6(or whatever length you prefer) containing the main input element(textbox, dropdown, checkbox etc)\r\n\r\nSo stop using li Elements and replace them with div with class form-group will sort many issues for you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938760/html-layout-in-mvc-5-razor-page-using-bootstrap-css-not-showing-the-way-i-want-i/57940544#57940544","title":"HTMl layout in MVC 5 Razor Page using bootstrap css not showing the way I want it to"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":6797268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ca103f751da810ac143dc89df4a0bfa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frankofoedu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6797268/frankofoedu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568641482,"creation_date":1568641482,"answer_id":57958201,"question_id":57938760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57958201","body_markdown":"For the &quot;published on&quot; and &quot;last modified&quot; input fields you can try using the flex classes in bootstrap. \r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;d-flex&quot;&gt;\r\n     &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;\r\n     &lt;button&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-calendar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;    \r\n\r\n                                          \r\n\r\n1.[bootstrap doc flex][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.[Here is a cheat sheet for flex boxes][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/\r\n  [2]: https://jonibologna.com/blog/flexbox-cheatsheet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938760/html-layout-in-mvc-5-razor-page-using-bootstrap-css-not-showing-the-way-i-want-i/57958201#57958201","title":"HTMl layout in MVC 5 Razor Page using bootstrap css not showing the way I want it to"}],"owner":{"reputation":1081,"user_id":244385,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff1f7796781f4024fa0043eeb96a3918?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/244385/ken"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568641482,"creation_date":1568490470,"question_id":57938760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938760","body_markdown":"I am having a great deal of trouble trying to get things to line up correctly and be presented in the same row.

I don&#39;t know why the Y pos doesn&#39;t change with the Ascii art, any clue? And thanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938757/y-position-of-an-ascii-art-doesnt-change-whereas-x-position-does","title":"Y position of an Ascii art doesn&#39;t change whereas, X position does"},{"tags":["c++","arrays","char","fstream"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":68012,"user_id":3943312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1qdf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sam Varshavchik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3943312/sam-varshavchik"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568490635,"post_id":57938755,"comment_id":102293066,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938755/assigning-char-array-from-ifstream-breaks-array-if-adding-another-char-to-array#comment102293066_57938755"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12068153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ce-9R0EdscM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjM/uSYhvJVSkDo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christopher Chafin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068153/christopher-chafin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":68012,"user_id":3943312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1qdf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sam Varshavchik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3943312/sam-varshavchik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568491135,"post_id":57938755,"comment_id":102293150,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938755/assigning-char-array-from-ifstream-breaks-array-if-adding-another-char-to-array#comment102293150_57938755"},{"owner":{"reputation":23537,"user_id":4581301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5580eebb22e2c65c9b2325d2276d92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4581301/user4581301"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568491888,"post_id":57938755,"comment_id":102293298,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938755/assigning-char-array-from-ifstream-breaks-array-if-adding-another-char-to-array#comment102293298_57938755"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12068153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ce-9R0EdscM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjM/uSYhvJVSkDo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christopher Chafin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068153/christopher-chafin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23537,"user_id":4581301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5580eebb22e2c65c9b2325d2276d92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4581301/user4581301"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568492138,"post_id":57938755,"comment_id":102293364,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938755/assigning-char-array-from-ifstream-breaks-array-if-adding-another-char-to-array#comment102293364_57938755"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12068153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ce-9R0EdscM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjM/uSYhvJVSkDo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christopher Chafin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068153/christopher-chafin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568492491,"post_id":57938755,"comment_id":102293422,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938755/assigning-char-array-from-ifstream-breaks-array-if-adding-another-char-to-array#comment102293422_57938755"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12068153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ce-9R0EdscM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjM/uSYhvJVSkDo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christopher Chafin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068153/christopher-chafin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568490991,"post_id":57938773,"comment_id":102293121,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938755/assigning-char-array-from-ifstream-breaks-array-if-adding-another-char-to-array/57938773#comment102293121_57938773"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":400,"user_id":2212476,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df7ac7b7d7e359782f1244641dcaad52?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Boki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2212476/boki"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568490650,"creation_date":1568490650,"answer_id":57938773,"question_id":57938755,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938773","body_markdown":"you forgot to add &#39;\\0&#39;

Assuming you will call this method in your static main function:\r\n\r\n    public static int binarySearch(int[] list, int key) {\r\n      int low = 0;\r\n      int high = list.length - 1;\r\n    \r\n      while(high &gt;= low) { //search array until there is a single element left\r\n        int mid = (low + high) / 2; //mark middle index\r\n        if (key &lt; list[mid]) //if key is smaller than the middle element..\r\n          high = mid - 1;  //new high is the middle element\r\n        else if (key == list[mid]) //if key=middle element --&gt; voila!\r\n          return mid; //returns the index of searched element if it is in your array\r\n        else\r\n          low = mid + 1; //if key is greater than the middle element new low is middle element\r\n      }\r\n      return –low - 1;  //high &lt; low, key not found\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938742/search-method-that-finds-an-element-by-cutting-an-array-in-halves-java/57938959#57938959","title":"Search method that finds an element by cutting an array in halves (Java)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":6846232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb26ac2eb21db23f9c20416979cd319e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mano176","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6846232/mano176"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568492321,"creation_date":1568492321,"answer_id":57938977,"question_id":57938742,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938977","body_markdown":"Solved it like this:\r\n\r\n    while (true) {\r\n        if (targetint&gt;array[array.length-1] || targetint&lt;array[0])\r\n            return false;\r\n\r\n        int middleInt = array[Math.round(array.length/2)];\r\n        if (middleInt == targetint) {\r\n            return true;\r\n        } else if (targetint&lt;middleInt) {\r\n            int[] firstHalf = new int[array.length/2];\r\n            System.arraycopy(array, 0, firstHalf, 0, firstHalf.length);\r\n            array = firstHalf;\r\n        } else if (targetint&gt;middleInt) {\r\n            int[] secondHalf = new int[array.length/2];\r\n            System.arraycopy(array, array.length/2, secondHalf, 0, secondHalf.length);\r\n            array = secondHalf;\r\n        } else if(array.length == 1)\r\n            return false;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938742/search-method-that-finds-an-element-by-cutting-an-array-in-halves-java/57938977#57938977","title":"Search method that finds an element by cutting an array in halves (Java)"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11879492,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oUYt_K9mFBU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/SQlE5hi-DMQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11879492/mar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":905,"user_id":11567551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/612ccd6960e869b7f26ff8703e9b09b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michiel Leegwater","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11567551/michiel-leegwater"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57938959,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568504595,"creation_date":1568490343,"last_edit_date":1568504595,"question_id":57938742,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938742","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on an assignment.\r\nWhat I must create is a method that searches for an specific int in an array.

But some comments on your code first:\r\n\r\n1. By convention, variable names should never begin with an uppercase (such as in your `let ModelArray`). It makes it harder to read. If not to you, to others. When sharing code (such as in stackoverflow), try to follow proper conventions.\r\n\r\n2. You are calling `ForEach(models)`, but you have not defined a models array (you did create ModelArray though).\r\n\r\n3. Inside your ForEach, you are calling `Model(...)`. Inside ForEach you need a view to display your data. But Model, in your code, is a data type. Does not make sense.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the code that I think, does what you asked. When you tap the view, its isActive flag toggles.

Using ```create-react-app``` (for which ```react-scripts``` is a utility), or webpack in general, the app must *always* be rebuilt at some point for the changes to be seen, since JSX is not browser-compatible and must be transpiled to regular JS.  Also, it&#39;s not necessary to restart the server if you&#39;re only making changes to the front end.\r\n\r\nRunning ```react-scripts start``` basically runs [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) (WDS) which is built into CRA&#39;s configuration.  WDS does not actually build the project in the sense of outputting build files, but it still must build it in-memory to be able to even display the changes at all. On a normal application, rebuilding through WDS shouldn&#39;t take more than a handful of seconds, and that&#39;s about the fastest feedback loop you&#39;re going to get for seeing changes manifest.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re running an Express server alongside a CRA app, I&#39;d recommend looking into [concurrently](https://www.google.com/search?q=npm+concurrently&amp;oq=npm+concurrently&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2015j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) and [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon), the former of which will allow you to run your server and React client with one command, and the latter of which will automatically restart your server for you (only when back end changes are made, a front end change will not trigger a server restart).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938689/how-to-run-react-scripts-start-from-an-express-server/57938789#57938789","title":"How to run react-scripts start from an express server?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":384,"user_id":5653309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af38d81d7de372cfc3d417c5cc7c024e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Indrajeet Patil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5653309/indrajeet-patil"},"last_editor":{"reputation":384,"user_id":5653309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af38d81d7de372cfc3d417c5cc7c024e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Indrajeet Patil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5653309/indrajeet-patil"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568491971,"last_edit_date":1568491971,"creation_date":1568490826,"answer_id":57938793,"question_id":57938689,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938793","body_markdown":"`react-scripts start` sets up the development environment and starts a server along with hot module reloading.

So what&#39;s the proper way for scaling so that I have a unique solution? \r\n\r\nExample below:\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    from sklearn import datasets\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\r\n    boston = datasets.load_boston()\r\n    \r\n    X = boston.data\r\n    y = boston.target\r\n    \r\n    reg = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1, n_estimators=10)\r\n    reg.fit(X, y)\r\n    \r\n    reg_eq = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1, n_estimators=10)\r\n    reg_eq.fit(X, y, sample_weight=np.full(len(y),1))\r\n    \r\n    reg_eq_bad = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1, n_estimators=10)\r\n    reg_eq_bad.fit(X, y, sample_weight=np.full(len(y),0.1))\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    xt = X[:20]\r\n    print(reg.predict(xt))\r\n    print(reg_eq.predict(xt))\r\n    print(reg_eq_bad.predict(xt))\r\n    \r\n    np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal(reg.predict(xt),reg_eq.predict(xt))\r\n    np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal(reg.predict(xt),reg_eq_bad.predict(xt)) # 75% mismatch\r\n\r\n

Thus the logic inside of it will only run a single time.\r\n\r\n      useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n        generateRandomPotentialPartner();\r\n        console.log(state.potentialParnter)\r\n      }, [])\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938668/why-is-my-setstate-causing-an-infinite-loop/57938729#57938729","title":"Why is my setState causing an infinite loop?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5146,"user_id":4183702,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WxJZT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mohamed Ramrami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183702/mohamed-ramrami"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568490256,"creation_date":1568490256,"answer_id":57938730,"question_id":57938668,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938730","body_markdown":"It&#39;s because of `useEffect` :  if you don&#39;t provide a second parameter this hook will run every time your component re-renders. \r\n\r\nSo what happens in your code is as follow :\r\n\r\n1. your component is rendered for the first time\r\n2. useEffect runs\r\n3. you get a random user and setState\r\n4. your components re-renders\r\n5. useEffect runs again\r\n6. ...\r\n\r\nIf you want it to run only when you component is mounted , give an empty array as second parameter :\r\n\r\n      useEffect(() =&gt;

am new to C# and I am trying to transfer a C++ package into a WPF project.

The value of `mid = (left+right)/2` can never adjust `left` or `right` such that `left &gt; right`.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s an easy fix for this: `while (left &lt; right)`. But this unfortunately creates 2 exit results, the target can&#39;t be found **or** the target is the final value, so we need to test for that after exiting the `while` loop.\r\n\r\n    if (values(left) == target) Some(left) else None\r\n\r\nThe next problem is that you&#39;re adjusting the wrong variable for current `mid` value. The simple fix is to change from `if(value &lt; target)` to `if(value &gt; target)`.\r\n\r\nAlso, after you know that `mid` is not the target we&#39;re looking for, it doesn&#39;t have to be retained for any future grouping. So now that section looks like this:\r\n\r\n    else if(value &gt; target)\r\n      right = mid-1\r\n    else\r\n      left = mid+1\r\n\r\nFinally, your code doesn&#39;t handle the empty array condition. Let&#39;s add that test at the end.\r\n\r\n    if (n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; values(left) == target) Some(left) else None\r\n\r\nSo now the code passes all the tests that I&#39;ve thrown at it.

are a some mistakes and errors in your code:\r\n\r\n - The function `retrieve_orders_ids_from_a_product_id()` works fine and gives an **array of order IDs**, but NOT an array of `WC_Order` Objects: so for example, in your code, the method `has_status()` can&#39;t be used on a non `WC_Order` Object.\r\n - The current `WC_Order` object is already included with `woocommerce_order_status_changed` hook, so the argument is missing from your function.\r\n - The hook `woocommerce_order_status_changed` is included in `WC_Order` [`status_transition()`][1] method source code, that is used by [`update_status()`][2], so you **can&#39;t use it with this hook**, as it makes a kind of infinite loop.\r\n - And some other things…\r\n\r\n&gt; **WooCommerce orders and reducing product stock quantity process explained:**\r\n\r\n&gt; The product stock status is reduced using [`wc_maybe_reduce_stock_levels()`][3]  function which is hooked in those 4 hooks *(see it on the [function source code][3])*: &lt;br&gt;\r\n- `woocommerce_payment_complete` - *has `$order_id` as argument*,&lt;br&gt;\r\n- `woocommerce_order_status_on-hold` - *has `$order_id` and `$order` as arguments*,&lt;br&gt;\r\n- `woocommerce_order_status_processing` - *has `$order_id` and `$order` as arguments*,&lt;br&gt;\r\n- `woocommerce_order_status_completed` - *has `$order_id` and `$order` as arguments*.\r\n\r\n&gt; When the related products stock quantities are reduced by an order, a specific meta data is set to this order, which **meta key** is **`_order_stock_reduced`** and **meta value** is **`1`**, avoiding to reduce it multiple times.\r\n\r\nIn the code below, we will use those 4 hooks. \r\n\r\nTo avoid problems using WC_Order `update_status()` method with those hooks *(as explained before)*, we will use instead `wp_update_post()` WordPress function. \r\n\r\nYou can try the following:\r\n\r\n\tfunction get_processing_orders_from_a_product_id( $product_id ) {\r\n\t

It should better work.\r\n\r\n&gt; **This might be a problem:** What about if the stock of the product is reduced by 3 for example (order item quantity) and jumps over the **`350`** *(or **`140`**)* stock quantity threshold?

Somehow I got syntax errors and etc. I didn&#39;t include the code here since it&#39;s too long and I&#39;m considering to start from ***scratch***. \r\n\r\nEssentially I would make a new file that has the same name as the image then replace below config variables (WIDTH,HEIGHT,etc) with the images size and path.\r\n\r\nThe template Conky config:\r\n\r\n    conky.config = {\r\n    \r\n    \t--Various settings\r\n    \r\n    \tdouble_buffer = true,\t\t\t\t\t\t-- eliminates flicker \t\r\n\r\n    \t--Windows\r\n    \r\n    \town_window = true,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-- create your own window to draw\r\n    \town_window_argb_visual = true,\t\t\t\t-- use ARGB \r\n    \town_window_type = &#39;override&#39;,\t\t\t\t-- keeps the image in the back \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \t--Placement\r\n    \r\n    \talignment = &#39;middle_middle&#39;,\t\t\t\t-- position of the conky\r\n    \r\n        --#########################################################################################\r\n        --########################\t\tTHE IMPORTANT CHANGABLE STUFF\t\t#######################\r\n        --#########################################################################################\r\n    \r\n    \tminimum_width = WIDTH,\t\t\t\t\t\t-- minimum height of window\r\n    \tminimum_height = HEIGHT,\t\t\t\t\t-- minimum height of window\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    \tconky.text = [[\r\n    \t${image PATH -s SIZE}\r\n    \r\n    ]];\r\n\r\n - WIDTH:  width of the image  \r\n - HEIGHT: height of the image\r\n - PATH:   path to the image\r\n - SIZE:  width + &quot;x&quot; + height of the image\r\n\r\nThis is the final result of the conky config. \r\n\r\n    conky.config = {\r\n    \tminimum_width = 800,\t\t\t\t\t\t-- minimum height of window\r\n    \tminimum_height = 1300,\t\t\t\t\t\t-- minimum height of window\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    \tconky.text = [[\r\n    \t${image /home/omarali/scripts/conky/conky-sets/images/record.jpg -s 800x1300}\r\n    \r\n    ]];\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, Just need a simple way to put the images into a conkies that I can later call from a bash script. Python or Bash script will do.\r\n\r\n**Here what I&#39;m looking for:**\r\n\r\n 1. **Build a conky config from each image in a directory. let&#39;s say *dir_pins***\r\n 2. **Each conky should have the same name as the image. (this was my issue)**\r\n 3. **Can be python or bash script, open to ideas but prefer these 2.**\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it, as mentioned before I already have a script to auto run my configs. Really appreciate your help. And open to new ideas.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky\r\n\r\n\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/omarali-koy/Stack_Overflow_Questions/tree/master/conky%20(copy%201)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938636/build-files-from-template-and-add-tweaks-turn-images-into-conky-configs","title":"Build files from template and add tweaks (turn images into conky configs)"},{"tags":["flutter","dart","flutter-test"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3653,"user_id":1037345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e96369bef56992b3fe4d7fccb606016?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ookami.kb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1037345/ookami-kb"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568493186,"creation_date":1568493186,"answer_id":57939073,"question_id":57938635,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57939073","body_markdown":"You have `NoSuchMethodError: The getter &#39;length&#39; was called on null`, because `FutureBuilder`&#39;s snapshot data will be null until the future is resolved.\r\n\r\nYou can either provide `initialData`:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nFutureBuilder(\r\n   future: _data,\r\n   initialData: [],\r\n   builder: (context, projectSnap) {\r\n        ...\r\n        return ListView.builder(\r\n          itemCount: projectSnap.data.length, \r\n          itemBuilder: (context, index)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor check if data exists inside builder:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nFutureBuilder(\r\n   future: _data,\r\n   builder: (context, projectSnap) {\r\n        if (!projectSnap.hasData) return Container();\r\n        ...\r\n        return ListView.builder(\r\n          itemCount: projectSnap.data.length, \r\n          itemBuilder: (context, index)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938635/flutter-dart-how-can-i-have-two-e-two-isgreaterthanorequalto-in-one-field-in-a-q/57939073#57939073","title":"Flutter/Dart How can I have two e two isGreaterThanOrEqualTo in one field in a QuerySnapshot?"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12016209,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56146a521d0640bfe08a094b47bfc976?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Livio98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12016209/livio98"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12016209,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56146a521d0640bfe08a094b47bfc976?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Livio98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12016209/livio98"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57939073,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568493186,"creation_date":1568489511,"last_edit_date":1568491387,"question_id":57938635,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938635","body_markdown":"I want from a collection of firestore only these files in the Futerbuilder have both the same data.But it does not work.
