Gatsby comes out-of-the-box with support for defining environment variables in environment-specific `.env.[environment]` files (e.g. `.env.development`), provided these files are in the root of your project (i.e. `your-project/.env.development`).  [Documentation for this feature](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/environment-variables/#defining-environment-variables). You do **not** need to install or configure `dotenv` for this to work. \r\n\r\n1. Another approach is to use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), which will allows you to use a general `.env` file. You need to then import and configure the tool, which is generally done at the very top line of `gatsby-config.js` and looks like this:\r\n\r\n        require(&quot;dotenv&quot;).config()\r\n\r\n Note that you do *not* specify the environment name (e.g. `development`) in this scenario, and you would not commit the `.env` file to your repository. \r\n\r\nThe other issue you might run into is that part of your code runs server-side, using Node, and part runs client-side (in the browser). Since `process.env` is only available in Node, Gatsby does some additional work to make it available in the browser. We don&#39;t want _all_ of these variables, which frequently hold secrets, to be provided to the browser, though, so Gatsby only copies over those that whose names begin with `GATSBY`. Finally, as a side effect of the way that these variables get copied over, you must explicitly reference them for your build to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// this is okay everywhere\r\nconst GATSBY_APP = process.env.GATSBY_APP\r\n\r\n// this won&#39;t work in code that runs client-side, but will work\r\n// in `gatsby-node.js` and other files that only run in Node\r\nconst { GATSBY_APP } = process.env\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488635/gatsby-environment-variables-not-accessible-in-browser/58507413#58507413","title":"Gatsby, Environment variables not accessible in browser"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":2146081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c255736921411ff5f004625a33ce4e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2146081","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2146081/user2146081"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1237,"user_id":7599510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iJk2N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"norbitrial","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7599510/norbitrial"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58507413,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571757377,"creation_date":1571668672,"last_edit_date":1571678024,"question_id":58488635,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488635","body_markdown":"I want to use environment variables.

I have tried to fix the corrupted tables with words repair feature but there was no visible result.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488634/word-corrupts-tables-added-via-powershell","title":"Word corrupts tables added via PowerShell"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","anaconda","threadpool","python-multiprocessing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22275,"user_id":3000206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NaBI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carcigenicate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3000206/carcigenicate"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571669601,"post_id":58488633,"comment_id":103308151,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488633/why-imap-unordered-has-longer-output-than-input-when-using-pool-with-maxtasksper#comment103308151_58488633"},{"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":9463681,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GfYJ8HTVcyM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD8/uXh1xQQCG-g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jan Musil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9463681/jan-musil"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22275,"user_id":3000206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NaBI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carcigenicate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3000206/carcigenicate"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571669962,"post_id":58488633,"comment_id":103308331,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488633/why-imap-unordered-has-longer-output-than-input-when-using-pool-with-maxtasksper#comment103308331_58488633"}],"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":9463681,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GfYJ8HTVcyM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD8/uXh1xQQCG-g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jan Musil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9463681/jan-musil"},"last_editor":{"reputation":92,"user_id":9463681,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GfYJ8HTVcyM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD8/uXh1xQQCG-g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jan Musil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9463681/jan-musil"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571733756,"creation_date":1571668669,"last_edit_date":1571733756,"question_id":58488633,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488633","body_markdown":"I have very function, with one argument, which is also return value.

It&#39;s just normal loop where some variable is increased by 1 after each iteration.\r\n\r\nWell, when `maxtasksperchild` argument is not used, then output is correct.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know why this behavior is present when using `maxtasksperchild`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488633/why-imap-unordered-has-longer-output-than-input-when-using-pool-with-maxtasksper","title":"Why imap_unordered has longer output than input when using pool with maxtasksperchild parameter in Anaconda python?"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14547,"user_id":1007220,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/htE7h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"aynber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1007220/aynber"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571668765,"post_id":58488631,"comment_id":103307672,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488631/how-i-can-restrict-mouse-only-in-the-browsers-screen-in-pop-up-window#comment103307672_58488631"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11676979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CSBnOwjXLgc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdW9dN9XCg4PCEv8nqPCvLz_9QMgw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cameron Hanton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11676979/cameron-hanton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571669360,"post_id":58488631,"comment_id":103314165,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488631/how-i-can-restrict-mouse-only-in-the-browsers-screen-in-pop-up-window#comment103314165_58488631"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11773538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60f4437266eb9258960f05c4f1314a0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SouvikBiswas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11773538/souvikbiswas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22892,"user_id":1291492,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f914cd02166793195d9d950503f8f739?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ControlAltDel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1291492/controlaltdel"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571669360,"creation_date":1571668665,"last_edit_date":1571668873,"question_id":58488631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488631","body_markdown":"Currently I am working on the online exam system,and the requirement is that during exam time no student should not able to close, minimize and maximize the pop up window.

You mention that the Docker containers might run on different machines. I recommend using container orchestrators like [Docker Swarm][1] or [Kubernetes][2] to manage a cluster and communication between microservices (typically via DNS).\r\n\r\nGenerally, you want to hide all your microservices behind one API path. The outside world does not need to know that your server application consists of multiple microservices. You can use a simple reverse proxy for this. I personally like [Traefik][3] because you can configure the routing paths in the Docker ecosystem via labels.\r\n\r\nYou say you consume the microservice APIs with a browser, so is it a web client application? If so, I recommend serving it as Docker container as well and embed it into the routing by using relative paths. E.g. UI is served as `/` and microservices as `/api/{service}/{path}`. Then the UI application can use relative paths because they are served by the same reverse proxy and such under the same URL (=&gt; no CORS issues). Additionally, you can deploy to any IP, the routing stays the same and does not have to be adjusted \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/docker/swarm\r\n  [2]: https://kubernetes.io/\r\n  [3]: https://traefik.io/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488616/apache-web-server-and-microservices-with-docker/58501721#58501721","title":"Apache web server and microservices with Docker"}],"owner":{"reputation":8112,"user_id":15173,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c5a1366e30fa3217c8c4c8df2854547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"michelemarcon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15173/michelemarcon"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571738387,"creation_date":1571668600,"question_id":58488616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488616","body_markdown":"I have a few spring boot microservices running on Docker, and Apache web server (also running on Docker) for all the static stuff.

Like you say, every (config true) list requires a key. Designating a leaf as a key makes that leaf mandatory, so you can&#39;t really have an instance document like in your example - if you make all four leafs to be keys (which you can as there may be multiple list keys) each node has to have all of them to be valid, and making just a couple of them to be keys, doesn&#39;t work for your example either.\r\n\r\nNote that a config false list does not need to have any keys. If you are not modeling configuration (or NETCONF/RESTCONF related data), that may be your way out.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlist node {\r\n  config false;\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you have no choice - you need to introduce another leaf to serve as an id for an entry.\r\n\r\nEither way, you would probably utilize the `unique` statement (I&#39;m assuming based on names of your leafs), to make entries in the list unique. It works in a similar way as `key`, but elements need not appear in an instance document if you use it - it only requires that the combination of nodes that do appear in the instance is unique across all entries of a list.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nlist node {\r\n  config false;\r\n  unique &quot;id1 id2 id3 id4&quot;;\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: there is a similar [answered question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49083454/yang-how-to-model-nested-lists-configuration-data-without-key/49112971#49112971) with some more details.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488596/how-to-model-a-list-in-yang-with-no-common-child-elements/58498541#58498541","title":"How to model a list in YANG with no common child elements?"}],"owner":{"reputation":347,"user_id":8860764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/200f6aae2f4c00e977284b8a6758114e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adrian Negru","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8860764/adrian-negru"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58498541,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571726975,"creation_date":1571668528,"question_id":58488596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488596","body_markdown":"I have an XML that looks like this.\r\n```\r\n&lt;c&gt;\r\n    &lt;node&gt;\r\n       &lt;id1&gt;value&lt;/id1&gt;\r\n       &lt;id2&gt;value&lt;/id2&gt;\r\n    &lt;/node&gt;\r\n    &lt;node&gt;\r\n       &lt;id3&gt;value&lt;/id3&gt;\r\n       &lt;id4&gt;value&lt;/id4&gt;\r\n    &lt;/node&gt;\r\n&lt;/c&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can this list be modeled in YANG?

Keep your `createNotificationChannel()` method in your main class. However, I suggest creating a different class with a static method (to create your notification) then just call it in the `FirebaseMessagingService` class.

has no built-in commands for Nuget support, so you will have to use the `nuget` [command line utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-exe-cli-reference) to include Nuget dependencies using CMake.\r\n\r\nYou can use CMake&#39;s [`find_program()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_program.html) to locate the `nuget` command line utility (once installed), coupled with [`add_custom_command()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html) or [`execute_process()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/execute_process.html) to execute `nuget` commands from CMake. The answers to this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/18132987/3987854) discuss in more detail, but it could essentially look something like this:\r\n\r\n    # Find Nuget (install the latest CLI here: https://www.nuget.org/downloads).\r\n    find_program(NUGET nuget)\r\n    if(NOT NUGET)\r\n        message(FATAL &quot;CMake could not find the nuget command line tool. Please install it!&quot;)\r\n    else()\r\n        # Copy the Nuget config file from source location to the CMake build directory.\r\n        configure_file(packages.config.in packages.config COPYONLY)\r\n        # Run Nuget using the .config file to install any missing dependencies to the build directory.\r\n        execute_process(COMMAND \r\n            ${NUGET} restore packages.config -SolutionDirectory ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}\r\n            WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}\r\n        )\r\n    endif()\r\n\r\nThis assumes you have an existing `packages.config` file listing the nuget dependencies for your project. \r\n\r\nTo tie dependencies to a specific target, you (unfortunately) have to use the full path to where `nuget` placed the assembly/library. \r\n\r\nFor .NET nuget packages this would look like this:\r\n\r\n    # Provide the path to the Nuget-installed references.\r\n    set_property(TARGET MyTarget PROPERTY \r\n        VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_MyReferenceLib\r\n        ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/packages/path/to/nuget/lib/MyReferenceLib.dll\r\n    )\r\n\r\nFor C++-flavored nuget packages, it could look like this:\r\n\r\n    add_library(MyLibrary PUBLIC\r\n        MySource.cpp\r\n        MyClass1.cpp\r\n        ...\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # Provide the path to the Nuget-installed libraries.\r\n    target_link_libraries(MyLibrary PUBLIC \r\n        ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/packages/path/to/nuget/lib/MyCppLib.dll\r\n    )\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nAs an aside, CMake **does** support the *creation* of Nuget packages with CPack. Here is the [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/cpack_gen/nuget.html#cpack_gen:CPack%20NuGet%20Generator) for the CPack Nuget generator.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488575/including-nuget-packages-in-vs2019-c-cross-platform-program/58489194#58489194","title":"Including nuget packages in VS2019 C++ cross platform program"}],"owner":{"reputation":838,"user_id":840736,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96559c7e9216ec31a90cdb2c4d49cff5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/840736/jason"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2874,"user_id":3987854,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OV64v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"squareskittles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3987854/squareskittles"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58489194,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571672670,"creation_date":1571668464,"last_edit_date":1571670649,"question_id":58488575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488575","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been tasked with starting to lay out a C++ cross platform program with CMake.

Let&#39;s say it received 200 bytes.\r\n\r\nYou then do `strstr(buffer,eom_flag);`. `strstr` doesn&#39;t know that 200 bytes were received. `strstr` starts from the beginning of the buffer, and keeps looking until it finds either &lt;EOF&gt;, or a 0 byte. There is a chance that it might find a &lt;EOF&gt; in the other 824 bytes of the buffer, even though you didn&#39;t receive one.\r\n\r\nThen you do `output += buffer;`. This also treats the buffer as if it ends with a 0 byte. This will look through the whole buffer (not just the first 200 bytes) to find a 0 byte. It will then add everything up to that point into `output`. Again, it might find a 0 byte in the last 824 bytes of the buffer, and add too much data. It might not find a 0 byte in the buffer at all, and then it will keep on adding extra data from other variables that are stored next to `buffer` in memory. Or it might find a 0 byte in the first 200 bytes, and stop there (but only if you sent a 0 byte).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat you should do is pay attention to the number of bytes received (which is `iResult`) and add that many bytes to the output. You could use:\r\n\r\n    output.insert(output.end(), buffer, buffer+iResult);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso (as Phillipe Thomassigny has pointed out in a comment), the &quot;&lt;EOF&gt;&quot; might not be received all at once. You might receive &quot;&lt;EO&quot; and then receive &quot;F&gt;&quot; separately. You should check whether `output` has an &quot;&lt;EOF&gt;&quot; instead of checking whether `buffer` has an &quot;&lt;EOF&gt;&quot;. (The performance implications of this are left as an exercise to the reader)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy the way, this line doesn&#39;t do anything at the moment:\r\n\r\n    output.erase(std::find(output.begin(), output.end(), &#39;\\0&#39;), output.end());\r\n\r\nbecause &#39;\\0&#39; never gets added to `output`, because with `output += buffer;`, a &#39;\\0&#39; tells it where to stop adding.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488574/sending-large-base64-string-over-tcp-socket/58489673#58489673","title":"Sending Large Base64 String over TCP Socket"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12251951,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a863238240d33a04fdef39dd17650e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"GeekyCoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12251951/geekycoder"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1082,"user_id":7215293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LvQl5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yaser Darzi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7215293/yaser-darzi"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58489673,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571672318,"creation_date":1571668459,"last_edit_date":1571671777,"question_id":58488574,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488574","body_markdown":"I am trying to send a Base64 encoded image from TCP client using GO and TCP server in C++.\r\n\r\nHere is the code snippet for C++ Receiver\r\n\r\n    std::string recieve(int bufferSize=1024,const char *eom_flag = &quot;&lt;EOF&gt;&quot;){\r\n\tchar buffer[bufferSize];\r\n\tstd::string output;\r\n\tint iResult;\r\n\tchar *eom;\r\n\tdo{\r\n\t\tiResult = recv(client, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);\r\n\t\t//If End OF MESSAGE flag is found.\r\n\t\teom = strstr(buffer,eom_flag);\r\n\t\t//If socket is waiting , do dot append the json, keep on waiting.\r\n\t\tif(iResult == 0){\r\n\t\t\tcontinue;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\toutput+=buffer;\r\n        //Erase null character, if exist.\r\n\t\toutput.erase(std::find(output.begin(), output.end(), &#39;\\0&#39;), output.end());\r\n\t\t\t//is socket connection is broken or end of message is reached.\r\n\t}while(iResult &gt; -1 and eom == NULL);\r\n\t//Trim &lt;EOF&gt;\r\n\tstd::size_t eom_pos = output.rfind(eom_flag);\r\n\treturn output.substr(0,eom_pos);}\r\n\r\nIdea is to receive the message until End of Message is found, thereafter continue to listen for another message on the same TCP connection.\r\n\r\nGolang TCP client code snippet.\r\n\r\n    //Making connection\r\n    connection, _ := net.Dial(&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;+&quot;:&quot;+PortNumber)\r\n    if _, err := fmt.Fprintf(connection, B64img+&quot;&lt;EOF&gt;&quot;); err != nil {\r\n\t\t\t\tlog.Println(err)\r\n\t\t\t\tpanic(err)\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\nTried approaches:\r\n\r\n - Increasing the buffer size in the C++ receiver.\r\n - Removing the null character from the end of the string in the C++ receiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n - Length of string sent by the client is fixed, while the length of the string after receive function is larger and \r\n   random.

The Chrome console shows no error and the network is able to get all the .js and .css files.\r\n\r\nMy App.js file looks like this:\r\n\r\n    import React, { Component } from &quot;react&quot;;\r\n    import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import withTracker from &quot;./withTracker&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import DefaultLayout from &quot;../src/layouts/Default&quot;;\r\n    import LoginLayout from &quot;../src/layouts/Empty&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import Overview from &quot;../src/views/Overview&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import &quot;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;;\r\n    import &quot;./shards-dashboard/styles/shards-dashboards.1.1.0.min.css&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    export default class App extends Component {\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;\r\n            &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n              &lt;Route\r\n                path=&quot;/&quot;\r\n                exact\r\n                component={withTracker(props =&gt; {\r\n                  return (\r\n                    &lt;DefaultLayout {...props}&gt;\r\n                      &lt;Overview {...props} /&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/DefaultLayout&gt;\r\n                  );\r\n                })}\r\n              &gt;&lt;/Route&gt;\r\n            &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n          &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen I change my App.js Router from BrowserRouter to HashRouter, like this:\r\n\r\n    import React, { Component } from &quot;react&quot;;\r\n    import { HashRouter, Route, Switch } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import withTracker from &quot;./withTracker&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import DefaultLayout from &quot;../src/layouts/Default&quot;;\r\n    import LoginLayout from &quot;../src/layouts/Empty&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import Overview from &quot;../src/views/Overview&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    import &quot;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;;\r\n    import &quot;./shards-dashboard/styles/shards-dashboards.1.1.0.min.css&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    export default class App extends Component {\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;HashRouter&gt;\r\n            &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n              &lt;Route\r\n                path=&quot;/&quot;\r\n                exact\r\n                component={withTracker(props =&gt; {\r\n                  return (\r\n                    &lt;DefaultLayout {...props}&gt;\r\n                      &lt;Overview {...props} /&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/DefaultLayout&gt;\r\n                  );\r\n                })}\r\n              &gt;&lt;/Route&gt;\r\n            &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n          &lt;/HashRouter&gt;\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt works normally after building, so I think it&#39;s a problem with the BrowserRouter. I&#39;ve also tried to add the basename to BrowserRouter to this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Router basename={&quot;&quot;}&gt;\r\n\r\nand this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Router basename={&quot;/&quot;}&gt;\r\n\r\nBut none of them solves the problem.

Problem: I have an html page that contains both information that I want to scrape and an url that I want to follow to get images urls for images that I want to download and save via the scrapy image pipeline.\r\n\r\nMy approach to achieve this:\r\n1. Scrape all the details as usual with a parse method\r\n2. Find the url in the initial page, create a request that has a second parse method as callback where I build the image_urls list.\r\n\r\nSo, I have the following setup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsettings.py\r\n\r\n...\r\nITEM_PIPELINES = {\r\n   &#39;crawlbot.pipelines.MybotPipeline&#39;: 300,\r\n   &#39;scrapy.pipelines.images.ImagesPipeline&#39;: 1,\r\n}\r\n\r\nIMAGES_STORE = &#39;/url/to/images&#39; #valid path to actual folder\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npipelines.py\r\n\r\nimport pymongo\r\n\r\nclass MybotPipeline(object):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.conn = pymongo.MongoClient(&#39;localhost&#39;, 27017)\r\n        db = self.conn[&#39;libraries&#39;]\r\n        self.collection = db[&#39;books&#39;]\r\n\r\n    def process_item(self, item, spider):\r\n        self.collection.insert(dict(item))\r\n        return item\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nitems.py\r\n\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass MybotItem(scrapy.Item):\r\n    url = scrapy.Field()\r\n    title = scrapy.Field()\r\n    images = scrapy.Field()\r\n    image_urls = scrapy.Field()\r\n    description = scrapy.Field()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ncrawler.py\r\n\r\nimport scrapy\r\nfrom scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MySpider(CrawlSpider):\r\n    name = &#39;myspider&#39;\r\n    allowed_domains = [&#39;books.com&#39;]\r\n\r\n    def start_requests(self):\r\n        urls = [\r\n            &#39;https://www.books.com/some/url&#39;\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n        custom_settings = {\r\n            &#39;DEPTH_LIMIT&#39;: 1\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        for url in urls:\r\n            yield scrapy.Request(url=url, callback=self.parse_item)\r\n\r\n    def parse_details(self, response):\r\n        for image in enumerate(response.xpath(&#39;//div[contains(@class, &quot;jumbotron&quot;)]/div&#39;)):\r\n            image_urls = image.xpath(&#39;div[contains(@class, &quot;jumbotron-image&quot;)]/img/@src&#39;).getall()\r\n\r\n\r\n    def parse_item(self, response):\r\n        for idx, list_item in enumerate(response.xpath(&#39;//div[contains(@class, &quot;slider-wrapper&quot;)]&#39;)):\r\n            anchor = list_item.xpath(&#39;div[contains(@class, &quot;slider-section&quot;)]/div/a&#39;)\r\n            slider_thumbnail = anchor.xpath(&#39;div[contains(@class, &quot;slider-thumbnail&quot;)]&#39;)\r\n            description = slider_thumbnail.xpath(&#39;div[contains(@class, &quot;description-box&quot;)]&#39;)\r\n\r\n            yield {\r\n                &#39;url&#39;: anchor.xpath(&#39;@href&#39;).get(),\r\n                &#39;description&#39;: description\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            details_page_urls = anchor.xpath(&#39;@href&#39;).getall()\r\n            for details_page in details_page_urls:\r\n                yield scrapy.Request(url=details_page, callback=self.parse_details)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not working, although with my little knowledge of both Scrapy and Python, the second parse method should return a list of image_urls. So I have 2 questions: 1. is there a better approach for my case? Maybe the whole issue is in trying to do too much with one spider? 2. If the approach is ok, what am I doing wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488571/scrapy-scrape-both-text-and-images-in-the-same-spider","title":"Scrapy - Scrape both text and images in the same spider"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3301,"user_id":10366273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1c2BX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MyNameIsCaleb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10366273/mynameiscaleb"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571668597,"post_id":58488570,"comment_id":103307583,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488570/python-self-class-problems#comment103307583_58488570"},{"owner":{"reputation":3301,"user_id":10366273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1c2BX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MyNameIsCaleb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10366273/mynameiscaleb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571668769,"post_id":58488570,"comment_id":103307676,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488570/python-self-class-problems#comment103307676_58488570"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10289907,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fOHvJjdLcu4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/APUIFaOMK7VoE9tRteXh5SaYuuM5wJQ2hA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dziug Bix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10289907/dziug-bix"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571668453,"creation_date":1571668453,"question_id":58488570,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488570","body_markdown":"The problem I have here is that I cannot return the value which was in the self class.

As I don&#39;t have a server, I would like to have access to user&#39;s account only when he uses the application. My goal is to be able to get user&#39;s channels id&#39;s so I could load all of his uploaded videos.\r\n\r\nIn order to do that I created a new project in the google console api, linked it to Firebase and used this tutorial [link][1] to integrate it in my app. I got to the point where a user can choose a Gmail account and login, the app also prompt series of YouTube permissions that the user need to permit.\r\nAfter that I get accountUid of the user (the same one that is shown in the Firebase console). \r\n\r\nFrom this point I got confused because some of the tutorials were mentioning token access, refresh tokens, client id, client secret which I don&#39;t have and not sure if those credentials are necessary for my application.\r\n\r\nAfter the user sign in successfully I&#39;m using this API call to obtain his channels of his YouTube account:\r\n \r\n\r\n     @GET(&quot;channels&quot;)\r\n        fun getChannelsList(@Query(&quot;part&quot;) part :String = &quot;contentDetails,snippet&quot;,@Query(&quot;mine&quot;) mine : Boolean = true, @Header(&quot;Authorization&quot;) accessToken : String) : Single&lt;ChannelResponse&gt;\r\n     \r\nBut I&#39;m getting this error:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;error&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;errors&quot;: [\r\n      {\r\n         &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;global&quot;,\r\n         &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;authError&quot;,\r\n         &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Invalid Credentials&quot;,\r\n         &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;header&quot;,\r\n         &quot;location&quot;: &quot;Authorization&quot;\r\n      }\r\n      ],\r\n      &quot;code&quot;: 401,\r\n      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Invalid Credentials&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nfrom this [link][2] I also tried to put &quot;Bearer &quot;

Some data types have an output length that is variable, but that is not the case for i. You can see that if you click on it in your output, it should have a red outline 11 characters long.\r\n\r\nBut if you would rather have the spaces at the end of the number, then you can use `&#39;CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_OUTPUT&#39;`.

The redzone is a region of unaccessible data both to the left and to the right of an allocation. ASan keeps a bitmask of the entire memory and determines for each 8-byte region wat kind of memory it is.\r\n\r\n1. As the legend shows, 00 is fully addressable memory, 01 through 07 means &quot;partially addressable&quot;. A value with `05` in it presumably means the first 5 bytes of that 8-byte block may be addressed.\r\n\r\n1. `0x0c067fff801e` is the index into the bitmap. The part in brackets indicates which shadow byte is intended. Multiply it by 8 and you get `0x6033fffc00f0`, which must presumably be still modified a bit to get back at the offending memory region\r\n\r\n1. A wild pointer is one that points into unallocated (or recently freed) memory.\r\n\r\n1.

An example of implementation in Java can be found here: \r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/vananth22/888ed9a22105670e7a4092bdcf0d72e4\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula\r\n\r\nEDIT: Your distance calculation will not be particular accurate on a sphere/curved surface. If accuracy is a requirement I would recommend to implement the Haversine formula as written above.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems like your question is more related to mapping an area name to a set of coordinates? If that is the case, there are a few different solutions to this (a few listed below):\r\n\r\n\r\n1. You can create a struct (class) to hold the area tag (name), lat and lon coords and store an instance for each coord pair in a list.\r\n\r\n2. You can  store the coords pair in one list as you do now, and the tag (name) in a separate string list matching the indices in the coords list.\r\n\r\n3. You can store each coord pair in a hashmap with the tag name as key.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would recommend to sort the list of coords according to for example the distance from a fixed point. This way, it is possible to find the closest point to the given coord doing a simple binary search instead of having to iterate over each coord in the list (O(N) in worst case).\r\n\r\nEDIT2:\r\n\r\nHere is an example where I modified your original code. This is not an optimal solution, I recommend to follow some of the advices I have given above.\r\n\r\nThe modified code returns an index to the closest point instead of the coord pair itself. Then it uses that index to look up zone in another String array.

The short answer\r\n&quot;You can&#39;t.&quot; Or, more accurately, &quot;It&#39;s probably not worth the effort / risk.&quot;\r\n\r\n# The long answer\r\nFrom previous experience, using VB to write CGI (which I do NOT recommend), I would guess that putting the code from your question in an automation script might cause a browser session to get launched on the server, where your script was run. Things may have changed since those VB days, 20+ years ago, but I would still be tempted to check.\r\n\r\n@Milton was on the right track, I think, but with Maximo it would actually be a little more complicated. This is because when he said, &quot;You could have [the script] return a response&quot;, that response would be returned from the business logic layer on the server side to the UI layer on the server side which would then have to return it to the browser, which you would have had to &quot;big C&quot; customize Maximo to expect that response and know what to do with it.\r\n\r\n# The alternative\r\nYou could maybe return an error from your script, and have the message include a URL. Or use an Autoscript + Conditional UI + Launch in Context + Nonpersistent Attribute mix to expose a link for the user to click.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488528/jython-open-url-in-browser-without-importing-python-libraries/58497638#58497638","title":"Jython: Open URL in browser (without importing Python libraries)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12260373,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-v37TaNRBUmU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfUqYgYDySt8LZVywA2p24Gn4mT3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Scott Johnson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12260373/scott-johnson"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12260373,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-v37TaNRBUmU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfUqYgYDySt8LZVywA2p24Gn4mT3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Scott Johnson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12260373/scott-johnson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571795031,"last_edit_date":1571795031,"creation_date":1571793877,"answer_id":58514211,"question_id":58488528,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58514211","body_markdown":"As some have have indicated, automation scripts in Maximo are run on the server side. These scripts are setup based on certain types of launch points to activate when the script will run on the server side. In general the automation scripts can not really be used to manipulate the UI elements because these are controlled on the webclient layer. \r\n\r\nWhat launch point type was used with the example Jython code above? It might work if it were an action type launch point associated with a push button in the UI. But I am unsure the context for how and when you are wanting this action to occur. But more than likely it still would not work because the Java code is still being run from the server side and not the client. Typically, you would have to create a custom Java class file extention for the application to add to the webclient layer. Though most organizations try to stay away from these type of true customizations because of the issues it can cause with future updates and upgrades to the base Maximo product.\r\n\r\nMaximo has an out of the box functionality built in that allows a user to launch in context URLs. Here is an IBM link that has a pdf of an example of launching an address associated from a record in Maximo into Google Maps.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=a9ba1efe-b731-4317-9724-a181d6155e3a#fullpageWidgetId=W5f281fe58c09_49c7_9fa4_e094f86b7e98&amp;file=a6af8bfb-8b72-4b57-945c-786ab4d71b14\r\n\r\nAlso I am not sure exactly what the purpose is for the requirement. But I have also seen were if you were just trying to retrieve information from an external source you can actually display the information directly in the Maximo application if the external web application can be access through a webservice type interaction.

If it does not, I create it. Problem is, the parent object that holds this array basically owns these, so a `OneToMany` relationship exists.\r\n\r\nSo I need to iterate over that array of events and called `setParentId()` to that of the newly created parent object.

Columns are added to the df based on previous columns.  However I am noting that the memory used keeps increasing.

However calling the execution of the df with `collect(), count(), show()` or conversion to rdd or even deletion of the df fails to release memory.  I have been seeing 1.2GB of memory for the above task.  It seems like garbage collection has no way of cleaning up the previous intermediate `df` objects, or perhaps that these objects are never de-referenced.\r\n\r\nis there a better method of building out this type of iterative calculation, or is there any way to cleanup these intermediate df&#39;s?

If there are 0 matches with the same title the case is created, if there are more than one match, I query that title by createdon ascending to get me the very first &quot;incident&quot; created ID. My tracers show that all the data is correct that I&#39;m getting. My problem is at the merge with the following code below:\r\n\r\n                                    //merge tickets here\r\n                                EntityReference masterTicket = new EntityReference();\r\n                                masterTicket.Id = (Guid)masterTicketId;\r\n                                masterTicket.LogicalName = &quot;incident&quot;;\r\n\r\n                                MergeRequest merge = new MergeRequest();\r\n                                merge.SubordinateId = targetIncidentId;\r\n                                merge.Target = masterTicket;\r\n                                merge.PerformParentingChecks = false;\r\n                                tracer.Trace($&quot;Merging {targetIncidentId} into {masterTicket.Id}.&quot;);\r\n                                var merged = (MergeResponse)service.Execute(merge);\r\n                                tracer.Trace($&quot;Merged Response: {merged}&quot;);\r\n\r\nI have used the following examples here: [merge link][1]\r\n\r\nThe issue I think might be that all code that I have seen they are updating records as well.  I don&#39;t want to update any of the records, I just want to merge the records with the matching title.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been fighting with this for awhile now and any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** The plugin trace log is show it&#39;s failing at:\r\n\r\n    var merged = (MergeResponse)service.Execute(merge);\r\n\r\nBecause the tracer after that line is not showing in the trace logs.\r\n\r\n&gt; **EDIT:**  The following is the error log file:\r\n&gt; &gt; \r\n&gt; &gt;     Unhandled exception:  Exception type: System.ServiceModel.FaultException`1[Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationServiceFault]\r\n&gt; &gt; Message: An error occurred in the following plugin:Detail: \r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OrganizationServiceFault\r\n&gt; &gt; xmlns:i=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n&gt; &gt; xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/xrm/2011/Contracts&quot;&gt;  \r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ActivityId&gt;80609179-2920-4a9e-91b9-65b10a3a3a4c&lt;/ActivityId&gt;  \r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ErrorCode&gt;-2147220891&lt;/ErrorCode&gt;   &lt;ErrorDetails\r\n&gt; &gt; xmlns:d2p1=&quot;http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/System.Collections.Generic&quot;&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;KeyValuePairOfstringanyType&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;d2p1:key&gt;OperationStatus&lt;/d2p1:key&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;d2p1:value xmlns:d4p1=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; i:type=&quot;d4p1:string&quot;&gt;0&lt;/d2p1:value&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;/KeyValuePairOfstringanyType&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;KeyValuePairOfstringanyType&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;d2p1:key&gt;SubErrorCode&lt;/d2p1:key&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;d2p1:value xmlns:d4p1=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; i:type=&quot;d4p1:string&quot;&gt;-2146233088&lt;/d2p1:value&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;/KeyValuePairOfstringanyType&gt;   &lt;/ErrorDetails&gt;   &lt;HelpLink&gt;http%3a%2f%2fgo.microsoft.com%2ffwlink%2f%3fLinkID%3d398563%26lcid%3d1033%26error%3dMicrosoft.Crm.CrmException%26client%3dplatform%26sv%3d9.0.42.1001%26de%3dLive%26opsys%3dMicrosoft+Windows+NT+10.0.14393.0%26errorCode%3d-2147220891&lt;/HelpLink&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Message&gt;An error occurred in the following plugin:&lt;/Message&gt;  \r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Timestamp&gt;2019-10-21T14:20:08.3608048Z&lt;/Timestamp&gt;  \r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ExceptionRetriable&gt;false&lt;/ExceptionRetriable&gt;   &lt;ExceptionSource\r\n&gt; &gt; i:nil=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;   &lt;InnerFault i:nil=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;   &lt;OriginalException\r\n&gt; &gt; i:nil=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;   &lt;TraceText&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; \r\n&gt; &gt; [ORG_Dynamics365: ORG_Dynamics365.TicketStacking]\r\n&gt; &gt; [e5b0700e-e3f0-e911-a812-000d3a33f7ca: ORG_Dynamics365.TicketStacking:\r\n&gt; &gt; Create of incident] Entered\r\n&gt; &gt; Microsoft.Dynamics.Service.Plugins.PreOperationIncidentCreate.Execute(),\r\n&gt; &gt; Correlation Id: 970488ac-6888-4eb6-9294-cdf1098e5371, Initiating User:\r\n&gt; &gt; bc80c76a-38d3-e911-a9b8-000d3a367d35 Exiting\r\n&gt; &gt; Microsoft.Dynamics.Service.Plugins.PreOperationIncidentCreate.Execute(),\r\n&gt; &gt; Correlation Id: 970488ac-6888-4eb6-9294-cdf1098e5371, Initiating User:\r\n&gt; &gt; bc80c76a-38d3-e911-a9b8-000d3a367d35 Entered\r\n&gt; &gt; Microsoft.Dynamics.Service.Plugins.PreOperationIncidentCreateEntitlement.Execute(),\r\n&gt; &gt; Correlation Id: 970488ac-6888-4eb6-9294-cdf1098e5371, Initiating User:\r\n&gt; &gt; bc80c76a-38d3-e911-a9b8-000d3a367d35 Exiting\r\n&gt; &gt; Microsoft.Dynamics.Service.Plugins.PreOperationIncidentCreateEntitlement.Execute(),\r\n&gt; &gt; Correlation Id: 970488ac-6888-4eb6-9294-cdf1098e5371, Initiating User:\r\n&gt; &gt; bc80c76a-38d3-e911-a9b8-000d3a367d35 Entered\r\n&gt; &gt; Microsoft.Dynamics.Service.Plugins.PostOperationIncidentCreateEntitlement.Execute(),\r\n&gt; &gt; Correlation Id: 970488ac-6888-4eb6-9294-cdf1098e5371, Initiating User:\r\n&gt; &gt; bc80c76a-38d3-e911-a9b8-000d3a367d35 Exiting\r\n&gt; &gt; Microsoft.Dynamics.Service.Plugins.PostOperationIncidentCreateEntitlement.Execute(),\r\n&gt; &gt; Correlation Id: 970488ac-6888-4eb6-9294-cdf1098e5371, Initiating User:\r\n&gt; &gt; bc80c76a-38d3-e911-a9b8-000d3a367d35\r\n&gt; &gt; \r\n&gt; &gt; target incident id: 8491c0df-0df4-e911-a813-000d3a33f11e target title:\r\n&gt; &gt; 20191021 10:12a target raised on: 10/21/2019 2:20:08 PM traget local\r\n&gt; &gt; time now:  10/21/2019 2:20:08 PM Before retrieveMultiple After\r\n&gt; &gt; retrieveMultiple In foreach loop oldest incidentid:\r\n&gt; &gt; 74e2f090-0df4-e911-a813-000d3a33f11e Title: 20191021 10:12a Master\r\n&gt; &gt; Ticket Guid: 74e2f090-0df4-e911-a813-000d3a33f11e oldest Raised On:\r\n&gt; &gt; 10/21/2019 2:17:58 PM Total Record Count: 2 1 record(s) matching.\r\n&gt; &gt; Timespan is 0.00150799356481481 days greather than original ticket\r\n&gt; &gt; (less than 30 days).

READ THE QUESTION FIRST BEFORE MARKING IT AS DUPLICATE!** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis question is asked by many but almost all gave the same solution which I am already applying. &lt;br&gt;\r\nSo I have classes `TestCase`,`B`,`C`, `D` &amp; `E`. &lt;br&gt;\r\nClasses `C` &amp; `D` inherit class `B` &amp; class `E` inherits both `C` &amp; `D`. Class `B` inherits `TestCase`. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen I run my code, class `E` is only running with methods for class `C` and ignoring `D` all along.&lt;br&gt;\r\nNow my classes go like these \r\n\r\n    class GenericAuthClass(TestCase):\r\n    \r\n        def setUp(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;Create a dummy user for the purpose of testing.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            # set some objects and variabels\r\n    \r\n        def _get_authenticated_api_client(self):\r\n            pass\r\n    \r\n    class TokenAuthTests(GenericAuthClass):\r\n    \r\n        def _get_authenticated_api_client(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;Get token recieved on login.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            super()._get_authenticated_api_client()\r\n            # make object\r\n            return object\r\n    \r\n    class BasicAuthTests(GenericAuthClass):\r\n    \r\n        def _get_authenticated_api_client(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;Get token recieved on login.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            super()._get_authenticated_api_client()\r\n            # make object\r\n            return object\r\n    \r\n    class ClientTestCase(BasicAuthTests, TokenAuthTests):\r\n        def dothis(self):\r\n            return self._get_authenticated_api_client()\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45100905/10190191\r\n\r\n1. How can I call method (with same name) in `C` and `D` from `E` like the diamond problem in `C++`? As of now, when I call the certain method using `self.method()` from `E` it only calls that method from `C` and ignores the same method from `D` while I think it should call both methods. Note that the method doesn&#39;t exist in class `E` and my code is working right now without errors but only calling method from `C`.\r\n\r\n&gt; This seems like a `Python` question mainly but tagging `django` too as `TestCase` class might have something to do with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488465/diamond-problem-in-python-call-method-from-all-parent-classes","title":"Diamond problem in Python: Call method from all parent classes"},{"tags":["random","scikit-learn","random-forest","confusion-matrix"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9788445,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/242decae5af32e8837f02b8567c0e7db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"adbadb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9788445/adbadb"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571668108,"creation_date":1571668108,"question_id":58488463,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488463","body_markdown":"I have split my dataset into 70/25/5 train/validation/test.\r\n\r\nI run hyper-parameters cross-validation on a few models on my training set (RForest, XGBoost, SVC, Logistic, all using auroc metric).\r\nOnce all cross-validated and re-fitted, I would like to select “best” model based on the auroc on my validation set.

With it, your example code could look like the following:\r\n\r\n    Semaphore s = new Semaphore(0, true); // No permits to start with, acquire will block\r\n    \r\n    // Producer loop\r\n    makeNewDataAvailable();\r\n    s.release();  // Raise &quot;flag&quot; to indicate new info\r\n    possiblyDoSomethingUseful();\r\n    s.acquire();  // A fair semaphore, so waiting threads get the permit\r\n    \r\n    // Consumer loop\r\n    s.acquire();  // Blocks until &quot;flag&quot; raised, then acquires it\r\n    processNewData();\r\n    s.release();  // Pass the permit back to thread 1\r\n    \r\nBut `Semaphore` does require you to plan your logic correctly, otherwise you could end up in a deadlock.\r\n\r\nA producer/consumer situation is solved better with other mechanisms though, as you see the code can look confusing and you need to keep track of who&#39;s calling `acquire/release` and when. The above code could be better implemented with for example [Exchanger](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Exchanger.html):\r\n\r\n    Exchanger&lt;String&gt; e = new Exchanger&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    // Producer loop\r\n    e.exhange(generateNewData());  // Ignore consumer&#39;s response\r\n    \r\n    // Consumer loop\r\n    processData(e.exchange(null)); // Get data, send dummy back\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488440/concurrent-blocking-flag-in-java/58488671#58488671","title":"Concurrent Blocking Flag in Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":11657720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ca3b8f1acbd5d23b7dbffb2264561d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Josh B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11657720/josh-b"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58488671,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571669669,"creation_date":1571668032,"question_id":58488440,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488440","body_markdown":"I sometimes write code like:\r\n\r\nMethod 1:\r\n```java\r\nsynchronized (someMonitor) {\r\n    newInfo = true;\r\n    someMonitor.notifyAll();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMethod 2:\r\n```java\r\nsynchronized (someMonitor) {\r\n    while (!newInfo) {\r\n        someMonitor.wait();\r\n    }\r\n    newInfo = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI imagine there&#39;s a higher-level concurrency object in the API to handle this.
