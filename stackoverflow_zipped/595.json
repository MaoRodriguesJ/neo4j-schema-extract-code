I will first define the problem and later post the code.\r\n\r\nI create dynamic html elements using javascript and during creation process I add &quot;click&quot; event listeners on each newly created object. And inside this event event listener I change a different property of a GLOBAL object. I mean, when you click a dynamically created element, each element modifies a different property of this global object.\r\n\r\nProblem occurs here, I dynamically select the different property of the global object. So for each element it modifies a different property of th global object. BUT when I run the code, I see that each element only changes the latest property of the global object. Meaning that each element changes the same property of that object and it is the latest property of the object. Here the code:\r\n\r\n    var filter = {1:false, 4:false, 7:false, 11:false, 8:false} //global object\r\n    var productsAndIndexes = {a:1, b:4, c:7, d:11, e:8 } //another global object used for looping \r\n    function createEmptyFilter(){\r\n      var hdr = document.querySelector(&quot;div.content .headers&quot;);\r\n      for(var product in productsAndIndexes){\r\n        var inp = document.createElement(&quot;input&quot;);\r\n        inp.setAttribute(&quot;type&quot;, &quot;checkbox&quot;);\r\n        var filterInd = productsAndIndexes[product];\r\n        \r\n        inp.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot; , (e) =&gt; {\r\n          if(e.target.checked){\r\n            filters[ filterInd ] = true;\r\n          }else{\r\n            filters[ filterInd ] = false;\r\n          }\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n        hdr.appendChild(inp);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    createEmptyFilter();\r\n\r\nEvery time I check a checkbox, I got filter = {1:false, 4:false, 7:false, 11:false, 8:true}. But instead each checkbox should modify its related part in the object.\r\n\r\nAny explanation and solution about the problem is appreciated (although I am not 15 rep :) )\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399423/object-modify-problem-on-dynamically-created-element-eventlistener","title":"Object Modify Problem on Dynamically Created Element EventListener"},{"tags":["javascript","python"],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12027240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2Cxs3sCn8dE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdFXufvG8QR_3wEtfhisjOv9HNwbg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Oni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12027240/oni"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571158504,"creation_date":1571158504,"question_id":58399419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399419","body_markdown":"How do I convert the following Crytojs javascript code to Python Pycryptodome?\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction encrypt() {\r\n\tvar l;\r\n\tvar n = &quot;190.207.78.120&quot;;\r\n\tl = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(btoa(&quot;AD7552C821266C8255348F726CAB9589&quot;));\r\n\ty = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(n,l,{mode:CryptoJS.mode.ECB,padding:CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7}).toString();\r\n\treturn y;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399419/equivalent-cryptojs-code-to-pycryptodome","title":"Equivalent Cryptojs code to Pycryptodome?"},{"tags":["amazon-s3","encryption","amazon-sagemaker"],"owner":{"reputation":559,"user_id":716440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aba9fb3eefba1552a843ccc0a3944596?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Moeller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/716440/john-moeller"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571158499,"creation_date":1571158499,"question_id":58399417,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399417","body_markdown":"The [documentation for TransformOutput](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_TransformOutput.html) states that if `KmsKeyId` isn&#39;t specified, that the default encryption for the configured role is used for encrypting data output.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when I exclude that configuration item, it ends up encrypted.

I don&#39;t have an explanation for the higher variance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR is an interpreted language, not JIT compiled to machine code like Java, or ahead-of-time like C.  (**I don&#39;t know much about R internals, just CPUs and performance, so I&#39;m making a *lot* of assumptions here**.)\r\n\r\nThe code that&#39;s running on the actual CPU hardware is *the R interpreter*, not exactly your R program.\r\n\r\nControl dependencies in the R program (like an `if()`) become *data* dependencies in the interpreter.  The current thing being executed is just data for the interpreter running on a real CPU.\r\n\r\nDifferent operations in the R program become control dependencies in the interpreter.  For example, evaluating `myvec[i]` then the `+` operator would probably be done by two different functions in the interpreter.  And a separate function for `&gt;` and for `if()` statements.\r\n\r\n**The classic interpreter loop is based around an *indirect* branch that dispatches from a table of function pointers.**  Instead of a taken/not-taken choice, the CPU needs a prediction for one of many recently-used target addresses.  I don&#39;t know if R uses a single indirect branch like that or if tries to be fancier like having the end of each interpreter block dispatch to the next one, instead of returning to a main dispatch loop.\r\n\r\nModern Intel CPUs (like Haswell and later) have IT-TAGE (Indirect TAgged GEometric history length) prediction.  The taken/not-taken state of previous branches along the path of execution are used as an index into a table of predictions.  This mostly solves the interpreter branch-prediction problem, allowing it to do a surprisingly good job, especially when the interpreted code (the R code in your case) does the same thing repeatedly.\r\n\r\n* **[Branch Prediction and the Performance of Interpreters - Don’t Trust Folklore (2015)](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01100647/document)** - Haswell&#39;s ITTAGE is a huge improvement for interpreters, invalidating the previous wisdom that a single indirect branch for interpreter dispatch was a disaster.  I don&#39;t know what R actually uses; there are tricks that were useful.\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46321531/x86-prefetching-optimizations-computed-goto-threaded-code has more links.\r\n* https://comparch.net/2013/06/30/why-tage-is-the-best/\r\n* https://danluu.com/branch-prediction/ has some links about that at the bottom.  Also mentions that AMD has used Perceptron predictors in Bulldozer-family and Zen: like a neural net.\r\n\r\n**The `if()` being taken *does* result in needing to do different operations, so it *does* actually still make some branching in the R interpreter more or less predictable depending on data.**  But of course as an interpreter, it&#39;s doing *much* more work at each step than a simple machine-code loop over an array.\r\n\r\n**So extra branch mispredicts are a much smaller fraction of the total time** because of interpreter overhead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Of course, both your tests are with the same interpreter on the same hardware.**  I don&#39;t know what kind of CPU you have.\r\n\r\nIf it&#39;s Intel older than Haswell or AMD older than Zen, you might be getting a lot of mispredicts even with the sorted array, unless the pattern is simple enough for an indirect branch history predictor to lock onto.  That would bury the difference in more noise.\r\n\r\nSince you do see a pretty clear difference, I&#39;m guessing that the CPU doesn&#39;t mispredict too much in the sorted case, so there is room for it to get worse in the unsorted case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399395/how-exactly-r-is-affected-by-branch-prediction/58400070#58400070","title":"How exactly R is affected by Branch Prediction?"}],"owner":{"reputation":12851,"user_id":6461462,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BlsdV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"M--","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6461462/m"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12851,"user_id":6461462,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BlsdV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"M--","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6461462/m"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58400070,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571322314,"creation_date":1571158401,"last_edit_date":1571167678,"question_id":58399395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399395","body_markdown":"***Some references:***\r\n\r\n&lt;sub&gt;This is a follow-up on this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array&lt;/sub&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;sub&gt;The only post in [tag:r] tag that I found somewhat related to branch prediction was this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42617883/why-sampling-matrix-row-is-very-slow&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\r\n***Explanation of the problem:***\r\n\r\nI was investigating whether processing a sorted array is faster than processing an unsorted one (same as the problem tested in `Java` and `C` -- first link) to see if branch prediction is affecting `R` in the same manner. \r\n\r\nLook at the benchmark examples below:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\nset.seed(128)\r\n#or making a vector with 1e7\r\nmyvec &lt;- rnorm(1e8, 128, 128)  \r\n\r\nmyvecsorted &lt;- sort(myvec)\r\n\r\nmysumU = 0\r\nmysumS = 0\r\n\r\nSvU &lt;- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(\r\n  Unsorted = for (i in 1:length(myvec)) {\r\n    \r\n    if (myvec[i] &gt; 128) {\r\n      mysumU = mysumU + myvec[i]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n  } ,\r\n  Sorted = for (i in 1:length(myvecsorted)) {\r\n    \r\n    if (myvecsorted[i] &gt; 128) {\r\n      mysumS = mysumS + myvecsorted[i]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n  } ,\r\n  times = 10)\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot2::autoplot(SvU)\r\n```\r\n[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JaRr.png&quot; width=&quot;335&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; title=&quot;1e7 elements&quot;&gt;][1]\r\n[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6tNRw.png&quot; width=&quot;335&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; title=&quot;1e8 elements&quot;&gt;][2]\r\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \r\n*Vector with 1e7 elements*   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n*Vector with 1e8 elements*\r\n\r\n###*Question:*\r\n\r\n- First, I want to know that why *&quot;Sorted&quot;* vector is not the fastest all the time and not by the same magnitude as expressed in `Java`?\r\n- Second, why the sorted execution time has a higher variation compared to one of the unsorted?\r\n\r\n***N.B.*** My CPU is an *i7-6820HQ @ 2.70GHz Skylake, quad-core with hyperthreading*.\r\n\r\n\r\n###*Update:* \r\nTo investigate the *variation* part, I did the `microbenchmark` with the vector of 100 million elements (`n=1e8`) and repeated the benchmark 100 times (`times=100`).

&quot;parameter&quot; &quot;result&quot;\r\n\r\ncolnames(df2)\r\n&quot;site_number&quot; &quot;day&quot; &quot;parameter&quot; &quot;result&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399329/how-to-rename-multiple-columns-with-different-column-names-and-different-order-i","title":"How to rename multiple columns with different column names and different order in several dataframes based on a dictionary in R"},{"tags":["c"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1254,"user_id":1098603,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sb0id.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthieu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1098603/matthieu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158312,"post_id":58399328,"comment_id":103144124,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399328/installing-other-programs-without-visible-installers#comment103144124_58399328"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158313,"post_id":58399328,"comment_id":103144125,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399328/installing-other-programs-without-visible-installers#comment103144125_58399328"},{"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":11150587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f1bbf3c20570fc02af0926606833ed1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lynx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11150587/lynx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158406,"post_id":58399328,"comment_id":103144151,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399328/installing-other-programs-without-visible-installers#comment103144151_58399328"},{"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":11150587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f1bbf3c20570fc02af0926606833ed1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lynx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11150587/lynx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158510,"post_id":58399328,"comment_id":103144202,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399328/installing-other-programs-without-visible-installers#comment103144202_58399328"},{"owner":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158600,"post_id":58399328,"comment_id":103144246,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399328/installing-other-programs-without-visible-installers#comment103144246_58399328"},{"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":11150587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f1bbf3c20570fc02af0926606833ed1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lynx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11150587/lynx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158668,"post_id":58399328,"comment_id":103144275,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399328/installing-other-programs-without-visible-installers#comment103144275_58399328"}],"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":11150587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f1bbf3c20570fc02af0926606833ed1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lynx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11150587/lynx"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571158609,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571158127,"creation_date":1571158127,"question_id":58399328,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399328","body_markdown":"How can I install other programs on Windows like the Visual studio installer does.

So when you clicked after a few seconds, hundreds of callbacks were called one after the other. No fun :-)\r\n\r\nYour solution was the right thing to do - register the click even one time, and execute the box creation when you click.\r\n\r\nTo save a bit of work, and do it &quot;the babylon way&quot;, you could instead do this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nscene.onPointerDown = function (evt, pickResult) {\r\n        // if the click hits\r\n        if (pickResult.hit) {\r\n            // do your thing here\r\n            createBlock(pickResult.pickedPoint);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nfunction createBlock(pickedPosition) {\r\n        var box = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox(&quot;box&quot;, { height: 3, width: 3, depth: 3 }, scene);\r\n        box.position.copyFrom(pickedPosition);\r\n        box.checkCollisions = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way babylon takes care of handling the event registration for you, so pick and touch events are also registered (and not only clicks). It also takes care of removing the event listeners when the scene is disposed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399323/how-can-i-optimize-the-creation-of-meshes/58502175#58502175","title":"How can i optimize the creation of meshes?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9953976,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yXQRGhc67yg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABqg/g46UgpwtyiM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jes&#250;s S&#225;inz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9953976/jes%c3%bas-s%c3%a1inz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9953976,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yXQRGhc67yg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABqg/g46UgpwtyiM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jes&#250;s S&#225;inz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9953976/jes%c3%bas-s%c3%a1inz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571739914,"creation_date":1571158107,"last_edit_date":1571158701,"question_id":58399323,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399323","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve added a functionality that let&#39;s you create meshes when you click on the ground.

I fix this using three Strawberry Perl one-liners in a Powershell script.\r\n\r\nThe Windows &#39;\\r\\n&#39; convention is recognized by Strawberry Perl and that is its output format.  I could not get Perl to recognize the empty lines with a single 0x0a linefeed, though, as the Strawberry flavor of Perl would always interpret that as a new line and include it in the output.\r\n\r\nMy solution was to simply replace all the linefeed 0x0a characters with a string unlikely to appear in the content:\r\n\r\n    &lt;*  script is Powershell, initialize source file name*&gt;\r\n    $myLoginCSV = &#39;User%5FProfile%5FReport.csv&#39; \r\n\r\n    &lt;*  convert linefeed (0a) chars into string LINEFEEDCHAR *&gt;\r\n    $perlarg=&#39;-i.p.bak -p -e &quot;s/\\x0A/LINEFEEDCHAR/g&quot;&#39;\r\n    perl $perlarg $myLoginCSV\r\n\r\n    &lt;*  de-duplicate linefeeds*&gt;   \r\n    $perlarg=&#39;-i.p.bak -p -e &quot;s/(LINEFEEDCHAR){2,}/LINEFEEDCHAR/g&quot;&#39;\r\n    perl $perlarg $myLoginCSV\r\n\r\n    &lt;*  restore the 0a linefeed characters by substituting for LINEFEEDCHAR *&gt; \r\n    $perlarg=&#39;-i.p.bak -p -e &quot;s/LINEFEEDCHAR/\\x0a/g&quot;&#39;\r\n    perl $perlarg $myLoginCSV\r\n\r\nI tried to do this in one line, but could not figure out how. Strawberry Perl interprets linefeeds with a fixed behavior to make it compatible with Windows.  This &quot;three liner&quot; works well and is fast.  An attempt at this using Powershell native regex was over 10 times slower.  \r\n\r\n**Specifically in the Strawberry Perl Windows environment, is there a way to do this in fewer than three lines?**\r\n\r\nThis is not a high priority.  One lesson I took away from this is that a regex solution using Strawberry Perl in Windows can have a multi line solution but still be fast.  In the future, I won&#39;t be as wedded to a true &quot;one-line&quot; solution when a couple of extra lines get the job done.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399319/regex-strawberry-perl-windows-one-liner-to-fix-multiple-linefeed-0a-characte","title":"regex strawberry perl (windows) one-liner to fix multiple linefeed (0a) characters"},{"tags":["github","markdown"],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":10199373,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/828c2aceb6024195910bb2b2f34d6b2d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H.

have a component which does some SQLite loads in it&#39;s `componentDidMount()` function\r\n\r\n    async componentDidMount() {\r\n        try {\r\n            const user = await this.userDao.getUserData();\r\n            const setupNeeded = user === null;\r\n            if( setupNeeded ) {\r\n                this.setState({\r\n                    status : &#39;setup&#39;\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                this.setState({\r\n                    status : &#39;ready&#39;,\r\n                    seed: user.seed\r\n                })\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (e) {\r\n            logger.error(&quot;Error during db query&quot;, e);\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                status: &#39;corrupted&#39;\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to test the rendered result after the call to `getUserData()` has been resolved, and the state has been set accordingly.\r\nNow in my test, I have the actual call to the database mocked away, so the Promise should be resolved immediately, yet testing like this does not work as expected:\r\n\r\nInitially, I tried it like this:\r\n\r\n    test(&#39;Should render SetNewPasswordScreen&#39;, async () =&gt; {\r\n        const tree = await renderer.create(&lt;IndexScreen/&gt;);\r\n        const json = tree.toJSON();\r\n        // expect stuff\r\n    });\r\nHowever the json in this case contains the data of the initial `render()` call.`\r\n\r\nDoing it like this will work:\r\n\r\n     test(&#39;Should render SetNewPasswordScreen&#39;, (done) =&gt; {\r\n         const tree = renderer.create(&lt;IndexScreen/&gt;);\r\n         setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n             const json = tree.toJSON();\r\n             // expect stuff\r\n         }, 5000);\r\n     });\r\n\r\nBut this is not ideal, because I am just guessing that after 5 seconds everything will be done, but I don&#39;t know. Also, it&#39;s less then suitable if a test takes 5 seconds to finish. (I used 5 seconds arbitrarily, probably it will also work with much less since the async call is mocked anyway, but I can never really know)\r\n\r\nMy question is if anybody has a better idea of how to solve this issue?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399299/testing-async-componentdidmount-with-react-test-renderer","title":"Testing async componentDidMount() with react-test-renderer"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8030,"user_id":4032703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EJoshuaS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4032703/ejoshuas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158043,"post_id":58399298,"comment_id":103144013,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399298/can-anyone-solve-this-search-engine-query-problem-any-approach-or-algorithm-wou#comment103144013_58399298"},{"owner":{"reputation":195293,"user_id":14122,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e2861b08f37fa306fbf5384994af688?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Charles Duffy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14122/charles-duffy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158183,"post_id":58399298,"comment_id":103144073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399298/can-anyone-solve-this-search-engine-query-problem-any-approach-or-algorithm-wou#comment103144073_58399298"},{"owner":{"reputation":8030,"user_id":4032703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EJoshuaS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4032703/ejoshuas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571158303,"post_id":58399298,"comment_id":103144121,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399298/can-anyone-solve-this-search-engine-query-problem-any-approach-or-algorithm-wou#comment103144121_58399298"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11872671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed86591c807e39f2d97f44f0a8af8405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Krish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11872671/krish"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158381,"post_id":58399298,"comment_id":103144144,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399298/can-anyone-solve-this-search-engine-query-problem-any-approach-or-algorithm-wou#comment103144144_58399298"},{"owner":{"reputation":7424,"user_id":669576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mRhrB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Johnny Mopp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/669576/johnny-mopp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571163220,"post_id":58399298,"comment_id":103146163,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399298/can-anyone-solve-this-search-engine-query-problem-any-approach-or-algorithm-wou#comment103146163_58399298"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11872671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed86591c807e39f2d97f44f0a8af8405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Krish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11872671/krish"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571330459,"post_id":58399298,"comment_id":103214476,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399298/can-anyone-solve-this-search-engine-query-problem-any-approach-or-algorithm-wou#comment103214476_58399298"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11872671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed86591c807e39f2d97f44f0a8af8405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Krish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11872671/krish"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11872671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed86591c807e39f2d97f44f0a8af8405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Krish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11872671/krish"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":7,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571158133,"answer_count":0,"score":-7,"last_activity_date":1571158227,"creation_date":1571157995,"last_edit_date":1571158227,"question_id":58399298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399298","body_markdown":"You are given a list of search engine queries.\r\n\r\nThe queries are in the form of strings and do not contain any whitespace.\r\n\r\nWhen you encounter the string &quot;top &lt;n&gt;&quot;&quot;, then output the top n search terms according to the popularity.

The first collection should store every event as a new\r\n    document. But the documents should expire after ```x seconds```.\r\n 2. The second collection should only store the latest entry for a given\r\n    ```eventId```.\r\n\r\nUsing annotations I can achieve 1. and 2. separately in the following way:\r\n\r\nCriteria 1.\r\n\r\n    @Document\r\n    public class event {\r\n      String eventId;\r\n      @Indexed(expireAfterSeconds = x)\r\n      String date;\r\n      String state;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nCriteria 2.\r\n\r\n    @Document\r\n    public class event {\r\n      @Id\r\n      String eventId;\r\n      String date;\r\n      String state;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find a good way of achieving both criteria at the same time. \r\n\r\nI know I could for example create 2 more classes that have the same fields as the event class but with different annotations and have a constructor that takes an event as an argument. But this really does not feel like a good solution with all the duplicate code. \r\n\r\nIs there a more elegant solution for this problem?

It would be a better practice to have it in a separate class. Check out MVP or VIPER design patterns for more info.\r\n\r\nAs for *when* to load your data (after view loaded or before) is more of a UX decision.\r\nIf you start loading after, of course, screen might be empty for a while, it would be good to have some loading indicator on the screen so that users do not get confused. Whether users will see empty screens often or not depends on whether you store your loaded data permanently (in a local DB), have some run time cache, or non of that. If you have some caching, empty screen will be visible just once, because if data is loaded and cached you will show that and update the screen after new data is received.\r\n\r\nYou can also start loading data before view is loaded (in loadView()) or may load some minimal data for the views which are not visible (so that they are not completely empty when opened) and then load full data after view is loaded.\r\n\r\nAny approach you choose is highly dependent on what kind of user experience do you want to provide, also on how long it takes to load your data.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399285/is-loading-data-in-viewdidload-too-late-to-display-it-in-a-uiviewcontroller/58402168#58402168","title":"Is loading data in viewDidLoad too late to display it in a UIViewController?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22471,"user_id":257022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6260b6943182933dffdca8d3a4697b6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aneuryzm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/257022/aneuryzm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571214949,"post_id":58404712,"comment_id":103161909,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399285/is-loading-data-in-viewdidload-too-late-to-display-it-in-a-uiviewcontroller/58404712#comment103161909_58404712"},{"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":12137030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qnV2qHy-_F8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcaE1Vvbru56CGDai9O5qW3Ntv5Ug/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12137030/reed"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22471,"user_id":257022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6260b6943182933dffdca8d3a4697b6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aneuryzm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/257022/aneuryzm"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571233451,"post_id":58404712,"comment_id":103172407,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399285/is-loading-data-in-viewdidload-too-late-to-display-it-in-a-uiviewcontroller/58404712#comment103172407_58404712"},{"owner":{"reputation":22471,"user_id":257022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6260b6943182933dffdca8d3a4697b6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aneuryzm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/257022/aneuryzm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571244351,"post_id":58404712,"comment_id":103178791,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399285/is-loading-data-in-viewdidload-too-late-to-display-it-in-a-uiviewcontroller/58404712#comment103178791_58404712"},{"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":12137030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qnV2qHy-_F8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcaE1Vvbru56CGDai9O5qW3Ntv5Ug/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12137030/reed"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22471,"user_id":257022,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6260b6943182933dffdca8d3a4697b6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aneuryzm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/257022/aneuryzm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247354,"post_id":58404712,"comment_id":103180133,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399285/is-loading-data-in-viewdidload-too-late-to-display-it-in-a-uiviewcontroller/58404712#comment103180133_58404712"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":12137030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qnV2qHy-_F8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcaE1Vvbru56CGDai9O5qW3Ntv5Ug/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12137030/reed"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571190870,"creation_date":1571190870,"answer_id":58404712,"question_id":58399285,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404712","body_markdown":"Answer in one line is viewididload but below is the actual structural method.\r\n\r\nSo for this you can have multiple answer the most popular answer for these days would be using MVC/MVVM.

Any recommendations?  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html#Getting-Started\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39976479/vfr-sectional-aeronautical-charts-with-matplotlib-python","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399282/python-folium-map-is-not-saving","title":"Python folium map is not saving"},{"tags":["haproxy"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":783,"user_id":508440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d43a1463b4d7fef6a347822f9ae8bb5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justin cress","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/508440/justin-cress"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571158460,"post_id":58399372,"comment_id":103144173,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399280/haproxy-conf-frontend-subdirectory-to-backend-on-a-different-host/58399372#comment103144173_58399372"},{"owner":{"reputation":593,"user_id":12115778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBAKOoldSd9p4na0I4TnZ3_DWy9Ja0H_M0I-ssh=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"richyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115778/richyen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":783,"user_id":508440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d43a1463b4d7fef6a347822f9ae8bb5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justin cress","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/508440/justin-cress"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571159291,"post_id":58399372,"comment_id":103144505,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399280/haproxy-conf-frontend-subdirectory-to-backend-on-a-different-host/58399372#comment103144505_58399372"},{"owner":{"reputation":783,"user_id":508440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d43a1463b4d7fef6a347822f9ae8bb5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justin cress","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/508440/justin-cress"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571159834,"post_id":58399372,"comment_id":103144740,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399280/haproxy-conf-frontend-subdirectory-to-backend-on-a-different-host/58399372#comment103144740_58399372"},{"owner":{"reputation":593,"user_id":12115778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBAKOoldSd9p4na0I4TnZ3_DWy9Ja0H_M0I-ssh=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"richyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115778/richyen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":783,"user_id":508440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d43a1463b4d7fef6a347822f9ae8bb5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justin cress","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/508440/justin-cress"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571160448,"post_id":58399372,"comment_id":103144989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399280/haproxy-conf-frontend-subdirectory-to-backend-on-a-different-host/58399372#comment103144989_58399372"},{"owner":{"reputation":783,"user_id":508440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d43a1463b4d7fef6a347822f9ae8bb5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justin cress","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/508440/justin-cress"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571161154,"post_id":58399372,"comment_id":103145261,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399280/haproxy-conf-frontend-subdirectory-to-backend-on-a-different-host/58399372#comment103145261_58399372"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":593,"user_id":12115778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBAKOoldSd9p4na0I4TnZ3_DWy9Ja0H_M0I-ssh=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"richyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115778/richyen"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571158287,"creation_date":1571158287,"answer_id":58399372,"question_id":58399280,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58399372","body_markdown":"Looks like it&#39;s not loading your CSS when you&#39;re not on the LAN.

I want there to be 2 options to be required always and then after that the user can create or remove any extra that are added.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried doing it through vue, and the Request class, I&#39;m not sure what is going on and why it&#39;s not working. My ideal solution would be to do this from the vue so that the form cannot be saved without the fields being validated as correct.\r\n\r\nCurrently the question saves anyways even if there is only one option, or none, the way I have it is that two fields are always there but they can be saved without adding anything inside, so having those two always is equal to having nothing. \r\n\r\nThis is my form code where the fields are added \r\n```\r\n&lt;div v-if=&quot;form.response_type_id === 2&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;el-divider&gt;&lt;/el-divider&gt;\r\n    &lt;el-row&gt;\r\n        &lt;el-col :span=&quot;22&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;p class=&quot;el-form-item__label&quot;&gt;Opciones&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;/el-col&gt;\r\n        &lt;el-col :span=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;btn-link-plus action-button&quot; @click=&quot;addOption()&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/el-col&gt;\r\n    &lt;/el-row&gt;\r\n    &lt;div v-for=&quot;(option, index) in questionOptions&quot; :key=&quot;index&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;el-row&gt;\r\n            &lt;el-col :span=&quot;22&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;el-form-item prop=&quot;option&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;el-input v-model=&quot;option.option&quot;&gt;&lt;/el-input&gt;\r\n                &lt;/el-form-item&gt;\r\n            &lt;/el-col&gt;\r\n            &lt;el-col :span=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;btn-link-delete action-button&quot; @click=&quot;removeOption(index)&quot;\r\n                    :disabled=&quot;trashDisabled&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-trash-alt&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/el-col&gt;\r\n        &lt;/el-row&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nThis is the data from the script\r\n```\r\nquestionOptions: [\r\n    {\r\n        option: &#39;&#39;\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        option: &#39;&#39;\r\n    },\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my rules in the vue, if I do this, the options show up as invalid always even if they are filled, and I can&#39;t save even though the inputs are not empty.\r\n```\r\nrules: {\r\nquestion: {required: true, message: &#39;question required&#39;, trigger: &#39;blur&#39;},\r\nresponse_type_id: {required: true, message: &#39;answer type required&#39;, trigger: &#39;blur&#39;},\r\noption: {required: true, message: &#39;options are required&#39;, trigger: &#39;blur&#39;},\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my request class file, it doesn&#39;t save it into the database at all, however it also doesn&#39;t show any errors, in the vue it says that it&#39;s been saved correctly but it does not save it, if I change this line to this `&#39;questionOptions&#39; =&gt; &#39;required_if:response_type_id,2|array|min:2&#39;` without the `.*` everything gets saved without any issues, no options, one options, and two or more which is not what I want.  \r\n```\r\npublic function rules()\r\n{\r\n    return [\r\n        &#39;question&#39; =&gt; &#39;required&#39;,\r\n        &#39;response_type_id&#39; =&gt; &#39;required|exists:response_types,id&#39;,\r\n        &#39;questionOptions.*&#39; =&gt; &#39;required_if:response_type_id,2|array|min:2&#39;,\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is the correct way to do this? Ideally it would be on the .vue part but if that is not possible I will take it anywhere.

Unfortunately we cannot rely on TCP keep-alive mechanism since NELBs do not forward keep-alive TCP packets to the other side of the loadbalancer.  \r\nWhat I&#39;m thinking to do is to watch for idle connections and send an empty string (empty byte array) to clients. What I did so far in the code is:  \r\n\r\n1. Add a `IdleStateHandler` with some timeout values\r\n2. Register a `GprsKeepAliveHandler`, a sub class of `ChannelDuplexHandler`, overriding `userEventTriggered` method sending (`ctx.writeAndFlush`) the `Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER`.\r\n\r\nThis way, I expect to receive a RST packet if the connection is gone. Otherwise the connection will become active again.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is Netty does not do anything with the empty message, it does not send any packets to the client (monitored with Wireshark). If I change the message to `Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(new byte[]{0})` I see what I&#39;m expect to see.\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n\r\n1. I couldn&#39;t find a better way to achieve my objective (keep connections alive and detect dead connections). If there&#39;s a better way please let me know.\r\n2. What is the proper way to send an empty message in Netty? (I saw [this][1] question but it didn&#39;t help)\r\n3.

to Stack Overflow!\r\n\r\nFrom the code sample provided it&#39;s quite hard to work out what&#39;s going wrong as it&#39;s not runnable in isolation.\r\n\r\nThat said, I&#39;d first verify that the image you&#39;re consuming by url exists in the format you expect. If you download the `.jpeg` from the url can you open it on your machine? Assuming it&#39;s well structured I&#39;d then try and work out if it&#39;s the HttpClient that&#39;s malformed - or if there&#39;s something wrong with the values you&#39;re providing to the Facebook API.\r\n\r\nYou can do this by creating a simple C# Web API project that listens for a multipart upload on a specific route. See [this answer for some sample code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41806697/5617952) on how to do this.\r\n\r\nAssuming that you&#39;re able to send the `.jpeg` in question between a local client and a local endpoint accepting a `multipart/form-data` header then the issue must be with how you&#39;re using the Facebook API itself.\r\n\r\nIn your sample I don&#39;t see you using the value of the `content` variable anywhere. Is this intentional?\r\n\r\nIf that missing variable is a red-herring then you could try running something along the lines of (making sure to swap the values out as necessary for the ones you&#39;re having problems with):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing (var httpClient = new HttpClient())\r\nusing (var formDataContent = new MultipartFormDataContent()) \r\n{\r\n    // Read the file in from a local path first to verify that the image\r\n    // exists in the format you&#39;re expecting.\r\n    var fileStream = File.OpenRead(&quot;/some/path/image.jpeg&quot;);\r\n    using (var streamContent = new StreamContent(fileStream)) \r\n    {\r\n        // Don&#39;t actually call `.Result` you should await this, but for ease of\r\n        // demonstration.\r\n        var imageContent = new ByteArrayContent(streamContent.ReadAsByteArrayAsync().Result);\r\n        imageContent.Headers.ContentType = MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse(&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;);\r\n\r\n        formDataContent.Add(imageContent, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;your-file-name-here&quot;);\r\n        formDataContent.Add(new StringContent ($&quot;{{\\&quot;id\\&quot;:\\&quot;{long.Parse(&quot;your-recipient-here&quot;)}\\&quot;}}&quot;), &quot;recipient&quot;);\r\n        formDataContent.Add(new StringContent($&quot;{{\\&quot;attachment\\&quot;:{{\\&quot;type\\&quot;:\\&quot;{&quot;image&quot;}\\&quot;, \\&quot;payload\\&quot;:{{\\&quot;is_reusable\\&quot;=true}}}}&quot;), &quot;message&quot;);\r\n\r\n        // Again don&#39;t call `.Result` - await it.\r\n        var response = httpClient.PostAsync(&quot;https://some-url-here.com&quot;, formDataContent).Result;\r\n    }    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you run the above do you still get an empty message body error?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399262/send-file-attachment-to-facebook-messenger-api-in-c/58401554#58401554","title":"Send file attachment to Facebook messenger API in C#"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12221673,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aaa56c143ff72b5f2e76d8aedefaa661?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Eric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12221673/eric"},"last_editor":{"reputation":82,"user_id":5617952,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xSdBu.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael Searson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5617952/michael-searson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571170165,"creation_date":1571157869,"last_edit_date":1571170165,"question_id":58399262,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399262","body_markdown":"I looked at the messenger documentation at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/#file to try and figure out how to send local attachments.

QEMU user mode before running gem5).\r\n\r\nX86 syscall emulation could in theory just work, the command line would be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/X86/gem5.opt \\\r\n  configs/example/se.py

ELF executable just like your C program, and `HelloWorld.class` is the compiled Java class passed as an argument to `java`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I tried this on Ubuntu 18.04 and gem5 61005bb9ef455b2ac851f8a992f2cec5686e520f and it failed with:\r\n\r\n&gt; /usr/bin/java: error while loading shared libraries: libjli.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure why that was the case, it would require further investigation.\r\n\r\nSE ARM userland does not currently support dynamic loaded executables, so you would need to compile JVM statically, which might be a pain / impossible.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399259/running-java-programs-in-gem5or-any-language-which-is-not-c/58399829#58399829","title":"Running Java programs in gem5(or any

posted [this question][1] yesterday about making a new column in a df.

Now I am curious as to how I could create a new df1 that is just the rows corresponding to the largest absolute value of new.  The output would be Output2 below.  I know that I can utilize something like `df1 = df.loc([df[&#39;new&#39;].idxmin())` but that only gives rows.

Operating system error code 1326(Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.)][2] here on StackOverflow. We can discount the first one (login permissions) because you stated that you had permissions, but the other solution (*I fixed it by adding the SQL Server port number to the connection string in SSIS, forcing SSIS to access SQL Server through TCP/IP instead of Named Pipes.*) could apply.

after following everything given as answers in my previous question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57334161/issues-with-wamp64-server), nothing was working. So I naively decided to create a copy folder of WAMP and then uninstall it from the other folder (the copy folder is a complete copy with /www/ and /bin/ and everything).\r\n\r\nThe new WAMP runs, but I can&#39;t seem to import the old data. Basically, using mysqldump.exe in the old folder, it doesn&#39;t &quot;see&quot; the old databases anymore. When I print all databases, only the defaults come up (like &#39;sys&#39;). So that ruined basically the only way I can seem to find online to restore the db.\r\n\r\nEssentially, all I have right now is a list of `.ibd` files with all the data in them, but no way to access them... Any help on how to extract and import into new PHPMyAdmin would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399211/mysql-database-not-found-after-wamp-uninstall","title":"MySQL Database Not Found After WAMP Uninstall"},{"tags":["java","jdbc","database-connection","h2"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":656,"user_id":11731987,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gqzFb8haCDE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reDHiOs2COVKMHKrmEGwMe2Y7r9Cw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Evgenij Ryazanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11731987/evgenij-ryazanov"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571187862,"creation_date":1571187862,"answer_id":58404390,"question_id":58399209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404390","body_markdown":"You need to use `ssl` protocol instead of `tcp` in the URL, because you use an encrypted socked on the server.\r\n\r\n`&quot;jdbc:h2:ssl://127.0.0.1/~/Data/test&quot;`\r\n\r\nPlease also note that database cannot be created remotely by default in recent versions of H2 due to security reasons.
