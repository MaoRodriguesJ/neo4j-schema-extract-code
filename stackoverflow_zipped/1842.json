Either iterate over the codes in your `ForEach`, or pass your `Picker` an index.\r\n\r\nBelow are three equivalent examples. Notice that the `@State` variable which is passed to `Picker` always matches the ID of element that the `ForEach` iterates over:\r\n\r\nAlso note that I have picked a default value for the `@State` variable which is not in the array (&quot;&quot;, -1, UUID()), so nothing is shown when the form loads. If you want a default option, just make that the default value for your `@State` variable.\r\n\r\n**Example 1: Iterate over codes (i.e. String)**\r\n\r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n        @State private var currencyCode: String = &quot;&quot;\r\n        var codes: [String] = [&quot;EUR&quot;, &quot;GBP&quot;, &quot;USD&quot;]\r\n    \r\n        var body: some View {\r\n            NavigationView {\r\n                Form {\r\n                    Section {\r\n                        Picker(selection: $currencyCode, label: Text(&quot;Currency&quot;)) {\r\n                            // ID is a String ----v\r\n                            ForEach(codes, id: \\.self) { (string: String) in\r\n                                Text(string)\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Example 2: Iterate over indices (i.e. Int)**\r\n\r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n        @State private var selectedIndex: Int = -1\r\n        var codes: [String] = [&quot;EUR&quot;, &quot;GBP&quot;, &quot;USD&quot;]\r\n    \r\n        var body: some View {\r\n            NavigationView {\r\n                Form {\r\n                    Section {\r\n                        Picker(selection: $selectedIndex, label: Text(&quot;Currency&quot;)) {\r\n                            // ID is an Int --------------v\r\n                            ForEach(codes.indices, id: \\.self) { (index: Int) in\r\n                                Text(self.codes[index])\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Example 3: Iterate over an identifiable struct by its ID type (i.e. UUID)**\r\n\r\n    struct Code: Identifiable {\r\n        var id = UUID()\r\n        var value: String\r\n    \r\n        init(_ value: String) {\r\n            self.value = value\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n        @State private var selectedUUID = UUID()\r\n        var codes = [Code(&quot;EUR&quot;), Code(&quot;GBP&quot;), Code(&quot;USD&quot;)]\r\n    \r\n        var body: some View {\r\n            NavigationView {\r\n                Form {\r\n                    Section {\r\n                        Picker(selection: $selectedUUID, label: Text(&quot;Currency&quot;)) {\r\n                            // ID is a UUID, because Code conforms to Identifiable\r\n                            ForEach(self.codes) { (code: Code) in\r\n                                Text(code.value)\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103437/swiftui-picker-in-form-does-not-show-checkmark/58104567#58104567","title":"SwiftUI Picker in Form does not show checkmark"}],"owner":{"reputation":1070,"user_id":1463853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MjhCc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"gpichler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1463853/gpichler"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":219,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58104567,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569436237,"creation_date":1569431294,"question_id":58103437,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103437","body_markdown":"I have a Picker embedded in Form, however I can&#39;t get it working that it shows a checkmark and the selected value in the form.\r\n\r\n    NavigationView {\r\n        Form {\r\n            Section {\r\n                    Picker(selection: $currencyCode, label: Text(&quot;Currency&quot;)) {\r\n                        ForEach(0 ..&lt;

idea of `csv.DictWriter()` is not to dump a dictionary to a `csv` file, but to write multiple dictionaries to the same tabular structure.\r\nGiven this, the `key`s of the dictionary act as a header for your tabular data.\r\n\r\nThis is clear from the example from the [official docs][1]:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport csv\r\n\r\nwith open(&#39;names.csv&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, newline=&#39;&#39;) as csvfile:\r\n    fieldnames = [&#39;first_name&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;]\r\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)\r\n\r\n    writer.writeheader()\r\n    writer.writerow({&#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Baked&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;: &#39;Beans&#39;})\r\n    writer.writerow({&#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Lovely&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;: &#39;Spam&#39;})\r\n    writer.writerow({&#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Wonderful&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;: &#39;Spam&#39;})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith output in `names.csv`:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nfirst_name,last_name\r\nBaked,Beans\r\nLovely,Spam\r\nWonderful,Spam\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# EDIT\r\n\r\nIf you have an input `dict` that you want to dump to a text file such that you have `&lt;key&gt;,&lt;value&gt;` for each `dict` entry, one way of using this with `csv.DictWriter` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport csv\r\n\r\ndata = {&#39;foo&#39;: &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;ping&#39;: &#39;pong&#39;}\r\n\r\nwith open(&#39;data.csv&#39;, &#39;a&#39;) as file_obj:\r\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(file_obj, fieldnames=[&#39;key&#39;, &#39;val&#39;])\r\n    for k, v in data.items():\r\n        writer.writerow({&#39;key&#39;: k, &#39;val&#39;: v})\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe content of `data.csv` will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoo,bar\r\nping,pong\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# EDIT 2\r\n\r\nIf all you want is a string representation of your `dict` in a line, I do not see `csv.DictWriter()` or even `csv` a good fit for the job.\r\nThe following code would reproduce your expected output:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = [\r\n   {&#39;foo&#39;: &#39;bar&#39;},\r\n   {&#39;spam&#39;: &#39;eggs&#39;}\r\n]\r\n\r\nwith open(&#39;data.csv&#39;, &#39;a&#39;) as file_obj:\r\n    for d in data:\r\n        file_obj.write(str(d) + &#39;\\n&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the content of `data.csv` will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{&#39;foo&#39;: &#39;bar&#39;}\r\n{&#39;spam&#39;: &#39;eggs&#39;}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]:

One that tests an exception was thrown and one that [depends](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/8.3/annotations.html#depends) on the first test and tests the record still exists, but in this case the database would be reset before each test, including test dependencies so it won&#39;t work as you might expect.\r\n\r\nBut you can still do two tests and have one depend on the other, however you need to re-run the same code in both test (because the database would be reset in between the tests).

*output channel* for `filter` (or any other endpoint) in the flow is the one created automatically before the endpoint in the flow. So, in your case it is like this:\r\n\r\n     .filter()\r\n     .transform()\r\n\r\nWhenever message has passed the filter, it is sent into that transformer. We can treat it as a `SUCCESS` process.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s write a filter function first of all to make those message to flow properly!\r\n\r\nThere is a method like this for you:\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Populate a {@link MessageFilter} with {@link MethodInvokingSelector}\r\n\t * for the provided {@link GenericSelector}.\r\n\t * Typically used with a Java 8 Lambda expression:\r\n\t * &lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;\r\n\t * {@code\r\n\t *  .filter(&quot;World&quot;::equals)\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * &lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\t * Use {@link #filter(Class, GenericSelector)} if you need to access the entire\r\n\t * message.\r\n\t * @param genericSelector the {@link GenericSelector} to use.\r\n\t * @param &lt;P&gt; the source payload type.\r\n\t * @return the current {@link IntegrationFlowDefinition}.\r\n\t */\r\n\tpublic &lt;P&gt; B filter(GenericSelector&lt;P&gt; genericSelector) {\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, our task is to implement that `GenericSelector` for your `UserBean`:\r\n\r\n     .&lt;UserBean&gt;filter(userBean -&gt; userBean.getStatus().equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;SUCCESS&quot;))\r\n\r\nTo send all other (`ERROR`) message to the discard channel (`errorSummaryReportGenerationChannel`), we need to add that `discardChannel` option into the filter somehow. And for this purpose there is an overloaded `filter()` method in Java DSL:\r\n\r\n    .&lt;UserBean&gt;filter(userBean -&gt; userBean.getStatus().equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;SUCCESS&quot;),\r\n                   endpoint -&gt; endpoint.discardChannel(&quot;errorSummaryReportGenerationChannel&quot;))\r\n\r\nSee their JavaDocs for more information.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103341/spring-integration-filter-send-messages-to-a-different-end-point/58103844#58103844","title":"Spring Integration - Filter - Send messages to a different end point"}],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":1478392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a3f03bd021bfb1e79fd27224abbec1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Deepboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1478392/deepboy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":116,"user_id":1478392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a3f03bd021bfb1e79fd27224abbec1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Deepboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1478392/deepboy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569511975,"creation_date":1569430921,"last_edit_date":1569511975,"question_id":58103341,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103341","body_markdown":"My input is a csv file as given below:\r\n\r\n    USER_ID, USER_NAME, FREQUENCY, FREQUENCY_DETAIL\r\n    A123, AAA, ANNUALLY, 1-JUN\r\n    B123, BBB, INVALID_FREQUENCY, 21-JUN\r\n    C123, CCC, ANNUALLY, APR\r\n    D123, DDD, WEEKLY, 1-DEC\r\n\r\nValidations:\r\n\r\n    USER_ID -&gt; alphanumeric\r\n    USERNAME -&gt; alphabets only\r\n    FREQUENCY -&gt; must be one of DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY , ANNUALLY\r\n    FREQUENCY DETAIL -&gt; Pattern \\\\d{1,2}-\\\\w{3}\r\n\r\nMy Bean is as follows:\r\n\r\n    class UserBean {\r\n    \tString userID;\r\n    \tString userName;\r\n    \tString frequency;\r\n    \tString frequencyDetail;\r\n    \t\r\n    \tString status = &quot;SUCCESS&quot;; //Code generated.

So e.g lets say your document was:\r\n```\r\n{ &quot;_id&quot;: 1, &quot;user&quot; : \r\n   { &quot;comments&quot;: \r\n     [ { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;mpla&quot;, &quot;active&quot; : true }, {

Essentially, given a `ColumnDataSource` and a value change in the `Select` box, just change what column a given plot axis references and update the plot.  Given [that many other glyph properties can be `js_linked` to widgets][1], I&#39;d thought this should be possible.  So far, the only implementations of this I&#39;ve seen have been in Bokeh Servers using Python callbacks, but I am trying to avoid having to use a Bokeh Server.  The following illustrates the idea:\r\n\r\n    from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, Select, CustomJS\r\n    from bokeh.plotting import figure\r\n    from bokeh.layouts import column\r\n    from bokeh.io import output_notebook, output_file, show\r\n    output_file(&#39;foo.html&#39;)\r\n\r\n    source = ColumnDataSource(\r\n        {\r\n        &#39;x&#39;: [0, 1, 2, 3],\r\n        &#39;y&#39;: [0, 1, 4, 9],\r\n        &#39;z&#39;: [0, 2, 3, 1],\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    fig = figure()\r\n    line = fig.line(x=&#39;x&#39;, y=&#39;y&#39;, source=source)\r\n    dropdown = Select(value=&#39;y&#39;, options=[&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;])\r\n    dropdown.js_link(&#39;value&#39;, line.glyph, &#39;y&#39;)\r\n    layout = column(dropdown, fig)\r\n    show(layout)\r\n\r\nI also tried the following, which I think is functionally identical but I suppose more explicit:\r\n\r\n    from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, Select, CustomJS\r\n    from bokeh.plotting import figure\r\n    from bokeh.layouts import column\r\n    from bokeh.io import output_file, show\r\n    output_file(&#39;foo.html&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    source = ColumnDataSource(\r\n        {\r\n        &#39;x&#39;: [0, 1, 2, 3],\r\n        &#39;y&#39;: [0, 1, 4, 9],\r\n        &#39;z&#39;: [0, 2, 3, 1],\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    fig = figure()\r\n    line = fig.line(x=&#39;x&#39;, y=&#39;y&#39;, source=source)\r\n    dropdown = Select(value=&#39;y&#39;, options=[&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;])\r\n    dropdown.js_on_change(\r\n        &#39;value&#39;,\r\n        CustomJS(\r\n            args={\r\n                &#39;glyph&#39;: line.glyph,\r\n                &#39;source&#39;: source,\r\n            }, \r\n            code=&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n                var new_vert = cb_obj.value;\r\n                glyph.y = new_vert; \r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;))\r\n    layout = column(dropdown, fig)\r\n    show(layout)\r\n\r\nIn both cases the HTML will render in the browser without errors, but as soon as the `Select` value changes, the line plot just disappears, rather than plotting the selected `CDS` series.  I tried inspecting in the browser but no JS errors are returned.  Am I missing something, or is this just not possible without Bokeh Server?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nI should also add that I&#39;m trying to avoid creating a second `CDS` and copying data over in a `CustomJS`, as I have multiple subplots sharing a single `CDS`, and I&#39;d prefer not to create a new one for each plot so that their behavior remains linked.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

explanation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103279/production-app-on-google-app-engine-suddenly-lost-access-to-google-cloud-storage/58180196#58180196","title":"Production App on Google

production app (python 2.7 standard environment) running on Google App Engine suddenly lost permissions to write (create objects) on Google Cloud Storage, without any change in the code on our side.\r\n\r\nThe code is able to create new buckets, but not new objects within them.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the default app engine service account is not granted the permission.\r\nNeedless to say, the service account has the Storage Object Creator role, as well as the Editor role on the project level.\r\n\r\nStrangely, the exact same code running on the test environment project, continues to work perfectly.\r\nWe are using the api client library to obtain credentials, like so:\r\n\r\n    from oauth2client.appengine import AppAssertionCredentials\r\n    from apiclient.discovery import build as discovery_build\r\n\r\n    credentials = AppAssertionCredentials(scope=scope)\r\n    http = credentials.authorize(httplib2.Http())\r\n    service = discovery_build(&#39;storage&#39;, &#39;v1&#39;, http=http)\r\n\r\nAnd then using the service to make the api call.\r\nAll calls to create objects are suddenly failing with the message:\r\n&quot;Anonymous caller does not have storage.objects.create access to &lt;bucket&gt;/&lt;object&gt;&quot;\r\n\r\nAny ideas what could suddenly have gone wrong ??\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103279/production-app-on-google-app-engine-suddenly-lost-access-to-google-cloud-storage","title":"Production App on Google App Engine

It depends on how many packages you want to generate. \r\n\r\nIf you want to create  one nuget package for 3 projects (iOS, Android, UWP), you should use the `.nuspec` file.\r\n\r\nThe path problem is because you are not set the correct path in the `.nuspec` file. The `.nuspec` file should be set at the folder that&#39;s **one level below** where the `.sln` file is. The path to the dll is the relative path where the `.nupsec` file is stored.\r\n\r\nSo, the path should be like:\r\n\r\n    &lt;files&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- Cross-platform reference assemblies --&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; target=&quot;lib\\netstandard2.0\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; target=&quot;lib\\netstandard2.0\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;!-- iOS reference assemblies --&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo.iOS\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; target=&quot;lib\\Xamarin.iOS10\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo.iOS\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; target=&quot;lib\\Xamarin.iOS10\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;!-- Android reference assemblies --&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo.Android\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; target=&quot;lib\\MonoAndroid10\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo.Android\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; target=&quot;lib\\MonoAndroid10\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;!-- UWP reference assemblies --&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo.UWP\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; target=&quot;lib\\UAP10\\XamarinDemo.dll&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;file src=&quot;XamarinDemo.UWP\\bin\\Release\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; target=&quot;lib\\UAP10\\XamarinDemo.xml&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/files&gt;\r\n\r\nCheck the document [Create packages for Xamarin with Visual Studio 2015][1] for some details.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create three nuget package for each platform, you can use the a `**/*.csproj` for the pack.\r\n\r\nThe reason for your issue is that you need install the .NET core SDK before you build the project/solution:\r\n\r\n\r\n    - task: UseDotNet@2\r\n      displayName: &#39;Use .Net Core sdk 2.2.105&#39;\r\n      inputs:\r\n        version: 2.2.105\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/guides/create-packages-for-xamarin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103259/is-it-possible-to-publish-a-xamarin-project-to-a-private-nuget-package-feed-in-v/58114428#58114428","title":"Is it possible to publish a Xamarin project to a private nuget package feed in VSTS (DevOps)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":8099633,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d49e2da1fa32e5d72e650fb24e4e2f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MouthOfMadness","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8099633/mouthofmadness"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569602365,"creation_date":1569602365,"answer_id":58138496,"question_id":58103259,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58138496","body_markdown":"So, my problem wasn&#39;t in my nuspec file; the real problem comes down to using the vmImage : &quot;macos-latest&quot;, which is required if you want to build an iOS project (iOS won&#39;t build under the agents 2019, or 2017, and you must use MSBuild (not VSBuild)\r\n\r\nThe macos-latest image has several issues (which I&#39;ll refer to as the iOS agent)\r\n\r\n 1.

working on this project challenge called &quot;Algebra Tutor&quot; for my very first java class. \r\n\r\n&gt; The program should be able to output a question to decide whether you want to solver for `m` or `b` or y in the formula `y = mx + b`.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  Once one of those is pick by a number: &quot;Select 1 to Solve for `Y`, `2` to Solve for `M`, `3` to Solve for B and 4 to quit. &quot; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; It should give you an output to solve the formula. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m working in part 3 of the project which is:\r\n\r\n&gt; Update your program so that each problem type mode will repeatedly ask questions until the user gets 3 correct answers in a row.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If the attempts more than 3 questions in a particular mode, the program should provide a hint on how to solve problems of this type.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; After the student has correctly answered 3 questions in a row, an overall score (the number of questions answered correctly divided by the total number of questions attempted) should be displayed, and the menu is presented again.\r\n\r\n\r\n**So I&#39;m getting stuck on how I can place a counter that starts at 0 and every time the user answers correctly then 1 will be added to the counter and quit if it gets 3 in a row or go back to 0 if the user answer is incorrect.** \r\n\r\nI will provide my code I&#39;m getting confused on how having a while loop inside of the if statement and then another while loop for the count, it&#39;s confusing I know but once you see my code you will see what I&#39;m talking about. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo I know I can place a counter like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint counter = 0;\r\nwhile (counter &lt; 4) \r\n      if statement here \r\n       counter ++; \r\n      else \r\n        counter = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport

then the if statement jumps in \r\nwhere can I place my counter to start and catch all the if statements depending on the number the user picks and then if the user gets 3 correct in a row the program should go back to the main question.

Each sequence in the training set has a different lenght.\r\nAt each time, the model should output a vector of 3 elements. \r\n\r\nI am trying to train and compare two models:\r\nA) a simple LSTM with 128 inputs and 3 outputs;\r\nB) a simple LSTM with 128 inputs and 100 outputs + a dense layer with 3 outputs;\r\n\r\nFor model A) I wrote the following code:\r\n\r\n    # Model\r\n    model = Sequential()\r\n    model.add(LSTM(3, batch_input_shape=(1, None, 128),  return_sequences=True, activation = &quot;linear&quot;, stateful = True))`\r\n    model.compile(loss=&#39;mean_squared_error&#39;, optimizer=Adam())\r\n\r\n    # Training\r\n    for i in range(n_epoch):\r\n        for j in np.random.permutation(n_sequences):\r\n            X = data[j] # j-th sequences\r\n            X = X[np.newaxis, ...] # X has size 1 x NTimes x 128\r\n\r\n            Y = dataY[j] # Y has size NTimes x 3\r\n                \r\n            history = model.fit(X, Y, epochs=1, batch_size=1, verbose=0, shuffle=False)\r\n            model.reset_states()\r\n\r\nWith this code, model A) seems to train fine because the output sequence approaches the ground-truth sequence on the training set. \r\nHowever, I wonder if the loss is really computed by considering all NTimes output vectors.\r\n\r\nFor model B), I could not find any way to get the entire output sequence due to the dense layer.
