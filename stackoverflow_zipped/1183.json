Or it could be that the order service queries some API that has direct access to the data stored by the customer service.\r\n\r\nQueries for the additional data that you need could be synchronous or asynchronous - maybe the work can be deferred until you have all of the data you need.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is that you redesign your system so that the business capability you need is with the data, either moving the capability or moving the data.  Why does ordering need customer data?  Can the customer service do the work instead?  Should ordering own the data?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a certain amount of complexity that is inherent in your decision to distribute the work across multiple services.

Forget microservices, they are just implementation strategy.\r\n\r\nNow back to your problem. Publish these events from Customer aggregate(in your case Customer microservice): `CustomerRegistered`, `CustomerInfoUpdated`, `CustomerAccountRemoved`, `CustomerAddressChanged` etc. Then subscribe your Order service(again in your case application service inside Order microservice) to listen all above events.

I would say, space in hard disk is cheaper than memory or a database query is faster than a network call in performance perspective. If your database host(or your server) is limited then you should not go with microservices.

I am writing an order system and currently have implemented an order microservice which takes care of placing an order. I am using DDD with event sourcing and CQRS.\r\n\r\nThe order service itself takes in commands that produce events, the actual order service listens to its own event to create a read model (The idea here is to use CQRS, so commands for writes and queries for reads)\r\n\r\nAfter implementing the above, I ran into a problem and its probably just that I am not fully understanding the correct way of doing this.\r\n\r\nAn order actually has dependents, meaning an order needs a customer and a product/s. So i will have 2 additional microservices for customer and products.\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple, i would like to concentrate on the customer (although I have exactly the same issue with products but my thinking is that if I fix the customer issue then the other one is automatically fixed also).\r\n\r\nSo back to the problem at hand. To create an order the order needs a customer (and products), I currently have the customerId on the client, so sending down a command to the order service, I can pass in the customerId.\r\n\r\nI would like to save the name and address of the customer with the order. How do I get the name and address of the customerId from the Customer Service in the Order Service ?\r\n\r\nI suppose to summarize, when data from one service needs data from another service, how am I able to get this data.\r\n\r\nWould it be the case of the order service creating an event for receiving a customer record ? This is going to introduce a lot of complexity (more events) in the system\r\n\r\nThe microservices are NOT coupled so the order service can&#39;t just call into the read model of the customer.\r\n\r\nAnybody able to help me on this ?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260962/ddd-event-sourcing-getting-data-from-another-microservice","title":"DDD/Event sourcing, getting data from another microservice?"},{"tags":["python","django","orm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":487985,"user_id":104349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f4cefeedec5163556751d61625eedd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Roseman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/104349/daniel-roseman"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570393887,"post_id":58260951,"comment_id":102890566,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260951/why-my-def-str-self-function-isnt-working-in-django#comment102890566_58260951"},{"owner":{"reputation":2426,"user_id":843999,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbvE2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ozgur Akcali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/843999/ozgur-akcali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570401262,"post_id":58260951,"comment_id":102891900,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260951/why-my-def-str-self-function-isnt-working-in-django#comment102891900_58260951"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1576,"user_id":3364820,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":49,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lrf8N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mihai Zamfir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3364820/mihai-zamfir"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570393895,"creation_date":1570393895,"answer_id":58260996,"question_id":58260951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58260996","body_markdown":"you need to define `__repr__` instead","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260951/why-my-def-str-self-function-isnt-working-in-django/58260996#58260996","title":"why my &quot;def __str__(self)&quot; function isn&#39;t working in django"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3504,"user_id":10746224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25bb2589e5ce6b9bd2c2fa2d81961c95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caleb Goodman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10746224/caleb-goodman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570398480,"post_id":58261234,"comment_id":102891449,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260951/why-my-def-str-self-function-isnt-working-in-django/58261234#comment102891449_58261234"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":10346571,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0O74x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Priyanshu Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10346571/priyanshu-gupta"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570396107,"creation_date":1570396107,"answer_id":58261234,"question_id":58260951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58261234","body_markdown":"Indentation is the fault it seems.

All the values must be stored in a LINEAR array and elements must only be manipulated as dereferenced pointers. Following this, the array elements must printed as a lower triangular matrix and subsequently deleted. My implementation functions perfectly for input ranging from 0 to 12 but produces spurious results for higher values.\r\n\r\nI tried two different implementations.\r\n\r\n1. Declare a pointer to an array of size (n+1)*(n+2)/2 (which is the number of elements in the triangle for input &#39;n&#39;). Assign/print variables within a nested loop. Delete the pointer once both loops have been executed.\r\n\r\n2. Run a nested loop, 0 &lt;= i &lt;= n, and 0 &lt;= j &lt;= i. Declare a pointer to an array of size (i+1) in the outer loop. Assign/print elements in the inner loop. Delete the pointer once the inner loop has been executed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// VERSION 1\r\nunsigned N = (n+1)*(n+2)/2;\r\n  unsigned* elements = new unsigned[N];\r\n  for(i = 0; i &lt;= n; i++) {\r\n\tfor(j = 0; j &lt;= i; j++) {\r\n\t  *(elements + j+(i*i+i)/2) = fact(i) / (fact(j) * fact(i-j));\r\n          // print statement\r\n\t}\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n  }\r\ndelete [] elements;\r\n\r\n// VERSION 2\r\nfor(i = 0; i &lt;= n; i++) {\r\n\tunsigned* elements = new unsigned[i+1];\r\n\tfor(j = 0; j &lt;= i; j++) {\r\n\t  *(elements + j) = fact(i) / (fact(j) * fact(i-j));\r\n          // print statement\r\n\t}\r\n\tdelete [] elements;\r\n\tcout &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth these versions were tried separately on Xcode. In both cases, the triangle printed correctly until the 12th layer, i.e. n=12, but generated incorrect results for higher values.\r\n```\r\n0 | 1 \r\n1 | 1 1 \r\n2 | 1 2 1 \r\n3 | 1 3 3 1 \r\n4 | 1 4 6 4 1 \r\n5 | 1 5 10 10 5 1 \r\n6 | 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 \r\n7 | 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1 \r\n8 | 1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1 \r\n9 | 1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1 \r\n10 | 1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1 \r\n11 | 1 11 55 165 330 462 462 330 165 55 11 1 \r\n12 | 1 12 66 220 495 792 924 792 495 220 66 12 1 \r\n13 | 1 4 24 88 221 399 532 532 399 221 88 24 4 1 \r\n14 | 1 0 1 5 14 29 44 50 44 29 14 5 1 0 1 \r\n15 | 1 1 0 0 2 4 7 9 9 7 4 2 0 0 1 1 \r\n16 | 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe debugger, to the extent that I can use it, produced no error messages.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening and how do I fix it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260938/why-does-this-new-and-delete-implementation-break-down-for-integers-12","title":"Why does this new [ ] and delete [ ] implementation break down for integers &gt; 12?"},{"tags":["python","selenium","web-scraping"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":10700415,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95f043f3ed0f59463b170f8b53ddd255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tom Callan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10700415/tom-callan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570398596,"post_id":58261220,"comment_id":102891471,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260935/selenium-only-returns-an-empty-list/58261220#comment102891471_58261220"},{"owner":{"reputation":3742,"user_id":6845383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4PKMR3Y4-Fg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/GQn04TEMI4c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Moshe Slavin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6845383/moshe-slavin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24,"user_id":10700415,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95f043f3ed0f59463b170f8b53ddd255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tom Callan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10700415/tom-callan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570432124,"post_id":58261220,"comment_id":102897485,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260935/selenium-only-returns-an-empty-list/58261220#comment102897485_58261220"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3742,"user_id":6845383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4PKMR3Y4-Fg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/GQn04TEMI4c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Moshe Slavin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6845383/moshe-slavin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":62610,"user_id":7429447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZMSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DebanjanB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7429447/debanjanb"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570444246,"last_edit_date":1570444246,"creation_date":1570395958,"answer_id":58261220,"question_id":58260935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58261220","body_markdown":"You should use [WebDriverWait][1].

have tested with different class implementations and can see the waiting time are for hashCode. This makes sense since the hashCode for an integer are just the same integer as it represent (makes sense if you think about it).\r\n\r\nThe hashCode for Object() are more complicated and needs to make an external call into some code I don&#39;t know.\r\n\r\nIf I create my own class and override the hashCode property with something like &quot;always return 5&quot; then I get the same speed as the integer.\r\n\r\nSince hashCode (and ==) are being used every time you add something to a Map or Set, it is important to keep this two functions as efficient as possible.\r\n\r\n**Answer to Update 2**\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Object() hashCode property are slower is because it does a lot than the integer hashCode. I have checked the source code and this is the steps it does:\r\n\r\n- The hashCode implementation are patched in here: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/e88057fe04deccb9468d93785f3fd43523c2f91f/sdk_nnbd/lib/_internal/vm/lib/object_patch.dart#L41\r\n- Which ends up calling a static method called _objectHashCode: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/7c1821c4aae86db4febf3c0656985e23df31be0f/sdk/lib/_internal/vm/lib/object_patch.dart#L25\r\n- The first thing _objectHashCode does it calling an external method by calling _setHash. The implementation of this can be found here: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/84db16381d8efbb4fdbcfa79ef411a5ec8809bc7/runtime/lib/object.cc#L34\r\n\r\nAs you can see this is a lot more complicated than just taking the value of the integer itself and use that as the hash. As you also can see in the code there are even usage of Random generators.\r\n\r\nI should add, that the Hash are cached so it is only the first time calling hashCode it is really slow. But as you can see the cached version are still an external call which are more expensive than just getting an integer variable.\r\n\r\n**Update for &quot;Proposing a workaround to this issue&quot;**\r\n\r\nThis is happening in flutter channel stable v1.9.1+hotfix.4, but is fixed in master. It shouldn&#39;t be necessary to implement in the next Flutter releases.\r\n\r\nIf you can&#39;t accept the performance of the standard hashCode method right now, I think the only other way is to manually cache it like:\r\n\r\n    class ObjectWithCachedHash {\r\n      int _hashCodeCache;\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      int get hashCode =&gt; _hashCodeCache ??= super.hashCode;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis should only be done if the hashCode are not dependent on any values inside the object (e.g. the standard hashCode implementation which are purely instance based).\r\n\r\n**Updated with link to issue**\r\n\r\nThe problem with slowish hashCode is a know issue (thanks Ignacio Catalan for pointing that out):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/24206\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the performance problem found in this stackoverflow question are more likely related to a recent regression there has been fixed on master:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/24206#issuecomment-539448012\r\n\r\nBut the fix for this regression will only fix the issue for x64, so 32 bit architectures (and properly also all ARM architectures) will still be affected by the performance issue (which are another issue which are not related to the regression).\r\n\r\nSo the recommendation for 32bit and ARM users would be to locally cache the hashCode value if you code depends on the Object.hashCode and are going to make a lot comparisons (e.g. using Map&#39;s or Set&#39;s with larger amount of objects).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260908/primitive-type-hashset-or-hashmap-10-times-faster-than-object/58261306#58261306","title":"Primitive type HashSet or HashMap 10 times faster than Object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11432778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17980b3252020653ef8e4ea6f39caa48?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ignacio Catalan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11432778/ignacio-catalan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11432778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17980b3252020653ef8e4ea6f39caa48?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ignacio Catalan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11432778/ignacio-catalan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":82,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58261306,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570597723,"creation_date":1570393028,"last_edit_date":1570551090,"question_id":58260908,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260908","body_markdown":"**Update:** This should be considered a bug in flutter channel stable v1.9.1+hotfix.4. When switched to channel master this is fixed, int and Object Sets have performances of the same order of magnitude.\r\n\r\nA benchmark throws that `HashSet&lt;int&gt;` performs an average of 10 times faster than `HashSet&lt;Object&gt;`.\r\nWhat is the reason of this behavior?\r\n\r\nI was having a big performance drop (over an order of magnitude) when I changed the internals of a library in a way that I expected to be more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe problem was changing from a `HashSet&lt;int&gt;` to a `HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt;`, which I confirmed when running the simple benchmark in a HashSet that adds the same value 1000 times. The result is that `HashSet&lt;int&gt;` performs an average of 10 times faster than `HashSet&lt;Object&gt;`.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions from a code design perspective? The code looks much cleaner when having a `HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt;` instead of having additional data structures that relate the instances to an int. This performance drop is important since it&#39;s the core of the library. The only way I have found to keep the program efficient, is to manipulate everything with an integer that identifies MyClass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe benchmark can be found here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/icatalud/dc28bd3bdd7c13b39c308b7abb9a9d8c\r\n\r\nThe function that adds to the Set is the following:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nplainAddSet&lt;T&gt;(T obj, [int n = 1000]) {\r\n  var s = Set&lt;T&gt;();\r\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n    s.add(obj);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update:** Running more tests led me to the root cause of the performance drop. The hashCode getter is extremely slow. In the following class if the hashCode method is not overriden, it takes 20 times longer, even slower than Object. Otherwise it takes slightly more than an int Set.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nclass Identifiable {\r\n  static int lastId = 0;\r\n  int id;\r\n  Identifiable() : id = lastId++;\r\n\r\n  // Not overriding this getter, causes the benchmark to take 20 times longer.\r\n  int get hashCode =&gt; id;\r\n\r\n  bool operator ==(other) =&gt;\r\n      other.runtimeType == runtimeType &amp;&amp;\r\n      hashCode == other.hashCode;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** Still, it would be interesting to understand why overriding the == operator and accessing the hashCode from there is three times slower than leaving the Object default implementation (which is more than 10 times slower than int).\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nclass Identifiable {\r\n  bool operator ==(other) =&gt;\r\n      other.runtimeType == runtimeType &amp;&amp;\r\n      other.hashCode == hashCode;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update 3:** There is an [open issue][1] about this in the dart SDK repository. It has been there for over 4 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/24206","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260908/primitive-type-hashset-or-hashmap-10-times-faster-than-object","title":"Primitive type HashSet or HashMap 10 times faster than Object?"},{"tags":["azure","chatbot","qnamaker"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":746,"user_id":9599453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQmn8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ranusharao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9599453/ranusharao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570657985,"post_id":58260906,"comment_id":102986558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260906/i-created-a-knowledge-base-in-spanish-but-the-bot-responds-in-english#comment102986558_58260906"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":746,"user_id":9599453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQmn8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ranusharao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9599453/ranusharao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570809500,"post_id":58312781,"comment_id":103044646,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260906/i-created-a-knowledge-base-in-spanish-but-the-bot-responds-in-english/58312781#comment103044646_58312781"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":746,"user_id":9599453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQmn8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ranusharao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9599453/ranusharao"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570657893,"creation_date":1570657893,"answer_id":58312781,"question_id":58260906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312781","body_markdown":"If your knowledge base is in Spanish and you are getting the default answer in English when it finds no match, the you can follow the steps below:\r\n\r\n - When you query for a question which has no match in the KB, click on the &#39;Inspect&#39; option right below the question.\r\n - Once you click on the &#39;Inspect&#39; option, it will expand to a larger window which shows the question and answer tabs. \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n - On the Answers tab, you can see the default answer in English.

Is there any other solution?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260877/access-firebase-emulator-from-local-network","title":"Access firebase emulator from local network"},{"tags":["c#",".net","syntax","operators"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2624,"user_id":4739488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8m1k.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Flydog57","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4739488/flydog57"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570393107,"post_id":58260876,"comment_id":102890422,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260876/how-can-i-subtract-an-object-in-dotnet-core-using-the-minus-symbol-similar-to-d#comment102890422_58260876"},{"owner":{"reputation":2624,"user_id":4739488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8m1k.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Flydog57","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4739488/flydog57"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570393324,"post_id":58260876,"comment_id":102890464,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260876/how-can-i-subtract-an-object-in-dotnet-core-using-the-minus-symbol-similar-to-d#comment102890464_58260876"},{"owner":{"reputation":44065,"user_id":3152130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqxLT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TaW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3152130/taw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570393991,"post_id":58260876,"comment_id":102890595,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260876/how-can-i-subtract-an-object-in-dotnet-core-using-the-minus-symbol-similar-to-d#comment102890595_58260876"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1737,"user_id":6180031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HRw-01bXV4c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACP8/Mi48YmzBWL0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ZorgoZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6180031/zorgoz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1737,"user_id":6180031,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HRw-01bXV4c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACP8/Mi48YmzBWL0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ZorgoZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6180031/zorgoz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570393344,"last_edit_date":1570393344,"creation_date":1570393033,"answer_id":58260909,"question_id":58260876,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58260909","body_markdown":"What you are looking for is called operator overloading.

I make a server for a game. This server need a lot of development, 800k lines of code.\r\n\r\nAfter more than one month. It appears there is a cheat some players are using to destroy player&#39;s fun. \r\n\r\nI have to admit it&#39;s a bit hard for me to figure out how to defend myself about this. The server owners community are just under attack too much and everyone is trying to defend himself as they can. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m working in Lua, JSON, HTML and CSS for this project, 99% Lua.\r\n\r\n**What things the game client has control over :** \r\n\r\nThe client can do commands but commands are only allowed to admin. Except if the injection of his own file make a new command. And can inject code inside the client game(explain after). \r\n\r\n**What the server does :** \r\n\r\nI guess, here is where we may can do something. All servers have tons of mods installed, so all client are downloading all my mod/client scripts to trigger my servers events.\r\n\r\n**What is the process of sending a command :**\r\n\r\n- the client can use chat /command [attribut][attribut2]\r\n- the client can run the client&#39;s console and : command [attribut][attribut2]\r\n\r\n\r\n**How cheaters are doing it?** \r\n\r\n-  1) Injector hidden in the memory with windows executable. \r\n-  2) They are loading a client file to make clients commands to call server triggers*. \r\n(because, yes, it&#39;s poor everyone is using same scripts so it&#39;s known triggers names)\r\n-  *) To do that they open a client console and writing inside : &quot;exec c:/filename.lua&quot; )\r\n\r\n50% of cheat scripts are obfuscated with AHCI &amp; variable replacement like the following.\r\n\r\n**What does a cheat look like?** \r\nI cannot post the full code here &gt;Body is limited to 30000 characters; you entered 208906.&lt; &gt;obfuscated&lt; &gt;not indented(1 ligne)&lt;\r\n\r\n-A global function :  \r\n\r\n`function IllIlllIllIlllIlllIlllIll(IllIlllIllIllIll) if (IllIlllIllIllIll==(((((919 + 636)-636)*3147)/3147)+919))end end)`\r\n\r\n-A global variable :\r\n\r\n`IllIIllIIllIII(IllIIIllIIIIllI(IlIlIlIlIlIlIlIlII,IIIIIIIIllllllllIIIIIIII))()`\r\n\r\n-A global variable :\r\n  \r\n`Xxxxx5 = {}`\r\n\r\n-A global variable : \r\n\r\n`Xxxxx5.debug = true`\r\n\r\n-A local variable :  \r\n\r\n`local logged = true`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where I need you help**\r\n\r\nI would like to detect not the injection. But, I have no control at all, on this. I would like to detect one of these thing : (Remember I can inject my client lua / Json scripts to do things)\r\n\r\n- when someone is typing : exec in the console ? \r\n- when someone is using a global variable/function ? (since I got them &quot;Xxxxx5.debug = true&quot;)\r\n- when someone is trying to detect or scan my triggers ? \r\n- something I didn&#39;t think yet ?\r\n- Detect if function exists ? \r\n\r\nI have global and local function in the client script : \r\n\r\n&gt;     local function d(e)\r\n&gt;         local f = {}\r\n&gt;         local h = GetGameTimer() / 200\r\n&gt;         f.r = math.floor(math.sin(h * e + 0) * 127 + 128)\r\n&gt;         f.g = math.floor(math.sin(h * e + 2) * 127 + 128)\r\n&gt;         f.b = math.floor(math.sin(h * e + 4) * 127 + 128)\r\n&gt;         return f\r\n&gt;     end\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     function Dt(text, x, y)\r\n&gt;         ..stuff\r\n&gt;     end\r\n\r\nA good information is : \r\nI succeed to do a good protection but it&#39;s very basic.... \r\nMost of cheats are using the same commands to be oppened. I just patched the shordcuts to acces them. Client get kick if they use them. \r\nMaybe it&#39;s a solution if better coded ? But, if player is in the chat or console it&#39;s no more working so I don&#39;t figure out how it&#39;s working when player is in this state. (Key disabled)\r\n\r\n**Why I&#39;m asking for help ?**\r\n\r\nI can assure I dev all my scripts, reworked all my downloaded scripts, find all other solutions, without any help.

Instead, he checks the price of his chosen model everyday and\r\n&gt; waits for the price to drop to an acceptable value.

If there is no record of the price on some of the\r\n&gt; previous five days (because Chef has not started checking the price on\r\n&gt; that day yet), then Chef simply ignores that previous day ― we could\r\n&gt; say that he considers the price on that day to be infinite.\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;Now, Chef is wondering ― on how many days has he considered the price to be good?

Basically, here is how I&#39;d like the application to work and wrote below so far:\r\n\r\n- You just enter your height in inches and enter weight in pounds.\r\n\r\n- The application will calculate your BMI, then tell you whether you are underweight, normal, obese, or overweight.\r\n\r\n- In case you enter a non-positive value for either height or weight, the program will show you an error message that &quot;Invalid input. Enter a positive number.&quot;, and it will highlight the boxes that you need to fix/enter a valid value.\r\n\r\n**I have encountered 2 problems.**\r\n\r\n- I can get the program to show the BMI result, but currently I don&#39;t know how to write to get the program to show whether the user is underweight, normal, obese, or overweight.\r\nIf BMI &lt; 18.5 then underweight, BMI &gt;= 18.5 and &lt;=24.99 then normal, BMI &gt; 25 and &lt;=29.99 then obese, and BMI &gt; 30 then overweight. \r\n\r\n\r\n- I would like to show the error (that tells user to enter positive values, not missing or negative values) as messages below the &quot;Calculate BMI&quot; button, not as an alert like &quot;This page says - Invalid input for weight, enter a non-negative number.&quot; In other words, I would like to keep the same message but not using &quot;alert&quot; method.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow may I fix these problems please?

I&#39;m unsure whether such a service exists. I&#39;m most familiar with Google Cloud Platform and this provides a wealth of compute and container services. However -- to your point -- these predominantly scale by (HTTP) requests.\r\n\r\nOne possibility may be [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) and to [trigger](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/events/pubsub-push) jobs using Cloud Pub/Sub. I see there&#39;s [async capabilities](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-http-target-tasks#http_target_tasks_with_authentication_tokens) too and this may be interesting (I&#39;ve not explored).\r\n\r\nAnother runtime for you to consider is Kubernetes itself. While Kubernetes requires some overhead in having Google, AWS or Azure manage a cluster for you (I strongly recommend you don&#39;t run Kubernetes yourself) and some inertia in the capacity of the cluster&#39;s nodes vs. the needs of your jobs, as you scale the number of jobs, you will smooth these needs. A big advantage with Kubernetes is that it will scale (nodes|pods) as you need them. You tell Kubernetes to run X container jobs, it does it (and cleans-up) without much additional management on your part.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m biased and approach the container vs image question mostly from a perspective of defaulting to container-first. In this case, you&#39;d receive several benefits from containerizing your solution:\r\n\r\n+ reproducible: the same image is more probable to produce the same results\r\n+ deployability: container run vs. manage OS, app stack, test for consistency etc.\r\n+ maintainable: smaller image representing your app, less work to maintain it\r\n\r\nOne (beneficial!?) workflow change if you choose to use containers is that you will need to build your images before using them. Something like Knative combines these steps but, I&#39;d stick with doing-this-yourself initially. A common solution is to trigger builds ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/), [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/categories/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions), [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build)) from your source code repo. Commonly you would run tests against the images that are built but you may also run your machine-learning tasks this way too.\r\n\r\nYour containers would container only your code. When you build your container images, you would `pip install`, perhaps `pip install --requirement requirements.txt` to pull the appropriate packages. Your data (models?) are better kept separate from your code when this makes sense. When your runtime platform runs containers for you, you provide configuration information (environment variables and|or flags) to the container.\r\n\r\nHTH!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260797/best-way-to-deploy-long-running-high-compute-app-to-gcp/58276896#58276896","title":"Best way to deploy long-running high-compute app to GCP"}],"owner":{"reputation":2030,"user_id":1747088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZWPt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1747088/james"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570481081,"creation_date":1570392026,"question_id":58260797,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260797","body_markdown":"I have a python app that builds a dataset for a machine learning task on GCP. \r\n\r\nCurrently I have to start an instance of a VM that we have, and then SSH in, and run the app, which will complete in 2-24 hours depending on the size of the dataset requested.\r\n\r\nOnce the dataset is complete the VM needs to be shutdown so we don&#39;t incur additional charges.\r\n\r\nI am looking to streamline this process as much as possible, so that we have a &quot;1 click&quot; or &quot;1 command&quot; solution, but I&#39;m not sure the best way to go about it.\r\n\r\nFrom what I&#39;ve read about so far it seems like containers might be a good way to go, but I&#39;m inexperienced with docker.\r\n\r\nCan I setup a container that will `pip install` the latest app from our private GitHub and execute the dataset build before shutting down?

than &quot;pure&quot; image processing, like Ander Biguri above, I&#39;d suggest maybe a different approach (actually two).\r\n\r\nThe concept here is to not rely on purely algorithmic image processing, but leverage the knowledge of the specifics of the situation you have:\r\n\r\n1) Given the container is metal (as you stated) another approach that might be a lot easier is just thresholding, based on the specific HU number for the metal frame.\r\n\r\nWhile you show the images as simple greyscale, in reality CT images are 16-bit images that are window levelled when viewed in a 256bit greyscale representation - so the pictures above are not a true representation of the full information available in the image data, which is actually 16 bit.\r\n\r\n**The metal frame would likely have a HU value that is significantly different to (higher than) anything within the anatomy.**  If that is the case, then a simple thresholding then subtraction would be a much simpler way to remove it.\r\n\r\n2) Another approach would also be based on considering the geometry and properties of the specific situation you have:\r\n\r\nIn the images above, you could look at a vertical profile upwards in the middle of your image (column-wise) to find the location of the frame - with the location being the point that vertical profile crosses into a HU value that matches the frame.\r\n\r\nFrom that point, you could use a flood fill approach (eg [scikit flood_fill][1]) to find all connected points within a certain tolerance.  \r\n\r\nThat also would give you a set of points (mask) matching the frame that you could use to remove it from the original image.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m thinking that either of these approaches would be both faster and more robust for the situation you&#39;re proposing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

am aiming to have all these waves animate identically, for performance reasons. This will help by reducing the cost of calculating wave paths, and to reduce the draw count.\r\n\r\nI have a scene in SpriteKit setup like so:\r\n\r\n[![Scene][1]][1]\r\n→ There is a link to an animating version [here][2].\r\n\r\nThe scene is mainly composed of 2 things:\r\n\r\n- Stones (the light and dark grey hexagons)\r\n- Waves (there are 2 per stone - a lighter and a darker blue animating path)\r\n\r\nThe waves are create like so:\r\n\r\n    // Wave outline shape node\r\n    shapeNode               = SKShapeNode(path: self.oldPath)\r\n    shapeNode.strokeColor   = wave.color\r\n    shapeNode.lineWidth     = 5\r\n    shapeNode.zPosition     = waveIndex == 0 ? Layer.farWave : Layer.nearWave\r\n    shapeNode.lineJoin      = .round\r\n    shapeNode.position      = stoneCell.node.position.offset(by: stoneCell.offsetVector)\r\n    view.scene?.addChild(shapeNode)\r\n    \r\n    // Layer which creates the animation\r\n    shapeLayer = CAShapeLayer()\r\n    shapeLayer.isHidden = true\r\n    view.layer.addSublayer(shapeLayer)\r\n\r\n    animate()\r\n\r\nAnd the `animate()` function:\r\n\r\n    /// Animates the wave&#39;s path. This method calls itself forever.\r\n    private func animate() {\r\n        let newPath = WavePath(wave: wave, direction: currentDirection).createPath()\r\n        \r\n        let anim = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: &quot;path&quot;)\r\n        anim.duration   = 2  // Duration of the wave movements in a direction (in or out)\r\n        anim.fromValue  = oldPath\r\n        anim.toValue    = newPath\r\n        anim.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeInEaseOut)\r\n        \r\n        shapeLayer.path = newPath\r\n        shapeLayer.add(anim, forKey: nil)\r\n        \r\n        shapeNode.run(SKAction.customAction(withDuration: anim.duration, actionBlock: { (node, timeDuration) in\r\n            (node as? SKShapeNode)?.path = self.shapeLayer.presentation()?.path\r\n        }), completion: {\r\n            self.oldPath = newPath\r\n            self.currentDirection.toggle()\r\n            self.animate()\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problems arise because there are 10 stones on the scene, which increases the performance cost. Is there a way to make this wave animation duplicated under all these stones?\r\n\r\nPossible options I can think of:\r\n\r\n- Convert the paths into a texture, which could be shared between multiple stones? However I think this would be slow to convert to a texture twice (for each wave) per frame, and then copy it over...\r\n\r\n- Rendering a full animation pass of the wave going in and then out, and then putting that on a loop for every node. But how?\r\n\r\nWhat other solutions may be better?\r\n\r\nI do **not** want to create an atlas and animate it. I cannot do this because these stones and waves change in size, depending on the screen size and level and I want them pixel-perfect. I do not mind however (as mentioned in bullet point two) of storing textures of an animation loop and then repeating that.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OqS8Sm.jpg\r\n  [2]:

The reasons that `EACCES` can be given when running an `exec` function on Linux are the following:\r\n\r\n* Search permission is denied on a component of the path.\r\n* The file or script interpreter isn&#39;t a regular file.\r\n* Execute permission is denied for the script or ELF interpreter.\r\n* The fileystem is mounted `noexec`.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the most likely problem is that you&#39;re working on a file system that is mounted `noexec`.  On some systems, `/tmp` is mounted `noexec`, and in some large installations (such as universities), `/home` is as well.  You should run `mount` (or your operating system&#39;s equivalent) to find out the mounted file systems and their mount options, and then pick a file system that isn&#39;t mounted `noexec`, assuming that&#39;s the case.\r\n\r\nThe other problem could be that the directory doesn&#39;t have search permissions, in which case you should look up the directory hierarchy and make sure the execute bit is set for each of those directories for your user, or to switch to a directory which does have those perimssions.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t really a Rust issue; you&#39;d likely have this with a C program as well.  The problem is almost certainly an issue with configuration or permissions on your system.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260773/hello-world-rust-program-compiles-but-execution-results-in-no-authorization-err/58261516#58261516","title":"Hello World Rust program compiles, but execution results in No authorization error"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":5282265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a87f1ceaded32808b904473d66238e05?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Monika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5282265/monika"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58261516,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570398711,"creation_date":1570391826,"question_id":58260773,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260773","body_markdown":"I have just started with the Rust book.

can definitely give your customers an opportunity to upload images, which on its own is fairly straightforward but often complicated by Shopify themes.\r\n\r\nIf you use a field with a `type=&quot;input&quot;` and a name with `name=&quot;properties[some custom property name]&quot;` you can upload images with a proper form submit. If you&#39;re already familiar with how to add custom line-item properties, this structure should look fairly familiar.  If your form *is* submitting normally but you are still not seeing your upload, make sure that the `form` tag has `enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;` set.\r\n\r\nHowever, where things get tricky is when themes jump in to do all kinds of fancy things.  If your theme keeps you on the product page when you hit the &#39;add-to-cart&#39; button, your theme is using Shopify&#39;s API endpoints to add products using Javascript rather than a normal HTML `POST` of the form.  Every theme that I have seen that implements this type of feature does so in an incomplete way, which is to use something similar to `data = jQuery(form).serialize()` to get a text string representing all of the user selections in the form - but a file upload field cannot be `serialize`&#39;d in this way, so it will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to get around this common theme limitation:\r\n\r\n1) Turn off or otherwise disable the javascript-based add-to-cart feature on your store.  In some themes, this can be done by going to your theme&#39;s customization page in the admin - usually the feature can be turned off in the settings under the &#39;Cart&#39; or &#39;Product&#39; header by specifying that you want customers to go to the Cart page after a product add.  (Exactly how it&#39;s sorted or what the wording will be is entirely under the control of the theme designer - if you&#39;re having trouble finding it, you should be able to reach out to the theme provider for assistance)\r\n\r\n2) If you are comfortable with a bit of coding, you can customize your theme to still do the fancy stay-on-page product additions by making just a few changes to the code.  Instead of using a `.serialize()` function (or similar) to get the data, you would instead use a `FormData` object. If using jQuery to post the data, you will need to specify a few additional options to stop jQuery from doing too much. Specifically, you will need to set  `processData: false, contentType: false` in your AJAX settings object.  If using Fetch or a plain ol&#39; XHR request, just remember that your `Content-type` is `multipart/form-data`.\r\n\r\nNote: If using method #2 to upgrade your theme&#39;s add-to-cart function, at present this will cause Shopify&#39;s built-in tracking code (&quot;Trekkie&quot;) to fail on cart-additions.  Trekkie hijacks the browser&#39;s native `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send` function to wrap it with some tracking code, and that tracking code assumes that anything being `post`ed is a JSON object/serialized form. \r\n\r\n**References:**\r\nForm enctypes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/enctype\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing FormData objects: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData\r\n\r\nUsing FormData with jQuery: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5976031/2592369 (Note: You have an existing form, see the part on &quot;Create FormData from an existing form&quot;\r\n\r\nProduct customizations: https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/customization/products/features/get-customization-information-for-products#allow-file-uploads (Note: The Shopify article claims that popup/drawer carts are not compatible with file uploads - this is only partially true, as theme developers _could_ design their themes to have such compatibility - they just choose not to)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260731/upload-image-field-on-product-page-of-shopify-theme/58271610#58271610","title":"upload image field on product page of shopify theme"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":6945970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1843819342501169/picture?type=large","display_name":"Towhidul Islam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6945970/towhidul-islam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1320,"user_id":2592369,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0ee53d225f9899dad2bd22bcd76b8ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2592369/dave-b"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570631651,"creation_date":1570391472,"last_edit_date":1570482140,"question_id":58260731,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260731","body_markdown":"I want to add a field for my customers to upload an image when they will purchase a product or add to cart a product.
