I want to make drums-like app but i have sound delay. Maybe someone tried some other package(s) and did some magic, I used react-native-sound and react-native-video since they are most popular and not outdated like others. This is code sample:\r\n\r\n    new Sound(`${filename}.mp3`, Sound.MAIN_BUNDLE, error =&gt; {\r\n      if (error) {\r\n        return;\r\n      } else {\r\n        audio.play(() =&gt; {\r\n          audio.release();\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n \r\nThere are other libraries, maybe outdated, but i am looking for any input to make it better, we did handler with onPressIn to make it slightly faster but still big delay:\r\n\r\n    &lt;TouchableOpacity onPressIn={handleOpenPress}&gt;\r\n\r\nIf this fails I will try to make another library, but I fear it will have the same delay. For some reason this repo works very fast: https://github.com/dwicao/react-native-drum-kit. I used same code and made even a list with prepared sounds to be used like soundList[i++ % 10].play() but still no effect.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525053/react-native-sound-delay-issue","title":"React-native sound delay issue"},{"tags":["mongodb"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12263687,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92cc0f27da04985ebaf2d36b429265bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sayeed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12263687/sayeed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571840712,"post_id":58525052,"comment_id":103375023,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525052/how-to-achieve-this-query-in-mongodb#comment103375023_58525052"},{"owner":{"reputation":228,"user_id":10690138,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qzy4Dpg0wB0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-hRPOPYeX5t-sSMnc5QTCVLQG767Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mahesh Bhatnagar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10690138/mahesh-bhatnagar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841744,"post_id":58525052,"comment_id":103375621,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525052/how-to-achieve-this-query-in-mongodb#comment103375621_58525052"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12263687,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92cc0f27da04985ebaf2d36b429265bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sayeed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12263687/sayeed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841919,"post_id":58525445,"comment_id":103375706,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525052/how-to-achieve-this-query-in-mongodb/58525445#comment103375706_58525445"},{"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":4649368,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10152539388586910/picture?type=large","display_name":"Okkano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4649368/okkano"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12263687,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92cc0f27da04985ebaf2d36b429265bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sayeed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12263687/sayeed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571842321,"post_id":58525445,"comment_id":103375912,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525052/how-to-achieve-this-query-in-mongodb/58525445#comment103375912_58525445"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":4649368,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10152539388586910/picture?type=large","display_name":"Okkano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4649368/okkano"},"last_editor":{"reputation":91,"user_id":4649368,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10152539388586910/picture?type=large","display_name":"Okkano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4649368/okkano"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571842056,"last_edit_date":1571842056,"creation_date":1571841779,"answer_id":58525445,"question_id":58525052,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58525445","body_markdown":"You can do this with [MongoDB Aggregation Framework][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is mongo shell command for you: \r\n\r\n    db.getCollection(&quot;myCollection&quot;).aggregate(\r\n        [\r\n            { \r\n                &quot;$match&quot;

Now when I call the same procedure in mysql workbench, then it works perfectly.\r\n\r\n Now I noticed when I tried inserting a record with a date inside it from my spring application, for example 2019-03-30 09:00:00, I get 2019-03-30 08:00:00 in my database, here is how I inserted the date:\r\n\r\n        \r\n```java\r\nprivate PatientAppointmentDTOR createPatientAppointmentDTOR() {\r\n\t\tPatientAppointmentDTOR dtor = factory.manufacturePojo(PatientAppointmentDTOR.class);\r\n\t\tdtor.setCpId(5L); // foreign keys...\r\n\t\tdtor.setBranchId(2L);\r\n\t\tdtor.setPtId(32L);\r\n\t\tdtor.setEmployeeId(55L);\r\n\t\tdtor.setInDepartmentId(7L);\r\n\t\tdtor.setPatientAppointmentStatusId(20L);\r\n\t\tCalendar cal1 = Calendar.getInstance();\r\n\t\tcal1.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2019);\r\n\t\tcal1.set(Calendar.MONTH, 2);\r\n\t\tcal1.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH,30);\r\n\t\tcal1.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 12);\r\n\t\tcal1.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0);\r\n\t\tcal1.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);\r\n\t\tcal1.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0);\r\n\t\tDate start = cal1.getTime();\r\n\t\tCalendar cal2 = Calendar.getInstance();\r\n\t\tcal2.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2019);\r\n\t\tcal2.set(Calendar.MONTH, 2);\r\n\t\tcal2.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH,30);\r\n\t\tcal2.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 12);\r\n\t\tcal2.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 30);\r\n\t\tcal2.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);\r\n\t\tcal2.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0);\r\n\t\tDate end = cal2.getTime();\r\n\t\tdtor.setStartTime(start);\r\n\t\tdtor.setEndTime(end);\r\n\t\tCompany company = companyService.getEntityById(5L);\r\n\t\tGroupDTOS gdtos = groupService.getDTOById(2L);\r\n\t\twhen(auth.userDetails())\r\n\t     .thenReturn(EntityFactory\r\n         .createUserDetails(DBStaticFields.Role.CLINIC_ADMIN, company, gdtos, factory));\r\n\t\treturn dtor;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then I just inserted this into my database using this JUnit test:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n\t@DisplayName(&quot;test insertion&quot;)\r\n\tvoid testInsert() {\r\n\t\tPatientAppointmentDTOR dtor = this.createPatientAppointmentDTOR();\r\n\t\tPatientAppointmentDTOS dtos = patientAppointmentService.insert(dtor);\r\n\t\tassertThat(dtos).isNotNull();\r\n\t\tassertThat(dtos.getId()).isNotNull();\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo yeah, when I insert these values from my application, startDate is 2019-03-30 11:00:00 and endDate is 2019-03-30 11:30:00 in my database.

For add price from checked checkboxes (if they are not too much checkboxes), create a check function to detect which of them are checked and then select the price of each and add them to each other, then put it to your price place. Something like:\r\n```js\r\nvar options = $(&quot;.option&quot;);\r\nvar options_price = [&#39;your&#39;, &#39;price&#39;, &#39;values&#39;, &#39;according&#39;, &#39;to&#39;, &#39;options&#39;, &#39;id&#39;];\r\nfunction optionsPrice() {\r\n    var total_price = 0;\r\n    options.each(function () {\r\n        var option = $(this);\r\n        if (option.is(&#39;:checked&#39;) &amp;&amp; option.val() != &#39;&#39; &amp;&amp; $.inArray(option.val(), Object.keys(options_price))) {\r\n                total_price += options_price[option.val()];\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return total_price;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCall **optionsPrice** function on any checkbox change.\r\n\r\nOR if you have a lot of checkeboxes on your page,\r\n\r\nyou can have a global total price variable and add or sub price from it on any checkbox change. Something like:\r\n```js\r\nvar total_price = 0;\r\n        var options = $(&quot;.option&quot;);\r\n        var options_price = [&#39;your&#39;, &#39;price&#39;, &#39;values&#39;, &#39;according&#39;, &#39;to&#39;, &#39;options&#39;, &#39;id&#39;];\r\n\r\nvar option, val;\r\noptions.on(&#39;change&#39;, function() {\r\n    option = $(this);\r\n    val = option.val();\r\n    if(val &amp;&amp; val != &#39;&#39; &amp;&amp; $.inArray(val, Object.keys(options_price)) !== -1) {\r\n        if(option.is(&#39;:checked&#39;)) {\r\n            total_price += options_price[option.val()];\r\n        } else {\r\n            if(total_price &gt; 0) {\r\n                total_price -= options_price[option.val()];\r\n            } else {\r\n                total_price = 0;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope it helps :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58524988/javascript-checkbox-that-adds-value-from-another-table-to-the-price/58527485#58527485","title":"Javascript checkbox that adds value from another table to the price"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5733,"user_id":6089612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KevYD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Don&#39;t Panic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6089612/dont-panic"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5733,"user_id":6089612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KevYD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Don&#39;t Panic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6089612/dont-panic"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571863684,"last_edit_date":1571863684,"creation_date":1571862536,"answer_id":58530551,"question_id":58524988,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58530551","body_markdown":"You&#39;ve got the tricky part - uniquely identifying your inputs in JS - already done.  All that is left is to sum them up!  \r\n\r\nThe simplest option is to iterate over all your inputs whenever one of them changes, and recalculate the price from scratch.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not 100% sure how your inputs and prices and extra costs work, but let&#39;s make it simple.  Here&#39;s some example HTML in the format your Blade template could generate:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div&gt;                       \r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;option&quot; id=&quot;option_1&quot; name=&quot;option_1&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; checked&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;option_price_1&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;Orange&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;1&lt;/label&gt; \r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;                       \r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;option&quot; id=&quot;option_2&quot; name=&quot;option_2&quot; value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;option_price_2&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;Apple&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;2&lt;/label&gt; \r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;                       \r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;option&quot; id=&quot;option_3&quot; name=&quot;option_3&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; checked&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; class=&quot;option_price_3&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;Pear&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;3&lt;/label&gt; \r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- I&#39;ve added a total area to display the total result --&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;total&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nNow taking your code, and using jQuery&#39;s `.each()` to iterate over all inputs on the page:\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;.option&#39;).change(function() {\r\n\r\n        var total = 0;\r\n\r\n        $(&#39;.option&#39;).each(function(index) {\r\n            // Process one option at a time.

That&#39;s trivially unimportant in this example, but it is good practice to get into so you won&#39;t get bitten by problems as your pages get more complex.\r\n\r\n3) It is good practice to separate your JS code into smaller chunks, so eg have a function that sums up the price, and a separate event handler which simply calls that when an option is changed.\r\n\r\nPutting all that together, here&#39;s updated code:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- Just one for example --&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;option&quot; id=&quot;option_1&quot; name=&quot;option_1&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; checked&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;option_price_1&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label for=&quot;option_1&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;1&lt;/label&gt; \r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd now the JS:\r\n\r\n    // Cache your selectors\r\n    var $options = $(&#39;.option&#39;),\r\n        $total = $(&#39;#total&#39;);\r\n\r\n    // Event handler, with callable function\r\n    $options.on(&#39;change&#39;, sumInputs);\r\n\r\n    function sumInputs() {\r\n        var id, id_number, hidden_input, price = 0;\r\n\r\n        $options.each(function(index) {\r\n            id = $(this).attr(&#39;id&#39;);\r\n            id_number = id.split(&quot;_&quot;)[1];\r\n            hidden_input = $(&quot;.option_price_&quot; + id_number).val();\r\n            if ($(this).prop(&#39;checked&#39;)) {\r\n                price += +hidden_input;\r\n            }\r\n            console.log(id, id_number, hidden_input, price);\r\n        });\r\n        $total.html(price);\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58524988/javascript-checkbox-that-adds-value-from-another-table-to-the-price/58530551#58530551","title":"Javascript checkbox that adds value from another table to the price"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11676748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77fbdf44f6d26a5be2ff926e82cd8a57?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sander105","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11676748/sander105"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5733,"user_id":6089612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KevYD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Don&#39;t Panic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6089612/dont-panic"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571863684,"creation_date":1571840406,"last_edit_date":1571859837,"question_id":58524988,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58524988","body_markdown":"Could anybody help me with this problem?

Is there a generalized preferred way of storing those dates so that they can serialize/deserialize without adding special code to each object that contains them?\r\n\r\nWe have been using the standard `JSON.stringify` / `JSON.parse` to do this, but since `LocalDate` converts to an ISO string when stringified, we lose its `LocalDate` type when we parse it back.\r\n\r\nAs demonstrated [here](https://runkit.com/bbernstein/5db053ff4d42bf00135259e3)\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the summary:\r\n```\r\nconst myObj = { a: &quot;thing&quot;, d: LocalDate.parse(&#39;2019-01-20&#39;) };\r\nconst stringified = JSON.stringify(myObj);\r\nconst parsed = JSON.parse(stringified);\r\n\r\n// this fails because d is no longer a LocalDate\r\nconsole.log(parsed.d.year());\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur workaround now is that we have custom deserializers for any class that contains a LocalDate, but it seems a little kludgy.\r\n\r\nSeeking a cleaner solution for this. Perhaps we could make a generalized serializer for LocalDate that outputs the same thing as the `%o` modifier in console.log?\r\n\r\n```\r\nmydate -&gt; serialize -&gt; &quot;LocalDate { _year: 2019, _month: 1, _day: 20}&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore we do that, I&#39;m looking to see if this has already been done cleanly or if I&#39;m just missing something obvious.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58524945/preferred-way-to-serialize-deserialize-js-joda-localdate","title":"Preferred way to serialize/deserialize js-joda LocalDate?"},{"tags":["python","bots","telegram","sendmessage"],"owner":{"reputation":380,"user_id":3420542,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cL34z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"xXJohnRamboXx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3420542/xxjohnramboxx"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571840254,"creation_date":1571840254,"question_id":58524942,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58524942","body_markdown":"Hi i have a telegram bot coded in python that return to the users some interactive button.\r\nSpecifically when user send e specific message the bot reply with a question followed by two button Yes or Not.\r\nIf user click on Yes button the bot should ask to the user inserting 2 parameter through the sendMessage function but currently it shows me only one.\r\n\r\nBelow the code:\r\n\r\n    def on_callback_query(msg):\r\n        query_id, chat_id, query_data = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=&#39;callback_query&#39;)\r\n        if query_data == &#39;Yes&#39;:\r\n            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, &#39;Insert name&#39;)\r\n            name = msg[&#39;text&#39;]\r\n            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, &#39;Insert last name&#39;);\r\n            lastName = msg[&#39;text&#39;]\r\n        elif query_data == &#39;No&#39;:\r\n            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, &#39;Already exists&#39;)\r\n\r\nCurrent situation: if the user click on &quot;Yes&quot; button the bot return to user &quot;Insert name&quot;, once inserted it the bot doesn&#39;t return &quot;Insert last name&quot;\r\n\r\nit seems like the code:\r\n\r\n    bot.sendMessage(chat_id, &#39;Insert last name&#39;);\r\n    lastName = msg[&#39;text&#39;]\r\nis ignored.\r\n\r\nWhat should i do to show both questions?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58524942/telegram-bot-python-send-multiple-message-to-user","title":"Telegram bot python send multiple message to user"},{"tags":["java","android","performance","android-studio","android-recyclerview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":95,"user_id":7174273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d029daad4d07e33b9cdf522828078aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shubham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7174273/shubham"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571870575,"post_id":58524941,"comment_id":103387439,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58524941/i-am-having-trouble-applying-searchview-with-recyclerview#comment103387439_58524941"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12036788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df08c9087018e073cbef2a1234f42e15?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"corgiwooer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12036788/corgiwooer"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571840253,"creation_date":1571840253,"question_id":58524941,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58524941","body_markdown":"I am trying to implement the SearchView from the support library.

access a static class member (including enum values) in your XAML, use the [x:Static](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/xaml-services/x-static-markup-extension) [markup extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/markup-extensions-and-wpf-xaml) as follows: `{x:Static nmspc:ClassName.MemberName}` (or `{x:Static nmspc:EnumTypeName.EnumValueName}` -- enum values are really static members of a static class). You get a namespace prefix, one class name optionally preceded by intermediate namespaces&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and one member name, and that&#39;s all it does. If you need a property of `MemberName`, make the static reference the Source of a Binding. A Binding can have a path to a property of a property:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Label \r\n        Content=&quot;{Binding conParam.ethPort, Source={x:Static config:AppConfig.ConnectionConfig)}&quot; \r\n        /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Say you have nmspc=Foo, which contains a namespace Bar, and a class MyClass in namespace Foo.Bar.Baz. This will work, but *only* in the case where Bar.Baz is a namespace contained within nmspc, and MyClass is a class within Bar.Baz.

can&#39;t return the handle from the constructor in that context because that would violate the defined behavior of [`new`][1]. `new SomeClass();` will only ever return an instance of the class, regardless of what other methods are called in the constructor.\r\n\r\n[`__construct()`][2] is a void method. It is not *intended* to return anything&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. That doesn&#39;t mean that the other code in it doesn&#39;t get executed, just that your `return` is disregarded in the context of creating a new object. This makes sense as the primary purpose for the constructor is to provide a means to pass dependencies to the object. Sometimes it is used to do additional initialization/setup of the object, but many people believe it should not do any work other than assigning the given arguments to the object&#39;s properties. Either way, there should be no need for it to return anything.\r\n\r\n---\r\n&lt;br&gt;  \r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; You *can* actually call the `__construct()` method explicitly *after* you create the object, and then it will behave like a normal method and your `return` will work.\r\n\r\n    $db = new HMMDatabaseHandle();\r\n    $dbh = $db-&gt;__construct();\r\n    var_dump($dbh);  // PDO Object\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t a normal thing to do though, and I can&#39;t think of a scenario where it would be useful or desirable.

How would you access any other methods that `HMMDatabaseHandle` provides?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhile I fully agree with @Don&#39;t Panic&#39;s answer, I need to also point out that you&#39;re mixing static and instance methods. \r\n\r\nAs a general rule of thumb, use the `static` keyword when you want to be able to call a method without instantiating the object first. If you want to actually create and use an *object*, then you can define you class like so and use `$this-&gt;` (or `$object-&gt;` if outside of the class) instead of `::` to access _instance_ properties and methods. \r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    class HMMDatabaseHandle\r\n    {\r\n        \r\n        private $configfile = &quot;config.json&quot;;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        public function __construct()\r\n        {\r\n            // You&#39;re not initializing anything in here, so this constructor is optional.\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public function create()\r\n        {\r\n            return $this-&gt;get_handle_admin();\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        private function get_handle_admin()\r\n        {\r\n            $config = json_decode(file_get_contents($this-&gt;configfile));\r\n            $dbhost = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbhost;\r\n            $dbname = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbname;\r\n            $dbuser = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbuser;\r\n            $dbpass = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbpass;\r\n            \r\n            try {\r\n                return new PDO(&quot;mysql:host=$dbhost;dbname=$dbname&quot;, $dbuser, $dbpass);\r\n            }\r\n            catch (PDOException $e) {\r\n                echo $e-&gt;getMessage();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo actually execute this, you need to now instantiate new class. \r\n\r\n    $dbManager = new HMMDatabaseHandle();\r\n    $handle = $dbManager-&gt;create();\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a trick you can employ to make your constructor *chainable*.

My attempt at returning the handle directly from a constructor fails. But succeeds from either a class method or from a class(?) method after an instance has been created. Here&#39;s the class definition and the sample script\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nclass HMMDatabaseHandle {\r\n\r\n        private static $configfile = &quot;config.json&quot;;\r\n\r\n// uncomment for test 1\r\n//      public function __construct () {\r\n//              return self::get_handle_admin();\r\n//      }\r\n\r\n        public static function create() {\r\n                return self::get_handle_admin();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static function get_handle_admin() {\r\n                $config = json_decode(file_get_contents(self::$configfile));\r\n                $dbhost = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbhost;\r\n                $dbname = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbname;\r\n                $dbuser = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbuser;\r\n                $dbpass = $config-&gt;database-&gt;dbpass;\r\n\r\n                try {\r\n                        return new PDO(&quot;mysql:host=$dbhost;dbname=$dbname&quot;, $dbuser, $dbpass);\r\n                }\r\n                        catch(PDOException $e) {\r\n                        echo $e-&gt;getMessage();\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n\r\n?&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is the test script I&#39;m using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\nrequire_once &#39;HMMDatabaseHandle.php&#39;;\r\n\r\n// Test 1 - fails (uncomment constructor func) at call to prepare() with:\r\n// PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method HMMDatabaseHandle::prepare()\r\n//$dbh = new HMMDatabaseHandle();\r\n\r\n// Test 2 - works when class creates default constructor\r\n// i.e. no explicit __construct() func\r\n// Fetching data from executed query is fine\r\n//$db = new HMMDatabaseHandle();\r\n//$dbh = $db-&gt;create();\r\n\r\n// Works using static class methods rather than instance\r\n$dbh = HMMDatabaseHandle::create();\r\n\r\n$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&#39;select data_title,track_id from master&#39;);\r\n$sth-&gt;execute();\r\nwhile($row = $sth-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n1. Why can&#39;t I return the handle directly from a constructor when it seems so similar to calling the class method directly? Why does it matter whether the constructor calls the class method or my script calls it?\r\n\r\n2. If I create an instance with PHP&#39;s default constructor, am I really calling a class method with $db-&gt;create()?\r\n\r\nI seem to be missing some fundamental concept here.

can use `break` to break out of a loop or switch, but you cannot break out of a simple block like this. \r\n\r\nThere are ways to achieve this, for example using `goto` or artificial `while` loop, but it definitely sounds like a code smell. \r\n\r\nYou can achieve what you want using **simple condition** which will make your intention much more clear. \r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n    DoSomething();\r\n    if (a == 1) // conditional break\r\n    {\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n    DoSomethingElse();\r\n    break; // unconditional break (why though)\r\n    UnreachableCode(); // will

This can tell us where the original 1&#39;s matrix was and the size of the matrix relatively to the size of the original matrix can tell us how large it was. In our case it&#39;s top left in 3x3 so originally it was a 3x3 matrix at the top left.\r\n\r\nThe action we are performing is actually a convolution with 2x2 matrix of 1&#39;s and than rounding down. A Lot of programing languages have a library with this functionality.\r\n\r\nThe time complexity for a single convolution is `O(n^2)`, but we are performing this `n` times so the time complexity is `O(n^3)`.\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n\r\n    Matrix is 5x5 [ 0 1 1 1 1\r\n                    0 1 1 1 1\r\n                    1 1 1 1 1\r\n                    1 1 1 1 1\r\n                    1 0 1 0 1 ] \r\n    \r\n    Matrix is 4x4 [ 0 1 1 1\r\n                    0 1 1 1\r\n                    1 1 1 1\r\n                    0 0 0 0 ] \r\n    \r\n    Matrix is 3x3 [ 0 1 1\r\n                    0 1 1\r\n                    0 0 0 ] \r\n    \r\n    Matrix is 2x2 [ 0 1\r\n                    0 0 ]\r\n    \r\n    Matrix is 1x1 [ 0 ]\r\n\r\nSo the top right in the 2x2 is the last left which mean the original was top right 4x4.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58524874/finding-biggest-square-sub-matrix-has-values-1-in-a-matrix-which-has-values-1-an/58525612#58525612","title":"Finding biggest square sub matrix has values 1 in a Matrix which has values 1 and 0"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":1867626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f78eba402fa2c901f0f8750250e7f68f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SadViolinMan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1867626/sadviolinman"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571842720,"creation_date":1571840034,"question_id":58524874,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58524874","body_markdown":"i have axb matrix has values 1 or 0, I need to find the largest square sub matrix includes only ones.

not familiar with the collections module, but it&#39;s really easy to achieve using old-school, plain Python.\r\n\r\nSupposing we have your list of dictionaries stored in a variable called `raw_dicts`. Allow me to suggest parsing it into a more convenient data structure for our task:\r\n\r\n    parsed_dict = dict()\r\n    for dictionary in raw_dicts:\r\n        bet = dictionary[&#39;Bet&#39;]\r\n        if bet not in parsed_dict.keys():\r\n    \t    parsed_dict[bet] = dict()\r\n        if dictionary[&#39;Home Team&#39;] not in parsed_dict[bet].keys():\r\n    \t    parsed_dict[bet][dictionary[&#39;Home Team&#39;]] = 0\r\n        parsed_dict[bet][dictionary[&#39;Home Team&#39;]] += 1\r\n\r\nWhat I did here is creating a counter for each bet-team pair. We get this beautiful dictionary:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;Over 2.5 Goals&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;AFC Wimbledon&quot;: 1\r\n        }, \r\n        &quot;Home Win&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;Man United&quot;: 1\r\n        }, \r\n        &quot;BTTS&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;Everton&quot;: 4, \r\n            &quot;Arsenal&quot;: 2\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nNow that we have such a nice dictionary, all we&#39;re left with is a simple maximization problem, whose solution is by the textbook:\r\n\r\n    most_frequent_bet = &quot;&quot;\r\n    most_frequent_team = &quot;&quot;\r\n    highest_frequency = 0\r\n    for bet in parsed_dict.keys():\r\n        for team in parsed_dict[bet].keys():\r\n\t        if parsed_dict[bet][team] &gt; highest_frequency:\r\n        \t    most_frequent_bet = bet\r\n\t            most_frequent_team = team\r\n\r\nThis could have been achieved by any number of other methods, some a lot more elegant and short than mine.

left this as a comment, but since it might not be clear, I&#39;ll post my answer in code...\r\n\r\nAs stated in my comment, there&#39;s no point allocating a pointer array - on a 64 bit machine, that would be 6 pointers, each requiring 8 bytes to point at a 7 byte long data block - **a total of 104 bytes** (ignoring the added allocator padding per allocation).\r\n\r\nInstead, **a single allocation could suffice, allocating 42 bytes** to contain all the &quot;wave&quot; strings and their NUL byte in a single block of memory (saving memory while improving locality).\r\n\r\n\r\n    int main(void) {\r\n      /* Assuming string &quot;hello&quot; */\r\n      const char *org = &quot;hello&quot;;\r\n      /* Calculate length only once and store value */\r\n      const size_t len = strlen(org);\r\n      const size_t len_with_nul = len + 1;\r\n      /* Allocate `len` strings in a single allocation */\r\n      char *buf = malloc(len * len_with_nul);\r\n      /* Copy each string to it&#39;s place in the buffer */\r\n      for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; len; ++i) {\r\n        /* position in the buffer */\r\n        char *pos = buf + (i * len_with_nul);\r\n        /* copy the NUL as well */\r\n        memcpy(pos, org, len_with_nul); \r\n        /* Wave... */\r\n        pos[i] = toupper(pos[i]);\r\n      }\r\n      /* Print result */\r\n      for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\r\n        char *pos = buf + (i * len_with_nul);\r\n        printf(&quot;s = %s\\n&quot;, pos);\r\n      }\r\n      /* Free buffer */\r\n      free(buf);\r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**EDIT - Why is using a single memory block better?**:\r\n\r\nIn this case we allocate a single memory &quot;block&quot; (blob / slice). This offers a number of advantages:\r\n\r\n* We perform a single allocation and deallocation instead of a larger number of allocations and deallocations.\r\n\r\n    This improves speed by performing less actions.\r\n\r\n* We also improve memory locality, [which minimizes CPU cache misses and improves performance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1126529/what-is-the-cost-of-an-l1-cache-miss).\r\n\r\n* We use less memory.\r\n\r\n    Each memory allocation comes with a price - we need a pointer to hold the memory address for the memory we allocated. A pointer &quot;costs&quot; 8 bytes on a 64bit machine and 4 bytes on a 32bit machine.\r\n\r\n    By using a single allocation, we &quot;pay&quot; less.\r\n\r\n    This is true even if we ignore the metadata attached to the memory block allocated (which requires memory from the memory allocator).\r\n\r\nI should note that C doesn&#39;t really care about the contents of a memory block, **it&#39;s all zeros and ones**. The meaning given to these zeros and ones is left to the developer.\r\n\r\nEven the `printf` function doesn&#39;t care about the contents of the memory it&#39;s reading - it simply reads the memory according to the formatting it was instructed to follow by the developer (the `%s` informs the function that the memory relates to a NUL terminated string).\r\n\r\nThere are some concerns about memory alignment which are CPU and system specific - but these don&#39;t apply to single byte strings.

In other words, I would like, for every column of this dataset to get one row that has the minimum value on that column, as well as another that has the maximum value on the same column. I should mention that I do not know in advance what columns this dataset will have. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n```\r\n+----+----+----+     +----+----+----+\r\n|Col1|Col2|Col3| ==&gt; |Col1|Col2|Col3|\r\n+----+----+----+     +----+----+----+\r\n| F  | 99 | 17 |     | A  | 34 | 25 |\r\n| M  | 32 | 20 |     | Z  | 51 | 49 |\r\n| D  |  2 | 84 |     | D  |  2 | 84 |\r\n| H  | 67 | 90 |     | F  | 99 | 17 |\r\n| P  | 54 | 75 |     | C  | 18 |  9 |\r\n| C  | 18 |  9 |     | H  | 67 | 90 |\r\n| Z  | 51 | 49 |     +----+----+----+\r\n| A  | 34 | 25 |\r\n+----+----+----+\r\n```\r\nThe first row is selected because A is the smallest value on Col1. The second because Z is the largest value on Col1. The third because 2 is the smallest on Col2, and so on. The code below seems to do the right thing (correct me if I&#39;m wrong), but performance is sloooow. I start with getting a dataframe from a random .csv file:\r\n```\r\ninput_file = (sqlContext.read\r\n    .format(&quot;csv&quot;)\r\n    .options(header=&quot;true&quot;, inferSchema=&quot;true&quot;, delimiter=&quot;;&quot;, charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;)\r\n    .load(&quot;/FileStore/tables/random.csv&quot;)\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThen I create two other dataframes that each have one row with the min and respectively, max values of each column:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, min, max\r\n\r\nmin_values = input_file.select(\r\n    *[min(col(col_name)).name(col_name) for col_name in input_file.columns]\r\n)\r\n\r\nmax_values = input_file.select(\r\n    *[max(col(col_name)).name(col_name) for col_name in input_file.columns]\r\n)\r\n```\r\nFinally, I repeatedly join the original input file to these two dataframes holding minimum and maximum values, using every column in turn, and do a union between all the results.\r\n```\r\nmin_max_rows = (\r\n  input_file\r\n    .join(min_values, input_file[input_file.columns[0]] == min_values[input_file.columns[0]])\r\n    .select(input_file[&quot;*&quot;]).limit(1)\r\n    .union(\r\n      input_file\r\n        .join(max_values, input_file[input_file.columns[0]] == max_values[input_file.columns[0]])\r\n        .select(input_file[&quot;*&quot;]).limit(1)\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\nfor c in input_file.columns[1:]:\r\n  min_max_rows = min_max_rows.union(\r\n    input_file\r\n      .join(min_values, input_file[c] == min_values[c])\r\n      .select(input_file[&quot;*&quot;]).limit(1)\r\n      .union(\r\n        input_file\r\n          .join(max_values, input_file[c] == max_values[c])\r\n          .select(input_file[&quot;*&quot;]).limit(1)\r\n      )\r\n  )\r\n\r\nmin_max_rows.dropDuplicates()\r\n```\r\nFor my test dataset of 500k rows, 40 columns, doing all this takes about 7-8 minutes on a standard Databricks cluster. I&#39;m supposed to sift through more than 20 times this amount of data regularly. Is there any way to optimize this code? I&#39;m quite afraid I&#39;ve taken the naive approach to it, since I&#39;m quite new to Spark.\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58524846/how-do-i-get-one-row-for-every-min-and-max-on-every-column-of-a-dataframe-in-pys","title":"How do I get one row for every min and max on every column of a dataframe in Pyspark efficiently?"},{"tags":["python","pandas","jupyter","modularity"],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":10305949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc7bda64c54c86161ffd225d39e2560?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Keyvan Tajbakhsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10305949/keyvan-tajbakhsh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":30,"user_id":10305949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc7bda64c54c86161ffd225d39e2560?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Keyvan Tajbakhsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10305949/keyvan-tajbakhsh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571843504,"creation_date":1571839935,"last_edit_date":1571843504,"question_id":58524845,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58524845","body_markdown":"Here is the code that print out the data.
