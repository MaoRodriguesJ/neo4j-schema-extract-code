every date.\r\n&#39;&#39;&#39;\r\nwith Dates as (\r\n   select date\r\n   from SomeTable\r\n   group by date\r\n),\r\nProducts as (\r\n   select productId\r\n   from SomeTable\r\n   group by productId\r\n)\r\nselect Dates.date, Products.productId\r\nfrom Dates cross join Products\r\n&#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n\r\nThen I attempted do a right outer join to reduce this to just the missing records:\r\n```\r\nwith Records as (\r\nselect date, productId, count(*) as views\r\nfrom SomeTable\r\ngroup by date, productId\r\n),\r\nCartesian as (\r\n{See query above}\r\n)\r\nSelect Cartesian.date, Cartesian.productId, 0 as views #for upcoming union\r\nfrom Cartesian right outer join Records \r\non Cartesian.date = Records.date \r\nwhere Records.productId is null\r\n```\r\nThen with the missing rows in hand, union them back onto the Records.\r\nin doing so, I create a new problem: extra rows.\r\n```\r\ndate      |  productId |   views\r\nJuly 1    |  A         |   8\r\nJuly 1    |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 1    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 2    |  A         |   6\r\nJuly 2    |  B         |   4\r\nJuly 2    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 3    |  A         |   2\r\nJuly 3    |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 3    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 4    |  A         |   8\r\nJuly 4    |  B         |   6\r\nJuly 4    |  C         |   4\r\nJuly 5    |  A         |   2\r\nJuly 5    |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 5    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 6    |  A         |   0\r\nJuly 6    |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 6    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 7    |  A         |   0\r\nJuly 7    |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 7    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 8    |  A         |   0\r\nJuly 8    |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 8    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 9    |  A         |   0\r\nJuly 9    |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 9    |  C         |   0\r\nJuly 10   |  A         |   17\r\nJuly 10   |  B         |   0\r\nJuly 10   |  C         |   0\r\n```\r\nAnd when I run my simple query\r\n```select date, count(distinct productId) as Inventory, sum(views) as views```\r\non that table I get the wrong output again:\r\n```\r\ndate      |  Inventory |   views\r\nJuly 1    |  3         |   8\r\nJuly 2    |  3         |   10\r\nJuly 3    |  3         |   2\r\nJuly 4    |  3         |   18\r\nJuly 5    |  3         |   2\r\nJuly 6    |  3         |   0\r\nJuly 7    |  3         |   0\r\nJuly 8    |  3         |   0\r\nJuly 9    |  3         |   0\r\nJuly 10   |  3         |   17\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy next thought would be to iterate through each productId, determine it&#39;s first &amp; last date, then Union that with the Cartesian table with the condition that the Cartesian.date falls between the first &amp; last date for each specific product. &lt;br&gt;\r\nThere&#39;s got to be an easier way to do this.

Could it be implementation-specific?\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nAfter an initial handshake over HTTP, Websockets send their data over a TCP/IP connection.\r\n\r\nMy assumptions regarding TCP Connections:\r\n\r\n- For a specific TCP connection on a given port, the connection makes the guarantee that all packets sent by the a sender through it will be received by the receiver, and will do so in order. It is a reliable ordered connection.\r\n\r\n- This means if two packets are sent over a TCP connection by the sender and the first one does not arrive within a given timeout, the second one is delayed until the first one has been successfully retransmitted by the sender. As far as the receiver is concerned, they always see packet one, then two.\r\n\r\n- If you create two separate TCP connections on two separate ports, then packets lost on one connection naturally have no impact on packets on the other connection. The reliable ordered guarantee only applies to the packets within one TCP connection, not all of them.\r\n\r\nSince an active websocket connection runs on top of a TCP connection, are there any assumptions we can make when we open multiple parallel websocket connections between the same client and server?\r\n\r\nIf I have a websocket javascript client opening two or more websocket connections to the same server, does the underlying implementation use only a single TCP connection?\r\n\r\nIs there a chance that this may be implementation-specific, or is it simply _guaranteed_ that for a given websocket server all connections will occur on the same underlying TCP connection?\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n# Context\r\n\r\nThe context here is a networked multiplayer game in the browser, where the desired behavior would be to have multiple parallel data streams where any timeout or latency on one stream has no impact on the packets sent on the others.\r\n\r\nOf course when low latency is desirable for multiplayer games you generally want to use UDP instead of TCP, but there is no real cross-browser, well supported option currently for that that I am aware of. In an environment where UDP sockets are an option you would implement your own data streams with varying reliability/order guarantees on top of UDP.\r\n\r\nHowever UDP-like low latency when it comes to one packet not blocking another *can* be achieved by guaranteeing that a TCP connection only ever has one packet in flight, and using more connections to allow in-parallel packets ([source][1]). Naturally that loses out on some optimizations, but may be desirable if latency is the primary variable being optimized for.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

VERSION:\r\n\r\nHave a bunch of apps I work on regularly, some of which are published to the app store.   Recently updated flutter and android studio and now everything is completely broken to the point none of my apps will even run any more.\r\n\r\nLONG VERSION:\r\n\r\nI have been working on this problem full time for this entire week, without any success so far.  I have tried countless suggestions of people having similar issues in forums, I have done everything suggested to me in any discussion threads.  I have made progress of a kind, because whereas previously even the base vanilla application you are given when you create a new project would die when you add any plugins to it, I have got past this now to my latest issue:\r\n\r\nAt the moment it seems to try and run an application to my device, the application seems to build successfully and run, but immediately closes on the phone.

working on a project which requires sending HTTP POST calls to a REST API, I noticed something strange (at least for me) today. First I tested the below code in a console application and it works every time.\r\n\r\n    static HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\r\n    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(&quot;Basic&quot;, MY_BASE64_STRING);\r\n    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(&quot;https://api-test.wirecard.com&quot;);\r\n    HttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, &quot;/engine/rest/payments&quot;);\r\n    request.Content = new StringContent(JSON_REQUEST_STRING, Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n    HttpResponseMessage response = client.SendAsync(request).Result;\r\n    string responseString = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;\r\n\r\nBut when I put the same code in my web application and test it, it is giving me *The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.* error, with the exact same code and request JSON. After setting the security protocol, it works. The updated code looks like this:\r\n\r\n    static HttpClient client = new HttpClient();    \r\n    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(&quot;https://api-test.wirecard.com&quot;);\r\n    HttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, &quot;/engine/rest/payments&quot;);\r\n    request.Content = new StringContent(JSON_REQUEST_STRING, Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(&quot;Basic&quot;, MY_BASE64_STRING);\r\n    ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls | SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12; //* new line\r\n    HttpResponseMessage response = client.SendAsync(request).Result;\r\n    string responseString = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what just happened here. I am trying to get the concept behind this. **The 1st code snippet works fine in a console application but not in my web application**. The 2nd works everywhere. Why the console application works without setting Security Protocol.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nI ran both of them on the same environment and machine using Visual Studio 2019 and .NET Framework.

However, I would like the graph to always start at zero and increase from there. The use-case is that I want to visualize my data usage over the course of a month to see how quickly I am approaching my data cap. (I already create a gauge object using `increase(ifHCInOctets{...}[$__range])` function which shows me how much I have used in total over the given time range, but I&#39;d like to be able to visualize that usage over time.)\r\n\r\nBasically, I want `ifHCInOctets{...} - X` where `X` is the value of ifHCInOctets at the start of the range. My first thought was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nifHCInOctets{...} - ifHCInOctets{...} offset $__range\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that seems to show me each data point minus the data point `$__range` time prior to it (rather than just subtracting the starting value from all points).\r\n\r\nI then tried creating a query variable with the query `query_result(ifHCInOctets{...} offset $__range)` and setting it to update on time range change. This almost seemed to work, but the resulting graph always seemed to start slightly negative, depending on the time range selected, which made me think it wasn&#39;t doing what I thought it was.\r\n\r\nI have also tried various forms of `sum`, `sum_over_time`, and `increase`, all to no avail.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404090/graph-a-counter-from-zero-in-prometheus-graphana","title":"Graph a counter from zero in prometheus/graphana"},{"tags":["c++"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2886,"user_id":2516916,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90d670e62ae35e180ad6e939443cab62?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gillespie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2516916/gillespie"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1571184749,"post_id":58404083,"comment_id":103153085,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404083/eliminate-comma-after-the-last-item-in-an-array-for-c#comment103153085_58404083"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1457,"user_id":1545658,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":30,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8184a1f0d5a54654d20831407acbe3d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"acegs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1545658/acegs"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571185255,"creation_date":1571185255,"answer_id":58404138,"question_id":58404083,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404138","body_markdown":"Since you&#39;re using a loop with incremented integer, this version of solution is simple and fast.\r\n\r\n    if(0 &lt; NUM_VALS ) cout &lt;&lt; hourlyTemp[0];\r\n    \r\n    for (i = 1; i &lt; NUM_VALS; i++) {\r\n       cout &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; hourlyTemp[i];  \r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404083/eliminate-comma-after-the-last-item-in-an-array-for-c/58404138#58404138","title":"Eliminate comma after the last item in an array for c++"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12151392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2411984532249127/picture?type=large","display_name":"Samantha Freeland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12151392/samantha-freeland"},"last_editor":{"reputation":133577,"user_id":2684539,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5fff6fb65e95570ad1a90fe1e3522e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jarod42","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2684539/jarod42"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571188011,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571188117,"creation_date":1571184609,"last_edit_date":1571188117,"question_id":58404083,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404083","body_markdown":"I have a for loop that prints a comma and a space after each item in a list.

Couple of notes: `sizeof(char)` is always `1` -- just use `1`. Further, there is no need to cast the return of `malloc`, it is unnecessary. See: [Do I cast the result of malloc?](http://stackoverflow.com/q/605845/995714). Additionally, how many times do you call `strlen(str)`? (hopefully optimization limits the loop condition to a single call, but you could potentially be calling `strlen(str)` for every iteration). Same with `endOfString = (i+1)==strlen(str)`. Save the length of the string before entering the loop and then just use the saved value to compare against.\r\n\r\nWhile you can count indexes as you have and loop character-by-character looking for delimiters, it is far more efficient to let `strchr (pointer, &#39;|&#39;)` advance to the next delimiter (or return `NULL` indicating no more delimiters remain). Then rather than worrying about indexes, simply keep a pointer `p` and end-pointer `ep` to advance down the string, e.g.\r\n\r\n    #define NFIELDS 20\r\n    ...\r\n    char **splitstr (const char *s, const char delim, size_t *n)\r\n    {\r\n        const char  *p = s,     /* pointer for parsing */\r\n                    *ep = s;    /* end pointer for parsing */\r\n        *n = 0;                                 /* zero string counter */\r\n        while (*n &lt; NFIELDS &amp;&amp; *p) {            /* loop while less than NFIELDS */\r\n            size_t len;\r\n            if ((ep = strchr (p, delim)))       /* get pointer to delim */\r\n                len = ep - p;\r\n            else\r\n                len = strlen (p);               /* or get length of final string */\r\n            if (!(output[*n] = malloc (len + 1))) { /* allocated for string */\r\n            ...\r\n            memcpy (output[*n], p, len);        /* copy chars to output[n] */\r\n            output[(*n)++][len] = 0;            /* nul-terminate to make string */\r\n            if (!ep)                            /* if delim not found, last */\r\n                break;\r\n            p = ++ep;                           /* update p to 1-past delim */\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n\r\nAdding appropriate error checking and returning the pointer to the allocated strings, you could do:\r\n\r\n    char **splitstr (const char *s, const char delim, size_t *n)\r\n    {\r\n        const char  *p = s,     /* pointer for parsing */\r\n                    *ep = s;

Also, after researching, I keep seeing that it&#39;s not a good idea to use regular middleware, as running any code on the client-side exposes the env variable... But I&#39;m confused.

Since Angular uses component based concept, you will need to create a tree of components from a root component for you to use multiple templates.

HTTP status code for the `MethodNotAllowedHttpException` is `405`\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/symfony/http-kernel/blob/master/Exception/MethodNotAllowedHttpException.php#L29)\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function __construct(array $allow, string $message = null, \\Throwable $previous = null, ?int $code = 0, array $headers = [])\r\n{\r\n    $headers[&#39;Allow&#39;] = strtoupper(implode(&#39;, &#39;, $allow));\r\n    parent::__construct(405, $message, $previous, $headers, $code);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA `TokenMismatchException` HTTP status code is `419`\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/1bbe5528568555d597582fdbec73e31f8a818dbc/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Exceptions/Handler.php#L208)\r\n\r\n```php\r\nprotected function prepareException(Exception $e)\r\n{\r\n    if ($e instanceof ModelNotFoundException) {\r\n        $e = new NotFoundHttpException($e-&gt;getMessage(), $e);\r\n    } elseif ($e instanceof AuthorizationException) {\r\n        $e = new AccessDeniedHttpException($e-&gt;getMessage(), $e);\r\n    } elseif ($e instanceof TokenMismatchException) {\r\n        // HTTP Status code is send in the header here\r\n        $e = new HttpException(419, $e-&gt;getMessage(), $e);\r\n    } elseif ($e instanceof SuspiciousOperationException) {\r\n        $e = new NotFoundHttpException(&#39;Bad hostname provided.&#39;, $e);\r\n    }\r\n    return $e;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this appears to be a CSRF token issue\r\n\r\nMake sure that you have a meta tag on the head of your document like this\r\n```html\r\n&lt;meta name=&quot;csrf-token&quot; content=&quot;{{ csrf_token() }}&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso from the [JQuery Ajax Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings)\r\n\r\nI think that the HTTP method should be defined as `method` parameter not `type` (though `type` works &#175;\\\\_(ツ)_/&#175;)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Send a CSRF token header with every Ajax request\r\n$.ajaxSetup({\r\n    headers: {\r\n        &#39;X-CSRF-TOKEN&#39;: $(&#39;meta[name=&quot;csrf-token&quot;]&#39;).attr(&#39;content&#39;)\r\n    }\r\n});\r\nfunction fillEmployeeData(emp_id) {\r\n    var emp_selected = emp_id.value;\r\n    $.ajax({\r\n        method: &quot;POST&quot;,\r\n        url: &quot;{{ route(&#39;adminAreaPostEmployee&#39;) }}&quot;,\r\n        data: &#39;emp_selected=&#39; + emp_selected,\r\n        success: function (data) {\r\n            var emp_data = JSON.parse(data);\r\n            alert(emp_data);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\nBut now you&#39;re gonna get an error\r\n&gt; Object of class Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Builder could not be converted to string\r\n\r\nBecause you&#39;re trying to return a query builder instance `User::where(&#39;id&#39;, $select)`&#160;instead of the user record itself serialized\r\n\r\nI think you may want to do this\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function post_employee(Request $request)\r\n{\r\n    $select = $request-&gt;get(&#39;emp_selected&#39;);\r\n    return User::find($select);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHope this

Then I use them to show the favorites on the `FavoritesScreen`. \r\n\r\nIf I go to the `ProductDetailsScreen` (where I toggle the favorite) I toggle it true/false with no problem. \r\n \r\nFurther if I then use the `Bottom Tab Navigation` to check the `FavoritesScreen` or the `OrdersScreen` etc and then go back to `ProductDetailsScreen`, nothing is changed.\r\n\r\n**But** if (from the `ProductDetailsScreen`) I go back (to `ProductsOverviewScreen`) and then come back again on `ProductDetailsScreen` the state of `isFav`\r\nsnaps back to false! Nevertheless the `id` and `isFav` are saved on Firebase, but `isFav` is saved as `false`.\r\n\r\nNote: I use a useState() hook...\r\n\r\nOne more thing that I don&#39;t understand happens when I  try to log `isFav`. \r\nI have two logs, one inside the `toggleFavoriteHandler` and one outside. When I **first** run the `toggleFavoriteHandler`, where I also have `setIsFav(prevState =&gt; !prevState);` I get:\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n`outside: false\r\ninside: false\r\noutside: true`\r\n\r\nSo I guess the first two false are from the initial state and then the true is from the above state-toggling. But why it gets it only outside true? Why actually the first two are false? I change the state to true before the log. I would expect it to immediately change to true and have them all true! \r\n\r\nThen if I go back to `ProductsOverviewScreen` and then again to `ProductDetailsScreen` I get two logs from outside:\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n`outside: true\r\noutside: false`\r\n\r\nSo it snaps back to its initial state! ?\r\n\r\nI really do not understand how the work-flow goes.

you look at `perldoc File::Copy` you will see the following:\r\n\r\n    RETURN\r\n        All functions return 1 on success, 0 on failure. $! will be set if an\r\n        error was encountered.\r\n\r\nTherefore, your code should be exposing what is in `$!` if there is an error:\r\n\r\n\r\n    if ( copy($source_file, $target_file)) {\r\n        print &quot;success\\n&quot;;\r\n    } \r\n    else { \r\n        warn &quot;fail: $!\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlso, as described in the documentation for File::Copy, `copy` returns `1` on success (a true value), so I removed your `== 0` in the success test.  With Perl, any true value in the `if(COND){...}` statement will do; you don&#39;t need to explicitly test for `1`.\r\n\r\nRegarding paths: The `/` character can be used as a path delimiter, even if you&#39;re using Windows except in some cases where you might be sending the path to an external program. This capability allows you to relatively portably write code that expresses paths as `foo/bar/baz`, and it will work with Windows similarly to how it would work under a *nix operating system.  Using the forward slash as a delimiter allows you to avoid escaping every backslash in a path: `foo\\\\bar\\\\baz`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403980/how-to-get-the-value-of-last-executed-command-in-strawberry-perl/58404107#58404107","title":"how to get the value of last executed command in strawberry perl"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12223324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-M7QP3K1577U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfHqWPfibzpXKP6_Zd-O4VF3Yv8yw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Priti Verma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12223324/priti-verma"},"last_editor":{"reputation":41306,"user_id":4653379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3953dbedd0dabff5cbc3db9b0835b14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zdim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4653379/zdim"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58404107,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571193649,"creation_date":1571183659,"last_edit_date":1571184668,"question_id":58403980,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403980","body_markdown":"I am trying to execute a simple strawberry perl script for file copy to get the code from the last executed command.

Below is my code. `Floor1.jpg` is the destination and `x.png` is the image to drag and drop.\r\n```\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n\t&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;form&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;How many devices do you have?&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; name=&quot;num1&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Enter&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n&lt;img src= &#39;Floor1.jpg&#39;&gt;\r\n \r\n&lt;?php\r\n$num1 = 0;\r\nif (isset($_GET[&#39;num1&#39;])) {\r\n \r\n    $num1 = $_GET[&#39;num1&#39;];\r\n \r\n}\r\n\r\nfor ($i=1; $i&lt;=$num1; $i++) {\r\n    $image = &quot;&lt;img src=&#39;x.png&#39; width = &#39;50&#39; width = &#39;50&#39; draggable = &#39;true&#39; /&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo $i;\r\n    echo $image ;\r\n}\r\n?&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403970/how-to-drag-multiple-images-and-save-new-location-using-php-and-javascript","title":"How to drag multiple images and save new location using PHP and Javascript"},{"tags":["google-cloud-datastore","gcloud"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3973,"user_id":2684055,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d7b42352806d7d85ec8746ca018d97?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jorge Silva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2684055/jorge-silva"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571187029,"post_id":58404195,"comment_id":103153570,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403969/datastore-index-not-working-for-property-that-is-json-string/58404195#comment103153570_58404195"},{"owner":{"reputation":430,"user_id":4624877,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f91dadad091002fe1a5a4867bc954721?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Siva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4624877/siva"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3973,"user_id":2684055,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d7b42352806d7d85ec8746ca018d97?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jorge Silva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2684055/jorge-silva"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571196482,"post_id":58404195,"comment_id":103155208,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403969/datastore-index-not-working-for-property-that-is-json-string/58404195#comment103155208_58404195"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":430,"user_id":4624877,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f91dadad091002fe1a5a4867bc954721?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Siva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4624877/siva"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571185796,"creation_date":1571185796,"answer_id":58404195,"question_id":58403969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404195","body_markdown":"Is your attrs field more than 1,500 bytes by any chance?

I have added a .PNG image in visual studio 2019, with the path Images/Locations, with a build action of &quot;Resource&quot;, and a copy to output of &quot;Copy if Newer&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn C#, I store the relative path to this image in the ImagePath property of CurrentLocation.  In WPF, I use an image control, where the source is a binding to this ImagePath property.  You can see the relevant code at the end of this post.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that the image does not appear, but **does** appear when I change the path string in the ImagePath property to a full/disk path, e.g. C:\\Users\\etc, making no other changes to the underlying code, the binding in the WPF control, etc.  Further, I&#39;m 99% certain that the syntax I&#39;m using to get the relative path of this image is correct for dotnet framework, so I&#39;m assuming this is a change in function made going from framework to core - unfortunately, I&#39;m not able to find any documentation on this.  Any ideas what is going on, or how relative paths are meant to function in dotnet core?  Can they not be used?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Relevant C# (ImagePath property is defined)**\r\n\r\n    CurrentLocation = new Location\r\n    {\r\n       Description = &quot;default location description&quot;\r\n      ,ImagePath   = &quot;/simpleRPG_Engine;component/Images/Locations/tempHome.png&quot; // broken???\r\n      ,Name        = &quot;default location&quot;\r\n      ,XCoordinate = 0\r\n      ,YCoordinate = 0\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n**Relevant XAML (ImagePath property is bound)**\r\n\r\n    &lt;Image      x:Name                = &quot;worldImage&quot;\r\n                Grid.Row              = &quot;1&quot;\r\n                Height                = &quot;250&quot;\r\n                HorizontalAlignment   = &quot;Center&quot;\r\n                Source                = &quot;{Binding CurrentLocation.ImagePath}&quot;\r\n                VerticalAlignment     = &quot;Center&quot;\r\n                Width                 = &quot;250&quot;\r\n            \r\n    /&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403948/relative-pathing-for-project-resources-in-c-and-dotnetcore","title":"Relative Pathing for Project Resources in C# and DotNetCore"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8860}
