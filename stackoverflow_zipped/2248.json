Is there any possibility that java compiler is messing with this?\r\n\r\nIn theory yes.  It is mathematically possible.\r\n\r\nIn practice ... it is more likely that you are either missing something, or you have a misconception about some aspect of Java&#39;s behavior.  (For example, what makes a program thread-safe.)\r\n\r\nJava is used by millions of programmers.  Bugs do get found, but the chances that any given unexpected / not understood behavior in some &quot;ordinary looking&quot; code is due to a compiler bug are miniscule.\r\n\r\n(And besides, unless you can provide evidence of the supposed compiler bug in the form of a reproducible testcase:\r\n\r\n1.  you won&#39;t be able to report it / get a fix for it, and\r\n2.  you won&#39;t have any *logical* basis for believing that your workaround is actually curing the problem.  (It could simply be reducing its probability, or moving it somewhere else.)\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n&gt; The code has one method which has code like below : \r\n\r\n(Is it that the real code?  Or is it just &quot;like&quot; it?

The problem is that either the input to or the output of this method is not what you think it is.  (Noting that if an application is multi-threaded, the use of a debugger or the addition of tracing or logging can alter the application&#39;s behavior.  In ways that may hide the actual evidence.)\r\n\r\nPossibility #1.  The problem is in the `LocaleCodeValue` constructor.\r\n\r\nPossibility #2.  Homoglyphs: under some circumstances you are getting some character that *looks* like the `&#39;_&#39;` character, but actually isn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nPossibility #3.  Somewhere else in the codebase is some code that is using nasty reflection to mutate `String` values, and it just happens to mutate the value of `code`.  It may not even be doing that during the call to this method ... if it happens on a different thread.\r\n\r\nPossibility #4.  Somewhere in the codebase some buggy native code is being called, and that is trampling something.\r\n\r\nPossibility #5.  A hardware error.\r\n\r\nPossibility #6.  The code that you are running doesn&#39;t match the source code that you are looking at; e.g. you have a problem with your build or deployment processes.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nPossibility #7.  There is some subtle but important difference between what you have shown us and the real code.\r\n\r\nMy bet would be on #0, #6 or #7 (except that you just said not #7).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005729/java-compiler-executes-return-before-if-statement/58006267#58006267","title":"Java Compiler executes return before if statement"}],"owner":{"reputation":5635,"user_id":4516110,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OmZWFhFrkqI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEY/MP002E8-x6Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mehraj Malik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4516110/mehraj-malik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5635,"user_id":4516110,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OmZWFhFrkqI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEY/MP002E8-x6Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mehraj Malik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4516110/mehraj-malik"},"comment_count":17,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":96,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568895697,"creation_date":1568877654,"last_edit_date":1568885921,"question_id":58005729,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58005729","body_markdown":"**Is there any possibility that `java compiler` ignores `if statement` in java while optimizing?**\r\n\r\nWe have two environments [A and B identical] and the same code is deployed on both the environments.\r\nThe code has one method which has code like below : \r\n\r\n    private LocaleCodeValue getDefaultLocaleCodeValue(String code) {\r\n    String value = code;\r\n    if (code.contains(&quot;_&quot;)) value = code.substring(0, code.lastIndexOf(&quot;_&quot;));\r\n    return new LocaleCodeValue(code, value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should work both the environments. \r\n\r\n**However, on environment B is sometimes ignore the if statement and directly return the object while the condition is true.

your code, I can only guess that you have missing values in your dataset (which is not surprising : I would not expect to have 48 different GDP indicators available for small countries every year since 1950).\r\n\r\nYou should find a strategy to deal with these missing values. It is clearly not an easy task. Among the possibilities : \r\n\r\n- Replace them with the average value of the column (naive)\r\n- Linearly regress them (hard to know if it&#39;s relevant at all)\r\n- Delete all columns or all lines with missing values (brutal)\r\n\r\nSome other methods are more subtle but also more difficult to put in place.

I can make an assumption based on the available data, that will work -most- of the time, but it needs to be reliable and work -all- the time.\r\n\r\nI can find a correct UUID in each html file, so that would be a way to link to the structure, but to find this structure, I need to be able to get the UUIDS of all children of a node and go through the tree recursively.\r\n\r\nI tried the following:\r\n\r\n    public Package GetRootPackage()\r\n    {\r\n        using (var repo = EnterpriseArchitect.Repository.Open(_connectionString))\r\n        {\r\n            return repo.GetPackage(this.RootPackageName);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*EnterpriseArchitect.Repository is a wrapper on top of EA.Repository to have it be IDisposable for better connection management.*\r\n\r\nUsing the GetRootPackage method defined above, I can connect and load the node I want:\r\n\r\n    var root = MyBuilder.ConnectTo(myConnectionString)\r\n    \t.RootPackage(rootNodeName)\r\n    \t.GetRootPackage();\r\n\r\nI&#39;d think that I&#39;d then be able to fetch it&#39;s children like so:\r\n\r\n    var children = root.Packages;\r\n\r\nBut then I get this nasty error:\r\n\r\n&gt; System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException   HResult=0x80010105  \r\n&gt; Message=The server threw an exception.

I did that to see if the String did return anything or if there was some fault that made the String not return anything.\r\n\r\n**This is how I send the String to the website**\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst char html[] = &quot;&lt;div class=\\&quot;jumbotron\\&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=\\&quot;center\\&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=\\&quot;display-4\\&quot; style=\\&quot;font-family: zetafonts-cinematografica-extrabold; font-size: 30px;\\&quot; &gt; {{TEAM1}} {{SCORE}} {{SCORE2}}&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;\r\n\r\nString scoreSend(PageArgument&amp; args) { //this workes fine\r\n  return score;\r\n}\r\nString scoreSend2(PageArgument&amp; args) { //this works fine\r\n  return score2;\r\n}\r\n\r\nString team1return(PageArgument&amp; args) {  //this only returns &quot;test&quot;\r\n  return team1Team;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// I have also tried this:\r\n\r\n//String team1return(PageArgument&amp; args) {  \r\n//return Server.arg(&quot;team1-playing-as&quot;);\r\n//}\r\n// but same result.\r\n\r\n\r\nPageElement body_elem(html, { {&quot;SCORE&quot;, scoreSend} });\r\nPageElement Score_2(html, { {&quot;SCORE2&quot;, scoreSend2} });\r\nPageElement Team1_elm(html, { {&quot;TEAM1&quot;, team1return} });\r\nPageElement CURRENT_GAME_ELEMENT(htmlPage2);\r\nPageBuilder CURRENT_GAME(&quot;/current-game&quot;, { CURRENT_GAME_ELEMENT, body_elem, Score_2, Team1_elm});\r\n\r\n\r\nvoid loop() {\r\nWiFi.softAP(&quot;SSID&quot;, &quot;PASS&quot;);\r\n  delay(100);\r\nCURRENT_GAME.insert(Server); \r\n Server.begin(); \r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid loop() {\r\nhandleForm();\r\nServer.handleClient();\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n**A solution** is maybe changing the way I declare the Strings because it looks like the value the strings get in the function `handleForm` is local and the content in that function is not accessable from other places than in the function. Thus, my question is also, how do I declare the Strings so they have the same functionality, but can be accessed from other places, or just how to make them global.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005635/sending-string-to-esp8266-webserver-via-token-string-does-not-show-updated-val","title":"Sending String to ESP8266 webserver via token. -String does not show updated value"},{"tags":["java","sockets","memory"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12088788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2446808168972788/picture?type=large","display_name":"Prince Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12088788/prince-gupta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568879414,"post_id":58005785,"comment_id":102417143,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005634/how-to-know-the-memory-usage-of-machine-by-using-ip-address-protocol-and-pro/58005785#comment102417143_58005785"},{"owner":{"reputation":2137,"user_id":6310593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95c8c1b1dd4a0e7235b6b885ce88b870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaartenDev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6310593/maartendev"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12088788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2446808168972788/picture?type=large","display_name":"Prince Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12088788/prince-gupta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568879479,"post_id":58005785,"comment_id":102417178,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005634/how-to-know-the-memory-usage-of-machine-by-using-ip-address-protocol-and-pro/58005785#comment102417178_58005785"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2137,"user_id":6310593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95c8c1b1dd4a0e7235b6b885ce88b870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaartenDev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6310593/maartendev"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568877823,"creation_date":1568877823,"answer_id":58005785,"question_id":58005634,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58005785","body_markdown":"This could be achieved by exposing a `/health` endpoint in your api.

it&#39;s impossible to &quot;suppress&quot; an external configuration.\r\nHowever, As one of the workaround, you can consider implementing an EnvironmentPostProcessor that will dynamically add profiles.\r\n\r\nIt runs after the environment is available but before spring actually processes its beans; in a nutshell, it provides a way to customize your configuration.\r\n\r\nSo this could rely on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n* an external file is called &quot;application-external.properties&quot;\r\n\r\n* the application is always started with `--spring.config.locations=&lt;path_to_external_folder&gt;`\r\n\r\n* in addition to the above specify the profile: \r\n`--spring.profiles.active=local` This will load `application.properties` and `application-local.properties` available internally but won&#39;t touch the external file unless in the post processor you add something like (a pseudo code):\r\n\r\n\r\n     `if(! getActiveProfiles().contains(&quot;local&quot;)) {\r\n         addProfile(&quot;external&quot;);\r\n     }`\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can read about environment post processors [Here][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

It is enough to have them only for Android, but it&#39;d be nice to have them for iOS as well.\r\n\r\nAfter quite some googling I (maybe foolishly) decided the best approach would be to use React Native.\r\n\r\nNow to elaborate, these apps will be the very simplest and useless apps, only made to check a certain checkbox on some paper.\r\n\r\nAll the websites I built are already fully mobile responsive so using mobile browser to see and use all they offer is perfectly OK.\r\n\r\nThat is why it would be perfectly good to just create a mobile native wrapper with webview inside that works exactly like a browser does, albeit without functionality to surf to URLs other than direct links from the website.\r\n\r\n**What I did:**\r\n\r\nI use VS Code with internal bash terminal (OS = Windows 10)\r\n\r\nI installed and update NPM\r\n - Node.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n    $ node -v\r\n    v12.8.0\r\n    \r\n    $ npm -v\r\n    6.10.3\r\n\r\n```\r\n - Android Studio + SDK\r\n - Android Virtual Device\r\n\r\nI opened VS Code terminal in my Projects folder and ran a few commands:\r\n```\r\n\r\n    $ npm i -g react-native-cli\r\n    &lt;path&gt;\\react-native -&gt; &lt;path&gt;\\node_modules\\react-native-cli\\index.js\r\n    + react-native-cli@2.0.1\r\n    \r\n    $ npm i -g yarn\r\n    &lt;path&gt;\\yarnpkg -&gt; &lt;path&gt;\\node_modules\\yarn\\bin\\yarn.js\r\n    &lt;path&gt;\\yarn -&gt; &lt;path&gt;\\node_modules\\yarn\\bin\\yarn.js\r\n    + yarn@1.17.3\r\n    \r\n    $ react-native init test1\r\n    /.../\r\n    Done in 68.03s.\r\n    /.../\r\n    Done in 36.62s.\r\n    /.../\r\n    Done in 52.31s.\r\n    \r\n    $ cd test1\r\n    \r\n    $ react-native start\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpened another terminal:\r\n```\r\n\r\n    $ react-native run-android\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis created a default Welcome to React app and ran it in emulated Pixel 2 mobile with Marshmallow. So far so good.\r\n\r\nI changed the App.js content and imported `Text`, `View`, `AppRegistry` and some others from `&#39;react-native&#39;`, played around, and the app in the emulator accepted everything, even images. So far so good.\r\n\r\nI did the same thing with creating a new component and everything is still OK.\r\n\r\n**Now the horcrux:**\r\n\r\nFacebook&#39;s [instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/webview) tell us to follow the new and improved [`react-native-community/react-native-webview`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    $ yarn add react-native-webview@androidx\r\n    yarn add v1.17.3\r\n    /.../\r\n    Done in 28.07s.\r\n    \r\n    $ react-native start\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy code with just `&lt;View&gt;&lt;Text&gt;Hello&lt;/Text&gt;&lt;/View&gt;` in render() still works.\r\n\r\nNow I change it to:\r\n```\r\n\r\n    import React, {Component} from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import { AppRegistry, View, Text } from &#39;react-native&#39;;\r\n    import { WebView } from &#39;react-native-webview&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    export default class test1 extends Component{\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;WebView source={{ uri: &#39;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/&#39; }} /&gt;\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    AppRegistry.registerComponent(&#39;test1&#39;, () =&gt; test1);\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnd I get an error, saying:\r\n`Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: &quot;RNCWebView&quot; was not found in the UIManager.`\r\n\r\nTrying `$ react-native link` changes nothing.\r\nAlso tried\r\n```\r\n\r\n    $ react-native link react-native-webview\r\n    info Linking &quot;react-native-webview&quot; iOS dependency\r\n    info iOS module &quot;react-native-webview&quot; has been successfully linked\r\n    info Linking &quot;react-native-webview&quot; Android dependency\r\n    info Android module &quot;react-native-webview&quot; has been successfully linked\r\n\r\n```\r\nbut no changes again.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the right way to use WebView in React Native?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005590/what-is-the-right-way-to-use-webview-in-react-native","title":"What is the right way to use WebView in React Native"},{"tags":["jenkins","checkmarx"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":324,"user_id":4086042,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e7a1ad3a3e95ffdb2580f56d30b99fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SPoint","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4086042/spoint"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570191200,"post_id":58005589,"comment_id":102845306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005589/how-to-configure-checkmarx-through-jenkinsfile#comment102845306_58005589"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11768626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4_DWq773QDw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc5GI7s96wju3Ul3VhD9gytuSqXyA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sangeeta Yelagod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11768626/sangeeta-yelagod"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568877150,"creation_date":1568877150,"question_id":58005589,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58005589","body_markdown":"I am trying to configure checkmarx through Jenkins file previously the checkmarx scripts was reading from groovy file which is globally configured. \r\n\r\nThis is how my jenkinsfile looks \r\n\r\n    `stage(&#39;Code Scanning&#39;) {\r\n          parallel {\r\n            stage(&#39;Static Code Analysis&#39;) {\r\n              steps {\r\n                step([$class: &#39;CxScanBuilder&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        comment: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        credentialsId: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        excludeFolders: &#39;.helmignore, build, templates, javadocs, javadoc, \r\n                                       dist, node_modules, WMSRegistryReader.java, \r\n                                       BlowfishEncryptionStrategy.java, BlowfishUtils.java&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        excludeOpenSourceFolders: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        exclusionsSetting: &#39;global&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        failBuildOnNewResults: false,\r\n    \t\t\t        failBuildOnNewSeverity: &#39;MEDIUM&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        filterPattern: &#39;&#39;&#39;!**/_cvs/**/*, !Checkmarx/Reports/*.*&#39;&#39;&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        fullScanCycle: 10,\r\n    \t\t\t        groupId: &#39;0de2e46c-8410-478a-85b9-b5dce83f8ecb&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        includeOpenSourceFolders: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        osaArchiveIncludePatterns: &#39;*.zip, *.war, *.ear, *.tgz&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        osaInstallBeforeScan: false,\r\n    \t\t\t        password: &#39;{}&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        preset: &#39;36&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        projectName: &quot;${APP_NAME}&quot;,\r\n    \t\t\t        sastEnabled: true,\r\n    \t\t\t        serverUrl: &#39;https://checkmarx.abc.com&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        sourceEncoding: &#39;1&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        username: &#39;&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        vulnerabilityThresholdResult: &#39;FAILURE&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t        waitForResultsEnabled: true])\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n            stage(&#39;Open Source Compliance&#39;) {\r\n              steps {\r\n                blackduck([appName: &quot;${APP_NAME}&quot;, appDomain: &quot;${APP_DOMAIN}&quot;, branchName: \r\n                &quot;master&quot;])\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n`\r\n\r\nBut the Build is considering global configuration done from jenkins-&gt;

remember you from your [previous question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57977396/how-to-access-text-views-in-custom-collection-view-cell-class-from-the-main-clas). A little change to my previous answer will help you. In your previous question you set the `CustomWriterPageCell` as `UITextView`&#39;s delegate. Instead of that, this time, set your Controller as the delegate.\r\n\r\n    func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell {\r\n\r\n        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: &quot;WriterPageCellID&quot;, for: indexPath) as! CustomWriterPageCell\r\n\r\n        cell.backgroundColor = indexPath.item % 2 == 1 ? .green : .yellow\r\n        cell.textViewOne.delegate = self\r\n\r\n        return cell\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, conform to the protocol:\r\n\r\n    extension ViewController : UITextViewDelegate {\r\n      func textViewDidEndEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {\r\n\r\n          let text = textView.text \r\n      }\r\n}\r\n\r\nUntil now, you successfully transferred the text from a TextView in a cell to your Controller.\r\nNow the problem here is that you don&#39;t know this text belongs to which indexPath.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not saying this is the best solution, but it works safely in your case:\r\nYou can set a tag for each TextView which acts like an id:\r\n\r\n    func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell {\r\n\r\n        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: &quot;WriterPageCellID&quot;, for: indexPath) as! CustomWriterPageCell\r\n\r\n        cell.backgroundColor = indexPath.item % 2 == 1 ? .green : .yellow\r\n        cell.textViewOne.delegate = self\r\n        cell.textViewOne.tag = indexPath.row\r\n\r\n        return cell\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n \r\n    extension ViewController : UITextViewDelegate {\r\n       func textViewDidEndEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {\r\n           let text = textView.text //This the text\r\n           let row = textView.tag //This the indexPath.row\r\n           self.texts[row] = text //Save texts in an array. This array is fixed-size and has number of elements equal to your number of collection view&#39;s Items.\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can declare it like this in your Controller :\r\n`var texts = Array(repeating: &quot;&quot;, count: 10)` where 10 is the number of items in Collection View.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything is set up, let&#39;s get to your print button:\r\n    \r\n     @objc func printButtonTapped() {\r\n           \r\n           for text in self.texts {\r\n \r\n                print(text)\r\n\r\n           }\r\n        \r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005582/getting-text-from-text-views-inside-all-collection-view-cells-at-once/58008260#58008260","title":"Getting text from text views inside all collection view cells at once"}],"owner":{"reputation":133,"user_id":11670593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69bbd51832d3eb3fdde31f2f8efd0e71?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SMALLworld","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11670593/smallworld"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15243,"user_id":472495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"halfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58008260,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570273543,"creation_date":1568877090,"last_edit_date":1570273543,"question_id":58005582,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58005582","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve got a collection view and I&#39;m using a custom class for the cells.

They have different capabilities and store their data in different ways. You may as well ask what is the difference between a decimal and a DateTime.\r\n\r\n`An Array` (System.Array) is fixed in size once it is allocated. You can&#39;t add items to it or remove items from it. Also, all the elements must be the same type. As a result, it is type safe, and is also the most efficient of the three, both in terms of memory and performance. Also, System.Array supports multiple dimensions (i.e. it has a Rank property) while List and ArrayList do not (although you can create a List of Lists or an ArrayList of ArrayLists, if you want to).\r\n\r\n`An ArrayList` is a flexible array which contains a list of objects. You can add and remove items from it and it automatically deals with allocating space. If you store value types in it, they are boxed and unboxed, which can be a bit inefficient. Also, it is not type-safe.\r\n\r\n`A List&lt;&gt;` leverages generics; it is essentially a type-safe version of ArrayList. This means there is no boxing or unboxing (which improves performance) and if you attempt to add an item of the wrong type it&#39;ll generate a compile-time error.\r\n\r\n`enum ` types are typically used to list unique elements, such as days of the week and country/territory names","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005532/how-can-i-store-several-values-in-application-storage/58006647#58006647","title":"How can I store several values in Application

are mixing up different ways of counting the hits and displaying the hit counts.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, to count the number of hits for one object, you&#39;ll need to add a DetailView, which shows one single song. This class is also where you add the `count_hit` parameter Something like this (views.py):\r\n\r\n\r\n    from hitcount.views import HitCountDetailView\r\n\r\n    class SongDetailView(HitCountDetailView):\r\n        model = Song        \r\n        count_hit = True    \r\n        template = &#39;song_detail.html&#39;\r\n        \r\n        def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\r\n            self.object = self.get_object()\r\n            context = self.get_context_data(object=self.object)\r\n            return redirect(self.object.song.audio_file.url)\r\n\r\n\r\n`HitCountDetailView` is hitcount&#39;s built in view that gets a single object and adds up the hitcounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd a template to display a single song (song_detail.html):\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h5&gt;{{ object.song_title }}&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;{{ object.artist }}&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;span&gt;plays: {% get_hit_count for [object] %}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\nThen in your urls add the following pattern (urls.py):\r\n\r\n    urlpatterns = [\r\n        ...\r\n        path(&#39;song/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;, SongDetailView.as_view(), name=&#39;song-detail&#39;),\r\n        ...\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nYou now have two urls, one that leads to home, and one that leads to song/&lt;id&gt;, the first should display a list of songs, the second just one song.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is some unnecessary/wrong code in your original code, which I will explain below:\r\n\r\nYour models.py has a generic relation, to HitCount, which is not necessary, unless you want to do some direct lookups to this models HitCount, but for now, you can leave it out. \r\n\r\nThe `HitCountMixin` should be added to a view, specifically a class based view, but not to a model. You models.py should look like this:\r\n\r\n    class Songs(models.Model):\r\n        ...\r\n        updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True, auto_now_add=False)\r\n    \r\n        class Meta:\r\n            ordering = [&#39;-updated&#39;]\r\n    \r\n        def __str__(self):\r\n            return self.song_title\r\n\r\n\r\nYour template looks like it&#39;s part of a file, but if it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not correct. Better would be to loop over each song (You can also link to your new detail-view), like this:\r\n\r\n    {% for song in songs %}\r\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h5&gt;{{ song.song_title }}&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;{{ song.artist }}&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;span&gt;plays: {% get_hit_count for [song] %}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;{% url &#39;song-detail&#39; song.id %}&quot;&gt;Play song&lt;/a&gt;\r\n    {% endfor %}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005521/how-to-use-django-hitcount-package-to-build-a-view-count/58006659#58006659","title":"How to use Django-hitcount package to build a view count"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7123033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1959e9fdf409cc88e97176a904d9f0da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sammy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7123033/sammy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":83,"user_id":10196908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dFi8ozZzJoQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAQko/gju64PSp2Dc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tej","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10196908/tej"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568883314,"creation_date":1568876821,"last_edit_date":1568879413,"question_id":58005521,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58005521","body_markdown":"I am learning Django and came across this Django package called &#39;Django-hitcount&#39;.

If so how to save jsx instead of the string?\r\n\r\nI also tried \r\n```\r\nsellArray += &lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;{content.data[i].type}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{&#39;EOS &#39; + content.data[i].quantity}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{&#39;$ &#39; + content.data[i].price}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{&#39;$ &#39; +Number(content.data[i].price*content.data[i].quantity).toLocaleString(&#39;en&#39;)}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;;\r\n```\r\nBut the html just shows `[object Object]`\r\n\r\nIf i have the values as objects in an array I can map over it and it works just fine, but i dont want to have to do that.\r\n```\r\nconst showMeArray = content.data.map((item: any) =&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;{item.type}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{&#39;EOS &#39; + item.quantity}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{&#39;$ &#39; + item.price}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{&#39;$ &#39; +Number(item.price*item.quantity).toLocaleString(&#39;en&#39;)}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);\r\n```\r\nI dont understand why this works\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005498/react-how-to-save-jsx-to-state-then-show-jsx-in-dom","title":"React: How to save jsx to state then show jsx in dom"},{"tags":["python","unicode","character-encoding"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12088693,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAc8uVDGgZ-wQbO07InvPWsyzkiL8wQppRSojIHNSE=k-s128","display_name":"Sameer Pophali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12088693/sameer-pophali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568881333,"post_id":58005766,"comment_id":102418047,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005494/how-to-convert-uxxxx-code-to-plain-text-in-python/58005766#comment102418047_58005766"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16049,"user_id":5320906,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NOdNo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"snakecharmerb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5320906/snakecharmerb"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568877765,"creation_date":1568877765,"answer_id":58005766,"question_id":58005494,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58005766","body_markdown":"It seems you have a string where the backslash representation usually used to represent non-ascii characters has been replaced by a percent-sign based convention.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to replace the precent signs with backslashes - as you have tried - then encode to bytes and decode from the [unicode-escape][1] codec.

Some kind of loop structure would really be helpful\r\n\r\n    0         IT-0\r\n    \r\n    1         IT-1\r\n    \r\n    2         IT-2\r\n    \r\n    3         IT-8\r\n    \r\n    4         IT-56\r\n             ...\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005484/i-would-like-to-manipulate-data-under-a-column-by-changing-the-values-that-are-b","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"I would like to Manipulate data under a column by changing the values that are both strings and integers"},{"tags":["android","scrollview","android-constraintlayout"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":11834065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xedxTQEx5zU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4g68ojnWdAQ_OZ0Y2AorKiMft1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shivam Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11834065/shivam-sharma"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568877304,"post_id":58005483,"comment_id":102416051,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005483/scrollview-inside-constraintlayout-not-working-as-expected#comment102416051_58005483"},{"owner":{"reputation":256,"user_id":11951874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98cc25669b776e913b9ab1f5e659a261?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raju Tukadiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11951874/raju-tukadiya"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":76,"user_id":11834065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xedxTQEx5zU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4g68ojnWdAQ_OZ0Y2AorKiMft1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shivam Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11834065/shivam-sharma"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568894742,"post_id":58005483,"comment_id":102425374,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005483/scrollview-inside-constraintlayout-not-working-as-expected#comment102425374_58005483"},{"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":5390707,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMri2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"theThapa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5390707/thethapa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568991647,"post_id":58005483,"comment_id":102464100,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005483/scrollview-inside-constraintlayout-not-working-as-expected#comment102464100_58005483"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":29724,"user_id":8298909,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cfmbW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ben P.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8298909/ben-p"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568993845,"creation_date":1568993845,"answer_id":58031426,"question_id":58005483,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58031426","body_markdown":"Modify your `&lt;ScrollView&gt;` tag to match the following:\r\n\r\n&gt;     &lt;ScrollView\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/scrollview&quot;\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;0dp&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;0dp&quot;\r\n        android:fillViewport=&quot;true&quot;\r\n        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n        app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf=&quot;@id/cardview&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd add this `id` attribute to your `CardView`:\r\n\r\n&gt;     &lt;androidx.cardview.widget.CardView\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/cardview&quot;\r\n\r\nWithout specifying a bottom constraint (and using `wrap_content` for the height), the `ScrollView` will size itself to be large enough that all of the content fits inside of it, but is clipped by the parent `ConstraintLayout`.

In this case, it looks like `var.azure_lb_public_backend_id` is an ID of an object that won&#39;t be allocated until that object is created, and so Terraform doesn&#39;t know yet what value that will have and so it can&#39;t say for certain whether it will equal `&quot;&quot;`.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, you&#39;ll instead need to make the decision based on something Terraform _does_ know at plan time. One way to do that is to wrap your load balancer id value in an object so that the decision can be made based on whether the object is set at all:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;load_balancer&quot; {\r\n  type = object({\r\n    backend_address_pool_id = string\r\n  })\r\n  default = null\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association&quot; &quot;vm-if-lb-public-association&quot; {\r\n  count                   = var.load_balancer != null ? var.countvm : 0\r\n  network_interface_id    = element(azurerm_network_interface.vm-if.*.id, count.index)\r\n  ip_configuration_name   = &quot;${var.workspace_config.prefix}-${var.profile}-${count.index + 1}&quot;\r\n  backend_address_pool_id = var.load_balancer.backend_address_pool_id\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the decision is based on whether the `var.load_balancer` object is null, rather than on the value of the `backend_address_pool_id` attribute inside it. Your calling module can then set that based on the same test it was using to decide how to set `var.enable` on the other module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  load_balancer = var.load_balancer_enabled ? {\r\n    backend_address_pool_id = module.load_balancer.lb_id\r\n  } : null\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming that `var.load_balancer_enabled` is something known at plan time, this should now work, because Terraform can decide whether `load_balancer` is null and thus determine a value for `count` in all cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the above I tried to stick as closely as possible to how you had things arranged in order to make it easier to see what changes I was proposing, but there are some different ways to arrange the above principle that might make the modules easier to use for callers. Below are some examples that are more drastically different than what you shared, showing how we might hide the details of this handoff in the module interfaces themselves in order to achieve cleaner [module composition](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/composition.html).\r\n\r\nIn your root module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;load_balancer_enabled&quot; {\r\n  type    = bool\r\n  default = false\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;example&quot; {\r\n  name     = &quot;example&quot;\r\n  location = &quot;West US&quot;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule &quot;load_balancer&quot; {\r\n  source = &quot;./modules/load-balancer&quot;\r\n\r\n  resource_group = azurerm_resource_group.example\r\n  enabled        = var.load_balancer_enabled\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule &quot;virtual_machines&quot; {\r\n  source = &quot;./modules/virtual_machines&quot;\r\n\r\n  resource_group = azurerm_resource_group.example\r\n  vm_count       = 4\r\n  load_balancer  = module.load_balancer\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `load-balancer` module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;resource_group&quot; {\r\n  type = object({\r\n    name     = string\r\n    location = string\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\nvariable &quot;enabled&quot; {\r\n  type    = bool\r\n  default = true\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_lb&quot; &quot;example&quot; {\r\n  count = var.enabled ? 1 : 0\r\n\r\n  name = &quot;example&quot;\r\n\r\n  resource_group_name = var.resource_group.name\r\n  location            = var.resource_group.location\r\n\r\n  # (and probably a frontend IP allocation)\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool&quot; &quot;example&quot; {\r\n  count = length(azurerm_lb.example)\r\n\r\n  name                = &quot;example&quot;\r\n  resource_group_name = var.resource_group.name\r\n  loadbalancer_id     = azurerm_lb.lb[count.index].id\r\n}\r\n\r\noutput &quot;backend_address_pool&quot; {\r\n  # Set only if the load balancer is enabled. Null otherwise.\r\n  value = var.enabled ? azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.example[0] : null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `virtual-machine` module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;resource_group&quot; {\r\n  type = object({\r\n    name     = string\r\n    location = string\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\nvariable &quot;vm_count&quot; {\r\n  type = number\r\n}\r\n\r\nvariable &quot;load_balancer&quot; {\r\n  type = object({\r\n    # We only need to specify the subset of the module outputs\r\n    # that we need here.\r\n    backend_address_pool = object({\r\n      id = string\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_network_interface&quot; &quot;example&quot; {\r\n  count = var.vm_count\r\n\r\n  # (and whatever other settings you need here)\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association&quot; &quot;vm-if-lb-public-association&quot; {\r\n  count = var.load_balancer.backend_address_pool != null ? var.vm_count : 0\r\n\r\n  network_interface_id    = azurerm_network_interface.example[count.index].id\r\n  backend_address_pool_id = var.load_balancer.backend_address_pool.id\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this variant, the `load-balancer` module produces an object representing the backend address pool and deals with setting it to `null` when the module is disabled. We can then just pass the whole module result into the `virtual-machine` module and let it make the decision based on the `null`-ness of that object, and the calling module is just simple wiring of the modules together without any special logic.\r\n\r\nAgain, the important detail is that the decision is ultimately made based only on the `var.load_balancer_enabled` variable (indirectly), and not on any values that Terraform will learn during apply.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58005470/terraform-cant-create-vm-behind-lb-with-azurerm-lb-backend-address-pool/58017436#58017436","title":"Terraform: Can&#39;t create vm behind lb with azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool"}],"owner":{"reputation":4308,"user_id":162622,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f250b5a19c6c65b27f03a8c75b45616b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kiva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/162622/kiva"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58017436,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568919474,"creation_date":1568876617,"question_id":58005470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58005470","body_markdown":"I have a weird behavior when I try to create an azure lb with vm inside the backend pool in the same time.\r\n\r\nI have on module to manage vm and one module to manage lb.\r\nIf I create lb first, all work fine but if I create both together, it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nHere is my configuration (terraform 0.12.9, azure 1.33.1):\r\n\r\n```\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association&quot; &quot;vm-if-lb-public-association&quot; {\r\n  count                   = var.azure_lb_public_backend_id != &quot;&quot; ?
