For that, you use `destruct x as [a b c ... | d e f ... | ...]`. These destruction patterns can be nested if needed, e.g. `destruct x as [[a b] | [c [d | e]]]`. Note that if a constructor takes no arguments, there is nothing to rename, so you can leave the pattern empty.\r\n\r\nIn particular, something like a natural number can be destructed with `destruct n as [ | n&#39;]`. This divides into the cases where `n` is zero (and the constructor has no arguments, so there&#39;s nothing to the left of the `|`) or `n` is the successor of `n&#39;`. Similarly, a list could be destructed as `destruct li as [ | a li&#39;]` to divide into the cases where the list is `nil` and where it is `cons a li&#39;`. The space to the left of the `|` is unnecessary, so you could do `destruct li as [| a li&#39;]`.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s happening in your case specifically is that `le` is defined as an inductive type something along the lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\nInductive le (n : nat) : nat -&gt; Prop :=\r\n| le_n : le n n\r\n| le_S : forall m : nat, le n m -&gt; le n (S m).\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo there are two cases: one with no arguments, and the successor case where the arguments are `m: nat` and `H: le n m`. Hence, the destruct pattern is `[| m H]`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo answer your second question, `absurd (S b&#39; &lt;= b&#39;).` means that (we think) we&#39;re able to prove `S b&#39; &lt;= b&#39;` in the current context. We can also prove (in the same context) that `S b&#39; &lt;= b&#39;` is absurd, i.e. leads to a witness of `False` (more precisely, `S b&#39; &lt;= b&#39; -&gt; False`). Using the induction principle for `False`, this allows us to generate a witness for any type, and in particular for `a = S b&#39;`.\r\n\r\nYou can see what kind of proof term `absurd` produces with a minimal experiment.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGoal forall A B: Type, A.\r\nProof.\r\n  intros A B.\r\n  absurd B.\r\n  Show Proof.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should print `(fun A B : Type =&gt; False_rect A (?Goal ?Goal0))`. The first goal (`?Goal`) has type `~B` (i.e. `B -&gt; False`). The second goal (`?Goal0`) has type `B`. If we can provide both, then `?Goal ?Goal0` has type `False`, so `False_rect A (?Goal ?Goal0)` produces a witness of type `A`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477897/rel-le-antisymmetric-comprehension/58478059#58478059","title":"Rel: le_antisymmetric comprehension"}],"owner":{"reputation":15989,"user_id":789186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d232cc5abe46092d3972d4f85833e42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user4035","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/789186/user4035"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58478059,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571613370,"creation_date":1571611265,"question_id":58477897,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58477897","body_markdown":"Rel chapter from Logical foundations.

I have the bucket configured for static web site hosting; the bucket static site URL for example might be `http://example.com.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com`. I also have a CloudFront distribution with an AWS-managed certificate, so that when I access `https://example.com/` for example it serves content out of the S3 bucket `http://example.com.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/`. That all works like a dream.\r\n\r\nOn my site I have a file `https://example.com/foo.html` that has been renamed to `https://example.com/bar.html`. Some other pages on the web may link to `foo.html`, so in my S3 bucket configuration I set up a redirect for the `foo.html` object, like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;RoutingRules&gt;\r\n  &lt;RoutingRule&gt;\r\n    &lt;Condition&gt;\r\n      &lt;KeyPrefixEquals&gt;foo.html&lt;/KeyPrefixEquals&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Condition&gt;\r\n    &lt;Redirect&gt;\r\n      &lt;ReplaceKeyWith&gt;bar.html&lt;/ReplaceKeyWith&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Redirect&gt;\r\n  &lt;/RoutingRule&gt;\r\n&lt;/RoutingRules&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to browse to `http://example.com.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/foo.html`, it sends an HTTP `301` permanent redirect to `bar.html`, so I wind up at `http://example.com.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bar.html`, just like I expect.\r\n\r\nSo now I deploy the S3 bucket to a CloudFront distribution as explained above. After the CloudFront status shows &quot;Deployed&quot;, I browse to `https://example.com/foo.html`, expecting to be redirected to `https://example.com/bar.html`. Oh, no; I am directed to `http://example.com.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/foo.html` insetad!\r\n\r\nWhy is the CloudFront distribution redirecting me back to the literal S3 bucket URL? Why doesn&#39;t the object redirect to a relative object in the same bucket being correctly deployed to CloudFront?\r\n\r\n_Note that I am aware of the other question [AWS Cloudfront redirecting to S3 bucket][1], but **that does not appear to be a duplicate question of this one**, as the other question is referring to the entire CloudFront site temporarily redirecting to the entire S3 bucket, not the failure of an individual S3 object redirect to be deployed to CloudFront._\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Values of the event object depend on the situation with and without the border of cell.\r\n\t- Also above situation can be seen at not only the border, but also the cases that the background color of the cell, the format (font color, size, bold and so on) except for the default font format.\r\n\t- It seems that when the cell and font are changed from the default settings, the event object returns the values of &quot;Sample situations 2&quot;.\r\n2. Values of the event object also depend on with and without using the installable event trigger.\r\n\r\n3. In the case of the cell with the default cell and font under **the simple trigger**,\r\n\t- When the value of `sample` of the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by the delete button, `e` of the event object has no both `oldValue` and `value`.\r\n\t- When the text of `sample` in the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by deleting each character using the backspace key, `e` of the event object has both `oldValue` and `value`. And `value` is `{&quot;oldValue&quot;:&quot;deleted value&quot;}`.\r\n4. In the case of the cell with the border under **the simple trigger**,\r\n\t- When the value of `sample` of the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by the delete button and also the text of `sample` in the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by deleting each character using the backspace key, `e` of the event object has both `oldValue` and `value`. And `value` is `{&quot;oldValue&quot;:&quot;deleted value&quot;}`.\r\n\r\n5. In the case of the cell with the default cell and font under **the installable trigger**,\r\n\t- When the value of `sample` of the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by the delete button, `e` of the event object has no both `oldValue` and `value`.\r\n\t- When the text of `sample` in the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by deleting each character using the backspace key, `e` of the event object has `oldValue` and no `value`. And `oldValue` is the deleted value which is not the object.\r\n6. In the case of the cell with the border under **the installable trigger**,\r\n\t- When the value of `sample` of the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by the delete button and also the text of `sample` in the cell &quot;A1&quot; is deleted by deleting each character using the backspace key, `e` of the event object has `oldValue` and no `value`. And `oldValue` is the deleted value which is not the object.\r\n\r\nFrom above results, I thought that the values (no both `oldValue` and `value`) of event object from the default condition of the cell and font might be a bug or the specification. But I had looked for the official document about this. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t still find it.\r\n\r\n## About your situation:\r\nUsing above results, when your shared Spreadsheet was tested, the cell &quot;C4&quot; is surrounded by the border. And the simple trigger is used. So the situation is the same with above &quot;Sample situations 2&quot; of &quot;Preparation 1&quot;. By this, when the value of cell &quot;C4&quot; is deleted by the delete button, `&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;oldValue&quot;:&quot;deleted value&quot;}` is returned.\r\n\r\nIn this case, how about the following method?\r\n\r\n1. When you want to use the simple trigger, I think that the script of the bottom of your question can be used.\r\n2. When you can use the installable OnEdit event trigger, you can know whether the value was deleted by checking with and without `value` in the event object `e`.\r\n\r\n## References:\r\n- [Event Objects](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/events)\r\n- [Simple Triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers)\r\n- [Installable Triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477852/google-script-detect-empty-cell-after-edit-take-2/58499090#58499090","title":"google script detect empty cell after edit -- Take 2"}],"owner":{"reputation":226,"user_id":2593714,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebba19bd834c05f62a1230f845f8565e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bryanp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2593714/bryanp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":226,"user_id":2593714,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebba19bd834c05f62a1230f845f8565e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bryanp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2593714/bryanp"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571729600,"creation_date":1571610581,"last_edit_date":1571614548,"question_id":58477852,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58477852","body_markdown":"This is related to onEdit functionality and a question with the same title [found here][1] . \r\n\r\nI am not getting the responses they are indicating I might or should when cells go from having values to empty, and those work around solutions did not work as a result. It&#39;s as if something has changed since those answers were given or there is different underlying behavior. \r\n\r\nHere is a [link to spreadsheet][2] with a simple example.\r\n\r\nIn this example, I have a cell with data validation on it. In context, this cell allows me to pick sales ticket IDs from a list to recall data. After I have recalled the data, if I remove the value from the selection cell with backspace or delete, the onEdit function should be called, a falsy value should exist for &quot;e.value&quot; and I should be able to clear the data it retrieved.  Pretty simple. \r\n\r\n== Full Testing Protocal ==\r\n\r\n1) When the cell is blank and I pick a value from the list,  I test the e.value property for truthy, i get truthy response, and it completes a function to get data.  \r\n\r\n2) When the cell is NOT blank and I pick a value from the list,  I test the e.value property for truthy, i get truthy response, and it completes a function to get data. \r\n\r\n3) When the cell is NOT blank, and I click into the cell and select backspace or delete to empty the cell. I test the e.value property for truthy and instead of getting a falsy response, I get an object back?!   {old_value=xxxx}. \r\n\r\nSo, not only do I not get a falsy value, I get an object returned instead that is missing the value item in it?? \r\n\r\nFrom looking at the other post, it seems when there is no &quot;value&quot;, google has decided to leave the &quot;value&quot; item out of the e object instead of leaving &quot;value&quot; item in the e object  and setting it to null or blank. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know why that was chosen, but that&#39;s the way I interpret that.  That said, it seems to me that decision should not have mattered. \r\n\r\nIf I&#39;m testing for an item in an object and the item doesn&#39;t exist, I should get a falsy of some sort, but instead, I&#39;m getting an object returned to me?!\r\n\r\nThe only way that I know of that might to work around this is to check for variable type to see if an object was returned which is really terribly confusing for those new to programming and shouldn&#39;t be required. I will try that shortly, but wanted to get this out first. \r\n\r\nI do recall running into this several years ago and not taking the time to try to get a sound answer. \r\n\r\n    function onEdit(e){\r\n      Logger.log(&quot;onEdit running&quot;)\r\n      var ss =        SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();  \r\n    \r\n      if (ss.getRangeByName(&quot;sTkt_uniqueID_recall&quot;).getA1Notation() == e.range.getA1Notation() ){\r\n        Logger.log(&quot;onEdit - sTkt_uniqueID_recall&quot;)\r\n    \r\n        if(e.value){\r\n          Logger.log(&quot;recall ID cell has value - get Data&quot;)\r\n          Logger.log(e.value)\r\n          //sTkt_getRecallData() \r\n          \r\n        }else{  \r\n          //oE.value should be blank, null or something falsy.. \r\n          //instead an object is returned?! {old_value: xxxxxx} \r\n          // and thus is not null and thus it never gets here..\r\n          Logger.log(&quot;recall ID cell now empty - clear Data&quot;)      \r\n          Logger.log(e.value)\r\n          //sTkt_clearForm()\r\n        }\r\n        Logger.log(&quot;onEdit fxnComplete&quot;)   \r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThanks for the help with this. \r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Added logs. \r\n\r\nLogs when item is in cell...\r\n\r\n    [19-10-20 15:17:18:071 PDT] onEdit running\r\n    [19-10-20 15:17:18:159 PDT] onEdit - sTkt_uniqueID_recall\r\n    [19-10-20 15:17:18:160 PDT] recall ID cell has value - get Data\r\n    [19-10-20 15:17:18:160 PDT] 1002\r\n    [19-10-20 15:17:18:161 PDT] onEdit fxnComplete \r\n\r\nLogs when item has been deleted -- it takes wrong path b/c of the object with oldValue in it...\r\n\r\n    [19-10-20 15:15:25:411 PDT] onEdit running\r\n    [19-10-20 15:15:25:509 PDT] onEdit - sTkt_uniqueID_recall\r\n    [19-10-20 15:15:25:510 PDT] recall ID cell has value - get Data\r\n    [19-10-20 15:15:25:511 PDT] {oldValue=1001.0}\r\n    [19-10-20 15:15:25:511 PDT] onEdit fxnComplete\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Providing the full event object shows this clearly.

Please think of this as just one of several answers.\r\n\r\nIn this modified script, it supposes that the cell &quot;I1&quot; has `&#39;001`.\r\n\r\n## Pattern 1:\r\nIn this pattern, the value retrieved from the cell &quot;I1&quot; is converted to the number and add 1, and then, the zero padding is run with the 3 digits. The value is put to the cell &quot;I2&quot; by adding `&#39;`.\r\n\r\n### Sample script:\r\n\t// var row = 2; // For cell &quot;I1&quot;\r\n\tvar n = parseInt(s.getRange(row-1,9).getValue(), 10) + 1;\r\n\ts.getRange(row,9).setValue(&quot;&#39;&quot; + (&quot;000&quot; + n).slice(-3));\r\n\r\n- If you don&#39;t want to reflect the zero padding When the previous value is more than 1000, you can use the following script.\r\n\r\n\t\ts.getRange(row,9).setValue(&quot;&#39;&quot; + (n.toString().length &lt;= 3 ? (&quot;000&quot; + n).slice(-3) : n));\r\n\r\n## Pattern 2:\r\nIn this pattern, the value retrieved from the cell &quot;I1&quot; is converted to the number and add 1. The value is put to the cell &quot;I2&quot; by changing the format to `000`. In this case, the put value can be used as the number.\r\n\r\n### Sample script:\r\n\t// var row = 2; // For cell &quot;I1&quot;\r\n\tvar n = parseInt(s.getRange(row-1,9).getValue(), 10) + 1;\r\n\ts.getRange(row,9).setNumberFormat(&quot;000&quot;).setValue(n);\r\n\r\n## Note:\r\n- In your script, if `row` is 1, an error occurs at `s.getRange(row-1,9)` because `row-1` is `0`.

Many built-in functions implemented in C already did not accept keyword arguments, even before Python 3.8. Allowing positional-only argument allows python code to be consistent with C code\r\n 2. Some python classes, such as the constructor for the `dict` type, take arbitrary keyword arguments. If you were to try to define a class with such behavior in python, you would have to write `def __init__(self, **kwds)`, ... except then you can&#39;t have a keyword argument named `self`!. Positional-only arguments can avoid this flaw.\r\n 3. Some functions don&#39;t have any natural name to assign their argument to. Take the `int` constructor. `int(x=&quot;3&quot;)` is no more readable than `int(&quot;3&quot;)`. Positional-only arguments allow names that have no inherent meaning to be considered implementation details rather than part of the public API of the module.\r\n\r\nThere are a few more details in the PEP, but those three points summarize the general reason for the existence of the feature.

That means you have two completely separate (and almost unrelated) variables `bmp1` and `bitmap1`.  The only relationship the two variables have is that `bitmap1` starts life with the same value that `bmp1` had when `decode` was called - i.e., `NULL`.\r\n\r\nYour `decode` logic calls `CreateBitmapFromWicBitmap` passing in the address of `bitmap1`and `CreateBitmapFromWicBitmap` carefully fills `bitmap1` with the address of the newly created bitmap.  **But** that doesn&#39;t affect `bmp1` at all.  So `bmp1` remains set to null.  You can check this for yourself by placing a breakpoint on `return hr` and then looking at the contents of `bmp1` and `bitmap1`.\r\n\r\nIf you want Decode to change the contents of `bmp1` you need to pass the address of `bmp1` to `decode` not the contents.  That means bitmap1 should be type `ID2D1Bitmap **` and decode should be called like this... `rl-&gt;decode(L&quot;Menu_corner.png&quot;, &amp;bmp1);`\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nSeveral comments pointed out that I was rather careless in saying &quot;C++ parameters are passed by value&quot;, I&#39;ve reworded the text above to be more focused.  \r\n\r\nThe comments also point out that that C++ parameters can be passed by reference as well as by value.  In the case of the `decode` function by using the syntax `ID2D1Bitmap*&amp; bitmap1`.\r\n\r\nI have to confess I&#39;m somewhat ambivalent about the relative merits of `ID2D1Bitmap** bitmap1` and `ID2D1Bitmap*&amp; bitmap1`.

You have to think about where the atomic accesses occur.  Consider this line of code … \r\n\r\n    a = a + 1;\r\n\r\n1. First the value of `a` is fetched atomically.  Let&#39;s say the value fetched is 50.  \r\n2. We add one to that value getting 51.  \r\n3. Finally we atomically store that value into `a` using the `=` operator \r\n4. `a` ends up being 51\r\n5. We atomically load the value of `a` by calling `a.load()`\r\n6. We print the value we just loaded by calling printf()\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far so good.  **But** between steps 1 and 3 some other threads may have changed the value of `a` - for example to the value 54.  So, when step 3 stores 51 into `a` it overwrites the value 54 giving you the output you see.\r\n\r\nAs @Sopel and @Shawn suggest in the comments, you can atomically increment the value in `a` using one of the appropriate functions (like `fetch_add`) or operator overloads (like `operator ++` or `operator +=`.  See the [std::atomic documentation][atomic] for details\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nI added steps 5 and 6 above.  Those steps can also lead to results that may not look correct.\r\n\r\nBetween the store at step 3. and the call tp `a.load()` at step 5. other threads can modify the contents of `a`.  After our thread stores 51 in `a` at step 3 it may find that `a.load()` returns some different number at step 5. Thus the thread that set `a` to the value 51 may not pass the value 51 to `printf()`.\r\n\r\nAnother source of problems is that nothing coordinates the execution of steps 5. and 6. between two threads.  So, for example, imagine two threads X and Y running on a single processor.  One possible execution order might be this … \r\n\r\n1. Thread X executes steps 1 through 5 above incrementing `a` from 50 to 51 and getting the value 51 back from `a.load()`\r\n2. Thread Y executes steps 1 through 5 above incrementing `a` from 51 to 52 and getting the value 52 back from `a.load()`\r\n3. Thread Y executes `printf()` sending 52 to the console\r\n4. Thread X executes `printf()` sending 51 to the console\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve now printed 52 on the console, followed by 51.\r\n\r\nFinally, there&#39;s another problem lurking at step 6. because `printf()` doesn&#39;t make any promises about what happens if two threads call `printf()` at the same time (at least I don&#39;t _think_ it does).  \r\n\r\nOn a multiprocessor system threads X and Y above might call `printf()` at exactly the same moment (or within a few ticks of exactly the same moment) on two different processors.  We can&#39;t make any prediction about which `printf()` output will appear first on the console.\r\n\r\n_Note_ The [documentation for printf][printf] mentions a lock introduced in C++17 &quot;… used to prevent data races when multiple threads read, write, position, or query the position of a stream.&quot;  In the case of two threads simultaneously contending for that lock we still can&#39;t tell which one will win.\r\n\r\n[atomic]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic \r\n[printf]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477740/why-my-stdatomicint-variable-isnt-thread-safe/58477975#58477975","title":"Why my std::atomic&lt;int&gt; variable isn&#39;t thread-safe?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":22199,"user_id":5231607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QzGsq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"1201ProgramAlarm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5231607/1201programalarm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571614671,"creation_date":1571614671,"answer_id":58478174,"question_id":58477740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58478174","body_markdown":"Besides the increment of `a` being done non-atomically, the fetch of the value to display after the increment is non-atomic with respect to the increment.  It is possible that one of the other threads increments `a` after the current thread has incremented it but before the fetch of the value to display.  This would possibly result in the same value being shown twice, with the previous value skipped.\r\n\r\nAnother issue here is that the threads do not necessarily run in the order they have been created.  Thread 7 could execute its output before threads 4, 5, and 6, but after all four threads have incremented `a`.  Since the thread that did the last increment displays its output earlier, you end up with the output not being sequential.  This is more likely to happen on a system with fewer than six hardware threads available to run on.\r\n\r\nAdding a small sleep between the various thread creates (e.g., `sleep_for(10)`) would make this less likely to occur, but would still not eliminate the possibility.  The only sure way to keep the output ordered is to use some sort of exclusion (like a mutex) to ensure only one thread has access to the increment and output code, and treat both the increment and output code as a single transaction that must run together before another thread tries to do an increment.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477740/why-my-stdatomicint-variable-isnt-thread-safe/58478174#58478174","title":"Why my std::atomic&lt;int&gt; variable isn&#39;t thread-safe?"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":6766207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-D5FlgO55XXE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAdU/04enPktTyt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shuo Feng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6766207/shuo-feng"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58477975,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571624232,"creation_date":1571609230,"question_id":58477740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58477740","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t know why my code isn&#39;t thread-safe, as it outputs some inconsistent results. \r\n```\r\nvalue 48\r\nvalue 49\r\nvalue 50\r\nvalue 54\r\nvalue 51\r\nvalue 52\r\nvalue 53\r\n```\r\nMy understanding of an atomic object is it prevents its intermediate state from exposing, so it should solve the problem when one thread is reading it and the other thread is writing it. \r\n\r\nI used to think I could use std::atomic without a mutex to solve the multi-threading counter increment problem, and it didn&#39;t look like the case. \r\n\r\nI probably misunderstood what an atomic object is, Can someone explain?\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid\r\ninc(std::atomic&lt;int&gt;&amp; a)\r\n{\r\n  while (true) {\r\n    a = a + 1;\r\n    printf(&quot;value %d\\n&quot;, a.load());\r\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nint\r\nmain()\r\n{\r\n  std::atomic&lt;int&gt; a(0);\r\n  std::thread t1(inc, std::ref(a));\r\n  std::thread t2(inc, std::ref(a));\r\n  std::thread t3(inc, std::ref(a));\r\n  std::thread t4(inc, std::ref(a));\r\n  std::thread t5(inc, std::ref(a));\r\n  std::thread t6(inc, std::ref(a));\r\n\r\n  t1.join();\r\n  t2.join();\r\n  t3.join();\r\n  t4.join();\r\n  t5.join();\r\n  t6.join();\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477740/why-my-stdatomicint-variable-isnt-thread-safe","title":"Why my std::atomic&lt;int&gt; variable isn&#39;t thread-safe?"},{"tags":["swiftui"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":1909561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fab0375573b385dbce26437e8c943c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stefano Toppi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1909561/stefano-toppi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571639563,"post_id":58477859,"comment_id":103293558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477739/swiftui-navigation-multiple-back-button/58477859#comment103293558_58477859"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1212,"user_id":1007303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/affa8195b52419bcf7cffb5cf4b82681?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gene Z.

That means to move Item functionality into a List.\r\n\r\nBootstrap version\r\n-----------------\r\n*car-list-component.html*\r\n\r\n```lang-html\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\r\n    &lt;app-car-item\r\n      *ngFor=&quot;let carItem of cars&quot;\r\n      [car] = &quot;carItem&quot;\r\n    &gt;&lt;/app-car-item&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n*car-item.component.html*\r\n\r\n```lang-html\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div&gt;\r\n    &lt;a (click)=&quot;carDetail(car.id)&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;span&gt;{{ getMakeLabel(car.make)}} : {{car.carModel.modelName}} &lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/a&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div&gt;\r\n    &lt;a (click)=&quot;remove(car)&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/i&gt;\r\n    &lt;/a&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy Angular Material version with a separate item template\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n*car-list.component.html*\r\n\r\n```lang-html\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;mat-list role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;mat-list-item&gt;\r\n    &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\r\n    &lt;app-car-item\r\n      *ngFor=&quot;let carItem of cars&quot;\r\n      [car] = &quot;carItem&quot;\r\n    &gt;&lt;/app-car-item&gt;\r\n  &lt;/mat-list-item&gt;\r\n&lt;/mat-list&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**car-item.component.html** does not change.\r\n\r\nAngular Material Example with &#39;inline&#39; item template.\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nThis is presented in all examples and tutorials on Angular Material. It would work for me, but as I said before if Item(car) is a more complex object than in this example then I want to keep it separately.\r\n\r\n*car-list.component.html*\r\n```lang-html\r\n&lt;mat-list&gt;\r\n    &lt;mat-list-item *ngFor=&quot;let car of cars&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;a style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; (click)=&quot;carDetail(car.id)&quot;&gt;\r\n       &lt;span&gt;{{ getMakeLabel(car.make)}} : {{car.carModel.modelName}} &lt;/span&gt;\r\n      &lt;/a&gt;\r\n    &lt;/mat-list-item&gt;\r\n&lt;/mat-list&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477720/how-to-use-in-angular-material-list-an-item-component","title":"How to use in Angular Material List an Item component"},{"tags":["c#","list","automapper"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":973,"user_id":4727132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J71pn-HQFB8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD38/SgcooSpaJI8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Boris Sokolov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4727132/boris-sokolov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571610249,"post_id":58477718,"comment_id":103288081,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477718/c-automap-the-output-results-of-an-object-array-to-model-or-list-using-the#comment103288081_58477718"},{"owner":{"reputation":1647,"user_id":8368871,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee377d633738ab70d3a44f13662a540f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"HariHaran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8368871/hariharan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571822992,"post_id":58477718,"comment_id":103365044,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477718/c-automap-the-output-results-of-an-object-array-to-model-or-list-using-the#comment103365044_58477718"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12247832,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2058a26266e0b3687337a1aa7b70a19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"clavi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12247832/clavi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571609051,"creation_date":1571609051,"question_id":58477718,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58477718","body_markdown":"I&#39;m a beginner at C#.

There can be no &quot;rotated dimensions&quot;. Let&#39;s use a rectangle to demonstrate this.&lt;/s&gt; (I didn&#39;t undestand correctly)\r\n\r\nSuppose there&#39;s this initial rectangle:\r\n\r\n[![Initial rectangle][1]][1]\r\n\r\nand you rotate it. This is what you get:\r\n\r\n[![Rectangle after rotation][2]][2]\r\n\r\nUsing a single Vector2, you can&#39;t differentiate a &quot;rotated x\\*y rectangle&quot; from a &quot;initial (x&#39;)\\*(y&#39;) rectangle&quot;. To sufficiently describe the position of a rectangle, you need to keep the size AND the rotation in your block-describing variable.\r\n\r\nIs `x&#39;` and `y&#39;` what you wanted to know? &lt;s&gt;I doubt it.&lt;/s&gt; Oh, you do? Great!\r\n\r\nIn 3 dimensions, I would define what you&#39;re looking for as\r\n\r\n    The minimum dimensions of a rectangular box that\r\n    1. has its faces parallel to the XY, XZ and YZ planes and\r\n    2. contains another rectangular box of known dimensions and orientation.\r\n\r\nThere are possibly more elegant solutions, but I&#39;d brute force it like this:\r\n\r\n  1. Make 8 Vector3 objects (one for each vertex of your block),\r\n  2. Rotate all of them around the x-axis.\r\n  3. Rotate them (the new ones you got from &quot;2&quot;) around the y-axis.\r\n  4. Rotate them (the new ones you got from &quot;3&quot;) around the z-axis.\r\n  5. Find the min and max values of the x, y and z coordinates among all your points.\r\n  6. Your new dimensions would be (x_max-x_min), (y_max-y_min), (z_max-z_min).\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not 100% sure about this though, so make sure you verify the results!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aubb3.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7aYlO.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477701/how-to-rotate-a-vector3-of-dimensions-by-a-vector3-of-angles/58477888#58477888","title":"How to rotate a Vector3 of dimensions by a Vector3 of angles?"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":10003286,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/43b903c9518fcdf577a5f81317ba38dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10003286","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10003286/user10003286"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571618212,"creation_date":1571608909,"question_id":58477701,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58477701","body_markdown":"I have a Vector 3 of how many blocks in a grid a piece is along each axis.

Since Plotly uses geojson files vs. interacting with geopandas dataframes (I believe that&#39;s the reason), it has more stringent requirements on data formatting. Other libraries like Bokeh, contextily, or geopandas aggregate multiple rows of polygons that share a common parent before plotting them, whereas Plotly looks at them individually. In my case, since each &#39;id&#39; had mutliple sub-ids, each with their own polygon coordinates, Plotly would just pick one when plotting them. It would store the rest as points, and it would only display them if I used the &#39;fill&#39; option. Here is a rough example of what my dataframe looked like:\r\n\r\n    DAUID DBUID Total geometry\r\n    001   00101 5     Polygon(x1, y1)\r\n    001   00102 5     Polygon(x2, y2)\r\n    001   00103 5     Polygon(x3, y3)\r\n\r\nSo while the primary id and the total values stayed constant, the geometries did not. I found this out by accident when trying to write a color mapper and noticed I had duplicate entries for the DAUID. At the end, it was my fault for not using the correct database.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Plotly will be introducing geopandas support soon, so I would be curious to see if it resolves edge cases like this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58477696/plotly-choroplethmapbox-not-showing-all-polygons/58510653#58510653","title":"Plotly Choroplethmapbox not showing all polygons"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11595201,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nUs3SsWnW4s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/fASjeo4Z5-I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mohamed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11595201/mohamed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11595201,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nUs3SsWnW4s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/fASjeo4Z5-I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mohamed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11595201/mohamed"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58510653,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571770320,"creation_date":1571608864,"last_edit_date":1571691164,"question_id":58477696,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58477696","body_markdown":"I&#39;m having an odd issue with Plotly, the image below will give some context:\r\n\r\n[This is the map made with Bokeh][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[This is the map made with Plotly][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/L5PKR.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/l82ql.png\r\n\r\nThe same transformation steps are applied to both versions, however for some reason Plotly will exclude some of the shapes. \r\n\r\nThese are the transformation steps I am using:\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import plotly.io as pio\r\n    import plotly.graph_objs as go\r\n    import json\r\n    import geopandas as gpd\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n    from shapely import wkt\r\n    from bokeh.plotting import save, figure\r\n    from bokeh.models import GeoJSONDataSource, LinearColorMapper, ColorBar\r\n    from bokeh.io import show, output_file\r\n    from bokeh.palettes import brewer\r\n    \r\n    df_test = pd.read_csv(f&#39;{filepath}&#39;)\r\n    df_blocks = pd.read_csv(f&#39;{filepath}&#39;)\r\n    group_2 = df_test[[&#39;geo_name&#39;, &#39;edited_characteristics&#39;, &#39;total&#39;, &#39;male&#39;, &#39;female&#39;]]\r\n    group_2 = group_2.pivot(index=&#39;geo_name&#39;, columns=&#39;edited_characteristics&#39;, values=[&#39;total&#39;, &#39;male&#39;, &#39;female&#39;])\r\n    cat = &#39;Total - Low-income status in 2015 for the population in private households to whom low-income concepts are applicable - 100% data&#39;\r\n    group_2[&#39;LIM 0-17 percent&#39;] = (\r\n            group_2[( &#39;total&#39;, f&#39;{cat}//0 to 17 years&#39;)] /\r\n            group_2[( &#39;total&#39;, cat)]\r\n            )\r\n    group_2.reset_index(inplace=True)\r\n    g2 = group_2[[&#39;geo_name&#39;, &#39;LIM 0-17 percent&#39;]]\r\n    g2.rename(columns={&#39;geo_name&#39;: &#39;DAUID&#39;}, inplace=True)\r\n    df_g2 = pd.merge(g2, df_blocks, on=&#39;DAUID&#39;)\r\n    df_g2[&#39;geometry&#39;] = df_g2[&#39;geometry&#39;].apply(wkt.loads)\r\n        \r\n    geo_df_g2 = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df_g2, geometry=&#39;geometry&#39;)\r\n    geo_df_g2.crs = {&#39;init&#39;: &#39;epsg:3347&#39;}\r\n    geo_df_g2 = geo_df_g2.to_crs({&#39;init&#39;: &#39;epsg:4326&#39;})\r\n    geo_df_g2 = geo_df_g2[geo_df_g2[(&#39;LIM 0-17 percent&#39;, &#39;&#39;)] &lt;

Is there a way to fix this? \r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** The shapes are in the correct position, there are just a lot of them missing from the plot.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** In hopes of seeing if other Plotly modules could solve the problem, I kind of narrowed down the issue. Using the tutorial on Plotly for creating a Scattermapbox, the way they called the mapbox features worked better at revealing the inherit problems than the tutorial did on the Choroplethmapbox. Apparently what is happening is that Plotly (or Mapbox) is not recognizing several groups of nearby points as coordinates for a polygon, and hence excluding them until you specify that you want them present. This is done by setting the mapbox dictionary values for &#39;type&#39; to either &#39;fill&#39;, &#39;line&#39;, or &#39;circle&#39;. This of course leads to another issue, whereby those new shapes are not colored or labelled the same way as the original polygons since they were not there by default.\r\n\r\nHere is the code sample that helps show the problem with the polygon points not forming a complete shape:\r\n\r\n \r\n    fig = go.Figure(go.Choroplethmapbox(geojson=geo_df_g2_json,\r\n                                                \r\n                                        locations=geo_df_g2[&#39;DAUID&#39;],\r\n                                        z=geo_df_g2[&#39;LIM 0-17 percent&#39;],\r\n                                        below=&#39;traces&#39;,\r\n                                        colorscale=&#39;Viridis&#39;,\r\n                                        zauto=True,\r\n                                        marker_opacity=0.5,\r\n                                        marker_line_width=0.5)\r\n                            )\r\n    fig.update_layout(\r\n            mapbox = {\r\n                &#39;style&#39;: &#39;carto-positron&#39;,\r\n                &#39;center&#39;: {&#39;lat&#39;: 45.41117, &#39;lon&#39;: -75.69812},\r\n                &#39;zoom&#39;: 12, &#39;layers&#39;: [{\r\n                    &#39;source&#39;: {\r\n                        &#39;type&#39;: &quot;FeatureCollection&quot;,\r\n                        &#39;features&#39;: geo_df_g2_json[&#39;features&#39;]\r\n                    },\r\n                &#39;type&#39;: &#39;fill&#39;, &#39;below&#39;: &#39;traces&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;lightblue&#39;}]},\r\n            margin = {&#39;l&#39;:0, &#39;r&#39;:0, &#39;b&#39;:0, &#39;t&#39;:0})\r\n    fig.show()\r\n\r\nTo clarify my intent, there are two questions I&#39;m trying to answer:\r\n\r\n1. Why does Plotly transform some polygon coordinates to a shape and others to just the individual points?\r\n\r\n2. Is there a workaround to fill the shapes after using the above function, based on the &#39;z&#39; value?

cordova app runs the following JS. URL and code simplified for this question.\r\n\r\n    let url = &#39;https://server.com/api/call&#39;;\r\n    fetch(url)\r\n    .then(r =&gt; r.json())\r\n    .then(d =&gt; alert(&#39;response ok: &#39;+JSON.stringify(d)))\r\n    .catch(e =&gt; alert(e));\r\n\r\n`cordova run browser` alerts &quot;response ok&quot;, which is the expected result.\r\n\r\n`cordova run android` alerts `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. This occurs with the emulator from Android SDK, and with the .apk sideloaded on my android that has an active internet connection. The android can reach https://server.com/api/call through a browser, but not my app.\r\n\r\nManually calling `https://server.com/api/call` through a browser returns the expected JSON response. Therefore we know the server side is working and this is a valid call.\r\n\r\nThe api call in question returns the following response headers:\r\n\r\n    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\r\n    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, Content-Type, Accept\r\n    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS\r\n    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\n\r\n`config.xml` for the app includes `&lt;access origin=&quot;https://server.com&quot;/&gt;`\r\n\r\n`index.html` for the app includes:\r\n\r\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Security-Policy&quot; content=&quot;\r\n\t\t  default-src &#39;self&#39; gap: cdvfile: https://ssl.gstatic.com;\r\n\t\t  connect-src https://server.com/;\r\n\t\t  img-src &#39;self&#39; cdvfile: filesystem: https://server.com/img/ https://i.ytimg.com/vi/;\r\n\t\t  frame-src https://www.youtube.com/;\r\n\t\t  &quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nI have access to both the front-end and back-end. The server has a valid Standard SSL CA 2 cert. I&#39;ve read through various CORS or CSP related fixes in case that&#39;s the issue. **What else do I need to do in order to fetch the expected response from an android?**\r\n\r\n----\r\nMore things I&#39;ve tried which are not necessary for `cordova run browser` to work as expected:\r\n\r\nAdded permissions to `AndroidMainfest.xml`\r\n\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nSwapped out `fetch()` for `XMLHttpRequest()`:\r\n\r\n    let request = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n    request.open(&quot;GET&quot;, url, true);\r\n    request.onreadystatechange = function() {\r\n       if (request.readyState == 4) {\r\n           if (request.status == 200 || request.status == 0) {\r\n    \t\t   alert(request.status + &#39;: &#39; + request.responseText);\r\n           }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    request.send();\r\n\r\nIn this case, `status` returns `0` and `responseText` returns an empty string. According to https://stackoverflow.com/a/14507670/2578125, this is basically an undefined error, with the most likely cause being CORS related.\r\n\r\nChecked the following logs on the server in case there were clues about the rejected/failed/invalid response.
