console.log(&quot;inside for loop&quot;);\r\n          await accounts.push(await this.eleNames.get(i).getText());\r\n        }\r\n     \r\n        return accounts;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n\r\nand I am

want to use the QStatusBar in my python app for showing the current status of the app (as the name of the StatusBar suggests).\r\n\r\nWhenever I perform actions after the ```show()``` function of my

I am trying to open a webpage using WebBrowser, passing my app development URI to the website. The website basically just redirects to the given URI after 5 seconds. However it never seems to open anything. I&#39;ve used almost the exact same code as here: https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-webbrowser-redirect. When I load this project into expo and run, it redirects fine. However, when I copy the code for the website and app into my own project, website opens and displays, but redirect does nothing. It just stays there. Here is the code for opening the browser. \r\n\r\n    _openBrowserAsync = async () =&gt; {\r\n      try {\r\n        this._addLinkingListener();\r\n        let result = await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync(\r\n        &#39;https://wexley-auth.firebaseapp.com/?linkingUri=exp://192.168.1.2:19000&#39;\r\n        );\r\n        this._removeLinkingListener();\r\n        this.setState({ result });\r\n      } catch (error) {\r\n        alert(error);\r\n        console.log(error);\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n \r\nThe linking listener never fires the callback which should dismiss the browser. My app URI should be exp://192.168.1.2:19000 as expo developer tools shows me this when I connect over LAN. Ive also tried using Linking.makeUrl() instead of sending URI in string manually. Neither method works for me. Relevant website code:\r\n\r\n        document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, function(event) {\r\n        var links = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;a&#39;);\r\n        var baseUri=&#39;&#39;;\r\n\r\n        // Take the uri from the params\r\n        var qs = decodeURIComponent(document.location.search);\r\n        if (qs) {\r\n          baseUri = qs.split(&#39;?linkingUri=&#39;)[1];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var redirectInterval = setInterval(function() {\r\n          var countdown = document.querySelector(&#39;.countdown&#39;);\r\n          var t = parseInt(countdown.innerText, 10);\r\n          t -= 1;\r\n          if (t === 0) {\r\n            clearInterval(redirectInterval);\r\n            window.location.href = baseUri;\r\n          }\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n      });\r\n\r\nAm I missing a step? Do I need to setup a scheme for opening my app or should this work out of the box? Am I using the wrong URI? I noticed that in the example code, the app.json has the following fields that my app.json doesn&#39;t have: \r\n\r\n    &quot;scheme&quot;: &quot;expo.examples.with-webbrowser-redirect&quot;,\r\n    &quot;platforms&quot;: [\r\n      &quot;android&quot;,\r\n      &quot;ios&quot;\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498477/how-to-redirect-to-app-from-webbrowser-in-expo","title":"How to redirect to app from WebBrowser in Expo"},{"tags":["meteor"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5984,"user_id":3975309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r5v7W.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikkel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3975309/mikkel"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571737204,"post_id":58498475,"comment_id":103331385,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498475/meteor-how-can-i-see-console-log-in-the-server-side#comment103331385_58498475"},{"owner":{"reputation":1639,"user_id":290163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a22fc9279daf6bff6eba56a25de9951c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Romulus Urakagi Ts&#39;ai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/290163/romulus-urakagi-tsai"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5984,"user_id":3975309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r5v7W.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikkel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3975309/mikkel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571796155,"post_id":58498475,"comment_id":103355989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498475/meteor-how-can-i-see-console-log-in-the-server-side#comment103355989_58498475"}],"owner":{"reputation":1639,"user_id":290163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a22fc9279daf6bff6eba56a25de9951c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Romulus Urakagi Ts&#39;ai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/290163/romulus-urakagi-tsai"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571726715,"creation_date":1571726715,"question_id":58498475,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498475","body_markdown":"I&#39;m debugging a big open source project written by `meteor` (https://github.com/wekan/wekan). \r\n\r\nI added some `console.log()` debug code, use `$ meteor` to run the project under the command line, but I can&#39;t see anything printed in the console nor in the browser F12.\r\n\r\nI reached some similar questions but I can only find &quot;it just works&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s in the browser console&quot; answers.

Morning bob-12345\r\n\r\nThe Point of docker containers is to get a more flexible architecture.\r\n\r\nI will make a Example from my work life:\r\n\r\nYou have an application thats run on php7.0 you now want to test if it still works with php 7.3 so you just stops the php 7.0 container and starts the 7.3 one and checks your application. Or you want to check if it still works with ngnx and php-fpm and so on...\r\n\r\nSo it is not recommended to put your webserver your coding layer and your persisent layer in one container due versioning issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you still want to have it all in one.

question really asks 3 different things:\r\n\r\n- how to serialize a DataTable\r\n- how to change the DataTable serialization format and finally\r\n- how to replace nulls with empty strings, even though an empty string isn&#39;t a NULL.\r\n\r\nJSON.NET already handles DataSet and DataTable instance serialization with a DataTableConverter whose source can be found [here](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/blob/master/Src/Newtonsoft.Json/Converters/DataTableConverter.cs). You could just write :\r\n\r\n    var str = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(data);\r\n\r\nGiven this DataTable :\r\n\r\n    var dataTable=new DataTable();\r\n    dataTable.Columns.Add(&quot;Name&quot;,typeof(string));\r\n    dataTable.Columns.Add(&quot;SurName&quot;,typeof(string));\r\n    dataTable.Rows.Add(&quot;Moo&quot;,null);\r\n    dataTable.Rows.Add(&quot;AAA&quot;,&quot;BBB&quot;);\r\n\r\nYou get :\r\n\r\n```\r\n[{&quot;Name&quot;:&quot;Moo&quot;,&quot;SurName&quot;:null},{&quot;Name&quot;:&quot;AAA&quot;,&quot;SurName&quot;:&quot;BBB&quot;}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDataTables aren&#39;t 2D arrays and the column names and types *matter*. Generating a separate row object with named fields is far better than generating an `object[]` array. It also allows makes it far easier for clients to handle the JSON string without knowing its schema in advance. With an `object[]` for each row, the clients will have to know what&#39;s stored in each location in advance.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a different serialization format, you could customize the DataTableConverter. Another option though, is to use [DataRow.ItemArray](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.datarow.itemarray?view=netframework-4.8) to get the values as an `object[]` and LINQ to get the rows, eg :\r\n\r\n    object[][] values=dataTable.Rows.Cast&lt;DataRow&gt;()\r\n                               .Select(row=&gt;row.ItemArray)\r\n                               .ToArray();\r\n\r\nSerializing this produces :\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[&quot;Moo&quot;,null],[&quot;AAA&quot;,&quot;BBB&quot;]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there&#39;s no way to tell which item is the name and which is the surname any more.\r\n\r\nReplacing DBNulls with strings in this last form needs an extra `Select()` to replace DBNull.Value with `&quot;&quot;` :\r\n\r\n```\r\nobject[][] values=dataTable.Rows.Cast&lt;DataRow&gt;()\r\n                           .Select(row=&gt;row.ItemArray\r\n                                           .Select(x=&gt;x==DBNull.Value?&quot;&quot;:x)\r\n                                           .ToArray())\r\n                           .ToArray();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSerializing this produces :\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[&quot;Moo&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;AAA&quot;,&quot;BBB&quot;]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s what was asked, but now *we have no way to tell whether the Surname is an empty string, or just doesn&#39;t exist*. \r\n\r\nThis may sound strange, but Arabic names may be one long name without surname. Makes things interesting for airlines or travel agents that try to issue tickets (ask me how I know).\r\n\r\nWe can get rid of `ToArray()` if we use `var` :\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar values=dataTable.Rows.Cast&lt;DataRow&gt;()\r\n                         .Select(row=&gt;row.ItemArray\r\n                                         .Select(x=&gt;x==DBNull.Value?&quot;&quot;:x));\r\n```\r\n\r\nJSON serialization will work the same.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498455/remove-foreach-loop-with-the-help-of-linq/58499319#58499319","title":"Remove foreach loop with the help of linq"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":589,"user_id":1848953,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4684ebd746f5542a023cde50ee47feb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AlanK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1848953/alank"},"last_editor":{"reputation":589,"user_id":1848953,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4684ebd746f5542a023cde50ee47feb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AlanK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1848953/alank"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571742810,"last_edit_date":1571742810,"creation_date":1571730828,"answer_id":58499472,"question_id":58498455,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58499472","body_markdown":"LINQ is not a nice fit for this sort of thing because you are using explicit indexes `r` and `col` into multiple &quot;array structures&quot; (and there is no easy/tidy way to achieve multiple, parallel enumeration).\r\n\r\n**Other issues**\r\n\r\n 1. `tb` is repeatedly `new`ed, filled with data and then replaced in the next iteration, so you end up capturing only the last row of input to the JSON string - that&#39;s a logical bug and won&#39;t work as I think you intend.\r\n 2.

I am unsure of how to avoid this.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the task:\r\n\r\nWrite an application that displays every perfect number from 2 through 1,000. A perfect number is one that equals the sum of all the numbers that divide evenly into it. For example, 6 is perfect because 1, 2, and 3 divide evenly into it and their sum is 6; however, 12 is not a perfect number because 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 divide evenly into it, and their sum is greater than 12.\r\n\r\nThe provided template lays out the initial for loop to check each number beginning from 2 and going up to 1,000. In this for loop, the perfect() method is called, where you will submit your piece of code to test if each number follows the conditions described above.\r\n\r\nSet result to true if it meets those conditions and use sum to add up the numbers divisible by int n in the method&#39;s parameter.\r\n\r\n    public class Perfect{\r\n    public static void main (String args[]){\r\n      final int MAX = 1000;\r\n      for(int i = 2; i &lt;= MAX; i++)\r\n      if(perfect(i) == true)\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;The number &quot; + i + &quot; is perfect&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n            \r\n     public static boolean perfect(int n){\r\n      int sum = 1;\r\n      int i;\r\n      boolean result = false;\r\n        for (i = 2; i &lt; n / 2; i++) {\r\n            if (n % i == 0) {\r\n                sum += i;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n      if (sum == i) {\r\n      return true;\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n      return false;\r\n      }\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy output:\r\nThe number 496 is perfect\r\nThe number 729 is perfect\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\nThe number 496 is perfect\r\n\r\nIt only expects the first line printed...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498432/program-that-displays-every-perfect-number","title":"Program that displays every perfect number"},{"tags":["android"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7794,"user_id":1568530,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001179991520/picture?type=large","display_name":"Vladyslav Matviienko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1568530/vladyslav-matviienko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571729707,"post_id":58498431,"comment_id":103327306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498431/why-record-audio-permission-is-required-for-video-recording#comment103327306_58498431"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":207,"user_id":12175239,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea9cd251e76f04f3ff61f790d44ed966?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Squti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175239/squti"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571730131,"creation_date":1571730131,"answer_id":58499304,"question_id":58498431,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58499304","body_markdown":"Your application must request `CAMERA` permission to use a device camera but for recording audio with video capture, your application must request the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission too.

am trying to stream an mp4-file to a memory location and thought smem (stream to memory) in libvlc was a good idea. I am using the libvlc headers and dynamically linking to the official vlc DLLs. The smem module requires you to define some callbacks before and after a frame of the video was rendered and that is where the actual video transfer to your desired memory location takes place. To test whether or not it works I added a &quot;counter&quot; member to the ParamStruct and it would count each time it enters the VideoPrerender() function. But after setting a breakpoint after the Sleep() and checking via the VSCode watch window the variable was still at zero, so it never entered that Callback function.
