we want to launch a dozen of HTTP requests asynchronously. Does the time saved by asynchrony go up the slower your network gets?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, we can split such a request into two parts. The first one, where we&#39;re doing some lightweight CPU-bound work (initializing and finalizing the connection - contacting the networking hardware, putting the response received into an array, et cetera). And the second one, that takes much more time, where our thread is blocked as we&#39;re waiting for the data to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe goal of asynchrony is to **process the second part of all requests made concurrently**, and (unlike the CPU-bound part) we have to wait for data the longer the slower our connection is.

response to my comment.\r\nYou are chunking the upload POST or GET request and limiting it as you go, it is done on the server side. I would do the limiting on the upload side (not the response side), because that is what you are trying to control. So I would suggest this is a Python question since your upload handler is in **Python**.\r\n\r\n**Notice:**\r\n\r\n- In the example, it says read a certain size of the payload when the upload form file is selected. You grab the size.\r\n- Then you limit based on the initial size.\r\n- You will be reading chunks, then will be returning where you left off.\r\n- Set a sleep handler, to chunk it at a certain speed.\r\n- Then callback the function with the left off chunk position and read position, to continue.\r\n\r\nLimit the download GET speed, can be applied to POST also.\r\n\r\naiohttp Python example: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2638\r\n\r\n    import aiohttp\r\n    import asyncio\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    async def read(self, n: int=-1) -&gt; bytes:\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Read up to &#39;n&#39; bytes of the response payload.\r\n    \r\n        If &#39;n&#39; is -1 (default), read the entire payload.\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        if self._body is None:\r\n            try:\r\n                if n is -1:\r\n                    self._body = await self.content.read()\r\n                else:\r\n                    chunks = []\r\n                    i = 0\r\n                    while i &lt; n:\r\n                        chunk = await self.content.read(n=n - i)\r\n                        if not chunk:\r\n                            break\r\n                        chunks.append(chunk)\r\n                        i += len(chunk)\r\n    \r\n                    self._body = b&#39;&#39;.join(chunks)\r\n    \r\n                for trace in self._traces:\r\n                    await trace.send_response_chunk_received(self._body)\r\n    \r\n            except BaseException:\r\n                self.close()\r\n                raise\r\n        elif self._released:\r\n            raise aiohttp.ClientConnectionError(&#39;Connection closed&#39;)\r\n    \r\n        return self._body\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    async def f(url, n=-1):\r\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\r\n            async with session.get(url) as response:\r\n                content = await read(response, n=n)\r\n                print(len(content))\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    URL = &#39;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/2010-kodiak-bear-1.jpg/320px-2010-kodiak-bear-1.jpg&#39;\r\n    \r\n    asyncio.run(f(URL, 10_000_000))  # 10 MB\r\n    asyncio.run(f(URL, 100))\r\n    asyncio.run(f(URL))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232704/limit-http-post-upload-bandwith/58232984#58232984","title":"Limit HTTP POST upload bandwith"}],"owner":{"reputation":730,"user_id":4121210,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLgLn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"El Sampsa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4121210/el-sampsa"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570180375,"creation_date":1570178110,"question_id":58232704,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232704","body_markdown":"In my application, I&#39;m uploading continuously videoclips, worth of tens of megabytes of video to a server in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThe uploading part has been written in python aiohttp, while the receiving part in the cloud uses node.js and the &quot;request&quot; library.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to limit the bandwith of the HTTP upload, say, to 1Mbps or less.  \r\n\r\nIs this even possible within the HTTP protocol?

In views or creating simple python script?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27819151/call-postgres-sql-stored-procedure-from-django","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232699/how-to-call-stored-mysql-procedures-from-django","title":"How to call stored mysql procedures from django"},{"tags":["terraform","cloud-init"],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":10202350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cf2d3ba2e4e09b7b8d3a1b75edf2da1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Albert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10202350/albert"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570178101,"creation_date":1570178101,"question_id":58232698,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232698","body_markdown":"I have an Ubuntu image which has already nocloud-net user-data embedded and I would like to apply on the new VMs, which are going to be spawned from this image, the network config using cloud-init.

It is placed inside the `src` directory on my GOPATH. The project has the following structure:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nproject/\r\n    Dockerfile\r\n    go.mod\r\n    cmd/\r\n        cmd_pkg1/\r\n            main.go\r\n            go.mod\r\n        cmd_pkg2/\r\n            main.go\r\n            go.mod\r\n    internal/\r\n        int_pkg1/\r\n            source.go\r\n        int_pkg2/\r\n            source.go\r\n    pkg/\r\n        pkg1/\r\n            source.go\r\n        pkg2/\r\n            source.go\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n`project` is not the real name and filenames have been simplified (there are multiple files, nested directories, ...). `main.go` indicate that those packages are called `main` (executables) while `source.go` files indicate that they have a name equal to its directory (libraries). `project/go.mod` file contains the dependencies of the project, while `project/cmd/cmd_pkgX/go.mod` contain the specific package dependencies plus a `require project v0.0.0` and a `replace project =&gt; ../../` directives.\r\n\r\nA simplified version of the Dockerfile is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nARG goversion=1.12.3\r\nARG goos\r\nARG goarch\r\nARG goarm=6\r\nARG cmd\r\n\r\nFROM golang:${goversion}-stretch AS build-env\r\nENV CGO_ENABLED=0\r\nENV GO111MODULE=on\r\nENV GOOS=${goos}\r\nENV GOARCH=${goarch}\r\nENV GOARM=${goarm}\r\nENV COMMAND=${cmd}\r\nADD . /src/project\r\nWORKDIR /src/project/cmd/cmd_pkg1\r\nRUN go build -i -o /bin/app .\r\n\r\nFROM scratch\r\nCOPY --from=build-env /bin/app /\r\nENTRYPOINT [&quot;/app&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see I&#39;m declaring some args that allow me to configure different Go versions and cross compiling to any supported target. It is a multi-step process.\r\nThe first step starts from the version-specific Go image, disables `cgo`, enables modules for go 1.11 and 1.12, and passes the args as environment variables. Then it adds the whole project structure to `/src/`, sets the workdir and compiles the code.\r\nThe second step just pulls the executable binary to a scratch image and defines it as the entrypoint.\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m trying to share this Dockerfile among all the executable packages (`cmd/cmd_pkg1`, `cmd/cmd_pkg2`, ...) and for that I was trying to set a new `ARG cmd` with the executable package name (`cmd_pkg1`, `cmd_pkg2`, ...) and pass it to the `WORKDIR` command somehow.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried multiple options for the `WORKDIR` and none of them seems to work:\r\n\r\n - `/src/package/cmd/${cmd}`\r\n - `/src/package/cmd/$COMMAND`\r\n - `&quot;/src/package/cmd/$COMMAND&quot;`\r\n\r\nAll of them give the following error:\r\n\r\n`can&#39;t load package: package package/cmd: unknown import path &quot;package/cmd&quot;: cannot find module providing package package/cmd`\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to recognize the `cmd_pkg1` dir in any of the provided options.\r\n\r\nI want to keep the Dockerfile where it is, to avoid duplicated Dockerfiles and having a single entry point for CI and so on. I would also prefer avoiding automated Dockerfile generation for each of the projects from a template.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? I&#39;m quite new to go modules and haven&#39;t played that much with go build as it has worked out of the box for all of my projects until now.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232696/dynamically-change-build-target-inside-dockerfile","title":"Dynamically change build target inside Dockerfile"},{"tags":["vue.js","sass","vuetify.js"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":5233289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ocmaz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kristoffer sylte dahl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5233289/kristoffer-sylte-dahl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570451174,"post_id":58269208,"comment_id":102906055,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232691/sass-loader-error-options-has-an-unknown-property-indentedsyntax-when-upgrad/58269208#comment102906055_58269208"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10574868,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3169431fe3012906b4135bdd631964e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dral","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10574868/dral"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570449822,"creation_date":1570449822,"answer_id":58269208,"question_id":58232691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58269208","body_markdown":"I had the same issue and fixed it by downgrading `sass-loader` by setting \r\n\r\n    &quot;sass-loader&quot;: &quot;7.3.1&quot;,\r\n\r\nin `package.json`.\r\n\r\nThis was suggested on the Vuetify Discord","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232691/sass-loader-error-options-has-an-unknown-property-indentedsyntax-when-upgrad/58269208#58269208","title":"Sass-loader error &#39;options has an unknown property &#39;indentedSyntax&#39;&#39; when upgrading Vuetify from 1.5 to 2"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":5233289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ocmaz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kristoffer sylte dahl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5233289/kristoffer-sylte-dahl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":129,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58269208,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570449822,"creation_date":1570178056,"question_id":58232691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232691","body_markdown":"I am upgrading Vuetify in my Vue CLI 3 project from version 1.5 to 2.

The window has a button. When this button is pressed for the first time, recording a video file is started and the button turns red. I usually record video files for 10 minutes. When the button is pressed for the second time, recording a video file is stopped and the button turns blue.\r\n\r\nIf I record a file to the local destination (to the same computer where the program is run, for example, D:\\Media\\Video\\A, A, 1\\test.mp4), everything is ok. Recording video file is started and stopped quickly, almost immediately.\r\n\r\nThe problems occur when I try to record a file to the remote computer (for example, \\BuildSrv\\Videos\\A, A, 1\\test.mp4). Recording a video file starts immediately. However, _videoRecorder.Stop() takes approximately 30 seconds – 1 minute. Resource monitor shows very high network use (90% in case of one computer and 100% in case of another) after the button is pressed for the second time (recording video is stopped). The longer the recorded video file is, the more time is needed to stop VlcMediaPlayer.\r\n\r\nWhy does stopping VlcMediaPlayer takes so much time in case of recording an RTSP stream to the remote computer? Can this problem be solved somehow?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232672/it-takes-to-long-to-stop-vlcmediaplayer","title":"It takes to long to stop VlcMediaPlayer"},{"tags":["laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":760,"user_id":1329816,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOsmR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Melvita","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1329816/melvita"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570178344,"post_id":58232669,"comment_id":102839178,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232669/laravel-6-database-error-integrity-constraint-violation#comment102839178_58232669"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":12162884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d84a89f849434f0b49a1056245fa5571?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Johannn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12162884/johannn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":138,"user_id":12162884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d84a89f849434f0b49a1056245fa5571?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Johannn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12162884/johannn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570185230,"last_edit_date":1570185230,"creation_date":1570184714,"answer_id":58234542,"question_id":58232669,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58234542","body_markdown":"From the very limited information given, just by looking at the query it seems to be an issue with the `user_id`.

So I made the following role that I can reuse to set up the loop:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- name: apply-roles\r\n  block:\r\n    - include_role:\r\n        name: &quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;\r\n        apply:\r\n          tags: &gt;-\r\n            {%- if item.tags is defined -%}\r\n            &quot;{{ item.tags }}&quot;\r\n            {%- else -%}\r\n            &quot;&quot;\r\n            {%- endif -%}\r\n  rescue:\r\n    - debug:\r\n        msg: &quot;before notification&quot;\r\n    - include_role:\r\n        name: &quot;my-notification&quot;\r\n      vars:\r\n        msg: an error has occurred\r\n        host: &quot;{{ inventory_hostname }}&quot;\r\n        result: &quot;{{ ansible_failed_result.msg | trim | default(omit) }}&quot;\r\n        role: &quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;\r\n        error: &quot;true&quot;\r\n    - debug:\r\n        msg: &quot;after notification&quot;\r\n  always:\r\n    - debug:\r\n        msg: &quot;include completed&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen my cluster.yml snippet will become:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- hosts: k8s-cluster:calico-rr\r\n  any_errors_fatal: &quot;{{ any_errors_fatal | default(true) }}&quot;\r\n  vars:\r\n    roles:\r\n      - name: &quot;kubespray-defaults&quot;\r\n      - name: &quot;etcd&quot;\r\n        tags: etcd\r\n        etcd_cluster_setup: false\r\n        etcd_events_cluster_setup: false\r\n\r\n  tasks:\r\n  - include_tasks: roles/apply-roles/tasks/main.yml\r\n    loop: &quot;{{ roles }}&quot;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut then I don&#39;t know how to capture the `etcd_cluster_setup` and `etcd_events_cluster_setup` variables and pass them to my `apply-roles` role. I guess this way I&#39;m actually passing them to the role but then how do I apply them to the final role from within my block?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232645/ansible-apply-variables-to-role-from-inside-a-block-of-another-role","title":"Ansible apply variables to role from inside a block of another role"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37258,"user_id":387194,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc10501a6e08f9efcb42bf7b434bf1b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jcubic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/387194/jcubic"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570178217,"post_id":58232644,"comment_id":102839119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232644/access-elements-and-its-properties-from-iframe-document-to-parent-document#comment102839119_58232644"},{"owner":{"reputation":543,"user_id":6488441,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f18a3533138c04ebc98a3b9e9ae0ef66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ganesh Aher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6488441/ganesh-aher"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":37258,"user_id":387194,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc10501a6e08f9efcb42bf7b434bf1b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jcubic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/387194/jcubic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570178440,"post_id":58232644,"comment_id":102839226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232644/access-elements-and-its-properties-from-iframe-document-to-parent-document#comment102839226_58232644"},{"owner":{"reputation":7179,"user_id":1386703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6Jbm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"skobaljic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1386703/skobaljic"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570178471,"post_id":58232644,"comment_id":102839236,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232644/access-elements-and-its-properties-from-iframe-document-to-parent-document#comment102839236_58232644"},{"owner":{"reputation":145233,"user_id":5459839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iehrR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"trincot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5459839/trincot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570182865,"post_id":58232644,"comment_id":102841315,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232644/access-elements-and-its-properties-from-iframe-document-to-parent-document#comment102841315_58232644"},{"owner":{"reputation":543,"user_id":6488441,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f18a3533138c04ebc98a3b9e9ae0ef66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ganesh Aher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6488441/ganesh-aher"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":145233,"user_id":5459839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iehrR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"trincot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5459839/trincot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570182998,"post_id":58232644,"comment_id":102841390,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232644/access-elements-and-its-properties-from-iframe-document-to-parent-document#comment102841390_58232644"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":12121905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7cb6ed0c3be04a750911567fc0909b64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fawaz Ibrahim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12121905/fawaz-ibrahim"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570310665,"creation_date":1570310665,"answer_id":58252449,"question_id":58232644,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58252449","body_markdown":"First, add to your iframe an onload event, this onload will trigger a function that has two goals:\r\n\r\n - send a message to the iframe to tell the content of that iframe that it has been loaded\r\n - send page DOM to the iframe when requested\r\n\r\n**[parent file]**\r\n\r\n    &lt;iframe id=&quot;assessment&quot;

To be more exact:\r\n\r\nWhen you as client open an SSL/TLS connection to a server, as part of the handshake the server sends its certificate &#39;chain&#39; containing its own cert, plus usually one or more linked CA (Certificate Authority) certificates ending with a &#39;root&#39; CA that should be trusted. See the neighboring Stack https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20803/how-does-ssl-work/ for an epically complete explanation. Public servers normally use a cert issued and signed by a public CA like Digicert, GoDaddy, LetsEncrypt/ISRG which are already in the standard default truststore (for Java in the file `JRE/lib/security/cacerts`) so no action is needed. If a server uses a cert from a off-brand or private CA, or a self-signed cert (from no CA at all), then (for Java) _some_ cert in the chain must be added to the client truststore, or otherwise overridden; this is only required to be the _server_ cert in the case where the server cert is self-signed (which is a chain by itself and has no relevant CA certs). \r\n\r\nJava/JSSE implements this through an `SSLContext` which contains among other things a `TrustManager`, more specifically an `X509ExtendedTrustManager`, which is _initialized_ from a truststore. You can create an `SSLContext` explicitly in code from any set of trusted certs (which doesn&#39;t even need to be from a file), or use the default context which uses the default truststore file, which defaults to the filename above unless overridden by a system property. \r\n\r\nWhen the server cert chain is received it is passed to the context&#39;s TrustManager for validation; among (many!) other checks, at each level of a normal chain, or the single level of a self-signed cert, the JSSE TrustManager looks for an anchor cert with the same Subject and (Subject)PublicKey and if so uses it to validate the cert chain. Note that a normal (CA-issued) leaf cert can have Subject empty if Subject Alternative Name is used instead -- see rfc5280 and rfc2818 -- but a self-signed cert cannot, because it has Subject = Issuer and Issuer must _not_ be empty. Certs for different entities (e.g. different servers) normally are expected to have different keys, although a single entity can have multiple certs with either the same key or different keys, and might correspond to multiple server names and/or addresses.\r\n\r\nIf the certificate is determined valid in general, for _some_ TLS applications, notably HTTPS, the validator _also_ checks it is for the correct server, specifically that the CommonName attribute in the Subject field, or an entry in the Subject Alternative Name extension if present -- which for public CAs for at least a decade it is, matches the host DNS name or IP adddress in the URL. In older versions of Java (through 6 IIRC) this was not done in JSSE but rather in the calling application(s) or library, such as `HttpsURLConnection`, which as a legacy still has the option to use its own `HostnameVerifier` instead.\r\n\r\nAll of this can be altered by using a custom `TrustManager` in place of the standard one, and some things like Apache `HttpClient` do so validly, but you will find (too many) answers here and some other Stacks recommending you &#39;solve&#39; TLS errors by using a neutered `TrustManager` that just accepts any cert, regardless of whether it is actually valid and correct, and thus happily connects and sends sensitive data to, or accepts changes from, any attacker who manages to intercept the IP traffic, which is often pretty easy nowadays.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232636/how-to-handle-alias-in-truststore/58237080#58237080","title":"How to handle alias in TrustStore"}],"owner":{"reputation":784,"user_id":1652183,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pYsow.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ashokhein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1652183/ashokhein"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58237080,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570194779,"creation_date":1570177882,"question_id":58232636,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232636","body_markdown":"I am running the Java process (Microservice) and trustStore configured in the JVM parameter.

days, &lt;b&gt;source navigator&lt;/b&gt; often came to the rescue for going through big chunks of code (hello to x-users of the tool and thank you RedHat!). Lots of things changed since then and new tools have appeared, however I have a pending question in relation to code analysis and assisted code navigation:\r\n\r\n * Is there a tool that can function well in both &lt;b&gt;space&lt;/b&gt; (across complete LoC and hopefully across _multiple git repositories_) as well as &lt;b&gt;time&lt;/b&gt; (i.e. navigate easily _through commits &amp; tags_)?\r\n * If so, is said tool configurable enough so that the whole navigation experience can be mapped on, say, *modifiers+arrow keys only*?\r\n * Extra bonus points if it could analyse many languages, beyond C or Python, or it is an established IDE with further integrations etc.\r\n * Open source, please.\r\n\r\nAs an example, try to imagine exploring this codebase with its sub-repos as a first-timer, as well as a 3rd-party-provided helm chart:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/zabbix\r\n\r\nCan we do better than downloading all repos, checking out commits, and `grep -R` through them?\r\n\r\nAt the moment, what is often found convenient is a search via an organisation&#39;s github page when it exists, to identify where individual functions, variables or constants are defined, with recursive grep as second best - but the need to search and navigate through *timeline of commits* is still not served in an ideal way.\r\n\r\nIn assisted code navigation, it should be relatively easy to detect how fi. a `db` configuration parameter is being used, where and how and what is the first thing to break if it gets modified:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: List\r\nitems:\r\n  - apiversion: v1\r\n    kind: Secret\r\n    type: Opaque\r\n    metadata:\r\n      name: {{ template &quot;fullname&quot; . }}-db-secret\r\n    data:\r\n      db-root-pass: &quot;myotherpassword&quot;\r\n      db-zbx-user: &quot;hello&quot;\r\n      db-zbx-pass: &quot;world&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect to see a tool, or a list of tools, that others declare content with their level of functionality, as regards the summary stated above and the need for *assisted code navigation* in both space/time.\r\n\r\np.s. \r\nIdeally the tool should be robust and flexible enough, so that exploring f.i. linux kernel function&#39;s `netif_receive_skb_core`&#39;s calling graph should be painless and intuitive, *across commits* and different kernel versions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232614/is-there-a-source-code-analysis-tool-which-facilitates-assisted-navigation-in-b","title":"Is there a source code analysis tool, which facilitates assisted navigation in both space and time?"},{"tags":["javascript","webdriver-io"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11468717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VtWn-AEjBaM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALI/fbe2ikA-ua4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anthony Andreev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11468717/anthony-andreev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11468717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VtWn-AEjBaM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALI/fbe2ikA-ua4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anthony Andreev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11468717/anthony-andreev"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570179220,"creation_date":1570177767,"last_edit_date":1570179220,"question_id":58232613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232613","body_markdown":"I am writing **CoffeeScript** tests using **Webdriver.io** and **mocha**.

In this model will contain a field that is an array of comments for a post. I want to handle if a comment is a reply for an older comment. I did do:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst M_Posts = new Schema({\r\n    title: { type: String, required: true },\r\n    content: { type: String, required: true },\r\n    by_user: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: &#39;Users&#39; },\r\n    comments: [{\r\n        content: String,\r\n        by_user: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: &#39;Users&#39; },\r\n        reply_for: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref:&#39;posts.comments&#39; },\r\n    }],\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst Posts = mongoose.model(&#39;posts&#39;, M_Posts);\r\nPosts.create({ title: &#39;Post 1&#39;, content: &#39;Post 1 content&#39; })\r\n    .then(post =&gt; {\r\n        var comment_1 = post.comments.create({\r\n            content: &#39;Content comment 1&#39;,\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        var reply_comment_1 = post.comments.create({\r\n            content: &#39;Reply for comment 1&#39;,\r\n            reply_for: comment_1._id,\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        post.comments.push(comment_1);\r\n        post.comments.push(reply_comment_1);\r\n        return post.save();\r\n    }).then(post =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(post);\r\n        return Posts.findById(post._id).populate(&#39;comments.reply_for&#39;).exec();\r\n    }).then(console.log).catch(console.log);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect the out this code is twice print object of post created with first time is post object data will contain two comments data with second comment have `reply_for` attribute that is `_id` of first comment. And the second is the same, but the `reply_for` attribute will contain all the data of the first comment.\r\nBut the result is the first time printing the correct data. \r\n\r\n```\r\n{ _id: 5d96fb0a7f2f8a27b8504d63,\r\n  title: &#39;Post 1&#39;,\r\n  content: &#39;Post 1 content&#39;,\r\n  comments:\r\n   [ { _id: 5d96fb0c7f2f8a27b8504d64, content: &#39;Content comment 1&#39;

filter is used to filter by a range of criteria, but to get a result based on one criteria gotten by a combobox value, a simple autofilter will do the trick as so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPrivate Sub ComboBox1_Change()\r\nDim lastr As Integer\r\nlastr = Range(&quot;A&quot; &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row\r\nSheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;).Range(&quot;A1:C&quot; &amp; lastr).AutoFilter Field:=3, Criteria1:=ComboBox1.Value, Operator:=xlFilterValues\r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation: the lastrow is dimmed to take an integer (numerical whole value). Then it is determined with [the most reliable lastrow method to date](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38882823/11936678).\r\nThen the range A1 to C and your lastrow (So effectively `A1:C7` for example) and an autofilter is applied. The field is the column within your range it filters on, 3 in this case means column C (if your range was B:D instead, 3 would mean the 3rd column in the range so column D). The criteria is the value taken directly from your combobox with `ComboBox1.value`. The operator xlFilterValues means it will filter by the values found in the column, which will work even if the column has formulas.\r\n\r\nPlease note: You can get the value directly from the combobox, there is no need to put it in a cell first, but you can do so if you want. Also finding the last row of your data isn&#39;t strictly necessary in this case either, just put range as `Range(&quot;A:C&quot;)` would do as well.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\nI have also explored the `.advancedfilter` method, and even though I don&#39;t know much about it, here are my findings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPrivate Sub ComboBox1_Change()\r\nDim sh As Worksheet: Set sh = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;)\r\nDim lastr As Integer\r\nIf sh.FilterMode Then sh.ShowAllData\r\nlastr = sh.Range(&quot;A&quot; &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row\r\nsh.Range(&quot;A1:C&quot; &amp; lastr).AdvancedFilter Action:=xlFilterInPlace, CriteriaRange:=(&quot;Table1[#All]&quot;), Unique:=False\r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes: There is a combobox with linkedcell F2, the range F1:F2 is in a table called table1. I didn&#39;t get the advancedfilter to work without putting it in a table due to the advancedfilter properties. The header of table 1 needs to be exactly the header of the column you want to filter by. If you set the header to the same as column 1, it will search for the value in the table in column 1.\r\n\r\nExplanation: The worksheet dim sets the worksheet to the current file sheet1. This isn&#39;t strictly necessary, but comes in handy later on.\r\n`lastr` is the same as last time, determine the last row and apply your filter to this range. Not strictly necessary again, but in this case speeds it up quite a bit.\r\n\r\nThe `If sh.FilterMode Then sh.ShowAllData` is important for when you select a new value. It basically resets the filter so a new filter can be applied. It detects if there is a filter applied to your sheet, and then sets it to show all data. If no filter is applied this is not needed, but if you leave out the test and just put in the `showalldata` it will fail since there is nothing else to show and throw an error, therefore the test. If the filter is not reset when applying a new one it will throw an error as well, since the data isn&#39;t found (because it&#39;s filtered out by the previous one).\r\n\r\nThen the advancedfilter is applied to the range with your data as previously. The criteria is to note here: it takes the full range of Table1, in this case just the combobox value below the header identical to column 2. The advancedfilter then hides all rows that don&#39;t match these data.\r\n\r\nNotes: The advancedfilter can take much more criteria than just the one combobox value. \r\n\r\nFor every row in Table1, it will handle it as an OR statement: So if in Table 1 I have a header similar to header 2 with below it value A, and a header similar to header 3 with two rows below it value B, it will search the range for column 2 to be A OR column 3 to be B, and hides everything that doesn&#39;t match. \r\n\r\n```\r\nHeader2 | Header3 &#39;this will return rows with A under Header2 and rows with B under Header3\r\nA       | 0\r\n0       | B\r\n```\r\nAll criteria on the same row is used as an AND statement. If I have the two headers as above, but the A and B are on the same row, then the filter will search for rows with both A and B on the same line. \r\n\r\n```\r\nHeader2 | Header3 &#39;this will return rows with both A under Header2 and B under Header3\r\nA       | B\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be expanded with as many columns and values as your data has. Just note that your table cannot have empty values, as this will match with ALL your data. This is the reason advancedfilter, if used right, is much more powerful than `.autofilter` as autofilter will only search one column by default and is finicky to work with multiple criteria.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232543/advanced-filter-in-vba-excel-with-combobox/58233316#58233316","title":"Advanced filter in VBA Excel with combobox"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12061753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7612f362f9aa9e511ea59aa33e57ad21?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SometingNew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12061753/sometingnew"},"last_editor":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12061753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7612f362f9aa9e511ea59aa33e57ad21?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SometingNew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12061753/sometingnew"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58233316,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570191225,"creation_date":1570177431,"last_edit_date":1570178748,"question_id":58232543,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232543","body_markdown":"I have this Excel table and combobox with some values inside.\r\n\r\nHere is an Example\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is: \r\n\r\n**Make an advanced filter with vba on combobox1_change**\r\n\r\nHere is my code so far:\r\n\r\n    Private Sub ComboBox1_Change()\r\n\r\n    Worksheets(&quot;Foglio1&quot;).Range(&quot;F1&quot;) = Me.ComboBox1.Value\r\n    a=Application.WorksheetFunction.CountA(Worksheets(&quot;Foglio1&quot;).Range(&quot;A1:B7&quot;))\r\n    Worksheets(&quot;Foglio1&quot;).Range(&quot;A&quot;

Let&#39;s say that you branched off the main branch according to this diagram:\r\n\r\n    main:   .. A -- D\r\n                \\\r\n    feature:     B -- C\r\n\r\nAnd you have a function in a certain source code file:\r\n\r\n    function foo() {\r\n        int a = 3;\r\n        return a;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say that, for whatever reason, you decided to add one line in commit B:\r\n\r\n    function foo() {\r\n        int a = 3;\r\n        int b = 10;\r\n        return a;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the second commit C, you removed the added line, leaving the code as it was when you branched off from the main branch.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the main branch, someone else has now made a new commit D which also added a new line:\r\n\r\n    function foo() {\r\n        int a = 3;\r\n        int c = 5;\r\n        return a;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you were to rebase your feature branch on the main branch, the code would start off above with the `int c = 5` line in the D commit.  But then reapplying your first B commit would give a merge conflict, because the two parents each tried to add a new line to the same spot, in the same function.  You would resolve that conflict, and then choose whichever version you wanted.\r\n\r\n_However_, if you instead were to _merge_ the main branch into your branch, there would be no conflicts.  The reason for this is that your feature branch is starting off at the C commit, whose source code is _identical_ to the A commit in the main branch.  So, only a single change to the function would happen, coming from the main branch, and there would likely be no conflict.\r\n\r\nThe rule of thumb for merge conflicts in rebasing versus merging is that in general they may not be the same.  Rebasing reintroduces your work (commits) on top of a new base, and each re-commit can cause merge conflicts.  On the the other hand, merging introduces a single delta into your target branch, all at once.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232536/understanding-rebase-conflict-vs-merge-conflict-with-an-example/58232671#58232671","title":"Understanding rebase conflict vs merge conflict with an example"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24674,"user_id":7050130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efd06b6898f66b91234471a40cffae45?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Adelsberger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7050130/mark-adelsberger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570196669,"creation_date":1570196669,"answer_id":58237663,"question_id":58232536,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58237663","body_markdown":"In practice, conflict differences should usually arise from the fact that rebase applies commit patches one at a time whereas merge looks only at the final state of each branch (and the merge base - the last commit common to the branches).\r\n\r\nSo if you have\r\n\r\n    o --- x &lt;--(master)\r\n     \\         \r\n      A - B - C  &lt;-(feature)\r\n\r\nand want to combine `feature` with `master`, maybe `o-A` patch conflicts with `o-x` even though `o-C` patch does not - in the simplest case because `B` or `C` undoes something that `A` did.  Then a rebase will create conflicts that a merge will not.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is possible that you resolve conflicts for `A` during a rebase, and that changes the course of the rebase as it applies `B` and `C`.  That&#39;s a little harder to visualize since it depends on how you edit the worktree during rebaase conflict resolution, but in theory it could happen.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are several ways that a merge can result in different final content than a rebase.  I suppose you could manipulate those scenarios into cases where conflicts differ.\r\n\r\nWhy would the content differ?  Well it *shouldn&#39;t*, and the cases where it does are weird edge cases that, in my opinion, arise from `rebase` trying too hard to be clever - but regardless they almost never come up in practice.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232536/understanding-rebase-conflict-vs-merge-conflict-with-an-example/58237663#58237663","title":"Understanding rebase conflict vs merge conflict with an example"}],"owner":{"reputation":464,"user_id":7212809,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VlOyJEUeeSc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jExBae7iJ2ALFtcMj_6BCoHGTMgw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"nz_21","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7212809/nz-21"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58232671,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570196669,"creation_date":1570177403,"question_id":58232536,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232536","body_markdown":"I am trying to come up with an example where a rebase conflict is **different** from a merge conflict. \r\n\r\nI understand what the individual terms -- rebase and merge -- mean.

Tasks are run in awsvpc network mode. (EC2,\r\n&gt; not Fargate)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ec2, not Fargate**, different horse for different courses. The task that is run against **awsvpc network mode** has own elastic network interface (ENI), a primary private IP address, and an internal DNS hostname. so how you will access that container with AWS EC2 public IP?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The task networking features provided by the awsvpc network mode give\r\n&gt; Amazon ECS tasks the same networking properties as Amazon EC2\r\n&gt; instances. When you use the awsvpc network mode in your task\r\n&gt; definitions, every task that is launched from that task definition\r\n&gt; gets its own elastic network interface (ENI), a primary private IP\r\n&gt; address, and an internal DNS hostname. The task networking feature\r\n&gt; simplifies container networking and gives you more control over how\r\n&gt; containerized applications communicate with each other and other\r\n&gt; services within your VPCs.\r\n\r\n[task-networking][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you need to place LB and then configure your service behind LB.\r\n\r\n&gt; when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose\r\n&gt; ip as the target type, not instance. This is because tasks that use\r\n&gt; the awsvpc network mode are associated with an ENI, not with an Amazon\r\n&gt; EC2 instance.\r\n\r\nSo something wrong with the configuration or lack of understanding between network mode. I will recommend reading this [article][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; when I do docker ps inside instance, Ports column is empty.\r\n\r\nSo it might be the case below if the port column is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking\r\n&gt; performance for containers because they use the Amazon EC2 network\r\n&gt; stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge\r\n&gt; mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports\r\n&gt; are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host\r\n&gt; network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the\r\n&gt; awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host\r\n&gt; port mappings.\r\n\r\nKeep the following in mind:\r\n\r\n&gt; It’s available with the latest variant of the ECS-optimized AMI. It\r\n&gt; only affects creation of new container instances after opting into\r\n&gt; awsvpcTrunking. It only affects tasks created with awsvpc network mode\r\n&gt; and EC2 launch type. Tasks created with the AWS Fargate launch type\r\n&gt; always have a dedicated network interface, no matter how many you\r\n&gt; launch.\r\n\r\n[optimizing-amazon-ecs-task-density-using-awsvpc-network-mode][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html\r\n  [2]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/optimizing-amazon-ecs-task-density-using-awsvpc-network-mode/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58232534/cannot-access-ports-in-aws-ecs-ec2-instance/58235562#58235562","title":"Cannot access ports in AWS ECS EC2 instance"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":7125941,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b70399b3f6661f54ed2be911909cf55e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sudo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7125941/sudo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":7125941,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b70399b3f6661f54ed2be911909cf55e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sudo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7125941/sudo"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570188584,"creation_date":1570177389,"last_edit_date":1570182615,"question_id":58232534,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58232534","body_markdown":"I am running an AWS ECS service which is running a single task that has multiple containers.\r\nTasks are run in awsvpc network mode.
