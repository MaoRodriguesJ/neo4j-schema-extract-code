assumption is basically correct, at least in this case.\r\n\r\nIn general you need to check the meaning of the if-else statement and how often it is triggered. If one if-else branch is called as often as the other (or better to say complexity-like as often as other - calling it i.e. 10 times more still does not change complexity. Calling if-branch `k times` more than else-branch if `k` is constant is fine. Calling it i.e. `log n` times more does affect complexity).\r\n\r\nJust imagine the if statement would be as this:\r\n\r\n    public static long powerN(long x, int n){\r\n          if(n==0) return 1;\r\n          if(n &lt; 100){\r\n                long a = powerN(x, n-1);\r\n                return a*a;\r\n          }\r\n          else {\r\n                long a = powerN(x, (n-1)/2);\r\n                return a*a;\r\n          }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen basically the if-branch is running in constant time for n &lt; 100 and you should ignore it.\r\n\r\nOr imagine this one: This would run with `T(n/2)` up to `n = log(N)` and then `T(n-1)` for `log(N)` time. Then you simply cannot just take &quot;what is inside&quot; if-else branch and choose the bigger one.\r\n\r\n    long initialN = 10000;\r\n    long intialX = 500;\r\n    powerN(initialX, initialN);\r\n\r\n    public static long powerN(long x, int n){\r\n          if(n==0) return 1;\r\n          if(n &gt; log(initialN) ){\r\n                long a = powerN(x, n/2);\r\n                return a*a;\r\n          }\r\n          else {\r\n                long a = powerN(x, n-1);\r\n                return a*a;\r\n          }\r\n    \r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079914/recurrence-function-time-complexity-with-if-else-statement/58080222#58080222","title":"recurrence function time complexity with if-else statement"}],"owner":{"reputation":563,"user_id":7321961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8c1a12e677622cb5818e155f6190c4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jwkoo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7321961/jwkoo"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58080222,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569327681,"creation_date":1569326611,"question_id":58079914,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58079914","body_markdown":"I am having some trouble solving the time complexity of below function.\r\n\r\n    pubilc static long powerN(long x, int n){\r\n          if(n==0) return 1;\r\n          if(n%2 == 0){\r\n                long a = powerN(x, n/2);\r\n                return a*a;\r\n          }\r\n          else {\r\n                long a = powerN(x, (n-1)/2);\r\n                return a*a;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve learned that if there is an if statement, we take greater complexity of then/else statement.\r\n\r\nIn above example, both conditional statement&#39;s time complexity is same, so I concluded in this way.\r\n\r\nAssume, function powerN be T(n),\r\n\r\n    T(n) = T(n/2) + k (k is the overhead)\r\n\r\nso I concluded T(n)&#39;s time complexity is `O(logn).`\r\n\r\nBut I am still wondering if my assumptions is right.

solution I&#39;ve used places the elements in order; this avoids any problems of duplication.  It uses recursion and backtracking to find all solutions.\r\n\r\nThe critical restriction to keep from duplicating a solution is that you may not place an element into the `n`th partition unless all lower-numbered partitions are non-empty.  \r\n\r\nConsider your problem, 9 students in 3 partitions.  We start with three empty sets\r\n\r\n    {} {} {}\r\n\r\nWe now need to place students [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] into this partition set.  Call our function\r\n\r\n    place({ {}, {}, {} }, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\r\n\r\nWe place the students in order. Student 1 has only one place to go: the first partition.  Otherwise, we would violate the restriction.\r\n\r\n    place({ {1}, {}, {} }, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\r\n \r\nStudent 2 can go into either of the first two partitions (i.e. you&#39;ll need an iteration loop to cover the legal possibilities).  From here, you&#39;ll cycle through two recursive calls:\r\n\r\n    place({ {1, 2}, {}, {} }, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\r\n    place({  {1},  {2}, {} }, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\r\n\r\nIn the first call, `3` cannot yet go into the 3rd partition; in the second call, it can go anywhere.\r\n\r\nDo you see how this works?  As the partitions fill up (I infer a limit of 3 students in each group), you&#39;ll need to check for a full group, as well.  At the end, each time you place the final student, you have a valid, unique arrangement.\r\n\r\nCoding is left as an exercise for the reader.  :-)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079910/find-all-ways-to-partition-a-set-into-given-sized-subsets/58086043#58086043","title":"Find all ways to partition a set into given-sized subsets"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25485,"user_id":5483526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec50563f80bacd2a7fed69bd31d0c810?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Timmermans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5483526/matt-timmermans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569412445,"post_id":58097671,"comment_id":102587412,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079910/find-all-ways-to-partition-a-set-into-given-sized-subsets/58097671#comment102587412_58097671"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12112764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAdGL5K1-UKMUSsvfOzZrUjArT95BcIRtLjxq6Trw=k-s128","display_name":"Aksik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12112764/aksik"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25485,"user_id":5483526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec50563f80bacd2a7fed69bd31d0c810?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Timmermans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5483526/matt-timmermans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569425311,"post_id":58097671,"comment_id":102595268,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079910/find-all-ways-to-partition-a-set-into-given-sized-subsets/58097671#comment102595268_58097671"},{"owner":{"reputation":25485,"user_id":5483526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec50563f80bacd2a7fed69bd31d0c810?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Timmermans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5483526/matt-timmermans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569444604,"post_id":58097671,"comment_id":102603453,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079910/find-all-ways-to-partition-a-set-into-given-sized-subsets/58097671#comment102603453_58097671"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12112764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAdGL5K1-UKMUSsvfOzZrUjArT95BcIRtLjxq6Trw=k-s128","display_name":"Aksik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12112764/aksik"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25485,"user_id":5483526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec50563f80bacd2a7fed69bd31d0c810?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Timmermans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5483526/matt-timmermans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569449764,"post_id":58097671,"comment_id":102605000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079910/find-all-ways-to-partition-a-set-into-given-sized-subsets/58097671#comment102605000_58097671"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12112764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAdGL5K1-UKMUSsvfOzZrUjArT95BcIRtLjxq6Trw=k-s128","display_name":"Aksik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12112764/aksik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12112764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAdGL5K1-UKMUSsvfOzZrUjArT95BcIRtLjxq6Trw=k-s128","display_name":"Aksik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12112764/aksik"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569425063,"last_edit_date":1569425063,"creation_date":1569412127,"answer_id":58097671,"question_id":58079910,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58097671","body_markdown":"Well I wrote this yesterday. &lt;s&gt;It takes a lot of time to generate all solutions, but it works.

I am trying to create a `forEach` loop that will use the different names in the array to access certain properties on the objects with the same name.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  [&#39;tablet&#39;, &#39;desktop&#39;, &#39;widescreen&#39;, &#39;fullhd&#39;].forEach(type =&gt; {\r\n      css`@media screen and (min-width: ${breakpoints[type]}) {\r\n        color: ${type[color]};\r\n        background-color: ${type[bg]};\r\n      }\r\n    `;\r\n  })}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe problem is when I try to access `type[color]` or `type[bg]`.  In this case, I am trying to use `type` to reference an object called `tablet`, or `desktop`, etc.  However, I am trying to do so using the strings `tablet`, `desktop`, etc. -- and that does not work.\r\n\r\nSo, here is my question...\r\n\r\nHow can I rewrite my code so that I can loop through the values of the array to access the relevant properties on my objects with the same name?\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n \r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nHere is my full code.  Before I show the code, though, I should note that in this particular example, I am using ReactJS and Styled Components.  However, as far as I know, the question has nothing to do with either React or Styled Components -- it&#39;s a pure Javascript question:\r\n\r\nFirst, a breakpoints object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst breakpoints = {\r\n  tablet: &quot;769px&quot;,\r\n  desktop: &quot;1024px&quot;,\r\n  widescreen: &quot;1216px&quot;,\r\n  fullhd: &quot;1408px&quot;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecondly, I create an array based off of the keys of that object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst breakpointKeys = Object.keys(breakpoints);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThird, I create a function that uses that array to try and access another object (more on that below):\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst gridCSS = ({ bg, color, tablet }) =&gt; css`\r\n  background-color: ${bg};\r\n  color: ${color};\r\n  ${breakpointKeys.forEach(key =&gt; {\r\n    css`\r\n      @media screen and (min-width: ${breakpoints[key]}) {\r\n        color: ${key[color]};\r\n        background-color: ${key[bg]};\r\n      }\r\n    `;\r\n  })}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFourth, I create a Styled Component that uses that function (`${gridCSS}`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Grid = styled.div(\r\n  ({ color, bg, desktop, tablet }) =&gt; css`\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  align-content: center;\r\n  min-height: 100vh;\r\n  ${gridCSS}\r\n`\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFifth, I create a React Component with a number of props (note, in particular, the `tablet` and the `desktop` props):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Grid\r\n      color=&quot;orange&quot;\r\n      bg=&quot;lightgreen&quot;\r\n\r\n      tablet={{\r\n        color: &quot;green&quot;,\r\n        bg: &quot;orange&quot;\r\n      }}\r\n\r\n      desktop={{\r\n        color: &quot;yellow&quot;,\r\n        bg: &quot;purple&quot;\r\n      }}\r\n    &gt;\r\n      &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;h1&gt;Hello CodeSandbox&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2&gt;Start editing to see some magic happen!&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Grid&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe props `tablet` and `desktop` are the objects that I am trying to get access to from my `breakpointsKeys` array.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079882/access-object-with-same-name-as-item-in-array-javascript","title":"Access Object with Same Name as Item in Array -- Javascript"},{"tags":["numpy"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":172809,"user_id":3293881,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZYnq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Divakar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3293881/divakar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":172809,"user_id":3293881,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZYnq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Divakar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3293881/divakar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569327008,"last_edit_date":1569327008,"creation_date":1569326618,"answer_id":58079918,"question_id":58079875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58079918","body_markdown":"One way with `masking` created with `broadcatsed-comparison` -\r\n\r\n    In [43]: a # input array\r\n    Out[43]: \r\n    array([[1, 2, 3],\r\n           [4, 5, 6],\r\n           [7, 8, 9]])\r\n    \r\n    In [44]: remove_idx # indices to be removed from each row\r\n    Out[44]: array([1, 0, 2])\r\n    \r\n    In [45]: n = a.shape[1]\r\n    \r\n    In [46]: a[remove_idx[:,None]!=np.arange(n)].reshape(-1,n-1)\r\n    Out[46]: \r\n    array([[1, 3],\r\n           [5, 6],\r\n           [7, 8]])\r\n\r\nAnother `mask` based approach with the mask created with `array-assignment` -\r\n\r\n    In [47]: mask = np.ones(a.shape,dtype=bool)\r\n    \r\n    In [48]: mask[np.arange(len(remove_idx)), remove_idx] = 0\r\n    \r\n    In [49]: a[mask].reshape(-1,a.shape[1]-1)\r\n    Out[49]: \r\n    array([[1, 3],\r\n           [5, 6],\r\n           [7, 8]])\r\n\r\nAnother with `np.delete` -\r\n\r\n    In [64]: m,n = a.shape\r\n    \r\n    In [66]: np.delete(a.flat,remove_idx+n*np.arange(m)).reshape(m,-1)\r\n    Out[66]: \r\n    array([[1, 3],\r\n           [5, 6],\r\n           [7, 8]])\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079875/delete-specified-column-index-from-every-row-of-2d-numpy-array/58079918#58079918","title":"Delete specified column index from every row of 2d numpy array"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9111199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10159701985845704/picture?type=large","display_name":"Khubaib Siddiqui","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9111199/khubaib-siddiqui"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58079918,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569327008,"creation_date":1569326469,"question_id":58079875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58079875","body_markdown":"I have a numpy array A as follows:\r\n```\r\narray([[1, 2, 3],\r\n       [4, 5, 6],\r\n       [7, 8, 9]])\r\n```\r\nand another numpy array column_indices_to_be_deleted as follows:\r\n```\r\narray([1, 0, 2])\r\n```\r\nI want to delete the element from every row of A specified by the column indices in column_indices_to_be_deleted.

I am completely new to WordPress (but not to software development) and am just trying to help my brother out. He has a simple web site right now, that just displays what can best be described as an online brochure of his business.\r\n\r\nNow he would like to also start sharing some files with his customers. Today he does this through emails, but these get lost and people keep requesting them over and over. These files are PDFs, PowerPoint slides, images etc. No more than a handful per client.\r\n\r\nSo he is looking for a plugin for WordPress where he can upload these files in the wp-admin tool, and then in that list assign users that can download these files... or alternatively on the user assign the files they can download.\r\n\r\nWhen a user logs in he would like to display a list of the files they can download. \r\n\r\nHe is not interested in letting the users register or manage their profile themselves. He would like to do that from within wp-admin himself.\r\n\r\nI have looked a number of membership plugins, but none of them seem to provide this functionality. Can anyone tell me if such a plugin exist and where I might find it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079827/file-sharing-plugin-for-wordpress","title":"File sharing plugin for WordPress"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":709,"user_id":1428102,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEl5y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"abhilb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1428102/abhilb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569327688,"post_id":58079826,"comment_id":102554682,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079826/reading-unstructured-txt-file-into-dataframe#comment102554682_58079826"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1035,"user_id":3866678,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7yZyO.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael Gardner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3866678/michael-gardner"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569330051,"creation_date":1569330051,"answer_id":58080915,"question_id":58079826,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58080915","body_markdown":"This works with your sample data but you may need to tweak some things with your real data.\r\n\r\nData:\r\n\r\n    2019-09-26 14:15:44 discount=1e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:16:44 discount=4e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:17:44 discount=2e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:18:44 discount=3e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:19:44 discount=2e\r\n    some text\r\n    some text\r\n    some text \r\n    Products: sold = 5, bought = 5, left = 0 (20% profit),\r\n    2019-09-26 14:20:44 discount=1e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:21:44 discount=4e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:22:44 discount=2e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:23:44 discount=3e\r\n    2019-09-26 14:24:44 discount=2e\r\n    some text\r\n    some text\r\n    some text \r\n    Products: sold = 5, bought = 5, left = 0 (15% profit)\r\n\r\nIn:\r\n\r\n    # range(12) because the expected input was 12 fields.

Now, if I right-click the taskbar icon and pin/unpin once, the new taskbar icon is shown correctly.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help how to resolve this issue?\r\n\r\nNote: The dynamic taskbar icon is not an .ICO file but some png or jpg file.\r\n \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079821/how-to-dynamically-set-the-taskbar-icon-image-on-application-launch","title":"How to dynamically set the taskbar icon image on application launch?"},{"tags":["loops","ansible","nested-loops"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":417,"user_id":11399171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8657014bd1dc98427ba8a4e5c6ee0774?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11399171/ash"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569331133,"post_id":58079816,"comment_id":102556750,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079816/error-with-ansible-include-tasks-while-adding-dynamic-hosts-in-nested-loop#comment102556750_58079816"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10041,"user_id":1023464,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BBmr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cyprian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1023464/cyprian"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569331144,"creation_date":1569331144,"answer_id":58081249,"question_id":58079816,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58081249","body_markdown":"Perhaps you forgot `vars` parameter, so:\r\n\r\n    include_tasks: &quot;{{ playbook_dir }}/gethosts.yml&quot;\r\n    vars:  #  &lt;------------------------------------------- HERE\r\n        dest_ip: &quot;{{ item.split(&#39;\\t&#39;)[0] }}&quot;\r\n        groups: dest_nodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079816/error-with-ansible-include-tasks-while-adding-dynamic-hosts-in-nested-loop/58081249#58081249","title":"Error with Ansible include_tasks while adding dynamic hosts in nested loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":11143113,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae3b356eba312d7102c2b69d594876e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ashar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11143113/ashar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6329,"user_id":2123530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/37a7fba006184897e8d74f1795e2835b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"β.εηοιτ.βε","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2123530/%ce%b2-%ce%b5%ce%b7%ce%bf%ce%b9%cf%84-%ce%b2%ce%b5"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58081249,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569354755,"creation_date":1569326257,"last_edit_date":1569354755,"question_id":58079816,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58079816","body_markdown":"Below is the playbook with import_tasks `get_hosts.yml` for building dynamic hosts in a nested loop.

Scanleft is not pararellizable, but in my case I only want to apply this function to the elements that are already in the same partition. Therefore operation can be exectued in parallel in each partition. (No data shuffling)\r\n\r\nConsider following example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n| partitionKey \t| orderColumn \t| value \t| scanLeft(0)(_+_) \t|\r\n|--------------\t|-------------\t|-------\t|------------------\t|\r\n| 1            \t| 1           \t| 1     \t| 1                \t|\r\n| 1            \t| 2           \t| 2     \t| 3                \t|\r\n| 2            \t| 1           \t| 3     \t| 3                \t|\r\n| 2            \t| 2           \t| 4     \t| 7                \t|\r\n| 1            \t| 3           \t| 5     \t| 8                \t|\r\n| 2            \t| 3           \t| 6     \t| 13               \t|\r\n```\r\nI want to scanLeft the values within the same partition, and create a new column to store the result.\r\n\r\nMy code for now would look sth like this:\r\n```scala\r\n    inDataframe\r\n      .repartition(col(&quot;partitionKey&quot;))\r\n      .foreachPartition{\r\n      partition =&gt;\r\n        partition.map(row =&gt; row(1).asInstanceOf[Double])\r\n      .scanLeft(0.0)(_+_)\r\n      .foreach(println(_))\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis aggregates the values as I want and prints out the result, however I want to add these values as a new column of dataframe\r\n\r\nAny idea of how to do it?\r\n\r\n----edit----\r\nThe real use case is to calculate time-weighted rate of return (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/time-weightedror.asp)\r\nExpected input look sth like this:\r\n```\r\n| product \t| valuation date \t| daily return \t|\r\n|---------\t|----------------\t|--------------\t|\r\n| 1       \t| 2019-01-01     \t| 0.1          \t|\r\n| 1       \t| 2019-01-02     \t| 0.2          \t|\r\n| 1       \t| 2019-01-03     \t| 0.3          \t|\r\n| 2       \t| 2019-01-01     \t| 0.4          \t|\r\n| 2       \t| 2019-01-02     \t| 0.5          \t|\r\n| 2       \t| 2019-01-03     \t| 0.6          \t|\r\n```\r\nI want to calculate the cumulated return per product for all dates until the current one. Dataframe is partitioned by product, and partitions are ordered by valuation date. I already wrote the aggregation fuction to pass into scanLeft:\r\n```scala\r\n  def chain_ret (x: Double, y: Double): Double = {\r\n    (1 + x) * (1 + y) - 1\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nExpected return data:\r\n```\r\n| product \t| valuation date \t| daily return \t| cumulated return \t|\r\n|---------\t|----------------\t|--------------\t|------------------\t|\r\n| 1       \t| 2019-01-01     \t| 0.1          \t| 0.1              \t|\r\n| 1       \t| 2019-01-02     \t| 0.2          \t| 0.32             \t|\r\n| 1       \t| 2019-01-03     \t| 0.3          \t| 0.716            \t|\r\n| 2       \t| 2019-01-01     \t| 0.4          \t| 0.4              \t|\r\n| 2       \t| 2019-01-02     \t| 0.5          \t| 1.1              \t|\r\n| 2       \t| 2019-01-03     \t| 0.6          \t| 2.36             \t|\r\n```\r\n\r\nI already solved this issue, by filtering dataframe for given range of dates and applying and UDAF to it. (look below) It is very long and I think with scanLeft it will be much faster! \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    while(endPeriod.isBefore(end)) {\r\n      val filtered = inDataframe\r\n

However, that means that the price is not part of the source document and therefore ReactiveSearch can&#39;t see it and therefore can&#39;t sort on it.)\r\n \r\n\r\nUpdate: here is the query generated by ReactiveSearch to which I need to append the limit on prices:\r\n\r\n```{\r\n   &quot;query&quot;:{\r\n      &quot;bool&quot;:{\r\n         &quot;must&quot;:[\r\n            {\r\n               &quot;bool&quot;:{\r\n                  &quot;must&quot;:[\r\n                     {\r\n                        &quot;bool&quot;:{\r\n                           &quot;must&quot;:[\r\n                              {\r\n                                 &quot;bool&quot;:{\r\n                                    &quot;should&quot;:[\r\n                                       {\r\n                                          &quot;multi_match&quot;:{\r\n                                             &quot;query&quot;:&quot;m4 washer&quot;,\r\n                                             &quot;fields&quot;:[\r\n                                                &quot;Name_en&quot;\r\n                                             ],\r\n                                             &quot;type&quot;:&quot;cross_fields&quot;,\r\n                                             &quot;operator&quot;:&quot;and&quot;\r\n                                          }\r\n                                       },\r\n                                       {\r\n                                          &quot;multi_match&quot;:{\r\n                                             &quot;query&quot;:&quot;m4 washer&quot;,\r\n                                             &quot;fields&quot;:[\r\n                                                &quot;Name_en&quot;\r\n                                             ],\r\n                                             &quot;type&quot;:&quot;phrase_prefix&quot;,\r\n                                             &quot;operator&quot;:&quot;and&quot;\r\n                                          }\r\n                                       }\r\n                                    ],\r\n                                    &quot;minimum_should_match&quot;:&quot;1&quot;\r\n                                 }\r\n                              }\r\n                           ]\r\n                        }\r\n                     }\r\n                  ]\r\n               }\r\n            }\r\n         ],\r\n&quot;filter&quot;: [            \r\n        {\r\n          &quot;nested&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;path&quot;: &quot;Prices&quot;,\r\n            &quot;query&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;term&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;Prices.CompanyId&quot;: 1474\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;inner_hits&quot;: {}\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\t\t \r\n      }\r\n   },\r\n   &quot;size&quot;:10,\r\n   &quot;aggs&quot;:{\r\n      &quot;CompanyName.raw&quot;:{\r\n         &quot;terms&quot;:{\r\n            &quot;field&quot;:&quot;CompanyName.raw&quot;,\r\n            &quot;size&quot;:1000,\r\n            &quot;order&quot;:{\r\n               &quot;_count&quot;:&quot;desc&quot;\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   },\r\n   &quot;_source&quot;:{\r\n      &quot;excludes&quot;:[\r\n         &quot;PurchasingViews&quot;,\r\n         &quot;ContractFilters&quot;,\r\n         &quot;SearchField*&quot;,\r\n         &quot;Keywords*&quot;,\r\n         &quot;Menus*&quot;\r\n      ]\r\n   },\r\n   &quot;from&quot;:0,\r\n   &quot;sort&quot;:[\r\n      {\r\n         &quot;Name_en.raw&quot;:{\r\n            &quot;order&quot;:&quot;asc&quot;\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   ],\r\n   &quot;script_fields&quot;:{\r\n      &quot;price&quot;:{\r\n         &quot;script&quot;:{\r\n            &quot;lang&quot;:&quot;painless&quot;,\r\n            &quot;inline&quot;:&quot;if(params[&#39;_source&#39;][&#39;Prices&#39;] != null){for(p in params[&#39;_source&#39;][&#39;Prices&#39;]){ if(p.CompanyId == 1474) return p.Price;

One function is returning an encrypted value and when i log it with    \r\n\r\n    fmt.println(...)\r\n\r\nIt does not match the return value I&#39;m logging in c# \r\n\r\n    Console.writeln(...)\r\n\r\nI tried different functions:\r\n\r\n    Marshal.PtrToStringAuto(...)\r\n    Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi(...)\r\n    Marshal.PtrToStringUTF8(...)\r\n    Marshal.PtrToStringUni(...)\r\n    \r\nAfter using the C Library I had problems with the strings in go too.

Question is, provided that I have this ID and the user has the right permissions, is there any way to accomplish this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58079696/open-exchange-email-from-identifier","title":"Open Exchange email from identifier"},{"tags":["ios12","ios13","xcode11","swift5.1"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":789,"user_id":3359372,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6vwP1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mohsin Khubaib Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3359372/mohsin-khubaib-ahmed"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569480331,"creation_date":1569480331,"answer_id":58110965,"question_id":58079695,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58110965","body_markdown":"Wohoo! I finally figured it out. So before as default it was working on **iOS-12** but after **iOS-13** and `UITableViewCell` changes as described in the question, it stopped working. Here is what I did: \r\n\r\n 1. Firstly, in the **Size Inspector**, the `ContentView` of `UITableViewCell` was set to `Safe Area Layout Guide` which I turned off and turned on `Safe Area Relative Margins`, similarly I did the same for the child, as in the **PriceView**. \r\n 2. Secondly, in the **Attributes Inspector**, the `ContentView`&#39;s and `UITableViewCell`&#39;s both had their `Autoresize Subviews` property turned on, I simply turned it off\r\n \r\nAnd voila!

The `UITableViewCell` has certain `UIView`s which are set as negative constraints from Top and are shown perfectly on **iOS-12** whereas when observed on **iOS-13** the `UIView`s showing over Parallax Header are clipped. I have tried all possible solutions but unfortunately it still shows the same. My App is opting out of SwiftUI and still running the old code. I have even tried to change the `zIndex` of the child `UIView` but still the same. Here are some snapshots and some code:\r\n\r\n    override func awakeFromNib() {\r\n        super.awakeFromNib()\r\n        // Initialization code\r\n\r\n        self.PriceView.layer.zPosition = 1\r\n        self.PriceView.bringSubviewToFront(self.contentView)\r\n        self.PriceView.setNeedsDisplay()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis code is functional for **iOS-12** but not **iOS-13**.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nApple&#39;s changelog/documentation for **iOS-13** suggests:\r\n\r\n&gt; The UITableViewCell class’s contentView property is always laid out\r\n&gt; edge-to-edge with adjacent accessories, both on the leading and the\r\n&gt; trailing side. This streamlines the layout code so developers who want\r\n&gt; the correct default offset no longer have to align their content with\r\n&gt; the content view border or the layout margin depending on whether\r\n&gt; there is an accessory on the trailing side or not. You should now\r\n&gt; always lay out their code on the layout margins of the cell’s content\r\n&gt; view to get the default system insets. These insets will be adjusted\r\n&gt; automatically based on the accessories visible in the cell to match\r\n&gt; the system’s default spacing. (48214114)\r\n\r\nThis is a bit unclear to me and if someone can help me out here.\r\n\r\nHere are the snapshots as to how it is showing in **iOS-12** which is required and how it is showing in **iOS-13** respectively:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd here observe for **iOS-13**:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nHere is also the Constraint Layout of my `UITableViewCell`&#39;s `PriceView`:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nI need both to be consistent on both OSes.
