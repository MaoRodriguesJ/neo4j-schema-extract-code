Idea is to load that folder into say something like hive periodically so that I can run queries to check previous states of certain rows, columns. Now, these are very high transactional tables and the dump does not need to be real time. It can be in batches, every hour. I want to avoid a trigger firing hundreds of times every minute.

I tried to read through https://js.stripe.com/v3/ to see why Stripe would be undefined. My javascript skills are pretty weak and it is clearly minified/obfuscated so I&#39;m having a difficult time understanding how and why `Stripe` would be undefined. It looks like it&#39;s declared dynamically, but what about the emulated browser is causing it to be undefined?\r\n\r\n\r\n **--------------Update 9-23-19---------------**\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter @duck suggested it might be a problem with my script running before the stripe script was loaded I changed the html to sequence the redirect function to run after stripe was loaded:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;Payments&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n        function redirectToCheckout(evt){\r\n            try {\r\n                document.writeln(&#39;loading stripe.js&#39;)\r\n                var stripe = Stripe(&#39;REDACTED&#39;);\r\n                document.writeln(&#39;redirecting to checkout&#39;);\r\n                stripe.redirectToCheckout({\r\n                    sessionId: &#39;REDACTED&#39;\r\n                }).then(function (result) {\r\n                });\r\n                document.writeln(&#39;done calling javascript&#39;);\r\n            }\r\n            catch(error) {\r\n                document.writeln(&#39;error occurred: &#39;

But if the basic Sequelize setup works on a good set of data, you can enhance the WHERE clause to test for numeric &quot;value&quot; data, there are good examples here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19975257/postgres-query-to-check-a-string-is-a-number\r\n\r\nHopefully this gets you close. In my experience with Sequelize + Postgres, it helps to run the program in such a way that you see what queries it creates, like in a terminal where the output is streaming. On the way to a working statement, you&#39;ll either create objects which Sequelize doesn&#39;t like, or Sequelize will create bad queries which Postgres doesn&#39;t like. If the query looks close, take it into pgAdmin for further work, then try to reproduce your adjustments in Sequelize.

You are allocating for a *pointer-to-pointer to type* where you first allocate pointers, and then a block of storage for each object and then you assign the beginning address for each block of storage to a pointer. (Rule: a pointer is not an array, and an array is not a pointer -- though on access an array is converted to a pointer to the first element pursuant to [C11 Standard - 6.3.2.1(p3)](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#6.3.2.1p3))\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nYour only problem is attempting to `free (results[a]-&gt;name);` which is not allocated, and then your failure to ***validate the return*** of each allocation. Other than that, you are very very close. You knew what you needed to `free` and the order to do it in, the `free(results[a]-&gt;name);` looks more like a `&quot;...duh...&quot;` error than any failure in understanding.\r\n\r\nYou can also size the *type* for each allocation by using the *dereferenced pointer* rather than trying to recall the `X-type` for `sizeof(X-type)` which can be error-prone in circumstances. For example, instead of:\r\n\r\n        calc_result** results = malloc(sizeof(calc_result*)*calcsPerChunk);\r\n\r\nYou can use the `sizeof *results` (the dereferenced pointer) to set the size of each object, e.g.\r\n\r\n        calc_results **results = malloc (sizeof *results * calcsPerChunk);\r\n\r\n**Note:** the `&#39;*&#39;` or `&#39;**&#39;` generally goes with the pointer and not the type. Why?, semantics and making what the pointer is explicit. For example:\r\n\r\n        calc_results* a, b, c;\r\n\r\ncertainly does NOT declare *3-pointers to* `calc_result`. Instead it declares *pointer to* `calc_result a` and two `struct calc_result b, c`. Ensuring the `&#39;*&#39;` is on the pointer makes that clear, e.g.\r\n\r\n        calc_results *a, b, c;\r\n\r\n(legal syntax-wise, it makes no difference, the compiler can parse it without any problem -- it&#39;s the human-side where the problems tend to occur)\r\n\r\n**A Quick Example Confirming Your Approach**\r\n\r\nFor testing, you don&#39;t need:\r\n\r\n    int numChunks = 10;\r\n    int calcsPerChunk = 50;\r\n\r\n(`3` and `5` (or anything more than `1`) will do)\r\n\r\nPutting together a short example that validates each allocation as well as sizes each allocation by using the dereferenced pointer, (and spits out output for each level just for fun) you could do:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    typedef struct {\r\n        char *name;\r\n        int index;\r\n        char **finals;\r\n    } calc_results;\r\n    \r\n    int main(void)\r\n    {\r\n        int numChunks = 3;\r\n        int calcsPerChunk = 5;\r\n    \r\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; numChunks; i++) {\r\n            calc_results **results = malloc (sizeof *results * calcsPerChunk);\r\n            if (!results) {\r\n                perror (&quot;malloc-results&quot;);\r\n                return 1;\r\n            }\r\n            for(int j = 0; j &lt; calcsPerChunk; j++)\r\n            {\r\n                if (!(results[j] = malloc (sizeof *results[j]))) {\r\n                    perror (&quot;malloc-results[j]&quot;);\r\n                    return 1;\r\n                }\r\n                results[j]-&gt;name = &quot;blah&quot;;\r\n                results[j]-&gt;index = j;\r\n                if (!(results[j]-&gt;finals=malloc(sizeof *results[j]-&gt;finals*12))) {\r\n                    perror (&quot;malloc-results[j]-&gt;finals&quot;);\r\n                    return 1;\r\n                }\r\n                for(int k = 0; k &lt; 12; k++) {\r\n                    if (!(results[j]-&gt;finals[k] = malloc(70))) {\r\n                        perror (&quot;malloc-results[j]-&gt;finals[k]&quot;);\r\n                        return 1;\r\n                    }\r\n                    sprintf (results[j]-&gt;finals[k], &quot;grade %d&quot;, k+1);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            /* DO ACTUAL WORK */\r\n            \r\n            /* output &amp; free stuff */\r\n            printf (&quot;results[%2d]\\n&quot;, i);\r\n            for (int a = 0; a &lt; calcsPerChunk; a++) {\r\n                printf (&quot;  %s %2d\\n&quot;, results[a]-&gt;name, results[a]-&gt;index);\r\n                for (int b = 0; b &lt; 12; b++) {\r\n                    printf (&quot;    %s\\n&quot;, results[a]-&gt;finals[b]);\r\n                    free (results[a]-&gt;finals[b]);\r\n                }\r\n                // free(results[a]-&gt;name);\r\n                free(results[a]-&gt;finals);\r\n                free(results[a]);\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            free(results);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Memory Use/Error Check**\r\n\r\nNow for the critical part. In any code you write that dynamically allocates memory, you have 2 *responsibilities* regarding any block of memory allocated: (1) *always preserve a pointer to the starting address* for the block of memory so, (2) it can be *freed* when it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that you use a memory error checking program to insure you do not attempt to access memory or write beyond/outside the bounds of your allocated block, attempt to read or base a conditional jump on an uninitialized value, and finally, to confirm that you free all the memory you have allocated. \r\n\r\nFor Linux `valgrind` is the normal choice. There are similar memory checkers for every platform. They are all simple to use, just run your program through it.\r\n\r\n    $ valgrind ./bin/free_nested_struct\r\n    ==13663== Memcheck, a memory error detector\r\n    ==13663== Copyright (C) 2002-2015, and GNU GPL&#39;d, by Julian Seward et al.\r\n    ==13663== Using Valgrind-3.12.0 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info\r\n    ==13663== Command: ./bin/free_nested_struct\r\n    ==13663==\r\n    results[ 0]\r\n      blah  0\r\n        grade 1\r\n        grade 2\r\n        grade 3\r\n        grade 4\r\n        grade 5\r\n        grade 6\r\n        ...\r\n        &lt;snip&gt;\r\n    ==13663==\r\n    ==13663== HEAP SUMMARY:\r\n    ==13663==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\r\n    ==13663==   total heap usage: 213 allocs, 213 frees, 14,520 bytes allocated\r\n    ==13663==\r\n    ==13663== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible\r\n    ==13663==\r\n    ==13663== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v\r\n    ==13663== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)\r\n\r\nAlways confirm that you have freed all memory you have allocated and that there are no memory errors.\r\n\r\nLook things over and let me know if you have further questions. You really were very close, and I suspect you are actually allocating for `name` in your actual code, so more than likely, your code should have worked.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984213/trouble-freeing-2d-array-in-2d-array-in-c/57985432#57985432","title":"Trouble freeing 2d array in 2d array in c"}],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":10066877,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ddc2e8e418dac7f625500e9e36c82ffd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MrPuzzler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10066877/mrpuzzler"},"last_editor":{"reputation":452,"user_id":3197387,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45ec27435a4e7d85c8eb8b5e4799abc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sisir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3197387/sisir"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57985432,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568788291,"creation_date":1568773274,"last_edit_date":1568788291,"question_id":57984213,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57984213","body_markdown":"Brief overview of my program: it takes in a list of about 500 sets of initial parameters.  It then splits those 500 into &quot;chunks&quot; of 50 so it can calculate the 50 and write the results to file, then move on to the next &quot;chunk&quot; of 50, etc.  It&#39;s a checkpointing system.  Anyway, for every &quot;chunk&quot;, an array of structs called `calc_result` is created to hold 50 results.  Each `calc_result` consists of a name, an index, and a 2d char array for the actual results.  Then work is done and written to file, and the current `calc_result` array is freed.

The approach you went with is being able to query appointments by accountId.\r\n\r\nTo get more granular with an approach that may allow you to more easily adapt to user-specific/permissions-based access, since you said *admins*, is to store a list of users who are authorized to access a given document. This might look something like this:\r\n\r\n    appointments: [\r\n      { id: &#39;randomlyGenerated1&#39;, accountId: &#39;abc123&#39;, users: [&#39;wmYUjdnJKks&#39;, &#39;user2&#39;] },\r\n      { id: &#39;randomlyGenerated2&#39;, accountId: &#39;def456&#39;, users: [&#39;yuRVjGnBLkm&#39;, &#39;user4&#39; },\r\n      ...\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nWhere this might come into play would be if an admin can see an appointment a user shouldn&#39;t, you can either query by accountId or query where the `array contains` the user&#39;s ID. This will involve keeping the lists of users updated.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can just give each person a role and query for that. Nicely, you can use numbers to define the roles, e.g. 10 = admin, and query for role &gt; 6. That way you can easy set the permissions thresholds, but of course you&#39;d be trading off user-specific permissions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984186/designing-firestore-database-for-app-with-many-users-per-account/57984581#57984581","title":"Designing Firestore database for app with many users per account"}],"owner":{"reputation":1355,"user_id":1044858,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72632ab377a3840f05e4f6b06ed1d6d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Brett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1044858/brett"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568776699,"creation_date":1568773072,"question_id":57984186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57984186","body_markdown":"I am a UI developer with almost no database/backend experience. I am creating an app for scheduling appointments with Angular, NgRx, Firestore, and Firebase Auth. I&#39;ve done some research and have a general feel for how to design a NoSQL database, but I get the feeling that I&#39;m going about things in a weird way.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have a working frontend and have setup Firebase Authentication, so I can successfully register and login. My issue is figuring out a good way to know which account each user is associated with, as there can potentially be many users per account. For more context, each account is a company and each user is either an admin, client, or employee.\r\n\r\nMy current solution, that is working but seems hacky, is to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. When an admin registers, I create a new account in my `accounts` collection as well as a new user in my `users` collection, which is a sibling to `accounts`. I generate an `id` for the new account object and use the same one for an `accountId` in the new user object. Each user also contains an `id`, which matches the `uid` generated via Firebase Authentication.\r\n2. When a user logs in, I grab their `uid` that is returned from Firebase Auth and use that to find the `user` object with a matching `id` from the `users` collection I created. From that object, I grab the `accountId` stored in there and use that for all of my API calls so I can get account specific data.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a simplified example of what my data looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n    accounts: [\r\n      { id: &#39;abc123&#39;, appointments: [...], clients: [...], employees: [], ... },\r\n      { id: &#39;def456&#39;, appointments: [...], clients: [...], employees: [], ... },\r\n      ...\r\n    ];\r\n    \r\n    // id matches uid from Firebase Auth.\r\n    // accountId is used to find which account to get data from\r\n    users: [\r\n      { id: &#39;wmYUjdnJKks&#39;, accountId: &#39;abc123&#39; },\r\n      { id: &#39;yuRVjGnBLkm&#39;, accountId: &#39;def456&#39; },\r\n      ...\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nSo if I want to get a list of all the appointments for a specific account, I will do something like this:\r\n\r\n    this.afs\r\n      .collection(&#39;accounts&#39;)\r\n      .doc(accountId)\r\n      .collection&lt;Appointment&gt;(&#39;appointments&#39;)\r\n      .get()\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not yet worked out how I will handle clients and employees registering and knowing how to associate them with the correct account.\r\n\r\nHopefully this isn&#39;t the wrong type of question to ask on here, but I don&#39;t want to take a bad approach to setting all this up only to have to do major refactoring later. If there are any recommendations on how to set up Firestore for an app like this, both for admins and for clients/employees, it would be very much appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984186/designing-firestore-database-for-app-with-many-users-per-account","title":"Designing Firestore database for app with many users per account"},{"tags":["swift","measurement","nsmeasurement"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3993,"user_id":884674,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4fZh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jeet.chanchawat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/884674/jeet-chanchawat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568865181,"post_id":57984343,"comment_id":102412035,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984184/add-more-conversion-units-to-existing-apple-classes-of-conversion/57984343#comment102412035_57984343"},{"owner":{"reputation":37561,"user_id":3141234,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J3g7n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3141234/alexander"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3993,"user_id":884674,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4fZh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jeet.chanchawat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/884674/jeet-chanchawat"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568866074,"post_id":57984343,"comment_id":102412196,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984184/add-more-conversion-units-to-existing-apple-classes-of-conversion/57984343#comment102412196_57984343"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":37561,"user_id":3141234,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J3g7n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3141234/alexander"},"last_editor":{"reputation":37561,"user_id":3141234,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J3g7n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3141234/alexander"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568775499,"last_edit_date":1568775499,"creation_date":1568774593,"answer_id":57984343,"question_id":57984184,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57984343","body_markdown":"Just follow the documentation in [`Dimension`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dimension), which is the superclass of `UnitTemperature`.\r\n\r\n`UnitTemperature`&#39;s base unit is Kelvin.

What am I missing?\r\n\r\n```alloy\r\n\r\nsig Data {}\r\nsig Val {}\r\n\r\nsig Dynamic {\r\n  d2v: Data -&gt; lone Val,\r\n}\r\n\r\npred nullify [dyn, dyn&#39;: Dynamic, d:Data] {\r\n  d in dyn.d2v.univ implies\r\n    dyn&#39;.d2v = dyn.d2v - (d -&gt; d.(dyn.d2v))\r\n  else\r\n     dyn&#39;.d2v = dyn.d2v\r\n}\r\n \r\nrun nullify for exactly 3 Data,\r\n                exactly 3 Val,\r\n                exactly 2 Dynamic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example evaluation of the two instances of Dynamic.d2v from Alloy:\r\n```\r\nsig Dynamic\r\n   Dynamic$0\r\n      field d2v\r\n         Data$2 -&gt; Val$2\r\n   Dynamic$1\r\n      field d2v\r\n         Data$0 -&gt; Val$1\r\n         Data$1 -&gt; Val$0\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhere Data$2 is the argument of remove predicate. What I would expect, for instance, is the following:\r\n```\r\nsig Dynamic\r\n   Dynamic$0\r\n      field d2v\r\n         Data$2 -&gt; Val$2\r\n         Data$0 -&gt; Val$1\r\n         Data$1 -&gt; Val$0\r\n   Dynamic$1\r\n      field d2v\r\n         Data$0 -&gt; Val$1\r\n         Data$1 -&gt; Val$0\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984167/variable-value-pairs-i-e-maps-are-not-retained-when-one-of-them-gets-nullifi","title":"Variable-Value pairs (i.e., maps) are not

When an admin saves a model (PremiumUser - contains premium plan information that needs to be read by the Lambdas), we want to set up a schedule of CloudWatch events based on the saved information. Those events then trigger other Lambdas which also need to directly access the database, as the database state may change at any time and they should work off the most recent state of the database.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that Django seems to think it has saved the values, but when the Lambdas read the database the expected values aren&#39;t there. We have tried using Django&#39;s `post_save` signal, calling the Lambdas inside the triggered function; we have tried overriding Django&#39;s default `PremiumUser.save` method to perform `super(PremiumUser, self).save(*args, **kwargs)`, and only *then* call Lambdas (in case the `post_save` signal was getting triggered too early); and we have tried overriding the `PremiumUser.save` method and calling `super(PremiumUser, self).save(*args, **kwargs)` in the context of an atomic transaction (ie `with transactions.atomic():`).\r\n\r\nWhen we call the Lambdas a few seconds after the admin dashboard has updated, they can find the values as expected and work properly, which suggests that somehow Django considers the model as having been &#39;saved&#39; to the database, while the database has not yet been updated.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to force Django to write to the database immediately? This would be the preferred solution, as it would keep Django&#39;s model and the database consistent.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution we have considered but would prefer not to resort to would be to put a `sleep` in the Lambdas and calling them asynchronously so that Django&#39;s save is able to complete before the Lambda functions access the database. Obviously this would be a race condition, so we don&#39;t want to do this if it can be at all avoided.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984155/djangos-view-of-its-models-is-inconsistent-with-the-actual-database","title":"Django&#39;s view of its models is inconsistent with the

4 is [built to be mobile-first][1], with all the built-in media queries based off of [`min-width`][2]. That means that you cannot easily create a selector that is *only* applied to the `xs` and `md` breakpoints (as there is no `xs`  utility size in Bootstrap 4).\r\n\r\nHowever, you can *override* these mobile-first rules with *further* mobile-first rules targetting higher size breakpoints. Applying the class `ml-md-0` in addition to `mx-auto` will give a left-hand `margin` of `0` on any breakpoint that is at *least* `md`, while still *retaining* the desired `auto` `margin` for the `xs` and `sm` breakpoints.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .bg1 {\r\n      background-color: lightgrey;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .bg2 {\r\n      background-color: lightblue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container mt-5&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;col-6 bg1&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;col-6 mx-auto ml-md-0&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;select class=&quot;form-control mt-5 mb-5&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;option&gt;select one&lt;/option&gt;\r\n                &lt;option&gt;select two&lt;/option&gt;\r\n              &lt;/select&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;col-6 bg2&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;col-6 col-sm-6&quot;&gt;\r\n              &amp;nbsp;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints\r\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-width","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984149/horizontally-center-element-a-specific-breakpoint-and-below/57984530#57984530","title":"Horizontally center element a specific breakpoint and below"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":6643388,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRG7z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Niran Yousuf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6643388/niran-yousuf"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568777222,"creation_date":1568777222,"answer_id":57984651,"question_id":57984149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57984651","body_markdown":"Do you want like this picture?

The demo&#39;s purpose is to teach you how to organize a database layer in a large application, and not how to develop HTTP services.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984127/what-is-the-reason-for-using-get-instead-of-post-in-this-instance/57984991#57984991","title":"What is the reason for using GET instead of POST in this instance?"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":11965064,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a35262306d5f2a0350853003b10e7120?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"8slashes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11965064/8slashes"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57984991,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569178156,"creation_date":1568772571,"question_id":57984127,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57984127","body_markdown":"I&#39;m walking through the Javascript demos of [pg-promise-demo](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise-demo) and I have a question about the route `/api/users/:name`.\r\n\r\nRunning this locally works, the user is entered into the database, but is there a reason this wouldn&#39;t be a POST?

observe this behavior because `private` variables in OpenMP are uninitialized. To be precise, they are initialized as if you would have a local variable without an explicit initialization. Which means it is undefined what value they have initially. You observe different behavior on different systems because some combinations of compiler, options, and OS use this &quot;undefined&quot; differently. Your code is incorrect in any case, even if it sometimes produces the correct result.\r\n\r\nNow you can do this setting to zero as you tried out. However, I would generally suggest to instead **declare variables as local as possible**. This makes reasoning about the (parallel) code much easier, and you can omit the &quot;private/shared&quot; declarations. So your code would look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    #pragma omp parallel\r\n    {\r\n        int sumP = 0;\r\n        #pragma omp for\r\n        for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++) {\r\n            for (int l = 0; l &lt; N; l++) {\r\n                if (A[l][k] % 5 == 0 &amp;&amp; A[l][k] != 0) {\r\n                    sumP = sumP + A[k][l];\r\n                    printf(&quot;numero: %i, pos [%i],[%i] sumP: %i\\n&quot;, A[k][l], k, l, sumP);\r\n                }\r\n            }   \r\n        }\r\n        #pragma omp critical\r\n        sum += sumP;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, there is another way to drastically simplify this code by using a reduction:\r\n\r\n\r\n    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)\r\n    for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++) {\r\n        for (int l = 0; l &lt; N; l++) {\r\n            if (A[l][k] % 5 == 0 &amp;&amp; A[l][k] != 0) {\r\n                sum += A[k][l];\r\n            }\r\n        }   \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe compiler will basically do the same thing for you (but better) and the code is much cleaner.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984116/sum-of-matrix-elements-on-a-parallel-region-resulting-on-wrong-answers-on-openmp/57991274#57991274","title":"Sum of matrix elements on a parallel region resulting on wrong answers on OpenMP"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":9671874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ddcb1170089bbfab8483b2011628381a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Luiz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9671874/luiz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":452,"user_id":3197387,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45ec27435a4e7d85c8eb8b5e4799abc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sisir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3197387/sisir"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57991274,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568804649,"creation_date":1568772496,"last_edit_date":1568791164,"question_id":57984116,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57984116","body_markdown":"I was doing an activity at my university that requires to populate a matrix of [2000][2000] elements and then calculate the sum of all elements that are multiples of 5 in a parallel way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first I tried using a 5 x 5 matrix, I did a parcial sum (sumP) of the elements and them I added all the elements on a variable called Sum into a critical region.\r\n\r\nOn my university computer the parcial sum was receiving thrash values (like 36501) when the values must be lower than 100;

I know there is `PyWinAuto`, but that is only for windows programs only like `notepad`). Meaning you can let the script run in the background while you can do something else on you computer.\r\n\r\nA possible solution to this is to run the script in a virtual machine but I am looking for a solution which I don&#39;t have to do this.

However, when using the REST API, I can only send the input image as a base64-encoded string. The problem is that this appears not to be a valid input to the model and I cannot figure out how to correctly configure the model to accept the base64-encoded string and do the preprocessing necessary to transform it to a valid input.\r\n\r\n**Background:**\r\n\r\nI have a retrained Inception model produced by following the instructions here:\r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining\r\n\r\nMore specifically, I create the saved_model.py by running this script with appropriate arguments:\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py\r\n\r\nI am able to successfully run inferences locally using the example label_image script (which appears to do the necessary image preprocessing):\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image.py\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\nI send the image in a json document like so:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;instances&quot;: [\r\n      {&quot;image&quot;: [{&quot;b64&quot;: base64Thumbnail}]}\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto this address:\r\n```\r\nlocalhost:8501/v1/models/inception_retrain/:predict\r\n```\r\n\r\nTensorflow-Serving sends back a response with this error in the body (I&#39;ve truncated the base64 string here to save space):\r\n```\r\n&quot;error&quot;: &quot;Failed to process element: 0 key: image of \\&#39;instances\\&#39; list.\r\n\r\nError: Invalid argument: JSON Value: {\\n    \\&quot;b64\\&quot;: \\&quot;/9j/4AAQSk...\\&quot;\\n} \r\n\r\nType: Object is not of expected type: float&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich makes sense, as when I check the metadata of my model through Tensorflow-Serving, I get this description of the model&#39;s input, indicating it expects a float:\r\n```\r\n&quot;inputs&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;image&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;dtype&quot;: &quot;DT_FLOAT&quot;,\r\n

&quot;Placeholder:0&quot;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do I need to do so that the model will accept and analyze the base64-encoded image? \r\n\r\nIn most examples, they just some gRPC-related client code (which seems simpler), but that option is not available to me, as my client is written in javascript/node and I can only send the image via Tensorflow-Serving&#39;s REST

I am getting an error thrown on a particular line, and my googling isn&#39;t teaching me enough about R syntax for me to figure it out.\r\n\r\nI am stepping through the R code using *RStudio v1.2.1335*, and the R version is *R x64 3.6.1*\r\n\r\nA dataframe *dff* is created that contains a bunch of columns and has half hourly data for various nodes for approximately 4 years.  As a very simplified demo without all the columns something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatetime        node   year   load, generation, deltaSS ...\r\n1/1/2014 00:00, ABC,   2014,   100,  50,          300    ...\r\n1/1/2014 00:00, XYZ,   2014,   200,  150,         500    ...\r\n1/1/2014 00:30, ABC,   2014,   125,  70,          355    ...\r\n1/1/2014 00:30, ABC,   2014,   220,  150,         25     ...\r\n:\r\n1/1/2015 00:00, ABC,   2015,   200,  20,          200    ...\r\n1/1/2015 00:00, XYZ,   2015,   400,  450,         400    ...\r\n:\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I believe the code is trying to do is summarize a subset of these columns for specific groupings.  Some of the columns need to be simple summed, others need to be summed / 2 to convert into a different unit.  The grouping is by year and by node.\r\n\r\nIn other words, for each year and node, sum up (or sum/2) the values of some of the columns in the table.  Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode   year   load, generation, deltaSS ...\r\nABC,   2014,   1000,  5000,     30000    ...\r\nXYZ,   2014,   2000,  15000,    50000    ...\r\nABC,   2014,   1250,  7000,     35500    ...\r\nABC,   2014,   2200,  15000,    2500     ...\r\n:\r\nABC,   2015,   2000,  2000,     20000    ...\r\nXYZ,   2015,   4000,  45000,    40000    ...\r\n:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error I am getting is:\r\n\r\n**Error in `[.data.frame`(dff, , .(generationMWh = sum(generation)/2, loadMWh = sum(load,  : \r\n  unused argument (by = .(modelyear, node))**\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that we&#39;re getting an error at all because apparently this code has been run and works (I only mention this in case it turns out to be a library version or something).\r\n\r\nThe code that throws the error is:\r\n```\r\ndf &lt;- dff[,.(generationMWh = sum(generation)/2, \r\n                 loadMWh = sum(load,na.rm = TRUE)/2,\r\n                 deltaSS = sum(deltaSS,na.rm = TRUE), \r\n                 pos_deltaSS = sum(pos_deltaSS,na.rm = TRUE), \r\n                 neg_deltaSS = sum(neg_deltaSS,na.rm = TRUE), \r\n                 deltaCS = sum(deltaCS,na.rm = TRUE),\r\n                 pos_deltaCS = sum(pos_deltaCS,na.rm = TRUE),\r\n                 neg_deltaCS = sum(neg_deltaCS,na.rm = TRUE)\r\n    ), by = .(modelyear,node)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan someone help me out here?

have two tables with relatively different data.\r\n\r\nthe `photos` table is a table with all the relevant meta data for photos such as user_id, photo_id, datetime, name, etc.\r\n\r\nI have another table `ratings` that holds liked/disliked data for each respective photo. The columns in this table would have rater_id(for the person rating the picture), photo_id, and the rating (like/dislike).\r\n\r\nThe user would be presented a picture (at random) and then pick whether they liked it or not. Every time the image is loaded/presented it would have to be something that they have not yet rated.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m trying to do is return a `photo_id` where the user has not yet rated it.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve thought of using join or union, but I&#39;m having difficulty understanding how to best use those (or any other solution) for this application. Where my confusion lies is how I can compare the `ratings` table against the `photos` table, to only return the photos that have not been rated by `rater_id`.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nSample data\r\n\r\n`photos table`\r\n```\r\nid | photo_id\r\n-------------------------\r\n1  | photo_123\r\n2  | photo_456\r\n3  | photo_432\r\n4  | photo_642\r\n-------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n`ratings table`\r\n```\r\nid | photo_id | rater_id | rating\r\n---------------------------------\r\n1 | photo_123 | user2 | 1\r\n2 | photo_456 | user2 | 1\r\n3 | photo_123 | user1 | 1\r\n4 | photo_642 | user2 | 1\r\n--------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample Result: return `photo_432` for `user2` because it has not yet had a rating in `ratings table`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984043/how-to-compare-two-tables-and-identify-a-specific-type-of-row-to-be-returned","title":"How to compare two tables and identify a specific type of row to be returned?"},{"tags":["c","base-conversion"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2025,"user_id":11498773,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJFL4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mihir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11498773/mihir"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568772306,"post_id":57984042,"comment_id":102376937,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984042/convert-number-to-binary-and-hex-in-c#comment102376937_57984042"},{"owner":{"reputation":1440,"user_id":7508077,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b4193888717f50e77805498af1435b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"EsmaeelE","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7508077/esmaeele"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568774872,"post_id":57984042,"comment_id":102377410,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984042/convert-number-to-binary-and-hex-in-c#comment102377410_57984042"},{"owner":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568775281,"post_id":57984042,"comment_id":102377489,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984042/convert-number-to-binary-and-hex-in-c#comment102377489_57984042"},{"owner":{"reputation":2025,"user_id":11294831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9BL5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"the busybee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11294831/the-busybee"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568785736,"post_id":57984042,"comment_id":102379863,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984042/convert-number-to-binary-and-hex-in-c#comment102379863_57984042"},{"owner":{"reputation":2025,"user_id":11294831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9BL5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"the busybee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11294831/the-busybee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568785762,"post_id":57984042,"comment_id":102379871,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984042/convert-number-to-binary-and-hex-in-c#comment102379871_57984042"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10746317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-T4Bb_Tlhh68/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/b9_mXCDDz50/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"We Que","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10746317/we-que"},"last_editor":{"reputation":74934,"user_id":1848654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84180c0f3c9c04f8b8f0613fc0129dac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"melpomene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1848654/melpomene"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568788565,"creation_date":1568771990,"last_edit_date":1568788565,"question_id":57984042,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57984042","body_markdown":"I want to a write a program that converts a number to binary and hex.I tried to do this but It gives me the wrong result\r\n\r\n    int n, c, k;\r\n    int t = 0;\r\n    int binary[8];\r\n    for (c = 31; c &gt;= 0; c--) {\r\n        k = num &gt;&gt; c;\r\n        if (k &amp; 1) {\r\n            printf(&quot;1&quot;);\r\n            int binary[t] = 1;\r\n        } else {\r\n            printf(&quot;0&quot;);\r\n            int binary[t] = 0;\r\n        }\r\n        ++t;\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984042/convert-number-to-binary-and-hex-in-c","title":"Convert number to binary and hex in C"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7101}
