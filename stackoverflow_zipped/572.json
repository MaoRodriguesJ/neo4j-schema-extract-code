I just ran into a problem with trying to open a tty device in raw (noncanonical mode) though. If I was using regular C or C++ I would call ```cfmakeraw()``` after opening the device, but how do I do that from a .NET Core app?\r\n\r\nThe device I need to work with is a CDC ACM function driver for the USB client connector, i.e. it&#39;s a virtual COM port. It appears in my system as ```/dev/ttyGS0```. I can open the device and then read from it and write to it using this code:\r\n\r\n```FileStream vcom = new FileStream(&quot;/dev/ttyGS0&quot;, FileMode.Open);```\r\n\r\nBecause the tty device opens in canonical mode by default I don&#39;t receive any characters until the user sends the carriage return character at the end of the line of text. I need to receive each character as it is sent, rather than waiting untill the carriage return is sent, i.e. I need to use raw mode for the tty device.\r\n\r\nThe code below does not work because .NET Core does not realize that this device is a virtual serial port, so it throws an exception when I try to open it this way. When I open the real UART devices using ```SerialPort``` then they do behave in raw mode as expected.\r\n\r\n```SerialPort serialPort = new SerialPort(&quot;/dev/ttyGS0);```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404561/how-to-open-a-tty-device-in-noncanonical-mode-on-linux-using-net-core","title":"How to open a tty device in noncanonical mode on Linux using .NET Core"},{"tags":["android","android-intent","android-accessibility"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":317,"user_id":8968956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38cb5bfbfc38e6a3476baee2e3ec1222?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"trinadh thatakula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8968956/trinadh-thatakula"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571201374,"post_id":58404558,"comment_id":103156189,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404558/close-a-set-of-applications-during-idle-state-force-stop#comment103156189_58404558"},{"owner":{"reputation":192,"user_id":1384715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99844bd8a4ae1f3b8e91835ec1aa465d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bukubapi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1384715/bukubapi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":317,"user_id":8968956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38cb5bfbfc38e6a3476baee2e3ec1222?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"trinadh thatakula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8968956/trinadh-thatakula"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571205614,"post_id":58404558,"comment_id":103157474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404558/close-a-set-of-applications-during-idle-state-force-stop#comment103157474_58404558"}],"owner":{"reputation":192,"user_id":1384715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99844bd8a4ae1f3b8e91835ec1aa465d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bukubapi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1384715/bukubapi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571189562,"creation_date":1571189562,"question_id":58404558,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404558","body_markdown":"I need to do a college project, wherein the requirement is to detect the phone idle time and do a force stop on a set of applications.

recently begun to learn the concepts of OOP in Java, and have started building a game which involves a ball and pegs scattered around a screen. The aim of this game is to remove all the pegs off the screen by having the ball collide with them. There are different types of pegs which have certain behaviours when they are destroyed. (I.e. black pegs can&#39;t be destroyed, red pegs spawn two new balls etc.)\r\n\r\nThe following method is what I am using to check for collisions between the ball and the peg by iterating through each peg in an ArrayList. If a collision is detected, the peg will execute an action before getting removed from the ArrayList.\r\n\r\n    // inside MainGame class\r\n    public void checkCollisions(Ball ball) {\r\n\t\tfor (GameObject peg: pegs) {\r\n\t\t\tif (peg.checkCollision(ball)) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// peg does something before getting removed from the ArrayList\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy first approach was to have a bunch of if statements to check the type of the peg using instanceOf, but although it may work for a small game like mine with very few peg types, I doubt that this solution would work elegantly in a game with many different types of game objects such as an RPG.\r\n\r\nWhat if some types couldn&#39;t be destroyed (such as the black peg), or that it affected other pegs around it?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to find a flexible solution which would make it easy to add &quot;death&quot; behaviours which could potentially affect/create other pegs / game objects, but I am unaware of a design pattern which addresses this problem and would love some tips/resources that could aid me with this question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404557/oop-how-to-delete-game-objects-with-different-death-behaviours","title":"OOP - how to delete game objects with different &quot;death&quot; behaviours"},{"tags":["css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1705,"user_id":334972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f628263a3b0ec5fc3198c21c8ab79f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/334972/tim"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571192231,"post_id":58404556,"comment_id":103154493,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404556/is-there-a-way-to-fix-a-scaling-issue-from-laptop-to-mobile#comment103154493_58404556"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":12159346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79f7d3354e3047c18324551a32c185cf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Periplo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12159346/periplo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571190146,"creation_date":1571190146,"answer_id":58404630,"question_id":58404556,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404630","body_markdown":"Jasper.

put commas until the end. The method [`str.join`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) is made just for you. It is called on the separator (like `&#39;, &#39;`), and accepts an iterable of strings that you want to concentrate. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_combination(decoded):\r\n    def encode(x):\r\n        if x &lt; 0:\r\n            return f&#39;Left {abs(x)}&#39;\r\n        return f&#39;Right {x}&#39;\r\n    return &#39;, &#39;.join(encode(x) for x in decoded)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last line could be rewritten using [`map`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) as\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn &#39;, &#39;.join(map(encode, decoded))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want a really illegible one-liner (which I don&#39;t recommend, but python makes so easy to write):\r\n\r\n```\r\n&#39;, &#39;.join(f&#39;Left {abs(x)}&#39; if x &lt; 0 else f&#39;Right {x}&#39; for x in decoded)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even (abusing f-strings to the max):\r\n\r\n```\r\n&#39;, &#39;.join(f&#39;{&quot;Left&quot; if x &lt; 0 else &quot;Right&quot;} {abs(x)}&#39;

If such an element doesn&#39;t exists, it will use the default handler to display message.\r\n2. If this element exists, this element&#39;s `class` will be :\r\n    * set as `components-reconnect-show` when attempting to reconnect to the server,\r\n    * set as `components-reconnect-failed` when it failed to connect to server. \r\n    * set as `components-reconnect-refused` if the browser reaches the server while the server rejects the connection actively\r\n\r\nBy default, the **`dialogId`** is **`components-reconnect-modal`**. So you can create an element in the page and use CSS to control the content and styles as you like.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Demo:\r\n\r\nFor example, I create three parts of content to display within the `Pages/_Host.cshtml`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;div id=&quot;components-reconnect-modal&quot;

div{\r\n        position: fixed;\r\n        top: 0;\r\n        right: 0;\r\n        bottom: 0;\r\n        left: 0;\r\n        z-index: 1000;\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n        background-color: #fff;\r\n        opacity: 0.8;\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n    .components-reconnect-hide &gt;

All the client needs then is to download this timer end value, and it can show the ticking client side by using a timeout.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404516/global-state-for-server-side-rendering/58404565#58404565","title":"Global state for server side rendering"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":10390899,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/407e48f610bdb0c64b326a98edc0cfd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Panamera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10390899/panamera"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571189613,"creation_date":1571189111,"question_id":58404516,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404516","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s say I have a button and onclick it changes components state to timer, so its state goes from 5 to 4,3,2,1 every second but if page is refreshed the value is lost since it is not stored anywhere and is rendering on client side.\r\n\r\nHow can I make this function value not to be lost when page is refreshed and be broadcasted to all users.\r\nI do not want to use database since this function will be used a lot and would slow the db connection network also there might be a delay on database and timer would not update and server respond in time.\r\nAny other method?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404516/global-state-for-server-side-rendering","title":"Global state for server side rendering"},{"tags":["nuxt.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":661,"user_id":10105539,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mDti3lQ0fwE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/CwYw0BthOfs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugen Govorun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10105539/eugen-govorun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571398524,"post_id":58404512,"comment_id":103237768,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404512/how-do-i-implement-jsganttimproved-using-nuxt-js#comment103237768_58404512"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12184467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1_wcTzWGhE0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdR37ppXFFsulAhUO5udfJTD1G-4g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"BAUCE","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184467/bauce"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12184467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1_wcTzWGhE0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdR37ppXFFsulAhUO5udfJTD1G-4g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"BAUCE","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12184467/bauce"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571397716,"creation_date":1571189081,"last_edit_date":1571397716,"question_id":58404512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404512","body_markdown":"    Im trying to implement jsganttimproved with nuxt.js and i cant seem to figure out how to get the gantt chart plugged into the designated &lt;div&gt;

I&#39;ve downloaded the Authorize.net SDK through Nuget to use within my app. \r\n\r\nPrimary order information is collected within my app and then the user is redirected to the Authorize.Net Accept Hosted form. (My client doesn&#39;t want **any** credit card entry on/from their site so that eliminates the Iframe/.js solutions from AuthNet)\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve worked through all of the initial issues with the AuthNet integration and I&#39;m now dealing with the absolute frustration of having to figure out why the hosted form shows correctly on occasion (VERY RARE), shows only an &quot;Order Summary&quot; header on other occasions, shows &quot;Missing or invalid token&quot; on yet other occasions and most of the time just plain doesn&#39;t appear at all.\r\n\r\nI can post the code but it&#39;s not the code. I&#39;m using the same records to test with - to ensure consistency on my end - and they have all, at one point or another, been successfully sent to the AuthNet form and processed correctly...but this is few and far between at this point.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using the Authorize.Net provided SDK and I&#39;ve already figured out the idiosyncrasies with it which is why the form appears sometimes. It can&#39;t be what I&#39;m sending up otherwise it wouldn&#39;t work ALL the time rather than just some of the time.....\r\n\r\n**Things I&#39;ve Tried to Resolve the Problem**\r\n\r\n 1. Set the Authorize.Net account to &quot;Live&quot; Mode\r\n 2. Downgraded to SDK version 1.9.6 instead of 2.0.1 because, apparently, the older version was better than the new one.\r\n 3. Ensured that all of my HostedPayment* options are correctly set and the values are appropriately formatted.\r\n 4. Checked the Authorize.Net developer forums\r\n 5. Checked on StackOverflow \r\n 6. Searched the web\r\n 7. Pulled all my hair out\r\n\r\n**Question:**\r\n\r\nHas anyone else run into problems getting the Accept Hosted Form to display consistently? If so, then how did you resolve the issue to make the form render correctly on a consistent basis? I mean REALLY consistently, not once every 30-40 tries.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Missing or invalid token][1]][1]\r\n\r\n[![Accept Hosted Form at it&#39;s finest!][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XrkbQ.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/AiTPJ.png\r\n\r\n\r\nSeriously!

[`java.lang.String`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#matches-java.lang.String-) has a matches method which can evaluate a String against a regular expression.\r\n\r\nBut instead you have an integer to work with. So you have two options: \r\n\r\n1. Convert the integer to a String, and then your code will work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString converted = String.valueOf(accountNumber); \r\nString pattern2 = &quot;^\\\\d{1,10}$&quot; ;\r\nif (!converted.matches(pattern2)) { // use the converted String to compare\r\n    return false;\r\n} else {\r\n    this.AccountNumber = accountNumber;\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Or, since you&#39;re just trying to count the digits, you can just use Math. You state you need to figure out if your integer has between 5 and 9 digits, so therefore it stands to reason that its value is between 10,000 and 999,999,999 (assuming that 9 digits are valid, otherwise drop one of the 9&#39;s.) So you could do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif ( 10_000 &lt;= accountNumber &amp;&amp; accountNumber &lt;= 999_999_999 ) {\r\n  // this meets your condition\r\n} else {\r\n  // the number of digits is wrong.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This assumes, of course, that you don&#39;t have a negative value in `accountNumber`. Calling `accountNumber = Math.abs(accountNumber)` would resolve that.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404495/problem-with-validating-integer-with-matches/58404620#58404620","title":"Problem with validating integer with .matches"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10717871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-te0jPXVt8kI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApI/LUxF6MS3Grc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yoonah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10717871/yoonah"},"last_editor":{"reputation":101057,"user_id":1393766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h0FSp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pshemo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1393766/pshemo"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58404620,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571597347,"creation_date":1571188939,"last_edit_date":1571597347,"question_id":58404495,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404495","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to make an expression validation method to make sure if the account number passed into the function is valid or not.

\r\nor it is also possible to retrieve it from the same call to `SHGetFileInfo`, using the `SHGFI_OVERLAYINDEX` and `SHGFI_ICON` flags;\r\nit is also possible to retreve the index of a specific overlay only once, because it will be constant on the system; \r\nfor example the &quot;link&quot; overlay has always index = 2 on my system.\r\nThe overlay index value must be passed using the `INDEXTOOVERLAYMASK` modifier (i.e. left shifted by 8).\r\nTo test, add a ListView and a button to a form.\r\n\r\n```   \r\npublic partial class Form1 : Form\r\n{\r\n    static class NativeMethods\r\n    {\r\n        public const uint LVM_GETIMAGELIST = 0x1000 + 2;\r\n        public const uint LVM_SETIMAGELIST = 0x1000 + 3;\r\n        public const uint LVM_SETITEMSTATE = 0x1000 + 43;\r\n        public const uint LVIS_OVERLAYMASK = 0x0F00;\r\n        public const uint LVSIL_SMALL = 1;\r\n        public const uint SHGFI_ICON = 0x100;\r\n        public const uint SHGFI_SMALLICON = 0x1;\r\n        public const uint SHGFI_SHGFI_ICON = 0x100;\r\n        public const uint SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX = 0x4000;\r\n        public const uint SHGFI_SHGFI_OVERLAYINDEX = 0x40;\r\n\r\n        [DllImport(&quot;user32&quot;)]\r\n        public static extern IntPtr SendMessage(IntPtr hWnd,\r\n                                                uint msg,\r\n                                                uint wParam,\r\n                                                IntPtr lParam);\r\n\r\n        [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]\r\n        public struct LVITEM\r\n        {\r\n            public uint mask;\r\n            public int iItem;\r\n            public int iSubItem;\r\n            public uint state;\r\n            public uint stateMask;\r\n            public string pszText;\r\n            public int cchTextMax;\r\n            public int iImage;\r\n            public int lParam;\r\n            public int iIndent;\r\n            public int iGroupId;\r\n            public uint cColumns;\r\n            public uint puColumns;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [DllImport(&quot;user32&quot;)]\r\n        public static extern IntPtr SendMessage(IntPtr hWnd, uint Msg, uint wParam, ref LVITEM lvi);\r\n\r\n        [DllImport(&quot;User32.dll&quot;)]\r\n        public static extern int DestroyIcon(IntPtr hIcon);\r\n\r\n        [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]\r\n        public struct SHFILEINFO\r\n        {\r\n            public IntPtr hIcon;\r\n            public int iIcon;\r\n            public uint dwAttributes;\r\n            [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 260)] public string szDisplayName;\r\n            [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 80)] public string szTypeName;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [DllImport(&quot;shell32&quot;)]\r\n        public static extern IntPtr SHGetFileInfo(string pszPath,\r\n                                                  uint dwFileAttributes,\r\n                                                  ref SHFILEINFO psfi,\r\n                                                  uint cbSizeFileInfo,\r\n                                                  uint uFlags);\r\n\r\n        public static uint INDEXTOOVERLAYMASK(uint i)\r\n        {\r\n            return i &lt;&lt;

Each point has a timestamp, measurement values and Flora MAC address and GW ID\r\n - Frontend:\r\n  - Grafana to visualise the metrics (Multiple users, other IoT applications as well)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, the issue is that currently the installation management is done manually. There is no database describing which MAC address corresponds to which plant, currently it&#39;s done manually in Grafana. This creates issues when the sensor unit is later moved to another plant, causing the historical data to be shown for the new plant as well (In Grafana, that is). Apart from that, I personally feel that the end user (me included) shouldn&#39;t need to deal with MAC addresses while creating and using the Grafana dashboards.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m asking for is opinions on how to set up the device &amp; installation database, along with thresholds for alerts (e.g &quot;Plant is dry, water me&quot;) and how to augment the current raw InfluxDB data. I&#39;m much in favor of keeping the current raw format so the options I see are:\r\n\t1.\tCreate another (or improve the current) forwarder that compares the Flora MAC&#39;s to device information in another database (Which database?)\r\n\t2.\tCreate a service which fetches (or subscribes to data stream via Kapacitor) raw data from TSDB, compares the MAC&#39;s to the device information in another database (Which database?) and pushes the augmented data points to a new timeseries in InfluxDB.\r\n\t3. Ditch the idea of aggregating TSDB data and use a frontend solution capable of combining the data from different databases.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;d be more in favor of 2 since that allows me to process the historical data easily. This still leaves the following questions open:\r\n\tWhich database should I use? I know that I could do this in InfluxDB as well but I don&#39;t think that would be proper use of TSDB.\r\n\tWill there be performance issues (even if theoretical) if I use Kapacitor and UDF functions (written in Python or Golang) to deal with the datastream as opposed to batch tasks to handle the linking of raw TSDB points and device metadata DB?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404492/recommended-approach-for-augmenting-tsdb-with-device-metadata","title":"Recommended approach for augmenting TSDB with device metadata"},{"tags":["python","io","flush","fsync"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57561,"user_id":1832058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/relWs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"furas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832058/furas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571190625,"post_id":58404491,"comment_id":103154177,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404491/do-i-need-to-os-fsync-before-f-close#comment103154177_58404491"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":8622053,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TZ9_LPesukQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Moqhewj3DH4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daniel Chin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8622053/daniel-chin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":57561,"user_id":1832058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/relWs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"furas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832058/furas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571337589,"post_id":58404491,"comment_id":103217509,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404491/do-i-need-to-os-fsync-before-f-close#comment103217509_58404491"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":8622053,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TZ9_LPesukQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Moqhewj3DH4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daniel Chin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8622053/daniel-chin"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571188914,"creation_date":1571188914,"question_id":58404491,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404491","body_markdown":"[&quot;what exactly the python&#39;s file.flush() is doing?&quot;](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7127075/what-exactly-the-pythons-file-flush-is-doing) says you should first `f.flush()` and then `os.fsync(f)` to make sure the data are written to the disk.  \r\nFurthermore, [&quot;does close() imply flush() in Python?&quot;](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2447143/does-close-imply-flush-in-python) claims that `f.close()` implies a `flush()`.  \r\n\r\nNow, the question is: should I do  \r\n```python\r\nos.fsync(f)\r\nf.close()\r\n```\r\nor, does `f.close()` also implies an `os.fsync()`?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the [doc of Python IO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.close), the [doc of Python file close](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=fsync%20flush#file.close), and the [source code](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Modules/_io/fileio.c).

that you haven&#39;t learned about arrays, the idea behind your solution is quite ingenious, but there are some mistakes that would render your code dysfunctional.  \r\n\r\nFirst off, there are many `while` loops that would either not execute or loop infinitely. It appears that you&#39;ve mixed up `while` loops with `if` statements. You can read more about the difference [here](https://www.quora.com/WHat-is-the-difference-between-an-if-and-a-while-loop).  \r\n\r\nAs both Andreas and Scary Wombat pointed out, there&#39;s a straggling `sc.nextInt();` that isn&#39;t assigned to anything. Delete that, since it will unintentionally drop inputs from the user.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, here&#39;s my solution using your method.\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\npublic class CountOccurence {\r\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Enter the number&quot;);\r\n        int num1 = sc.nextInt();\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Enter a list of positive numbers\\nEnter -1 to indicate end:&quot;);\r\n        int count = 0;\r\n        int input = 0;\r\n        while (input != -1) {\r\n            input = sc.nextInt();\r\n            if (input == num1) {\r\n                count++;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Your number occurs &quot; + count + &quot; times&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI chose to print the occurances at the very end, since that&#39;s after the user types `-1`.\r\n\r\nBy the way, welcome to the Stack Overflow community!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404478/how-do-i-count-the-occurence-of-an-integer-in-a-list-and-output-it-correctly/58404707#58404707","title":"How do I count the occurence of an integer in a list and output it correctly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12156868,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD62_UYseKQry76Vq57i-MXD8A9oU918P0oRvCPJw=k-s128","display_name":"Hassan Haroon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12156868/hassan-haroon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":202,"user_id":10869762,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JuSgnj210Ws/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFI/8LVFRdqRaEY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Leftist Tachyon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10869762/leftist-tachyon"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58404707,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571190801,"creation_date":1571188805,"last_edit_date":1571189967,"question_id":58404478,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58404478","body_markdown":"To start, I&#39;m new to Java and I just started learning it around a month ago.\r\n\r\nOne of my HW Questions is &quot;Write a program that prompts the user for a positive\r\nnumber N, followed by a list of positive numbers.

So unless they are explicitly initialized it would be a waste of processor cycles to do so.\r\n\r\nWith regard to arrays as well as structs, an object is either initialized or it is not.

(e.g. simulating `open(O_CREAT | O_EXCL)`)\r\n\r\ni.e. I&#39;d like my PUT OBJECT to fail if the file already exists. S3 does offer strong read-after-create consistency, so hopefully there&#39;s some way to take advantage of that.\r\n\r\nAbstractly speaking, I wish to implement an operation `create_s3_object(s3_key, data)`, that any S3 client can call, to write `data` to a _new_ S3 object designated by `s3_key`. The data and the key are known before issuing the call.\r\n\r\nIf all clients cooperate and use `create_s3_object(s3_key, data)` to create object `s3_key`, then the call should provide the following guarantees:\r\n\r\n   1. if file `s3_key` does not exist, then file `s3_key` is created with data `data` as its contents, and the call succeeds.\r\n\r\n   1. if file `s3_key` already exists, the call fails, and the existing file remains unmodified by the call. (I can loosen this requirement by tolerating the existence of file `s3_key` if and only if it contains exactly `data`) \r\n\r\n   1. if file `s3_key` does not exist, and multiple calls are issued concurrently from different clients (and/or from the same client) with different data: i.e. `create_s3_object(s3_key, data1)`, `create_s3_object(s3_key, data2)`, … `create_s3_object(s3_key, dataN)`, and then at most one of those calls will succeed, and the data of `s3_key` will match that provided by the one call that succeeded.\r\n\r\n   1. Atomicity. Assuming a file was created via `create_s3_object(s3_key, data)`, and never updated after creation, if any client performs a GET for `s3_key` at any point in time (before, during, or after creation), the client will have receive either a 404 error (before creation), or data `data`, but no other versions of the file (e.g. some transient state of `s3_key`).\r\n\r\nAdditional details:\r\n\r\n- i&#39;m using boto3 (python)\r\n- the set of clients making potentially conflicting requests are: running on ECS containers (same region as the bucket), in lambda functions (same region as bucket), and one or two processes running on a desktop located on the public internet outside aws.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404444/concurrent-upload-of-file-in-s3-prevent-conflicting-upload","title":"Concurrent upload of file in S3 -- prevent conflicting

think I understand what you&#39;re trying to do.\r\n\r\nSql accounts are less desirable in this situation because you have to distribute the account credential with your app. You can do things with encrypted config file sections or other tricks, but ultimately that username/password are exposed and not easily serviceable.\r\n\r\nIntegrated security improves on this by using the authentication infrastructure built into Active Directory. You no longer need to distribute passwords with your app. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are still two weaknesses with Integrated Security.\r\n\r\nThe first is account management. It can be tedious to set up Sql Server logins for each of your Active Directory users, and awkward and unwieldy to manage them as you have user churn over time. \r\n\r\nThankfully, this isn&#39;t as bad as you might think. You can get past the issue by creating Sql Server logins for Active Directory groups instead of individual users. Setting an Active Directory user as a member of such a group is enough to grant them the group access. You can even use a small number of groups, one in place of each &quot;Service Account&quot; in your original proposal, in order to support tiered access. Using this scheme, the actual logged in user is also still available to Sql Server (and therefore to the application) for assigning more specific permissions within the app if needed.\r\n\r\nThe other weakness is you are granting raw database permissions directly to users, instead of merely granting permission to use an application. This is a real problem, if Joe User can download Sql Server Management Studio (or any similar app that may not even require installation) and run whatever query they want against the section of your database authorized for use of the app.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, your proposed solution (Service Accounts in Active Directory) won&#39;t work. Those service accounts still need to use integrated security, and integrated security **only** works when the account in question is actually running the application process. That&#39;s **never** going to work the way you want it to.\r\n\r\nSo what can we do?\r\n\r\nOne &quot;best practice&quot; is using [Application Roles][1] in combination with group-based integrated security. Unfortunately, this requires changes to your application so every database connection can call `sp_setapprole`. \r\n\r\nThis also has you back to distributing a credential with your application. It&#39;s somewhat safer because this distributed credential requires the integrated security login before it can be used; if such a credential leaks to the world, your database is still only compromised among your own user base. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind, though, when the credential is exposed any of your users with motivation and access to Google can still find an app that will let them replicate what your application was doing to run any query they want with the same permissions as the application, just as with group-based integrated security alone. You still need to protect the credential, and all the challenges going with that. \r\n\r\nIn other words, this still ultimately has both the integrated security weakness of granting raw database permissions to your users and the sql authentication weakness of needing to protect a credential. I&#39;m not a fan.\r\n\r\nThe only other good solution I know to this problem involves radically changing your application to use a service layer (usually JSON via web API) instead of direct database access. This works because you control the service layer machine(s).\r\n\r\nSo what would I do in your shoes? Probably go for the group-based integrated security option, without using the special Application Roles (no  `sp_setapprole`... using Sql Server roles for assigning permissions to your groups is still a good idea). However, I would try to restrict permissions on those groups as much as possible. This way, the only change needed initially in your application is to the connection string. Later, we even further restrict permissions on these users. For example, you can used stored procedures in the database to create a de-facto API, and only grant access to those procedures. This can be done in the application over several release cycles, so you don&#39;t need to wait to make the change to integrated security.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/application-roles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404432/service-account-to-connect-database-in-winforms-app/58418943#58418943","title":"Service account to connect database in winforms app"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":322544,"user_id":3043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61d2a0f034915fa9d2acd6f6b145bba8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Joel Coehoorn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3043/joel-coehoorn"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571252990,"post_id":58419762,"comment_id":103182582,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404432/service-account-to-connect-database-in-winforms-app/58419762#comment103182582_58419762"},{"owner":{"reputation":3110,"user_id":7675833,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LBkWl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Travis Acton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7675833/travis-acton"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":322544,"user_id":3043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61d2a0f034915fa9d2acd6f6b145bba8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Joel Coehoorn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3043/joel-coehoorn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571253743,"post_id":58419762,"comment_id":103182907,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404432/service-account-to-connect-database-in-winforms-app/58419762#comment103182907_58419762"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3350203,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da04b4616f5415bf5fa8785f10c5d973?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3350203","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3350203/user3350203"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571367424,"post_id":58419762,"comment_id":103225714,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404432/service-account-to-connect-database-in-winforms-app/58419762#comment103225714_58419762"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3110,"user_id":7675833,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LBkWl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Travis Acton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7675833/travis-acton"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571251191,"creation_date":1571251191,"answer_id":58419762,"question_id":58404432,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58419762","body_markdown":"Along with Joel&#39;s answer regarding AD groups assigned to SQL permissions, it may be in your best interest to create sql views for data reads and stored procs for updates, just assign the sql login mapped to your AD group perms to those items instead of the whole shabang.

My current problem is that any user could just type out the exact URL of the page they are redirected to upon a successful PayPal payment that adds the amount to their account. I&#39;m not sure what the best way is to tackle this issue, I&#39;ve tried fiddling with IPN/PDT, Database cross-checking and webhooks, but at this point, I&#39;ve moved five steps back instead of two steps forward. What would be the best way for me to move forward? Thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nSide note: For the testing purposes so far, it&#39;s been a fixed rate of $10 that adds $10 to their account upon successful payment. I have a form submit that adds an &quot;order request&quot; database entry, before switching the header(Location) to the Paypal order. Upon Payment, they are taken to an &quot;order success&quot; page that checks the &quot;order request&quot; entry, if there, deletes it, and then adds a new entry to the &quot;successful orders&quot; database. If it&#39;s not there, it redirects to the home page. All pages besides the &quot;successful orders&quot; page checks the &quot;order request&quot; database to delete any entries with the user&#39;s username to prevent attempting to access the page directly from the site. The only issue, they could easily open a second tab while the PayPal payment page is still open, and type in the URL passing the check and adding to their account balance without paying. The same issue would occur with including a $_GET variable from PayPay upon successful payment. Someone could expose the $_GET and they would just add that to the URL. The same issue occurs with creating a $_SESSION before populating the PayPal transaction page. That&#39;s why I feel $_POST from PayPal directly would be most sufficient.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404419/passing-paypal-variables-through-post","title":"Passing PayPal Variables Through $_POST"},{"tags":["css","mobile-safari"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7059,"user_id":668871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69a7b5d337a6316aeb96e37963133281?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Matthematics","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/668871/matthematics"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571766396,"post_id":58508206,"comment_id":103347200,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58404417/mobile-safari-not-rendering-fixed-element-outside-of-viewport-unless-it-has-no-c/58508206#comment103347200_58508206"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":12159346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79f7d3354e3047c18324551a32c185cf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Periplo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12159346/periplo"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571760099,"creation_date":1571760099,"answer_id":58508206,"question_id":58404417,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58508206","body_markdown":"I had a similar issue once.

The function calculates the TF-IDF for all the books in the dataframe (thus, rows, as each book is a new row) and then returns the name of the book which has the highest TF-IDF value like:\r\n\r\n    choice(&#39;the&#39;, mydataframe)\r\n\r\n    # output: pg16238.txt\r\n\r\nThe problem I am encountering is that I am unable to extract a particular frequency from the dataframe owing to having renamed the indexing from standard numbering (0, 1, 2, etc) to the book titles as you can see in the image which renders the built-in &quot;.str.contains&quot; function useless somehow (it doesn&#39;t work).\r\n\r\nI searched a lot about it and found out that it somehow became a &quot;multi-index&quot; dataframe? (I am a beginner so I do not have a good idea about how to tackle this).\r\n\r\nAnother problem I am having is that I do not know how to return the name of the book after the calculation is completed. Like, should I make a list of the indexes and then create a dictionary which looks something like:\r\n\r\n    {&#39;book-title&#39;: tf-idf-value}\r\n\r\nand then return the highest value? Please help me in figuring out the appropriate way to solve this.\r\n\r\n I have successfully written a working IDF calculation function:\r\n\r\n    def get_IDF(self, term):\r\n        N = 0\r\n        D = len(self.files_list)\r\n        for file in self.files_list:\r\n            with open(file, &#39;r&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf-8-sig&#39;, errors=&#39;replace&#39;) as f:\r\n                temp_cleaned_data = &#39;&#39;.join(i.lower() for i in f.read() if ord(i) &lt; 128).translate(str.maketrans(&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;, string.punctuation)).replace(&#39;\\n&#39;, &#39; &#39;)\r\n                if self.contains_word(temp_cleaned_data, term):\r\n                    N += 1\r\n        return 1 + (math.log(D / (1 + N)))\r\n\r\n&quot;files_list&quot; is a list of files stored in the current directory.\r\n\r\nAlso, please excuse my terrible coded &quot;temp_cleaned_data&quot;, I will refactor it later so sorry about that. ( I know there are really simpler ways to do this using &quot;.isalnum()&quot; but I am trying to learn a bit of list comprehension and functional programming too so I try out different stuff and piece it together to see how it works).\r\n\r\nAnyways, I&#39;d really appreciate any sort of help in figuring this out, thank you. The formula for TF-IDF is:\r\n\r\n&gt; term-frequency(term) x idf(term) \r\n\r\n**Note**: The DataFrame screenshot I provides is only a part of the complete dataframe. Also, the book-titles may vary and the amount of books is not just 6 and can be N in number.
