The problem with it is a little bit subtle, especially if you&#39;re coming from a C or C++ background. Arrays in swift are not like arrays in C or C++; in particular, they do not have fixed addresses in memory. They are objects that the Swift runtime may choose to move. This is nice when you&#39;re working in Swift, but sometimes causes pain when you need to interact with C functions (and especially C types that want to *persist* pointers across function calls, as you have noticed).\r\n\r\nWhen you call `DSPSplitComplex(realp: &amp;forwardInputReal, ...)`, the `&amp;` implicitly creates an `UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Float&gt;` to the memory of `forwardInputReal`, but *that pointer is only valid during the duration of the call to `init`*. When you pass `forwardInput` to `vDSP_ctoz`, the pointer has already passed out of scope and is no longer valid, so you are invoking undefined behavior. In particular, the compiler can assume that the call to `vDSP_ctoz` does not modify the contents of `forwardInputReal` or `forwardInputImag`, because the function doesn&#39;t receive a valid pointer to their contents.\r\n\r\nThe best way to work around this is to be more explicit:\r\n\r\n    forwardInputReal.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { r in\r\n      forwardInputImag.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { i in\r\n        var splitComplex = DSPSplitComplex(realp: r.baseAddress!, imagp: i.baseAddress!)\r\n         vDSP_ctoz(observed, 2, &amp;splitComplex, 1, vDSP_Length(halfN))\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    // forwardInput[Real,Imag] now contain the de-interleaved data.\r\n    // splitComplex is out-of-scope and cannot be used, so the invalid pointers\r\n    // are discarded.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a few things that would make this easier.\r\n\r\nFirst, there&#39;s a [change coming to the Swift compiler](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27695) that will diagnose this error for you.\r\n\r\nSecond, we can wrap the little dance I showed into some convenience functions:\r\n\r\n    /// De-interleave the real and imaginary parts of a complex buffer into two\r\n    /// new Float arrays.\r\n    func ctoz&lt;T&gt;(_ data: T) -&gt; (real: [Float], imag: [Float])\r\n    where T: AccelerateBuffer, T.Element == DSPComplex {\r\n      var imag = [Float]()\r\n      let real = [Float](unsafeUninitializedCapacity: data.count) { r, n in\r\n        imag = [Float](unsafeUninitializedCapacity: data.count) { i, n in\r\n          ctoz(data, real: &amp;r, imag: &amp;i)\r\n          n = data.count\r\n        }\r\n        n = data.count\r\n      }\r\n      return (real, imag)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /// De-interleave the real and imaginary parts of a complex buffer into two\r\n    /// caller-provided Float buffers.\r\n    ///\r\n    /// - Precondition: data, real, and imag must all have the same length.\r\n    func ctoz&lt;T, U, V&gt;(_ data: T, real: inout U, imag: inout V)\r\n    where T: AccelerateBuffer, T.Element == DSPComplex,\r\n          U: AccelerateMutableBuffer, U.Element == Float,\r\n          V: AccelerateMutableBuffer, V.Element == Float\r\n    {\r\n      precondition(data.count == real.count &amp;&amp; data.count == imag.count)\r\n      real.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { r in\r\n        imag.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { i in\r\n          var split = DSPSplitComplex(realp: r.baseAddress!, imagp: i.baseAddress!)\r\n          data.withUnsafeBufferPointer { d in\r\n            vDSP_ctoz(d.baseAddress!, 2, &amp;split, 1, vDSP_Length(data.count))\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith these convenience functions defined, you can just do:\r\n\r\n    var forwardInputReal = [Float](repeating: 0, count: halfN)\r\n    var forwardInputImag = [Float](repeating: 0, count: halfN)\r\n    ctoz(observed, real: &amp;forwardInputReal, imag: &amp;forwardInputImag)\r\n\r\nor even:\r\n\r\n    let (forwardInputReal, forwardInputImag) = ctoz(data)\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll talk to the vDSP team and see if we can&#39;t get something like this added in the Framework for a future release so you don&#39;t need to write it yourself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332930/apple-fft-giving-inconsistent-results/58525429#58525429","title":"Apple FFT giving inconsistent results"}],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":5294396,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3m_o2WGytCs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/rTM2PyLG6_A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"dmann200","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5294396/dmann200"},"last_editor":{"reputation":51,"user_id":5294396,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3m_o2WGytCs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/rTM2PyLG6_A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"dmann200","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5294396/dmann200"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":312,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571865740,"creation_date":1570756003,"last_edit_date":1570756832,"question_id":58332930,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332930","body_markdown":"I implemented in FFT algorithm using native Apple classes.

I am using the python win32com module which provides full access to the VBA (C#?) COM api. \r\n\r\nMy current idea is to have the users create generic slide layouts using the slide master. I will then provide an API to create JSON based on python dictionaries for what layouts to apply in what position of presentation and to place what content in what placeholders on each particular slide. \r\n\r\nMy concern is how to effectively keep track of what placeholders are what on each slide layout. I&#39;ve been digging around the API and while you can add [names to shapes within a slide][1] I am failing to see how I can have a user do that through the GUI in the slide master.

Then to say add something to shape-A the user would reference shape-A as a key in the json. \r\n\r\nIs it not possible to name shapes within the slide master? At least through the GUI?

The api used to have no MFA, however they have recently implemented an MFA.  This MFA requires a redirect, but it doesn&#39;t actually occur until this section of the code: \r\n\r\n    docURL = &#39;https://api.com/jobs/%s/attachments/%s&#39; % (docID, fileID)\r\n    data = session.get(docURL, verify=False)\r\n\r\nI can setup through the script and I can get the DocID, I can use the DocID to check the docstatus, I can get the fileID.  As soon as I go to actually get the data the redirect happens and it gives a few 302s with 401s following until the 5th retry finally gives a final 401.  I am trying to figure out how to give the the sentry_token to the redirect, because that is apparently what it needs.  Instead it is trying to use the sso_token.  How can I use the right token for the correct domain with the redirect?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332905/python-requests-redirect-using-specific-token","title":"Python Requests Redirect using specific token"},{"tags":["python","pandas"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570758584,"post_id":58332903,"comment_id":103023864,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332903/order-of-the-categorical-variables-in-pandas#comment103023864_58332903"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":125,"user_id":7183008,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":14,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f75d9fb2ad51a0ba17bcb3281c3f0c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bluetooth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7183008/bluetooth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570813410,"post_id":58333350,"comment_id":103046330,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332903/order-of-the-categorical-variables-in-pandas/58333350#comment103046330_58333350"},{"owner":{"reputation":985,"user_id":2970853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/507188635/picture?type=large","display_name":"henrywongkk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970853/henrywongkk"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":125,"user_id":7183008,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":14,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f75d9fb2ad51a0ba17bcb3281c3f0c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bluetooth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7183008/bluetooth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570833611,"post_id":58333350,"comment_id":103053405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332903/order-of-the-categorical-variables-in-pandas/58333350#comment103053405_58333350"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":985,"user_id":2970853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/507188635/picture?type=large","display_name":"henrywongkk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970853/henrywongkk"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570759767,"creation_date":1570759767,"answer_id":58333350,"question_id":58332903,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58333350","body_markdown":"Assume you have a dataframe like below (I added column names for readability)\r\n```\r\ndf\r\n  Cat1 Cat2  Relationship\r\n0    a    b           3.0\r\n1    b    c           2.0\r\n2    c    d           1.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst merge `df` itself on first 2 columns and calculate the new relationship value by multiplying the original 2 relationship values on the merged row.

from busy waiting, which can block an entire CPU and quickly drain the battery, I can&#39;t see any synchronization. There are shared data structures (likely `stopMessageThread`, `characteristicWriteSuccessful` and `messageQueue`) and several threads accessing them. Without synchronization, race conditions will occur and the *jam up* could be a manifestation of it.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to go with a simpler design, in particular without a thread for sending messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate ArrayList&lt;byte[]&gt; messageQueue = new ArrayList&lt;byte[]&gt;();\r\nprivate boolean isSending = false;\r\n\r\nvoid sendMessage(&lt;byte[]&gt; message) {\r\n    synchronized (this) {\r\n        if (isSending) {\r\n            messageQueue.add(message);\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        isSending = true;\r\n    }\r\n    bluetoothGatt.writeCharacteristic(customCharacteristic);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void onCharacteristicWrite (BluetoothGatt gatt, \r\n                BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic, \r\n                int status) {\r\n    byte[] message;\r\n    synchronized (this) {\r\n        if (messageQueue.size() == 0) {\r\n            isSending = false;\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        message = messageQueue.remove(0);\r\n    }\r\n    bluetoothGatt.writeCharacteristic(customCharacteristic); \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe assumption in this solution is that `writeCharacteristic` does not block and is quick. That&#39;s a safe assumption as the method is asynchronous by design: it has a callback that will be called when the operation is complete.\r\n\r\nSo the callback `onCharacteristicWrite` is used to send the next message in the buffer. Therefore, the need for the thread goes away – and so goes the associated complexity.\r\n\r\nThere are still several threads involved as the callback is called from a background thread. Therefore, the access to the shared data is synchronized.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332898/android-ble-write-characteristic-locks-up-oncharacteristicwrite-oncharacteristic/58348711#58348711","title":"Android BLE write Characteristic locks up onCharacteristicWrite/onCharacteristicChange"}],"owner":{"reputation":383,"user_id":10067555,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23629f32bc51e9dff04aec6b8eb51123?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"karamazovbros","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10067555/karamazovbros"},"last_editor":{"reputation":383,"user_id":10067555,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23629f32bc51e9dff04aec6b8eb51123?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"karamazovbros","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10067555/karamazovbros"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570829706,"creation_date":1570755588,"last_edit_date":1570813545,"question_id":58332898,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332898","body_markdown":"I have a message thread for sending a buffer of messages. Each message is queued to be sent once `onCharacteristicWrite` is successful before the characteristic writes the next message. The characeristic is also set to `WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE`, so the message buffer queue is pretty fast (0-7ms approximately) between characteristic write calls.\r\n\r\n**The main issue: &quot;jammed up&quot; characteristic**\r\n\r\nFor the most part this works great. The problem seems to arise when there&#39;s a large amount of messages (possibly happens with fewer message, but is more noticeable when sending lots of messages). What happens is `writeCharacteristic`will get called, and the characteristic seems to lock up, since `onCharacteristicChanged` no longer reads any new data, and doesn&#39;t get to `onCharacteristicWrite`.\r\n\r\n**Other things I&#39;ve noticed:**\r\n\r\n 1. Adding a sleep delay of 5-10ms after each `characteristicWrite` seems to \r\n help, but I don&#39;t understand why the Bluetooth GATT object would need a delay when `onCharacteristicWrite` returns successful. \r\n\r\n 2. Sometimes I&#39;ll get a callback in `onConnectionStateChange` with status 8, device out of range. This doesn&#39;t always happen though.\r\n 3. Sometimes `characteristicWrite` returns false; however, it can also return true before going into the &quot;jammed up characteristic&quot; state described above\r\n\r\n\r\n**Message Thread code:**\r\n\r\n        private boolean stopMessageThread = false;\r\n        private boolean characteristicWriteSuccessful = true;\r\n        private ArrayList&lt;byte[]&gt; messageQueue = new

@Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() &amp;&amp; !stopMessageThread) {\r\n                    if(messageQueue.size() != 0 &amp;&amp; characteristicWriteSuccessful) {\r\n    \r\n                        Log.i(TAG, &quot;&quot;+(System.currentTimeMillis()-lastTime));\r\n                        Log.i(TAG, &quot;Queue count: &quot;+messageQueue.size());\r\n    \r\n                        characteristicWriteSuccessful = false;\r\n                        byte[] message = messageQueue.remove(0);\r\n                        customCharacteristic.setValue(message);\r\n                        boolean status = bluetoothGatt.writeCharacteristic(customCharacteristic);\r\n    \r\n                        Log.i(TAG, &quot;write characteristic status &quot;+status);\r\n    \r\n                        lastTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n                        //sleep(10); // this kinda helps but can still throw the

Moreover, I need to perform this operation on multiple directories, and each time, the condition might be different.\r\n\r\nThe way I thought I would go about this was to create a higher-order function that reads in the files, extracts the property of interest from each, and then applies the condition (supplied as an argument in the form of a function) element-wise to the resulting vector of values:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilter.by.property &lt;- function(where, funct) {\r\n  setwd(where)\r\n  paths &lt;- list.files(&quot;.&quot;, pattern = &quot;.file&quot;)\r\n  Robjects &lt;- Map(read.file, paths)\r\n  values &lt;- sapply(Robjects, function(x) property_of_interest(x))\r\n  passes &lt;- Filter(funct, paths)\r\n  dir.create(&quot;dir1&quot;)\r\n  dir.create(&quot;dir2&quot;)\r\n  file.copy(passes, paste(&quot;./dir1/&quot;, 1:length(passes), &quot;.file&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;))\r\n  file.copy(paths[!paths %in% passes], paste(&quot;./dir2/&quot;, (length(passes) + 1):length(paths), &quot;.file&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I would like the condition-specifying function (supplied in the `funct` argument) to have access to the `values` vector. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nten.biggest &lt;- function(path) {\r\n  Robject &lt;- read.file(path)\r\n  property_of_interest(x) %in% tail(sort(values), 10)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfilter.by.property(&lt;place&gt;, ten.biggest)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince R is lexically scoped, it will look for `values` in the environment where `ten.biggest` is defined (the global environment) rather than in the environment where it is called (i.e., inside `filter.by.property`). I could solve this by using global assignment for `values` inside `filter.by.property`, but I&#39;d prefer not to do that unless absolutely necessary. I could also supply `values` as another argument to `ten.biggest`, but then the function would no longer be unary, and I&#39;m not sure how (or even whether) it could still be used inside `Filter`.\r\n\r\nOne solution I attempted was to rewrite `ten.biggest` as follows\r\n\r\n```\r\nten.biggest &lt;- function(path) {\r\n  Robject &lt;- read.file(path)\r\n  property_of_interest(x) %in% tail(sort(eval.parent(parse(text = values))), 10)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to I can emulate dynamic scoping in R to make this work? From reading related StackExchange questions, it seems that perhaps the `body` function could help, but I don&#39;t know how to apply it to my problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332884/emulate-dynamic-scoping-in-r-to-filter-by-arbitrary-functions","title":"Emulate dynamic scoping in R to filter by arbitrary functions"},{"tags":["plugins","photoshop","adobe-illustrator","google-fonts","graphic-design"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":324,"user_id":4014834,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daveh0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4014834/daveh0"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570758218,"post_id":58332883,"comment_id":103023795,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332883/preferred-way-to-control-access-to-google-fonts-in-dev-test-environments#comment103023795_58332883"}],"owner":{"reputation":324,"user_id":4014834,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daveh0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4014834/daveh0"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570755389,"creation_date":1570755389,"question_id":58332883,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332883","body_markdown":"Although far from perfect, the Fontea, the plugin for Photoshop and Illustrator, allowed us to design with these fonts but not have them installed on our workstations.

Interim / intermediate results are distributed to these stakeholders via pdf attachments sent via e-mail.\r\n\r\nThere are 8 different pdf documents corresponding to each of the 8 cohorts.  Each pdf document is about 14 pages long and contain fairly simple content such a few graphs and tables.  The structure of the 8 pdfs are identical.\r\nThe previous developer used an R markdown based workflow and generated the pdfs from the markdown.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are 8 markdown documents (corresponding to the 8 cohorts) and each markdown document contains about 400 lines of basically identical code. The code is embedded in the markdown file.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the sets of code is that each of the 8 sets point to a different data source.\r\n\r\nWhen there are changes / enhancments, all of the 8 sets of code (i.e markdown documents) need to be changed.\r\n\r\nObviously, I would like to make a single code change that affects all 8 cohorts.\r\n\r\nI am thinking would be to programmatically create the markdown files and then programmatically generate the corresponding pdf files.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot find any R packages that would enable me to programmatically create an R markdown file.  Of course, I could create a markdown file just using text-based methods but I am wondering if anyone can think of a better

But you haven&#39;t bound the incoming model to that route.\r\n\r\nYou can do this using a variable on your route something like this:\r\n\r\n    Route::post(&#39;/home/{postPicture}&#39;, &#39;PostPicturesController@create&#39;)-&gt;name(&#39;home&#39;);\r\nwhere the route variable matches the injected variable on the controller exactly.\r\n\r\nBut, if you are sending the ID directly via a data object, it may be easier to just load the `$request` variable, and then pull the `id`, and subsequently the model with that id, within your method.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I&#39;m not sure either of these will work as you wish.  I&#39;m not entirely sure what you are trying to do with this create method.  If you are trying to create a new PostPictures model - then what is Laravel supposed to be injecting?  IE if there is no model yet, how can you pull one from the database?  By convention, usually this method doesn&#39;t have an `id` coming in, but you would show a form or something to create a new model here and store it in the `store` method.  As you have it, it looks like a bit of a loop (postpicture -&gt; user -&gt; postpicture).    \r\n\r\nBottom line though is that the error is likely happening because there is nothing sent to that method to allow the model to be injected - no id = no `$postPicture`\r\n\r\nIf you are just trying to create a new model and give the right user to it, you can simplify your method a bit.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n    public function store(Request $request) {\r\n        $uID = \\Auth::user()-&gt;id;\r\n        $uploadPic = PostPicture::create([\r\n            &#39;body&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;get(&#39;body&#39;)\r\n            &#39;user_id&#39; =&gt; $uID    // assuming user_id is the fk\r\n        ]);\r\n\r\n        // If you want to load the user on the new object:\r\n        $uploadPic-&gt;load(&#39;user&#39;);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332851/what-am-i-doing-wrong-in-my-controller-thats-causing-the-500-error/58332921#58332921","title":"What am I doing wrong in my controller that&#39;s causing the 500 error?"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11914034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RbjF4yeB9go/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcYYDJHY9kANe5MyrERpK4UipEoEw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"luvs2spuge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11914034/luvs2spuge"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11914034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RbjF4yeB9go/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcYYDJHY9kANe5MyrERpK4UipEoEw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"luvs2spuge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11914034/luvs2spuge"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570757725,"creation_date":1570755024,"last_edit_date":1570755885,"question_id":58332851,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332851","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t understand what on earth I&#39;m doing wrong.

have trying to understand the build process at a much finer level by doing all the building myself without a build tool, so I can understand and appreciate gradle more.\r\n\r\nI have two folders in my Desktop, `gradle_demo` and `library-A`, `gradle_demo` has only one java file which is the main class. This class requires a dependency on `library-A`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from below snapshot on my atom editor, under the `library-A`, I have two classes `DemoMathUtil.java` and `NetworkUtil.java`. I packaged the two java files into a jar and you can see the content on the right of the snapshot\r\n\r\nSo, in my `Program.java` file, I got this code:\r\n\r\n    import DemoMathUtil;\r\n    \r\n    public class Program {\r\n    \r\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        DemoMathUtil mu = new DemoMathUtil();\r\n        mu.m1();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt only used the `DemoMathUtil` class.\r\n\r\nIn the terminal, I wrote the following:\r\n\r\n`Wings-MacBook-Pro:gradle_demo wingsuncheung$ javac -cp .;../library-A/demo.jar Program.java`\r\n\r\nAnd this is the error I got:\r\n\r\n`javac: no source files`\r\n\r\n`bash: ../library-A/demo.jar: Permission denied`\r\n\r\nWhy is that? I feel like I have done everything correct, but the compiler denied my access to my own jar file.\r\n\r\nAny clues? thanks\r\n\r\n[![Jars structure][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bHo5.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332808/adding-jar-file-to-buildpath-and-got-permission-denied-error","title":"Adding jar file to buildpath and got permission denied error"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html","css","dom"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":12197525,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_e4uoRW0pec/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfMt1rL6LkvT_pTgDX2xu4PDwFEIg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dane Maison","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12197525/dane-maison"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570757015,"creation_date":1570757015,"answer_id":58333049,"question_id":58332804,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58333049","body_markdown":"You can use the `element.getBoundingClientRect()` method to get the position of a specific element on the screen, and then the `scrollBy` method to move the screen to that element.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332804/prevent-page-jumping-when-dom-element-collapse/58333049#58333049","title":"Prevent page jumping when DOM element collapse"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10204,"user_id":638544,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d4c99fe6d9d6cfa7198610b0541cf5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Brilliand","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/638544/brilliand"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570853534,"creation_date":1570853534,"answer_id":58350776,"question_id":58332804,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58350776","body_markdown":"I think you have the wrong plan here.

When the module is about to collapse, trigger a JS function.\r\n\r\n2. The JS function should be able to mark down current user&#39;s viewpoint location on the page.\r\n\r\n3.

Take a look at [CommandBox][1]. It makes it extremely easy to use different versions of CF.\r\n\r\n&gt; chr(2) returns the value &quot;/u000299&quot;\r\n\r\nAnyway.. the serializeJSON() function is what&#39;s converting `chr(2)` into `/u0002`. However, this doesn&#39;t seem to be new behavior. [CF 11 does the same thing][2]. Instead of trying to &quot;fix the fix&quot;, try using one of the [newer serialization features][3] instead:\r\n\r\n&gt; Adobe ColdFusion (2016 release) Update 2 enables you to specify the\r\n&gt; datatype information for keys in a struct. This is known as metadata.\r\n\r\nExplicitly declare the `payment_form` value as a string and CF will enclose it in quotes instead of guessing it&#39;s a number.\r\n\r\n**Input:**\r\n\r\n    input = {&quot;payment_form&quot;:&quot;99&quot;};\r\n    input.setMetadata( {payment_form: {type: &quot;string&quot;}} );\r\n    output = serializeJSON( input );\r\n    writeDump( output );\r\n\r\n**Results:**\r\n\r\n    {&quot;payment_form&quot;:&quot;99&quot;}\r\n\r\nAlso, in case you&#39;re building this from a query object, CF2016 added two new application settings that can override the wacky default for serialized queries, making it MUCH easier to [generate a properly cased array of structures out of the box][4].\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox\r\n  [2]: https://trycf.com/gist/b4f937cbfa6d710d24639789b87aae03/acf11?theme=monokai\r\n  [3]: https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/cfml-reference/coldfusion-functions/functions-s/serializejson.html\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57122084/javascript-jquery-returns-cfquery-value-of-no-as-false-and-yes-as-true/57212161#57212161","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332796/encoding-problem-between-coldfusion-11-and-coldfusion-2016/58333771#58333771","title":"Encoding problem between Coldfusion 11 and Coldfusion 2016"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":6392534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/S1LLe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gabriel Villafuerte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6392534/gabriel-villafuerte"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3859,"user_id":8895292,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea18986c1a59000cc60f6b46617eb742?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ageax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895292/ageax"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58333771,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570764525,"creation_date":1570754528,"last_edit_date":1570764446,"question_id":58332796,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332796","body_markdown":"I currently use ColdFusion 11 as a local server for development.\r\n\r\nI have a JSON string that is serialized with ColdFusion . Within the string I have to insert a code &quot;99&quot; in the object &quot;Payment_form&quot;. The Api required in the response tells me that the Payment_form object be a string.\r\n\r\nKnowing about problems with ColdFusion serialization with JSON string and the numerical representation, look here at StackOverflow and find a solution by placing a &quot;chr(2)&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved.... but only in ColdFusion 11. When I uploaded the code to the ColdFusion hosting (hostek.com/CF2016) it stopped working, because chr(2) returns the value &quot;/u000299&quot; and consequently the API responds with an error.\r\n\r\nI assumed that ColdFusion 2016 changed the handling of chr(), but in the documentation of both versions there are no changes in the handling of this function.\r\n\r\nIt seems that CF/2016 is changing (Escaped Unicode) according to the ASCII table.\r\n\r\n[![Image of representations of ASCII character 2][1]][1]\r\n\r\n So?.

Nonetheless, I wrote these two examples of two methods for you to use. Note that these are just general examples. You have to fix them to your usage case and what system, platform, or python version you are targeting.\r\n\r\nFiles are a continues block of memory. Just think of a file as a string of text that is mutable. Its length can be increased or decreased but only from one side and that side is the end of the file.\r\n\r\nMethod 1: Thus, if you want to get rid of the 10th line. Get the position of where the 10 line is. Read everything after line 10 and save that into a string. Truncate the file to the end of the 9th line. Append whatever after the 10th after truncating the file.\r\n\r\n    fileName = &quot;test.txt&quot;\r\n    line10start = -1\r\n    line11start = -1\r\n    morethan15 = 0\r\n    \r\n    f = open(fileName, &quot;r&quot;)\r\n    for i in range(0,16):\r\n      if ( f.readline() == &quot;&quot; ):\r\n        break;\r\n      if ( i == 8 ):\r\n        line10start = f.tell()\r\n      if ( i == 9 ):\r\n        line11start = f.tell()\r\n      if ( i == 15 ):\r\n        morethan15 = 1\r\n    if ( morethan15 == 1 ):\r\n      f.seek(line11start)\r\n      contentAfter10 = f.read()\r\n    f.close()\r\n    \r\n    if ( morethan15 == 1 ):\r\n      with open(fileName, &#39;a&#39;) as f: \r\n        f.seek(line10start);\r\n        f.truncate();\r\n        f.write(contentAfter10)\r\n\r\nMethod 2: Just read the entire file into a list. If its length is larger than 15, remove the 10th index and write that back to the file. Ultimately, you don&#39;t have to use pop(), you can just assign index 9 with an empty string.\r\n\r\n    fileName = &quot;test.txt&quot;\r\n    fileContent = []\r\n    \r\n    with open(fileName, &#39;r&#39;) as f: \r\n      fileContent = f.readlines()\r\n    \r\n    if ( len(fileContent) &gt; 15 ):\r\n      fileContent.pop(9)\r\n      with open(fileName, &#39;w&#39;) as f: \r\n        f.write(&quot;&quot;.join(fileContent))\r\n\r\ntest.txt content:\r\n\r\n    this is line 1c\r\n    this is line 2c\r\n    this is line 3c\r\n    this is line 4c\r\n    this is line 5c\r\n    this is line 6c\r\n    this is line 7c\r\n    this is line 8c\r\n    this is line 9c\r\n    this is line 10c\r\n    this is line 11c\r\n    this is line 12c\r\n    this is line 13c\r\n    this is line 14c\r\n    this is line 15c\r\n    this is line 16c\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332793/removing-one-line-in-file/58333617#58333617","title":"Removing one line in file"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12198132,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6JMWxzvRCPE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd_Bjij7w3gQlMGEwe-srgUTaGflg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andrejovic Andrej","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12198132/andrejovic-andrej"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58333617,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570763181,"creation_date":1570754500,"question_id":58332793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332793","body_markdown":"I trying to insert some lines to `news.php` file.

Anyways, here&#39;s what I did with my code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Update()\r\n    {\r\n        if (joystick.Horizontal &gt;= .1f || joystick.Horizontal &lt;= -.1f)\r\n        {\r\n            movement.x = joystick.Horizontal;\r\n            MoveCharacter();\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            movement.x = 0f;\r\n            angle = 0f;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (joystick.Vertical &gt;= .1f || joystick.Vertical &lt;= -.1f)\r\n        {\r\n            movement.y = joystick.Vertical;\r\n            MoveCharacter();\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            movement.y = 0f;\r\n            angle = 0f;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void MoveCharacter()\r\n    {\r\n        rb.MovePosition(rb.position + movement * moveSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime);\r\n        angle = Mathf.Atan2(movement.y, movement.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg - 90f;\r\n        transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(new Vector3(0f, 0f, angle));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully this may help someone that might have the same problem. I doubt anyone would have the same problem but I hope it helps. :D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332790/why-does-my-gameobject-returns-back-to-a-certain-z-position-when-joystick-is-let/58336873#58336873","title":"Why does my GameObject returns back to a certain z-position when Joystick is let go?"}],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":3471178,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbdd0948ccdfdffe9e345a7a65d1784f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"m.lacabe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3471178/m-lacabe"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570781191,"creation_date":1570754474,"question_id":58332790,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332790","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a small project in unity. It&#39;s a top down game which has a character that is controlled by a joystick. When I run the game, my character starts -90 on the z-position which supposed to be at 0. But when I move the joystick to the direction I wanted it to run it works fine, meaning it&#39;s facing the direction where it&#39;s running to. However, if I let go of the joystick, the character snaps back to -90 in z-position, which I am trying to figure why it does that and prevent it from happening.\r\n\r\nI have looked for tutorial videos and some post in here but none has answered my issue. I also tried removing the &quot;-90f&quot; on my Mathf.Atan2 formula but when I did, it rotates 90 in z-position less. Meaning, when I direct the joystick straight down, the character rotates facing right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour\r\n{\r\n\r\n    public static PlayerController instance;\r\n\r\n    public Rigidbody2D rb;\r\n    public Joystick joystick;\r\n\r\n    private float moveSpeed = 2.5f;\r\n    Vector2 movement;\r\n  \r\n\r\n    //

transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(new Vector3(0f, 0f, angle));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect to  have my character to start on 0 in z-position when the game start and also have the character stay and face the direction of the joystick before it was let go instead of rotating back to -90 in z-position.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332790/why-does-my-gameobject-returns-back-to-a-certain-z-position-when-joystick-is-let","title":"Why does my GameObject returns back to a
