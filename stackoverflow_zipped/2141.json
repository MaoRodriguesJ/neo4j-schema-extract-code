We recently encountered an issue where the SMB share became inaccessible, causing 504 gateway timeout error when accessing the application.  The share is mounted in Global.asax and has a timeout so if the share is offline entirely it will only wait for a few seconds before loading the page, minus the assets.\r\n\r\nIf the share is already mounted however and then goes offline, the application seems to freeze trying to access it.  I realize that the IIS request timeout could be increased but that would likely end up being far longer than a user would tolerate...  Is there anyway to set a timeout on the individual file access attempts to the SMB share?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031734/setting-timeout-on-smb-share-access-in-net-web-app","title":"Setting timeout on SMB share access in .NET web app"},{"tags":["android","android-webview"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12095249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDGMf9JPHYco7GG7aw88FiBqOeXArDzfXDO2BOCuA=k-s128","display_name":"RAS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095249/ras"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3141,"user_id":6021469,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Slrs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shweta Chauhan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6021469/shweta-chauhan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569053385,"creation_date":1568995015,"last_edit_date":1569053385,"question_id":58031733,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031733","body_markdown":"all I have build app and it was working fine before but now when I installed office suite it loads the Html file form the app and app itself is not loading the file as before.

installing a WiX standard bootstrapper to install several packages in a Chain. The bootstrapper shows up in the list of installed Apps &amp; Features. I can use the entry to uninstall our software on most systems, but on others, nothing visibly happens after confirming that I want to allow modifications to the system.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing to another PC (both Win 10, different editions) where the uninstall process starts properly, I find that the command lines of the launched process install.exe differ, see\r\n[this Process Explorer screenshot for the functioning case][1] and [this screenshow of the disfunctional case][2]. The latter case shows no installer window, and install.exe doesn&#39;t load a few DLLs it otherwise would, such as CoreMessaging.dll, CoreUIComponents.dll, explorerframe.dll, etc.\r\n\r\nSo for some reason, the executable is copied from its location in the package cache to the Windows temp folder. If I open the command shell and navigate to the temp location, I can launch install.exe /uninstall just fine.\r\n\r\nWhy does the system copy the installer to the temp folder? How can I debug this - I cannot find anything in the system event log, and the bootstrapper log ends after a few lines, when the log file location has been reported.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nHolger\r\n\r\n**Edit 1:**\r\n\r\nGiven that the execution from either the package cache of from the Windows temp folder is irrelevant for this issue, I have attached a debugger, using the debugging symbols of burn. In the problematic case, the main thread is stuck in UiCreateMessageWindow in the line 63:\r\n\r\n    // Wait for either the thread to be initialized or the window to exit / fail prematurely.\r\n

The method you pass to it is put in an internal queue, and then `TThread::Queue()` exits immediately. The main UI thread runs the queued method at its earliest convenience, usually long after the queuing thread has moved on to do other things.\n\nThe method you are passing to `TThread::Queue()` belongs to a variable that is local to `RunInMainThread()`, it goes out of scope and is no longer valid by the time the queued method is called. That is why your code crashes.\n\nYou don&#39;t have that problem with `TThread::Synchronize()` because it runs *synchronously*, it does not exit until after the synced method has been called. So, it is OK to use a method that belongs to a local variable, the variable won&#39;t go out of scope until after the synced method exits.\n\nTo fix your use of `TThread::Queue()`, you need to allocate the variable dynamically and let the main UI thread free it after the queued method is done, eg:\n\n```c++\ntypedef void (__closure *FTCdef)(const __int64, const wchar_t);\n\nvoid RunInMainThread(FTCdef FuncToCall, const __int64 fP1, const wchar_t fP2)\n{\n\tstruct Args\n\t{\n\t\t__int64 P1;\n\t\twchar_t P2;\n\t\tFTCdef FTC;\n\n\t\t/*\n\t\tvoid __fastcall ExecFuncSync()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tFTC(P1, P2);\n\t\t}\n\t\t*/\n\n\t\tvoid __fastcall ExecFuncQueue()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\tFTC(P1, P2);\n\t\t\t} __finally {\n\t\t\t\tdelete this;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\n\t//Args args{fP1, fP2, FuncToCall};\n\t//TThread::Synchronize(NULL, &amp;args.ExecFuncSync);\n\n\tArgs *args = new Args;\n\targs-&gt;P1 = fP1;\n\targs-&gt;P2 = fP2;\n\targs-&gt;FTC = FuncToCall;\n\tTThread::Queue(NULL, &amp;args-&gt;ExecFuncQueue);\n}\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031713/tthreadqueue-crashes-c-builder/58037385#58037385","title":"TThread::Queue crashes C++ Builder"}],"owner":{"reputation":1749,"user_id":974700,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee45cd52f0db0a7d720d97c45809ee03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Coder12345","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/974700/coder12345"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33418,"user_id":2521214,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nd58V.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Spektre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2521214/spektre"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58037385,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569041766,"creation_date":1568994945,"last_edit_date":1569035349,"question_id":58031713,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031713","body_markdown":"I am using C++ Builder 2010.

But for the UPDATE query it&#39;s no use to pick every clause by hand, a loop would be a much cleaner solution.\r\n\r\nThe approach demonstrated by @ooa is better but they forgot to create the actual update clauses. Besides, it is using these *despicable* variable variables. \r\n\r\nBut the right solution is almost there. We will use my example for PDO that accomplishes the same thing, [How to create a prepared statement for UPDATE query](https://phpdelusions.net/pdo_examples/dynamical_update):\r\n\r\n    // the list of allowed field names\r\n    $allowed = [&#39;prov&#39;, &#39;city&#39;, &#39;addr&#39;, &#39;code&#39;, &#39;phone&#39;, &#39;phone_alt&#39;];\r\n    \r\n    // initialize an array with values:\r\n    $params = [];\r\n    \r\n    // initialize a string with `fieldname` = ? pairs\r\n    $setStr = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    // loop over source data array\r\n    foreach ($allowed as $key)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!empty($_POST[$key]) &amp;&amp; $key != &quot;id&quot;)\r\n        {\r\n            $setStr .= &quot;`$key` = ?,&quot;;\r\n            $params[] = $_POST[$key];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    $setStr = rtrim($setStr, &quot;,&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    $params[] = $_POST[&#39;id&#39;];\r\n    prepared_query(&quot;UPDATE _MAIN_meta SET $setStr WHERE main_user = ?&quot;, [$params]);\r\n\r\nAnd for goodness sake, forget about variable variables.

It&#39;s an account information form where a person can change the information associated with their account.

However a person can choose to only fill out city, press submit and just that info gets updated, all other info remains the same.\r\n\r\nThis might make more sense with the code in hand, here is the PHP I am using to accomplish this task; There are 4 lines with comments that contain code, these were left in since they were an attempt at answering my own question; they may help explain what I&#39;m trying to achieve:\r\n\r\nPHP\r\n===\r\n```\r\n// SQL HELPER\r\nfunction prepared_Query($con, $sql, $params, $types = &quot;&quot;){\r\n\t$types = $types ?: str_repeat(&quot;s&quot;, count($params));\r\n\t$stmt\t= $con -&gt; prepare($sql);\r\n\t$stmt -&gt; bind_param($types, ...$params);\r\n\t$stmt -&gt; execute();\r\n\treturn $stmt;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// TRIM ALL POST VARS\r\nfunction trim_Val(&amp;$val){\r\n\t$val = trim($val);\r\n}\r\narray_filter($_POST, &#39;trim_Val&#39;);\r\n\r\n// SANITIZE ALL INPUTS \r\n$filter\t= [&#39;filter&#39; =&gt; FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING, &#39;flags&#39; =&gt; FILTER_FLAG_ENCODE_HIGH | FILTER_FLAG_ENCODE_LOW];\r\n$inputs\t= [&#39;prov&#39;, &#39;city&#39;, &#39;addr&#39;, &#39;code&#39;, &#39;phone&#39;, &#39;phone_alt&#39;];\r\n$keys\t    = array_fill_keys($inputs, $filter);\r\n$values    = filter_input_array(INPUT_POST, $keys);\r\nunset($filter, $inputs, $keys); // cleanup\r\n\r\n$sqlA \t= [];\r\nforeach($values as $key=&gt;$val){\r\n\tif($val){\r\n\t\t$$key\t= $val;\r\n\t\t//$sqlA[]\t= &quot;meta_&quot;.$key.&quot; = ?&quot;;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n//$sqlA = implode(&quot;, &quot;, $sqlA);\r\n//$sql  = &quot;UPDATE _MAIN_meta SET &quot;.$sqlA.&quot; WHERE meta_user = ?;&quot;;\r\n//$stmt = prepared_Query($con, $sql, [$$key, $uid]);\r\n\r\nif(!empty($prov)){\r\n\t$sql\t= &quot;UPDATE _MAIN_meta SET meta_prov = ?

Phone&quot;;\r\n}\r\n$con -&gt; close();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I repeat that last function over and over again, and it seems silly to run that ```$stmt``` repeatedly when it could be accomplished with a single execute. From what I&#39;ve learnt in my time with PHP and programming fundamentals, this is very WET code, where T is no longer twice but 6x too much.  In an attempt to solve this issue I created an array, then ```foreach``` input that was set; add the column name to that array.  Once finished ```implode``` the array using a comma separator.  Finally create the SQL statement using that imploded array.\r\n\r\nThis outputs a dynamically built SQL statement based on whatever inputs are set.  So if City and Address contain data the statement would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$sql = &quot;UPDATE _MAIN_meta SET meta_city = ?, meta_addr = ? WHERE meta_user = ?;&quot;;\r\n```\r\nNow I have this working up to this point, depending on what inputs I&#39;ve filled out the final output of the SQL statement is exactly what I want it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem...\r\n===\r\n ...I have is when it comes to binding that statement to variable-Variables.  I don&#39;t know if its even possible to get *ALL* of the set var-vars into the parameters of this ```prepared_Query()``` function, when I have no idea which ones are set.\r\n\r\nPossibly my logic is flawed, but I was so close to getting this to work I have to ask if there is a way I can accomplish this, or if it even makes sense doing it this way.  It makes sense to me, but I&#39;ve gone down some pretty nasty blackholes with PHP before.  I&#39;m sure there is someone out there with a bit more common sense than I.. when it comes to doing something like this.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, how can I bind variable Variables to a prepared SQL statement when each one is optional.  Is there any way to not have to write a separate statement for each input?  Or a shorter/faster way to do this?\r\n\r\nThese SO question are similar but do not answer the question I have:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19986738/dynamically-generating-an-sql-statement-based-on-user-form-input \r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/14761462/dynamic-sql-select-statement-with-php-based-on-user-options \r\n\r\nThere seems to be a few other questions out there phrased like this, but I could not find a clear example of someone trying to solve this same sort of problem.  This is what makes me think my logic is somehow flawed.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point me in the right direction, please? \r\n\r\n*Note: I think I&#39;ve pasted everything relevant to the question, let me know if something is not clear.*\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031677/build-a-prepared-sql-statement-based-on-user-inputs-with-php","title":"&quot;Build&quot; a prepared SQL statement based on user-inputs with PHP"},{"tags":["jenkins","jenkins-pipeline"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":961,"user_id":3014025,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/25zFH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adam vonNieda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3014025/adam-vonnieda"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568997038,"creation_date":1568997038,"answer_id":58032147,"question_id":58031673,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58032147","body_markdown":"Might not be the best solution, but it&#39;s the one I use extensively.

  Serial.read();\r\n        digitalWrite (trig, LOW);\r\n        delayMicroseconds(5);\r\n    \r\n        digitalWrite(trig, HIGH);\r\n        delayMicroseconds(10);\r\n    \r\n        digitalWrite(trig, LOW);\r\n    \r\n        int T = pulseIn(echo, HIGH);\r\n    \r\n        S= 0.034;\r\n        D= T *S/2;\r\n        Serial.print(&quot;|&quot;);\r\n        Serial.print(D);\r\n        Serial.println(&quot;|&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n       delay(5000);\r\n\r\nAnd this for the PIR sensor:\r\n\r\n    valor = digitalRead(pinPIR);\r\n    if(valor == HIGH)\r\n    {\r\n      digitalWrite(pinLED, HIGH);\r\n      Serial.println(valor);\r\n      EstPIR = HIGH;\r\n      delay(5000);\r\n      }else{\r\n        digitalWrite(pinLED, LOW);\r\n        if (EstPIR == HIGH){\r\n            Serial.println(valor);\r\n            EstPIR = LOW;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThese are written in the loop void of the Arduino code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

According to the specification, **[client][1]** is an application which require tokens to access protected resources.\r\n\r\nAnd then there&#39;s an resource owner who own the true resource. In most of the scenarios this will be a human user like you and me. But sometimes there are OAuth grants which allow token issuing for a client. For example [Client Credentials Grant][2] issue token to client. \r\n\r\nSo to answer your question, first you need to differentiate the grant that you are using. If your application simply use tokens issued to it, then you can simply use set of tokens of that application in the backend. But if it involved end users, then you need to differentiate token per user.\r\n\r\nUsually, your users should have a unique identifier (ex:- email is one such).

In short: a generic callable.\r\n\r\n(2) If you can modify the `RegisterCmdHandler()` function **but** you need to know (and use) the `ReqT` and `RestT`, you can follows the plain function pointer way (see Maxim Egorushkin&#39;s answer for the syntax). Unfortunately this works with function pointers only and doesn&#39;t works (by example) when `sync_handler` is a lambda.\r\n\r\n(3) If you can&#39;t modify `RegisterCmdHandler()` but you can use C++17, you can use `std::function` deduction guides and call the function as follows\r\n\r\n    RegisterCmdHandler(1, std::function{SomeHandler}); \r\n\r\nor, maybe better if you have to call it in different places, call it through a converter\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename F&gt;\r\n    auto CallRegisterCH (int cmd_if, F &amp;&amp; func)\r\n     { return RegisterCmdHandler(cmd_if, std::function{std::forward&lt;F&gt;(func)}); }\r\n\r\ncalling it as follows\r\n\r\n    CallRegisterCH(1, SomeHandler);\r\n\r\n(4) if you can&#39;t modify `RegisterCmdHandler()` and you have to use C++11 or C++14... well... explicating the template types\r\n\r\n    RegisterCmdHandler&lt;Foo, Bar&gt;(1, SomeHandler); \r\n\r\nseems to me the better way.\r\n\r\nOther ways you can explicit the `std::function`\r\n\r\n    std::function&lt;int(int, Foo const &amp;, Bar &amp;)&gt;  sh{ SomeHandler };\r\n\r\n    RegisterCmdHandler(1, sh);\r\n\r\nbut seems to me almost the same thing.\r\n     ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031607/c-template-parameter-compiler-can-not-deduce/58032616#58032616","title":"c++ template parameter compiler can not deduce"}],"owner":{"reputation":350,"user_id":7609067,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07b9896b3a2884ee3a6582869fae8521?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xinnjie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7609067/xinnjie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46842,"user_id":6022656,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf138f6c424001ac8491ca86b1976c0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"max66","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6022656/max66"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58031718,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569004825,"creation_date":1568994547,"last_edit_date":1569004825,"question_id":58031607,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031607","body_markdown":"here is function to register.\r\n\r\n\ttemplate &lt;typename ReqT, typename RespT&gt;\r\n\tbool RegisterCmdHandler(int cmd_id, std::function&lt;int(int, const ReqT&amp;, RespT&amp;)&gt; sync_handler) {\r\n\t\t// ... do something with sync_handler and register it for later callback\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nand a specific handler to register:\r\n\r\n\tint SomeHandler(int id, const Foo&amp; req, Bar&amp; resp) {\r\n\t\t// ... specific logic\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nnow I want to apply the Handler to Register Function, compiler complains\r\n\r\n\tRegisterCmdHandler(1, SomeHandler); // ERROR, compiler can not deduce\r\n\r\nwhile specificly write out the type is OK:\r\n\r\n\tRegisterCmdHandler&lt;Foo, Bar&gt;(1, SomeHandler); // OK, compiler can deduce\r\n\r\nbut the latter has ugly API.

you have that `JdbcSourceUpdate` implementation, there is just enough to do like this:\r\n\r\n    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void handleMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; message) throws MessagingException {\r\n\r\nSee its JavaDocs for more info:\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n\t * Create a new transaction, and suspend the current transaction if one exists.\r\n\t * Analogous to the EJB transaction attribute of the same name.\r\n\t * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Actual transaction suspension will not work out-of-the-box\r\n\t * on all transaction managers. This in particular applies to\r\n\t * {@link org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager},\r\n\t * which requires the {@code javax.transaction.TransactionManager} to be\r\n\t * made available to it (which is server-specific in standard Java EE).\r\n\t * @see org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager#setTransactionManager\r\n\t */\r\n\tREQUIRES_NEW(TransactionDefinition.PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW),\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nPay attention to the NOTE though:\r\n\r\n     * Actual transaction suspension will not work out-of-the-box\r\n     * on all transaction managers. This in particular applies to\r\n     * {@link org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager}`. \r\n\r\nSo, sounds like `DataSourceTransactionManager` doesn&#39;t work with suspension. I can suggest you to consider to use a `.gateway()` for that `JdbcSourceUpdate`, but using an `ExecutorChannel`. This way your `handle(jdbcSourceUpdate()` will be performed on a new thread and, therefore, with a new transaction. The main flow will wait for the reply from that gateway holding its transaction opened.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.subscribe(f -&gt; f\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.gateway(subFlow -&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubFlow.channel(c -&gt; c.executor())\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.handle(jdbcMessageHandler()))\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.channel(&quot;nullChannel&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t));\r\n\r\nBuy your `JdbcSourceUpdate` must return something for the gateway reply. Consider do not implement `MessageHandler` there, but make just as a plain POJO with a single non-`void` method.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031595/spring-integration-start-new-transaction-in-my-message-flow-integrationflowbuil/58031804#58031804","title":"Spring Integration: start new transaction in my Message flow IntegrationFlowBuilder to commit change and resume the outer transaction"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12075120,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2766a5c3d7bfca8944c6999d67ccfc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mohamed  Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12075120/mohamed-ali"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568999671,"creation_date":1568994500,"question_id":58031595,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031595","body_markdown":"My jdbcSourceMessage execute a select for update with batch of 100 rows at a time.\r\nWhile the integrationFlow is been executed in a Transaction to hold a lock to the database for the fetched batch.\r\nI would like to start new Transaction for my JdbcSourceUpdate (within the message flow) to excute an update and commit my change for each\r\nrow sent throught the channel.  \r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public IntegrationFlow integrationFlow() {\r\n        IntegrationFlowBuilder flowBuilder = IntegrationFlows.from(jdbcSourceMessage());\r\n        flowBuilder\r\n                .split()\r\n                .log(LoggingHandler.Level.INFO, message -&gt;\r\n                        message.getHeaders().get(&quot;sequenceNumber&quot;)\r\n                                + &quot;

It is not necessary to add the self in front of every attribute, so you can just drop it.\r\n\r\nWhen listing class methods, you normally only list their signature (name, parameter names and types) and return type. The class attributes that are used inside of those methods is not listed. An example of an entry in each section would be:\r\n\r\n    Rectangle\r\n\r\n    width: float\r\n    height: float\r\n    \r\n    area(): float\r\n\r\nNote that the visibility of class attributes and methods is handled differently in Python. There are no private or protected class attributes or methods in Python; everything is public. Instead of using keywords such as private, protected, and public to signal visibility, the name is used to convey intentions regarding visibility. The general consensus is that:\r\n\r\n - class attributes and methods with a name that starts with an underscore or a double \r\n   underscore (name mangling is applied) are not part of the public interface\r\n - all other class attributes and methods are deemed part of the public interface\r\n\r\nSo, if you want indicate that the width and height attributes shouldn&#39;t be accessed from outside of this class, you would adapt the previous example in the following way:\r\n\r\n    Rectangle\r\n\r\n    _width: float\r\n    _height: float\r\n\r\n    area(): float\r\n    _a_private_method(): None\r\n \r\n**To answer your question directly: no reason to use &#39;self&#39; in a class diagram.**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031589/specifying-self-parameter-in-python-uml-class-diagrams/58032614#58032614","title":"Specifying self parameter in Python UML class diagrams"}],"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":11486181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCMLh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pavel Antspovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11486181/pavel-antspovich"},"last_editor":{"reputation":118,"user_id":11486181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCMLh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pavel Antspovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11486181/pavel-antspovich"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58032614,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568999382,"creation_date":1568994482,"last_edit_date":1568996812,"question_id":58031589,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031589","body_markdown":"I know that there is no official UML standarts for Python but if I want to specify parameters in methods of class should I specify ```self``` parameter?

If Value\r\n&gt; is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing\r\n&gt; attribute.\r\n\r\nI was able to find a [AWS forum post][2] that had a successful upsert, as well as another [SO answer][3] with the ADD and SET syntax in the same line.  Below is some code that will run if placed in a new lambda (change your region to match where your table is)\r\n\r\n    var AWS = require(&#39;aws-sdk&#39;);\r\n    var documentClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({&#39;region&#39;: &#39;eu-central-1&#39;});\r\n\r\n    exports.handler = function(item, context, callback) {\r\n\r\n        var params = {\r\n            TableName: &quot;my-table&quot;,\r\n            Key:{\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: item.id\r\n            },\r\n            UpdateExpression: &quot;ADD iteration :iteration SET itemdata = :itemdata&quot;,\r\n            ExpressionAttributeValues:{\r\n                &#39;:iteration&#39;: 1,\r\n                &#39;:itemdata&#39; : item.data\r\n            },\r\n            ReturnValues:&quot;NONE&quot;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    documentClient.update(params, function(err, data) {\r\n        if (err) {\r\n          console.log(&quot;Error&quot;, err);\r\n          const errResponse = {\r\n            statusCode: 500,\r\n            headers: {\r\n              &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            body: JSON.stringify({ Error: 500, device : &quot;DynamoDB&quot;, detail : err })\r\n          };\r\n          callback(null, errResponse);\r\n        } else {\r\n          console.log(&quot;Success&quot;, params.Items);\r\n          const response = {\r\n            statusCode: 200,\r\n            headers: {\r\n              &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            body: JSON.stringify(&quot;upsert complete.&quot;)\r\n          };\r\n          callback(null, response);\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    };\r\n\r\n**note:**  data is a reserved keyword, and I got the following error:\r\n\r\n    Invalid UpdateExpression: Attribute name is a reserved keyword; reserved keyword: data\r\n\r\nconsider changing it to something else.  I used `itemdata`.  \r\n\r\nRunning it once will insert a new record.  The following images are before and after images of the table after I run the lambda the second time.  \r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateItem.html#API_UpdateItem_RequestSyntax\r\n  [2]: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=239939\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39387846\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/FVkgk.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/eEbVD.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031562/aws-lambda-node-js-increment-value-if-exist-else-add-element/58141363#58141363","title":"AWS Lambda Node Js - Increment value if exist else add element"}],"owner":{"reputation":4683,"user_id":3535537,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/buDCT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sgrillon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3535537/sgrillon"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58141363,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569618599,"creation_date":1568994374,"question_id":58031562,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031562","body_markdown":"I want increment value if exist else add element.\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------+\r\n    | id | iteration | data |\r\n    +-----------------------+\r\n    | 10 |         1 | foo1 |\r\n    | 11 |         1 | foo2 |\r\n    | 12 |         2 | foo3 |\r\n    +-----------------------+\r\n\r\nmy code:\r\n\r\n    var AWS = require(&#39;aws-sdk&#39;);\r\n    var documentClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({&#39;region&#39;: &#39;eu-west-1&#39;}); \r\n    exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {\r\n    \r\n    var params = {\r\n      Item: {\r\n        id: uuid,\r\n        iteration: 1,\r\n        data: body.data\r\n      },\r\n      TableName: &quot;my-table&quot;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    documentClient.put(params, function(err, data) {\r\n        if (err) {\r\n          console.log(&quot;Error&quot;, err);\r\n          const errResponse = {\r\n            statusCode: 500,\r\n            headers: {\r\n              &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            body: JSON.stringify({ Error: 500, device : &quot;DynamoDB&quot;, detail : err })\r\n          };\r\n          callback(null, errResponse);\r\n        } else {\r\n          console.log(&quot;Success&quot;, params.Items);\r\n          const response = {\r\n            statusCode: 200,\r\n            headers: {\r\n              &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            body: JSON.stringify(&quot;thanks&quot;)\r\n          };\r\n          callback(null, response);\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy insert is OK.\r\n\r\nI try with:\r\n\r\n    var params = {\r\n        TableName: &quot;my-table&quot;,\r\n        Key:{\r\n            &quot;id&quot;: uuid\r\n        },\r\n        UpdateExpression: &quot;set iteration = iteration + :val&quot;,\r\n        ExpressionAttributeValues:{\r\n            &quot;:val&quot;: 1\r\n        },\r\n        ReturnValues:&quot;UPDATED_NEW&quot;\r\n      };\r\n      documentClient.update(params, function(err, data) {\r\n        if (err) {\r\n            console.error(&quot;Unable to update item.

This heavily effects my workflow when making changes on request from the maintainer. I have a desktop and laptop that I use to work from. \r\n\r\nThis may not be the &quot;right&quot; idea, but I consider my desktop the &quot;homebase&quot; or &quot;original&quot; machine. My laptop is always tracking remote branches that originated from that machine. \r\n\r\nLately, I&#39;ve been running into this problem where I will make a change (either on my laptop or desktop) and have trouble rebasing the same branch on a different machine. I&#39;m not an expert at git, but I think this has something to do with trying to rebase changes on amended commits. I&#39;ll give you an example:\r\n\r\n**Desktop on a branch with a single commit and an open PR**\r\n```bash\r\n# Make requested changes\r\n&gt; touch changes.txt\r\n&gt; git add changes.txt\r\n&gt; git commit --amend\r\n&gt; git push -f origin PR_branch\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis updates my PR and launches the automated testing scripts. Now, I have a long conference call I have to go to and can still work while listening, so I grab my laptop and navigate to my repo on a branch that is tracking the branch I just pushed to\r\n\r\n**Laptop on a branch tracking the remote branch with amended commit**\r\n```bash\r\n&gt; git pull origin PR_branch\r\nFrom gitlab:user/repo\r\n * branch                PR_branch -&gt; FETCH_HEAD\r\nCONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in changes.txt\r\nAuto-merging changes.txt\r\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\r\n&gt; git status\r\nOn branch PR_branch\r\nYour branch is ahead of &#39;upstream/devel&#39; by 1 commit.\r\n  (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)\r\n\r\nYou have unmerged paths.\r\n  (fix conflicts and run &quot;git commit&quot;)\r\n  (use &quot;git merge --abort&quot; to abort the merge)\r\n\r\nUnmerged paths:\r\n  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to mark resolution)\r\n\tboth added:      changes.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point the only way I&#39;ve found to resolve this is by doing:\r\n```bash\r\n# Still on my laptop\r\n&gt; git checkout --theirs changes.txt\r\n&gt; git add changes.txt\r\n&gt; git commit -m &quot;Fixed merge conflict between desktop and laptop&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow what I&#39;ll do is `reset --hard` to the previous commit hash which is the amended commit that has the most recent changes from my desktop. My gut feeling is that this is flat out **wrong**. \r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; git reset &lt;previous commit hash&gt; --hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I have the updated changes from my desktop on my laptop and everything seems kosher. I have done this back and forth from my desktop -&gt; laptop -&gt; desktop -&gt; laptop -&gt; desktop (that many times). Is there a more idiomatic way to handle this, am I messing something up in my git history?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031548/merge-changes-in-ammended-commit-from-remote-branch","title":"Merge changes in ammended commit from remote branch?"},{"tags":["javascript","html","reactjs","image"],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":7863435,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/716c46c8742d4ae15fbc4065df94c849?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Deivbid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7863435/deivbid"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568994331,"creation_date":1568994331,"question_id":58031547,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031547","body_markdown":"hope you doing well ! \r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to add a white background to an image in ```clipboardEvent``` file (I&#39;ll attach an image of reference ).\r\n\r\nThis is the real problem: Each file I copy on my clipboard, when I catch on the ```paste``` event in my project, I received it as a ```image/PNG``` so imagine I copy a ```PDF``` I receive a ```image/PNG``` and It&#39;s ok but I want to add a white background to that file I&#39;m receiving, is there any way to do this ?

have a lot of &quot;small&quot; files that I want to copy from one server (mounted with sshfs) into my local machine.   \r\n\r\nUsing `stfp get` or `ssh, cp` only transfers one file at a time, so I has a huge overhead and it takes forever. \r\n\r\nI wanted to start multiple copying processes simultaneously to try to speed things up. I was not able to do this with bash, so this was my attempt on Python, using multiprocessing to start 30 parallel, non-overlapping, copying processes:\r\n\r\n    import multiprocessing        \r\n    from multiprocessing import Pool\r\n    from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool as ThreadPool   \r\n    import os\r\n    import shutil\r\n    \r\n    def copytree(src, dst, symlinks=False, ignore=None):\r\n        if not os.path.exists(dst):\r\n            os.makedirs(dst)\r\n        for item in os.listdir(src):\r\n            s = os.path.join(src, item)\r\n            d = os.path.join(dst, item)\r\n    \r\n            if not os.path.exists(d) or os.stat(s).st_mtime - os.stat(d).st_mtime &gt; 1:\r\n                shutil.copy2(s, d)\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n    list_of_folders = os.listdir(&#39;source/of/folders&#39;)          \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    # PARALLELIZATION INTO 30 PROCESSES:\r\n\r\n    pool = Pool(30)\r\n    pool.map(copytree, list_of_folders, chunksize=250)\r\n    pool.close()\r\n    pool.join()    \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever this seems to be just as slow as the copying in sequence. Checking on htop most processors dont seem active, and the file transfer in total is around 10MB/Second... \r\n\r\nWhy is this not working as expected?

The source control tool only track the files changes and record the history of changes. But the users is not within the scope of the source control, it only record the uses name who make any change in the source control.\r\n\r\nBesides, if remove a user from the organization will remove the code or any content they have uploaded, which will cause all code development will be aborted due to developer changes. This will be a disaster. And, according to [that document][1], it indirect explain that:\r\n\r\n&gt; After you remove a user from Azure AD, you can&#39;t assign artifacts to\r\n&gt; that user anymore. Examples are work items and pull requests. However,\r\n&gt; **we preserve the history of artifacts that were already assigned to the\r\n&gt; user**.\r\n\r\nSo, do not worry about deleting users from your organization will delete the code or any content they upload.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/delete-organization-users?view=azure-devops","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58031527/does-removing-a-user-from-azure-devops-remove-the-content-they-uploaded/58054959#58054959","title":"Does removing a user from Azure Devops remove the content they uploaded?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12096387,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48971e73b2fcbf7d8e23324dbaa55ac5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chillin_pete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096387/chillin-pete"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569206708,"creation_date":1568994245,"question_id":58031527,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58031527","body_markdown":"Currently, I am trying to do a user audit to remove old accounts from our environment.
