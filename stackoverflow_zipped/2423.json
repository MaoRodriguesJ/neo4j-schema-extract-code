What kind of information it needs to know how many threads the main thread have and which thread I&#39;m on.\r\n\r\nCode\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;errno.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n#include &quot;pthread.h&quot;\r\n\r\nvoid *foo(void *bar) {\r\n        while(1) {\r\n                printf(&quot;hello from thread: %d\\n&quot;, pthread_self());\r\n                sleep(2);\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n        printf(&quot;Before fake pthread_create&quot;);\r\n        pid_t pid;\r\n        if ((pid = fork()) == -1) {\r\n                perror(&quot;fork error&quot;);\r\n                exit(errno);\r\n        }\r\n        if (pid == 0) {\r\n                while(1) {\r\n\r\n                        sleep(3);\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (pid &gt; 0) {\r\n        \r\n                pthread_t thread;\r\n                pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, foo, NULL);\r\n                while(1) {\r\n                        printf(&quot;hello from thread: %d\\n&quot;, pthread_self());\r\n                        sleep(2);\r\n                }\r\n                return 0;\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960684/how-does-gdb-detect-pthread","title":"How does gdb detect pthread?"},{"tags":["python","pandas","dataframe","typeerror"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568650580,"post_id":57960683,"comment_id":102333206,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960683/pandas-sum-up-to-a-specific-column-value#comment102333206_57960683"},{"owner":{"reputation":2436,"user_id":5120049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9K6RV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vishnudev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5120049/vishnudev"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568650869,"post_id":57960683,"comment_id":102333336,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960683/pandas-sum-up-to-a-specific-column-value#comment102333336_57960683"},{"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":3003122,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1788fbdc0d9360c914a8e2ecc301582?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Philip Caputo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3003122/philip-caputo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568651649,"post_id":57960683,"comment_id":102333640,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960683/pandas-sum-up-to-a-specific-column-value#comment102333640_57960683"}],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":3003122,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1788fbdc0d9360c914a8e2ecc301582?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Philip Caputo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3003122/philip-caputo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":40,"user_id":3003122,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1788fbdc0d9360c914a8e2ecc301582?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Philip Caputo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3003122/philip-caputo"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568651114,"creation_date":1568650073,"last_edit_date":1568651114,"question_id":57960683,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960683","body_markdown":"The little piece of code is giving me more trouble than necessary.

However, the watermark doesn&#39;t adjust to use the new time domain.  Two use cases come to mind:\r\n\r\n - Data has been sitting in pubsub subscription for days. I want to switch to assigning windows based on processing time.  However the watermark is days behind the processing time, so window triggers will fire days late.\r\n - Timestamped data has been sitting in an external source for days, and then gets published to pubsub in a large batch.  I want to switch to assigning windows based on the intrinsic data timestamp which is days behind the published timestamp, without it being considered late data.  Adjusting allowed lateness or allowedTimestampSkew may prevent the data being dropped, but the watermark still advances based on the published timestamp (which advances too slowly because it was published quickly in one large batch).\r\n\r\nAny way to make the watermark start over and recompute itself from a certain point in the pipeline, rather than being fixed on the source timestamps?\r\n\r\nThis question doesn&#39;t really seem specific to pubsub, as I can reproduce the same behavior using fake data from GenerateSequence, running with DirectRunner.\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage com.example.beamtest;\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.Pipeline;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.io.GenerateSequence;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.options.PipelineOptions;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.options.PipelineOptionsFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.DoFn;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.GroupByKey;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.ParDo;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.WithKeys;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.BoundedWindow;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.FixedWindows;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.Window;\r\nimport org.apache.beam.sdk.values.KV;\r\nimport org.joda.time.Duration;\r\nimport org.joda.time.Instant;\r\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\r\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\r\n\r\n\r\npublic class TestPipeline {\r\n\r\n  final static Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TestPipeline.class);\r\n  // Constants for emulating pubsub data that has been sitting in the\r\n  // subscription for a while.

If I am printing the length of file_list, it contains 400 rows but ideally there should be 800 rows since I am parsing 2 files.\r\nCan someone pls help me with this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960671/unable-to-parse-multiple-files-in-a-directory-using-python","title":"Unable to parse multiple files in a directory Using Python"},{"tags":["php","symfony","doctrine","symfony-2.8"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7303,"user_id":1251684,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iX2Jq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BentCoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1251684/bentcoder"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568650817,"post_id":57960670,"comment_id":102333312,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960670/symfony-hangs-after-using-doctrine#comment102333312_57960670"},{"owner":{"reputation":1451,"user_id":3497902,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aFgSj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SilvioQ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3497902/silvioq"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1568653188,"post_id":57960670,"comment_id":102334269,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960670/symfony-hangs-after-using-doctrine#comment102334269_57960670"},{"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568658814,"post_id":57960670,"comment_id":102336461,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960670/symfony-hangs-after-using-doctrine#comment102336461_57960670"}],"owner":{"reputation":1475,"user_id":4485955,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d31f821e9c645e34ff7ee6f729843076?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"prgrm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4485955/prgrm"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568650020,"creation_date":1568650020,"question_id":57960670,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960670","body_markdown":"I am trying to debug something so I made this test controller:\r\n\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @Route(&quot;/test&quot;)\r\n     */\r\n    public function reventarAction()\r\n    {\r\n        $a = $this-&gt;getDoctrine()\r\n            -&gt;getRepository(MyTable::class)\r\n            -&gt;find(1);\r\n\r\n        var_dump($a-&gt;getId());\r\n        die();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works just fine.

made a classic error: a non-empty list has as pattern `(x:xs)` (notice the empty brackets). But you make things too complicated here.\r\n\r\nYou can implement this with a `foldr` pattern, that can convert any `(Ord a, Foldable f) =&gt; f a` to a `(Ord a, Integral i) =&gt; Map a i`:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Data.Map(Map, alter, empty)\r\nimport Data.Maybe(maybe)\r\n\r\ntoCounter :: (Ord a, Foldable f, Integral i) =&amp;gt; f a -&amp;gt; Map a i\r\ntoCounter = foldr (alter (Just . maybe 1 (1+))) empty&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nWe thus start with an `empty` map, and for each item in the `Foldable`, we perform an `alter` where, in case the item already exists (then it gives us a &lt;code&gt;Just &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we return a &lt;code&gt;Just &lt;i&gt;(n+1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and for a `Nothing` we fallback on `1`.\r\n\r\nSince it works on `(Ord a, Foldable f) =&gt; f a`, you can make a &quot;counter&quot; for anything of a type that is an instance of the `Ord` typeclass, and is stored in a object of a type that is an instance of a `Foldable`. So it can count items in a list, `Maybe` (well this has exactly one or no item), a `Tree`, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    *Main&gt; toCounter [&quot;one&quot;,&quot;one&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;three&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;three&quot;,&quot;four&quot;,&quot;four&quot;,&quot;four&quot;,&quot;four&quot;,&quot;five&quot;,&quot;five&quot;,&quot;two&quot;]\r\n    fromList [(&quot;five&quot;,2),(&quot;four&quot;,4),(&quot;one&quot;,2),(&quot;three&quot;,2),(&quot;two&quot;,4)]\r\n\r\nA shorter version, that works on lists is one written by [@DavidFletcher](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960636/converting-a-list-to-a-data-map-giving-type-error/57960752?noredirect=1#comment102333381_57960752):\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Data.Map(Map, fromListWith)\r\n\r\ntoCounter :: (Ord a, Integral i) =&amp;gt; [a] -&amp;gt; Map a i\r\ntoCounter = fromListWith (+) . map (flip (,) 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nwe can however use `toList` to let it work with `Foldable`s as well:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Data.Foldable(toList)\r\nimport Data.Map(Map, fromListWith)\r\n\r\ntoCounter :: (Ord a, Foldable f, Integral i) =&amp;gt; f a -&amp;gt; Map a i\r\ntoCounter = fromListWith (+) . map (flip (,) 1) . toList&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960636/converting-a-list-to-a-data-map-giving-type-error/57960752#57960752","title":"Converting a list to a data.map giving type error"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13407,"user_id":3522130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f83ceae9da7eb5d15dba167d1ff9357e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rnso","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3522130/rnso"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568650770,"post_id":57960759,"comment_id":102333294,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960636/converting-a-list-to-a-data-map-giving-type-error/57960759#comment102333294_57960759"},{"owner":{"reputation":14386,"user_id":7509065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eT7QDf4HDf0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAi8/Hppm678o8WA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joseph Sible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7509065/joseph-sible"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13407,"user_id":3522130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f83ceae9da7eb5d15dba167d1ff9357e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rnso","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3522130/rnso"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568650865,"post_id":57960759,"comment_id":102333334,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960636/converting-a-list-to-a-data-map-giving-type-error/57960759#comment102333334_57960759"},{"owner":{"reputation":13407,"user_id":3522130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f83ceae9da7eb5d15dba167d1ff9357e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rnso","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3522130/rnso"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568650970,"post_id":57960759,"comment_id":102333389,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960636/converting-a-list-to-a-data-map-giving-type-error/57960759#comment102333389_57960759"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14386,"user_id":7509065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eT7QDf4HDf0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAi8/Hppm678o8WA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joseph Sible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7509065/joseph-sible"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14386,"user_id":7509065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eT7QDf4HDf0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAi8/Hppm678o8WA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joseph Sible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7509065/joseph-sible"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1568650666,"last_edit_date":1568650666,"creation_date":1568650340,"answer_id":57960759,"question_id":57960636,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960759","body_markdown":"Willem Van Onsem already pointed out the first problem in a comment: you used `[y:ys]` instead of `(y:ys)`.

You can reuse it elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe best solution that I would suggest is to use [AutoMapper][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960634/how-to-custom-cast-a-list-to-a-different-type/57960831#57960831","title":"How to custom cast a list to a different type?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":41212,"user_id":941240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCC3P.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wiktor Zychla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/941240/wiktor-zychla"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568650833,"post_id":57960839,"comment_id":102333323,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960634/how-to-custom-cast-a-list-to-a-different-type/57960839#comment102333323_57960839"},{"owner":{"reputation":3357,"user_id":5762332,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ce605a59b1662e10c36c4cb6133bbd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Magnetron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5762332/magnetron"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":41212,"user_id":941240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCC3P.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wiktor Zychla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/941240/wiktor-zychla"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568651095,"post_id":57960839,"comment_id":102333437,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960634/how-to-custom-cast-a-list-to-a-different-type/57960839#comment102333437_57960839"},{"owner":{"reputation":41212,"user_id":941240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCC3P.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wiktor Zychla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/941240/wiktor-zychla"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568652262,"post_id":57960839,"comment_id":102333887,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960634/how-to-custom-cast-a-list-to-a-different-type/57960839#comment102333887_57960839"},{"owner":{"reputation":354,"user_id":9822528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af2e13489d1179cbe2c62b4982424f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DubDub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9822528/dubdub"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568709031,"post_id":57960839,"comment_id":102350743,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960634/how-to-custom-cast-a-list-to-a-different-type/57960839#comment102350743_57960839"},{"owner":{"reputation":354,"user_id":9822528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af2e13489d1179cbe2c62b4982424f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DubDub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9822528/dubdub"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568709149,"post_id":57960839,"comment_id":102350805,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960634/how-to-custom-cast-a-list-to-a-different-type/57960839#comment102350805_57960839"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3357,"user_id":5762332,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ce605a59b1662e10c36c4cb6133bbd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Magnetron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5762332/magnetron"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3357,"user_id":5762332,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ce605a59b1662e10c36c4cb6133bbd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Magnetron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5762332/magnetron"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568651278,"last_edit_date":1568651278,"creation_date":1568650625,"answer_id":57960839,"question_id":57960634,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960839","body_markdown":"From [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.cast?view=netframework-4.8#remarks) (my emphasis):\r\n\r\n&gt; The source sequence for this method is IEnumerable, which means the elements have the compile-time static type of object. **The only type conversions that are performed by this method are reference conversions and unboxing conversions**.

I am 99% certain there is a SO post somewhere that discusses this, wherein it&#39;s detailed what is optimal for cross browser support (i.e. Chrome ignoring unsafe-inline but having it present for IE) but I cannot find the thing to save my life.\r\n\r\nAny pointers?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960633/is-chrome-supposed-to-ignore-the-unsafe-inline-directive-if-a-hash-is-declared","title":"Is Chrome supposed to ignore the unsafe-inline directive if a hash is declared?"},{"tags":["spring-boot","kotlin","nullpointerexception","spring-data-jpa"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2364,"user_id":1947216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b52eaf82bd907e8b39e49aeea74273e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mentallurg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1947216/mentallurg"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568659470,"creation_date":1568659470,"answer_id":57962717,"question_id":57960630,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57962717","body_markdown":"Move initialization into a separate method and annotate it with `@PostConstruct`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960630/kotlin-and-spring-boot-transient-properties-not-initialized-properly/57962717#57962717","title":"Kotlin and Spring boot, transient properties not initialized properly"}],"owner":{"reputation":806,"user_id":2303474,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a923c830db8508f92c91cc009ccd739?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lord Yggdrasill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2303474/lord-yggdrasill"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568659470,"creation_date":1568649835,"question_id":57960630,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960630","body_markdown":"I am using spring boot with a DDD application, in which each aggregate root entity has a transient field called events, which are not persisted in database:\r\n\r\n    @MappedSuperclass\r\n    abstract class AggregateRoot&lt;TId&gt;(id: TId) : DomainModel&lt;TId&gt;(id) {\r\n\r\n        @Transient\r\n        private var events : MutableList&lt;DomainEvent&gt; = mutableListOf()\r\n\r\n        fun occurredEvents(): List&lt;DomainEvent&gt;{\r\n            val events = this.events.toMutableList()\r\n            this.events.clear()\r\n            return events\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        fun addEvent(event: DomainEvent){\r\n            events.add(event)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        fun removeEvent(event: DomainEvent){\r\n            events.remove(event)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt works fine when I add new entities by composing it myself.

This gave me a null pointer exception that took me a while to find out why it happened. \r\n\r\nI tried to change it to lateinit property and it would not work. The only workaround I have so far is to add a null check for each methods that involve events and initialize it, but this solution is suboptimal(the funny thing is, when I package it with Maven, it warns me that condition of null is always false, but it happens to be true):\r\n\r\n    if(events == null) events = mutableListOf()\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a better way to handle this problem? Maybe @Transient is the issue here? Or perhaps a custom initializer will help? Anyone know how to solve this problem in a good and elegant Kotlin way, instead of a dumb null check?

A SELECT will take a shared lock on the rows, but it shouldn&#39;t effect\r\n&gt; inserts correct?\r\n\r\nNo, it&#39;s not exact.\r\nWhen you make a `SELECT`, it can acquire `shared locks` on `pages` and even on the whole `table`,\r\nyou can test it by yourself by using `paglock` or `tablock` hints (of course you should use `repeatable read` or `serializable` to see them, as all the `shared locks` in `read committed` are released as soon as they are no needed anymore).\r\n\r\nThe same situation can be modelled this way:\r\n\r\n    if object_id(&#39;dbo.t&#39;) is not null drop table dbo.t;\r\n    \r\n    select top 10000 cast(row_number() over(order by getdate()) as varchar(10)) as col\r\n    into dbo.t\r\n    from sys.columns c1 \r\n         cross join sys.columns c2;\r\n    \r\n    set transaction isolation level serializable;\r\n    \r\n    begin tran\r\n    \tselect *\r\n    \tfrom dbo.t \r\n    \twhere col like &#39;%0%&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    \tselect resource_type,\r\n    \t       request_mode,\r\n    \t\t   count(*) as cnt\r\n    \tfrom sys.dm_tran_locks\r\n    \twhere request_session_id = @@spid\r\n    \tgroup by resource_type,\r\n    \t         request_mode;\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nHere you see `lock escalation result`, my query wanted more than 5000 `locks` per `statement` so instead of them server took only one `lock`, `shared lock` on the `table`.\r\n\r\nNow if you try to insert any row in this table from another session, your `INSERT` will be blocked.\r\n\r\nThis is because any insert first need to acquire `IX` on a `table` and `IX` on a `page`, but `IX` on a table is incompatible with `S` on the same table, so it will be blocked.\r\n\r\nThis way your `select` could block your `insert`.\r\n\r\nTo see what exactly happens on your server you should use `sys.dm_tran_locks` filtered by both your `session_id`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ucm6Y.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960609/can-select-block-a-table-from-insert/57972330#57972330","title":"Can Select block a table from Insert?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1414,"user_id":4816175,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/697df6176ef55a7ea25f159e0fcdec38?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cool breeze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4816175/cool-breeze"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569874770,"creation_date":1568649741,"last_edit_date":1569874770,"question_id":57960609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960609","body_markdown":"If I am performing SELECTS on a table, is it possible that a SELECT query on a table can block INSERTS into the same table?\r\n\r\nA SELECT will take a shared lock on the rows, but it shouldn&#39;t effect inserts correct?\r\n\r\n**The query is a LIKE clause - will this block an insert?**  Does it have the potential?\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE Description LIKE &#39;%HELLO%&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nI read this response https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017177/sql-server-select-statements-causing-blocking/1017203#1017203 and I am confused how this would block an insert.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960609/can-select-block-a-table-from-insert","title":"Can Select block a table from Insert?"},{"tags":["git","bitbucket","visual-studio-2019"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":4278585,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11fd0bb4817a3cf5931a21409fb6e362?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"GreatApe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4278585/greatape"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568727386,"creation_date":1568727386,"answer_id":57975481,"question_id":57960604,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57975481","body_markdown":"This ***IS*** a proxy/SSL issue!\r\n\r\nI followed [this][1] advice to enable git trace logging and identified where git was running from, and its associated gitconfig file.

approach, mechanisms &lt;s&gt;(&amp; probably code)&lt;/s&gt; one should apply to fully implement Model-to-View**s** data update (transfer) on Model-State-Change event with pure PHP?\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n*If I&#39;m not mistaken,* MVC pattern states an implicit requirement for data to be sent from Model layer to **all active** View**s**, specifying that &quot;View is updated on Model change&quot;. (otherwise, it doesn&#39;t make any sense, as users, working with same source would see its data non-runtime and absolutely disconnected from reality)  \r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nBut PHP is a scripting PL, so it&#39;s limited to &quot;connection threads&quot; via processes &amp; it&#39;s lifetime is limited to request-response cycle (as [tereško](https://stackoverflow.com/users/727208/tere%c5%a1ko) kindly noted).  \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nThus, one has to solve couple issues:  \r\n\r\n1. Client must have a *live tunnel* connection to server (Server Sent Events),\r\n2. Server must be able to *push* data to client (`flush()`, `ob_flush()`),\r\n3. Model-State-Change event must be raised &amp; related data packed for transfer,\r\n3. (&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;) Data must be sent to **all** *active* clients (connected to same exact resource/URL) together, not just one currently working with it&#39;s own processes &amp; instance of ModelClass.php file...  \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n**UPDATE 1:** So, it seems that &quot;simultaneous&quot; interaction with multiple users with PHP involves implementation of WEB Server over sockets of some sort, independent of NGINX and others.... Making its core non-blocking I/O, storing connections &amp; &quot;simply&quot; looping over connections, serving data....  \r\nThus, if I&#39;m not mistaken the easiest way is, still, to go and get some ready solution like Ratchet, be it a &#39;concurrency framework&#39; or WEB server on sockets...  \r\nToo much overhead for a couple of messages a day, though...  \r\nAJAX short polling seems to be quite a solution for this dilemma....  \r\n\r\nIs simultaneous updating multiple clients easier with some different backend than PHP, I wonder?.. Look at C# - it&#39;s event-based, not limited to &quot;connection threads&quot; and to query-reply life cycle, if I remember correctly... But it&#39;s still WEB (over same HTTP?)...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960573/update-multiple-mvcs-views-on-model-change-with-php","title":"Update multiple MVC&#39;s Views

I work on Windows and my colleague is on Mac. When he pushes his changes, sometimes files he hasn&#39;t worked on show up in the diff as being changed, because the line endings now show `^M` on each file. This has lead to merge conflicts. I read in the Git docs the following:\r\n\r\n&gt; Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when\r\n&gt; you add a file to the index, and vice versa when it checks out code\r\n&gt; onto your filesystem. You can turn on this functionality with the\r\n&gt; core.autocrlf setting. If you’re on a Windows machine, set it to\r\n&gt; true — this converts LF endings into CRLF when you check out code:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; $ git config --global core.autocrlf true If you’re on a Linux or macOS\r\n&gt; system that uses LF line endings, then you don’t want Git to\r\n&gt; automatically convert them when you check out files; however, if a\r\n&gt; file with CRLF endings accidentally gets introduced, then you may want\r\n&gt; Git to fix it. You can tell Git to convert CRLF to LF on commit but\r\n&gt; not the other way around by setting core.autocrlf to input:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; $ git config --global core.autocrlf input This setup should leave you\r\n&gt; with CRLF endings in Windows checkouts, but LF endings on macOS and\r\n&gt; Linux systems and in the repository.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense, but I am still unclear on how the files are actually committed in the repo. For example, if he creates a file on his system, it will have all `LF` line endings, correct? So when he commits, I presume those line endings are retained as-is. When I pull, my `autocrlf` being `true` will check them out with `CRLF` line endings, as far as I understand. (I get the warnings `warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in &lt;file x&gt;; The file will have its original line endings in your working directory`)\r\n\r\nA couple questions about this: when the warning says &quot;working directory&quot;, what is that referring to? Also, when I then make changes, or create other files, all of which have the `CRLF` line endings and commit+push, are they stored in the repo as `CRLF` or `LF`?\r\n\r\nI imagine the ideal is to have the repo strip anything but `LF` everytime a commit is made; is this what happens? What&#39;s going on under the hood and how can we force this to behave consistently?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960566/how-to-force-consistent-line-endings-in-git-commits-with-cross-platform-compatib","title":"How to force consistent line endings in Git commits with cross-platform compatibility"},{"tags":["spring","spring-boot","spring-transactions"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":209,"user_id":9758079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tvKrW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sven M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9758079/sven-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568663958,"post_id":57961350,"comment_id":102338356,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960563/spring-boot-logging-dont-log-constraintviolationexceptions/57961350#comment102338356_57961350"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":12036413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7aa30a673171403c27826331bffb6653?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bkbb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12036413/bkbb"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568653021,"creation_date":1568653021,"answer_id":57961350,"question_id":57960563,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961350","body_markdown":"Please try to use @ControllerAdvice.\r\n\r\nhttps://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@jovannypcg/understanding-springs-controlleradvice-cd96a364033f","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960563/spring-boot-logging-dont-log-constraintviolationexceptions/57961350#57961350","title":"Spring Boot logging - Don&#39;t log ConstraintViolationExceptions"}],"owner":{"reputation":209,"user_id":9758079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tvKrW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sven M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9758079/sven-m"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568653021,"creation_date":1568649560,"question_id":57960563,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960563","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s my problem.

problem lies in the nesting of your code.\r\n\r\nFirst you add the first `mousedown` event listener which will trigger on when the mouse is clicked and not released.\r\n```\r\nthis.span.addEventListener(&#39;mousedown&#39;, (e) =&gt; { ...\r\n```\r\nThen inside of your `mousedown` event listener you listen for the `mouseup` event on the `document`.\r\n```\r\ndocument.addEventListener(&#39;mouseup&#39;, handleMouseUp = (e) =&gt; { ...\r\n```\r\nSo now, whenever you click both the `mousedown` and the `mouseup` will be triggered. Even when you remove the event listener inside the `mouseup` event listener. The code inside there is already executing.  \r\nThat is what causes your code to fire the `CustomEvent` twice.\r\n\r\nPrevent the nesting of event listeners, except when one would rely on the other. Like in the `mousedown` event listener where you need to add the `mousemove` event listener. Now instead of nesting add another event listener that listens to `mouseup` adjecent to the `mousedown` event listener. Remove the `mousemove` event there. Example below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SlideButton extends HTMLElement {\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super();\r\n\r\n        // Attach a shadow root to the element.\r\n        const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({ mode: &#39;open&#39; });\r\n        shadowRoot.appendChild(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));\r\n        this.span = shadowRoot.querySelector(&#39;span&#39;);\r\n\r\n        this.triggerEvent = new CustomEvent(&quot;trigger&quot;, {\r\n            bubbles: false,\r\n            cancelable: false,\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    connectedCallback() {\r\n\r\n        // It&#39;s preferred to set the event listeners in the connectedCallback method.\r\n        // This method is called whenever the current element is connected to the document.\r\n        this.initMouseEvents();\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    initMouseEvents() {\r\n\r\n        // Bind slider-button as this context to the slide method.\r\n        // In case you use the this keyword inside of the slide method\r\n        // you would need to do this to keep using the methods of this class.\r\n        const slide = this.slide.bind(this);\r\n\r\n        // Create a toggle to indicate that the slide-button has been clicked so that ONLY then the event listeners will be added.\r\n        let targetIsClicked = false;\r\n\r\n        // Mouse is clicked, mousemove added.\r\n        document.addEventListener(&#39;mousedown&#39;, (e) =&gt; {\r\n            \r\n            // Check if this button has been clicked.\r\n            const slideButton = e.target.closest(&#39;slide-button&#39;);\r\n            if (slideButton === this) {\r\n\r\n                // Toggle true and add mousemove event.\r\n                targetIsClicked = true;\r\n                document.addEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, slide, false);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        // Mouse is released, remove mousemove and fire event.\r\n        document.addEventListener(&#39;mouseup&#39;, (e) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n            // Only do something if this button has been clicked in the mousedown event.\r\n            if (targetIsClicked === true) {\r\n                document.removeEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, slide, false);\r\n\r\n                // Reset toggle value.\r\n                targetIsClicked = false;\r\n\r\n                //If slided enough, dispatch event...\r\n                if (Math.abs(this.slideAmount) &gt; (this.maxSlide * 0.75)) {\r\n                    console.log(&#39;firing event&#39;);\r\n                    this.dispatchEvent(this.triggerEvent);\r\n                }\r\n                //Reset button to normal state...\r\n\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEdit\r\n====\r\nI&#39;ve changed the event listener&#39;s target to `document`. You explained that you want the `mousemove` and `mouseup` events to work when triggering them outside the button.\r\n\r\nIn the `mousedown` I check if the current target that has been clicked is in fact **this** button. And if so the `targetIsClicked` value will toggled to indicate that the correct button has been clicked.\r\n\r\nIn the `mouseup` event first check if the `targetIsClicked` is `true`. Meaning you clicked **this** button and execute the rest of your code.\r\n\r\nAlthough, if you&#39;d have multiple `&lt;slide-button&gt;` elements there would be multiple `mousedown`, `mousemove` and `mouseup` listeners attached to the `document`, which could create some weird outcomes.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n----\r\nI&#39;ve moved the `this.initMouseEvents()` function call to the `connectedCallback()` method. It is good practice to do this because now you are interacting with the *lifecycle* of the custom element. Add the event listeners in `connectedCallback()` when the element is created and remove event listeners in `disconnectedCallback()` when the element is removed.

I&#39;m using the `$_POST` method.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960554/how-to-define-text-type-files-in-an-upload-form-in-php","title":"How to define text type files in an upload form in php?"},{"tags":["python","pandas"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7020,"user_id":9609447,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9FDax.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"harvpan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9609447/harvpan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568649880,"creation_date":1568649880,"answer_id":57960638,"question_id":57960552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960638","body_markdown":"You need to use [.assign()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html)\r\n\r\n    C[&#39;final&#39;] = C.assign(num1_aux=C[&#39;num1&#39;]/2)[[&#39;num1_aux&#39;,&#39;num2&#39;]].min(1)\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    \tname\tnum1\tnum2\tfinal\r\n    0\tA\t     99\t     3.5\t3.5\r\n    1\tB\t      3\t    99.0\t1.5\r\n    2\tC\t      5\t    -5.0\t-5.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960552/pandas-select-columns-with-simple-operations/57960638#57960638","title":"Pandas Select Columns with simple operations"}],"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":11831883,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1c54acd52943850fd1b23817334803aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"spYder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11831883/spyder"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3236,"user_id":9302488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/097c89e042db32a2510ab6bd328d3b02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Massifox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9302488/massifox"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57960638,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568650317,"creation_date":1568649518,"last_edit_date":1568650317,"question_id":57960552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960552","body_markdown":"The idea is to select two columns from a DataFrame, but one of the columns needs to be divided by 2.

However if you want to a custom function on a variable, e.g:\r\n\r\n    ggboxplot(iris, x=round(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;), y=&quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, add = &quot;jitter&quot;)\r\n    Error in round(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;) : \r\n      non-numeric argument to mathematical function\r\n\r\nThis makes sense, since the function doesn&#39;t know that the text in quote refers to a variable. \r\n\r\nNote that I have been using the `ggpubr` package for prettier plots, but I think the problem is essentially further down in `ggplot2`\r\n\r\n    ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=floor(Sepal.Length), y=Sepal.Width)) + geom_boxplot()\r\n    Warning message:\r\n    Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nOne way to bypass this is to override the aes mapping, however this results in a slightly weird x-axis\r\n\r\n    ggplot(data = iris, aes(y=Sepal.Width, x=Sepal.Length)) + geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group=floor(Sepal.Length)))\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nI am thinking there has to be a simpler way to get this done, any advice? I would ideally like to keep using `ggboxplot()` from `ggpubr` package, but if it can&#39;t be done there I can consider using the `ggplot2` alone.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSjnRl.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/unWMyl.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqRVwl.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960531/using-a-function-on-a-variable-column-when-plotting-with-ggplot2-ggpubr","title":"Using a function on a variable (column) when plotting with ggplot2/ggpubr"},{"tags":["sharedpreferences","mapbox"],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":11587276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2485893491457988/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mateusz Pośpiech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11587276/mateusz-po%c5%9bpiech"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568649388,"creation_date":1568649388,"question_id":57960527,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960527","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on the app focused on presenting a map with feature restaurants around the city. Among many others, user has an option of marking certain places as &#39;visited&#39; (via checkbox), which triggers the marker to be changed to 0.5 opacity. Here&#39;s the code related to this action.\r\n\r\noncheckedchange action:\r\n```\r\npublic void onCheckboxClick(int position) {\r\n    // Get the visited individual location via its card&#39;s position in the recyclerview of cards\r\n    IndividualLocation selectedLocation = listOfIndividualLocations.get(position);\r\n\r\n    // Evaluate each Feature&#39;s &quot;visited state&quot; to appropriately style the location&#39;s icon\r\n    List&lt;Feature&gt; featureList = featureCollection.features();\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; featureList.size(); i++) {\r\n      if (featureList.get(i).getStringProperty(&quot;name&quot;).equals(selectedLocation.getName())) {\r\n\r\n        if (featureVisitedStatus(i)) {\r\n          setFeatureVisitedState(featureList.get(i), false);\r\n        } else {\r\n          setVisited(i);\r\n```\r\nsetting up a map layer and markers behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void initStoreLocationIconSymbolLayer() {\r\n    mapboxMap.getStyle(new Style.OnStyleLoaded() {\r\n\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void onStyleLoaded(@NonNull Style style) {\r\n        style.addImage(&quot;store-location-icon-id&quot;, customThemeManager.getUnselectedMarkerIcon());\r\n        style.addImage(&quot;selected-store-location-icon-id&quot;, customThemeManager.getSelectedMarkerIcon());\r\n\r\n        // Create and add the GeoJsonSource to the map\r\n        GeoJsonSource storeLocationGeoJsonSource = new GeoJsonSource(&quot;store-location-source-id&quot;);\r\n        style.addSource(storeLocationGeoJsonSource);\r\n\r\n        // Create and add the store location icon SymbolLayer to the map\r\n        for (Feature singleFeature : featureCollection.features()) {\r\n          String category = singleFeature.getStringProperty(&quot;category&quot;);\r\n          String layerID = &quot;layer-id-&quot; + category;\r\n          if (mapboxMap.getStyle().getLayer(layerID) == null) {\r\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;initStoreLocationIconSymbolLayer:layerID=&quot; + layerID);\r\n\r\n            // Create and add the store location icon SymbolLayer to the map\r\n\r\n            SymbolLayer storeLocationSymbolLayer = new SymbolLayer(layerID,&quot;store-location-source-id&quot;);\r\n            storeLocationSymbolLayer.withProperties(\r\n                    iconImage(match(Expression.toString(get(PROPERTY_SELECTED)), literal(&quot;store-location-icon-id&quot;),\r\n                            stop(&quot;true&quot;, &quot;selected-store-location-icon-id&quot;))),\r\n                    iconAllowOverlap(false),\r\n                    iconIgnorePlacement(true),\r\n                    iconOffset(new Float[]{0f, -9f}),\r\n                    iconSize(match(Expression.toString(get(PROPERTY_SELECTED)), literal(1.0f),\r\n                            stop(&quot;true&quot;, 1.3f))),\r\n                    iconOpacity(match(Expression.toString(get(PROPERTY_VISITED)), literal(1),\r\n                            stop(&quot;true&quot;, 0.5)))\r\n            );\r\n            storeLocationSymbolLayer.setFilter(eq(get(&quot;category&quot;), literal(category)));\r\n            style.addLayer(storeLocationSymbolLayer);\r\n```\r\n\r\nmethods related to changing the state of PROPERTY_VISITED to &quot;true&quot;\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate boolean featureVisitedStatus(int index){\r\n    if (featureCollection == null) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    return featureCollection.features().get(index).getBooleanProperty(PROPERTY_VISITED);\r\n  }\r\n \r\nprivate void setSelected(int index) {\r\n    Feature feature = featureCollection.features().get(index);\r\n    setFeatureSelectState(feature, true);\r\n    refreshSource();\r\n  }\r\n\r\nprivate void setFeatureVisitedState(Feature feature, boolean visitedState){\r\n    feature.properties().addProperty(PROPERTY_VISITED, visitedState);\r\n    refreshSource();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, here&#39;s one final obstacle I can&#39;t figure out - after the app is closed, marker changes caused by &#39;visited&#39; state should remain permanent and visible after the app is opened again. At the moment I&#39;m already successfully saving the checkbox state in SharedPreferences, but everything else doesn&#39;t go with - markers stay 1.0 opaque as if they were never checked. What should I put to memory to achieve this goal?

At best, it&#39;s a convenience feature. As the [design meeting notes]((https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2018/LDM-2018-05-21.md)) say:\r\n\r\n&gt; This is a convenience. However, it risks a syntactic conflict with other potential futures, especially &quot;non-local returns&quot; (allowing a lambda to return from its enclosing method) and &quot;block expressions&quot; (allowing statements inside expressions). While we can imagine syntaxes for those that do not conflict, we don&#39;t want to limit the design space for them at this point, at least not for a feature that is merely &quot;nice to have&quot;.\r\n\r\n&gt; Also, while we&#39;ve been talking about this in analogy with throw expressions, that isn&#39;t quite right. throw is a dynamic effect, whereas return, break and continue are statically bound control transfers with a specific target.\r\n\r\nAs the discussion shows, it&#39;s hard to come up with a *compelling* example while there are many alternatives already. \r\n\r\nIn any case return expressions aren&#39;t similar to throw expressions. An exception is neither a control flow nor a return mechanism. It&#39;s a blown fuse that needs handling, otherwise the application can&#39;t continue. \r\n\r\nThrow expressions aren&#39;t just convenience, they allow throwing exceptions in places where only an expression is valid. That&#39;s why they are used in functional languages like F#&#39;s [raise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/exception-handling/the-raise-function) and [failwith](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/exception-handling/the-failwith-function) functions. \r\nWithout them pattern matching constructs like C#&#39;s [switch expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8#switch-expressions) or F#&#39;s [match expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/match-expressions) would be impossible to write and analyze at compile time.\r\n\r\nWithout throw expressions this: \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static RGBColor FromRainbow(Rainbow colorBand) =&gt;\r\n    colorBand switch\r\n    {\r\n        Rainbow.Red    =&gt; new RGBColor(0xFF, 0x00, 0x00),\r\n        Rainbow.Orange =&gt; new RGBColor(0xFF, 0x7F, 0x00),\r\n        _              =&gt; throw new ArgumentException(message: &quot;invalid enum value&quot;, paramName: nameof(colorBand)),\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould have to be rewritten to include a dummy return statement , making analysis of the code during compilation needlessly hard. The compiler would have to recognize this patter, ignore the return statement and use the throw statement to verify whether the code is valid or not :\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static RGBColor FromRainbow(Rainbow colorBand) =&gt;\r\n    colorBand switch\r\n    {\r\n        Rainbow.Red    =&gt; new RGBColor(0xFF, 0x00, 0x00),\r\n        Rainbow.Orange =&gt; new RGBColor(0xFF, 0x7F, 0x00),\r\n        _              =&gt; { \r\n                              throw new ArgumentException(message: &quot;invalid enum value&quot;, paramName: nameof(colorBand));\r\n                              return default;\r\n                          }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat `return default` would also play havoc with C# 8&#39;s nullable reference types and nullability analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nC# 8 took advantage of C# 7&#39;s throw expressions to offer switch expressions. C# 9 will take advantage of both to offer discriminated unions and (hopefully) exhaustive pattern matching.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960519/the-null-coalescing-operator-with-return-statement/57969544#57969544","title":"the null-coalescing operator with return statement"}],"owner":{"reputation":455,"user_id":1539100,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fd1a7d5e9b7b16c0f70cfdd049f7233?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sorosh_sabz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1539100/sorosh-sabz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16663,"user_id":2756409,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UIrGI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TylerH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2756409/tylerh"},"comment_count":15,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568710333,"creation_date":1568649365,"last_edit_date":1568660488,"question_id":57960519,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960519","body_markdown":"As you can see in [C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw#the-throw-expression), we can write null coalescing operator combine with throw expression something like below\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic string Name\r\n{\r\n    get =&gt; name;\r\n    set =&gt; name = value ?? \r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(paramName: nameof(value), message: &quot;Name cannot be null&quot;);\r\n}   \r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in many cases I need return statement if left value is null, for example something like below\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic double CalculateSomthing(ClassType someInstance)\r\n{\r\n    var someValue = someInstance?.Value ?? return double.NaN;\r\n\r\n    // Call some method\r\n    AnyMethod(someValue);\r\n\r\n    // Some Computation\r\n    return someValue + 17;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I know I could not write code something like above, my question is why? why C# language designer permit to write throw expression with null coalescing operator but don&#39;t permit use return statement with coalescing operator?\r\n\r\nIs any intrinsic difference between them?\r\n\r\n**Is there any near solution like above example in exist version of C#**? or I have to write some boiler plate code, something like below\r\n\r\n    public double CalculateSomthing(ClassType someInstance)\r\n    {\r\n    \r\n        var someValue = someInstance?.Value;\r\n        if (someValue == null) return double.NaN;  // Boiler plate\r\n    \r\n        // Call some method\r\n        AnyMethod(someValue);\r\n    \r\n        // Some Computation\r\n        return someValue + 17;\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960519/the-null-coalescing-operator-with-return-statement","title":"the null-coalescing operator with return statement"},{"tags":["python","apache-spark","pyspark","pyspark-sql","orc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16159,"user_id":7579547,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e064cb6036830f4883abb0450f6afd7e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shaido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7579547/shaido"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568698080,"post_id":57960517,"comment_id":102345925,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960517/pyspark-merge-multiple-orc-schemas#comment102345925_57960517"},{"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":9828765,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93ceeb3c6f7b100c1a17b43cf708161d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.

Which means that if any one of your items gets an aditional property (own or inherited), it will break the table layout. \r\n\r\nA safer way is to use helper spreading method, to enforce the structure of the output object:\r\n\r\n    methods: {\r\n      spreadItem(item) {\r\n        const { id, make, year } = item;\r\n        return { id, make, year };\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand, in template:\r\n\r\n    &lt;template slot=&quot;items&quot; slot-scope=&quot;props&quot;&gt;\r\n       &lt;td v-for=&quot;(prop, key) of spreadItem(props.item)&quot; \r\n           :key=&quot;key&quot;\r\n           :v-text=&quot;prop&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/template&gt;\r\n\r\nUpdated [pen](https://codepen.io/andrei-gheorghiu/pen/PoYdPYa). This will not add extra cells when a few items have additional props (unless you add them to the `spreadItem` method and the `headers`, of course, in which case they&#39;ll show up as an additional column).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960505/vuetify-dynamically-load-data-table-rows/57962320#57962320","title":"Vuetify dynamically load data table rows"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6707,"user_id":3519009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RM3eJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Narendra Jadhav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3519009/narendra-jadhav"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6707,"user_id":3519009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RM3eJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Narendra Jadhav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3519009/narendra-jadhav"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568658497,"last_edit_date":1568658497,"creation_date":1568658083,"answer_id":57962431,"question_id":57960505,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57962431","body_markdown":"You could use [`Object.keys()`][1] in `v-for` like below\r\n\r\n    &lt;td v-for=&quot;(key,index) in Object.keys(props.item)&quot;

You can suppress the immediate removal of such files using `git rm --cached`, but in the future, anyone who goes back to any existing commit that *contains* the files will have the files put into their index/staging-area and their work-tree, and then moving from that commit back to a current commit (that *doesn&#39;t* have the files) means Git will remove the files.\r\n\r\nThat is, any time you `git checkout` a commit that *has* the files, they go into both your index/staging-area (these are two names for one thing) and your work-tree (this is where you can see and work with your files).  Any time you move from having checked out this kind of commit, that *has* the files, to any commit that *doesn&#39;t* have the files, Git will remove the files from the index and from your work-tree.  So the presence of these files in any *historical* commit effectively &quot;poisons&quot; the repository.\r\n\r\nThe *only complete solution* to this problem is never to have committed the files in the first place.  This requires that you go back in time and stop yourself from committing the files.  An approximation to this solution is to rewrite the commit history so that no remaining commits have the files: eliminate all the commits that *did* have the files, perhaps inserting new-and-improved replacement commits that *don&#39;t* have the files.  See some of the many answers to https://stackoverflow.com/q/1274057/1256452\r\n\r\nThe drawback to this solution is that you cannot have sample prototype files in your commits.  The solution to this drawback is to put sample prototype files in your commits **but under some other file names**:\r\n\r\n&gt; I have a bunch of files that should not be under version control. However, if I don&#39;t bring them under version control then my build fails. As those files contain key/value content, I added those files in but replaced the actual values with a fake value.\r\n\r\nHave your build process use the alternate (sample-file) files *instead of* the real files, for test builds.\r\n\r\nUsers of the software will use the real files, which will not be under version control.  Users of the test builds will use the test files, which *will* be under version control.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960498/gitignore-doesnt-ignore-my-files-after-i-changed-them/57964355#57964355","title":".gitignore doesn&#39;t ignore my files after I changed them"}],"owner":{"reputation":23653,"user_id":513413,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0b73975f75df2f25f8b7cc8ce834f0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hesam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/513413/hesam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32047,"user_id":7976758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512cfbaf98d63ca4acd57b2df792aec6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"phd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7976758/phd"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57964355,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568667615,"creation_date":1568649300,"last_edit_date":1568650902,"question_id":57960498,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960498","body_markdown":"I have a bunch of files that should not be under version control.

I tried several possibilities, but they all worked only partly. I couldn&#39;t convert the `dict` to a `pd.DataFrame` because the entries of the dict have different lengths. Otherwise, the method of choice would be `pd.DataFrame.to_csv`/ `pd.read_csv` and `pd.DataFrame.to_json`/ `pd.DataFrame.read_json`, resp.\r\n\r\nReading a file means reading a saved state of a previous program run (data would become a `pd.DataFrame`). The random values are going to be replaced by computation during the program run (or with values from an earlier saved config file), so there&#39;s no worry about the `np.random.rand` parts.\r\n\r\nThe lines commented out are different possibilities I found on different sites (including [the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html), which [wasn&#39;t as helpful](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) as expected).\r\n\r\n# Write file\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import csv\r\n    import os\r\n    import json\r\n\r\n    content = {\r\n        &#39;rootpath&#39; : os.path.abspath ( os.getcwd () ),\r\n        &#39;indir&#39; : &#39;.&#39;,\r\n        &#39;outdir&#39; : &#39;output&#39;,\r\n        &#39;workdir&#39; : &#39;temporary&#39;,\r\n        &#39;datafile&#39; : &#39;file.csv&#39;,\r\n        &#39;configfile&#39; : &#39;configs.txt&#39;,\r\n        &#39;savefile&#39; : &#39;contents.csv&#39;,\r\n        &#39;model&#39; : np.arange (4),\r\n        &#39;datafiles&#39; : [os.path.join (os.getcwd (), &#39;data.csv&#39;), os.path.join (os.getcwd (), &#39;data.dat&#39;)],\r\n        &#39;data&#39; : pd.DataFrame ( np.arange (15).reshape (3, 5) ),\r\n        &#39;dataid&#39; : &#39;g_g;r_g;r_r;&#39;,\r\n        &#39;result&#39; : None,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    hmm = {\r\n        &#39;hmm_a&#39; : np.random.rand (9).reshape (3, 3), # test input of a two-dimensional (np.nd)array because one isn&#39;t enough and they will appear (during/after computation)\r\n        &#39;hmm_b&#39; : np.zeros (3),\r\n        &#39;hmm_mu&#39; : np.random.rand (1),\r\n        &#39;hmm_pi&#39; : np.random.rand (3),\r\n        &#39;hmm_block&#39; : np.random.rand (27).reshape (3, 3, 3), # test input of a three-dimensional (np.nd)array because of their appearance\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n    computation, changing pathname and filename, rest of the program\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n\r\n    write_in = content.copy ()\r\n    write_in.update (hmm)\r\n    path = os.path.join ( write_in [&#39;rootpath&#39;], write_in [&#39;outdir&#39;], write_in [&#39;savefile&#39;] )\r\n    p, filetype = os.path.splitext (path)\r\n\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n    if write_in == write_in [&#39;data&#39;] : # write_in only contains data\r\n        onlydata = True\r\n    else :\r\n        onlydata = False\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n\r\n    for c in write_in :\r\n        if type ( write_in [c] ) == np.ndarray :\r\n            write_in [c] = write_in [c].tolist ()\r\n        elif type ( write_in [c] ) == pd.DataFrame :\r\n            #write_in [c] = pd.DataFrame.to_numpy ( write_in [c], copy = True ).tolist () # needs pandas +0.24.0\r\n            write_in [c] = write_in [c].values.tolist ()\r\n\r\n    # saving as *.csv Comma Separated Values\r\n    if &#39;csv&#39; in filetype or &#39;CSV&#39; in filetype :         # If chosen, take care when loading this file.

go into more detail of PaulF&#39;s comments:\r\n\r\n    var usersInfo = new UsersInfo_tbl()\r\n    {\r\n        FKUserID = userID,\r\n        FirstName = firstName,\r\n        LastName = lastName\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThis sets the `FKUserID`, but you haven&#39;t set the `ID` for this table, so you are trying to insert a `null` value, which is what the error is telling you: `The duplicate key value is (&lt;NULL&gt;).` The key to note here is that it&#39;s the `UsersInfo_tbl` table, not the `Users_tbl` table. Since you haven&#39;t included the schema for the `UsersInfo_tbl` table, we don&#39;t know what the primary is for that, or if it allows null. If it does (which it seems like it does), it shouldn&#39;t. Try looking at the data of both tables to see exactly what&#39;s going on.\r\n\r\nThis also says that there&#39;s already a `null` value in your table, which most likely needs to be updated with a real value.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I find adding &quot;tbl&quot; to a table name to be fairly atrocious. Aside from the look &amp; feel of it being bad, it can lead to problems later. Other people find it to be bad practice as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/154251/is-adding-the-tbl-prefix-to-table-names-really-a-problem\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960479/how-to-fix-violation-of-unique-key-constraint/57960837#57960837","title":"How to fix &quot;Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint&quot;"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1267,"user_id":1836461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHYf4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"computercarguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836461/computercarguy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568652249,"post_id":57961094,"comment_id":102333881,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960479/how-to-fix-violation-of-unique-key-constraint/57961094#comment102333881_57961094"},{"owner":{"reputation":5776,"user_id":3070060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a936bdd7a67a345d312281305d5adde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PaulF","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3070060/paulf"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1267,"user_id":1836461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHYf4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"computercarguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836461/computercarguy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568652741,"post_id":57961094,"comment_id":102334073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960479/how-to-fix-violation-of-unique-key-constraint/57961094#comment102334073_57961094"},{"owner":{"reputation":1267,"user_id":1836461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHYf4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"computercarguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836461/computercarguy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568652922,"post_id":57961094,"comment_id":102334151,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960479/how-to-fix-violation-of-unique-key-constraint/57961094#comment102334151_57961094"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5776,"user_id":3070060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a936bdd7a67a345d312281305d5adde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PaulF","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3070060/paulf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5776,"user_id":3070060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a936bdd7a67a345d312281305d5adde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PaulF","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3070060/paulf"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568652274,"last_edit_date":1568652274,"creation_date":1568651827,"answer_id":57961094,"question_id":57960479,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961094","body_markdown":"The error message states *&quot;Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint &#39;UQ__Users_tb__2B5B96C51C3AA70E&#39;.

I guess you&#180;ll need some sort of adapter application (be it in the form of kafka connect or not).\r\nMy idea is to write a small spring boot application which implements a websocket client, see this link to get an idea of how (scroll a bit down):\r\n https://www.sitepoint.com/implementing-spring-websocket-server-and-client/\r\n\r\nThen after that, you can push the messages received via websocket to apache kafka using spring kafka, which works fine in my experience: https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka\r\n\r\nFor Serialization from SpringBoot App to Kafka you *can* user JSON, however I recommmend the full bells and whistles with AVRO and a schema registry: https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/index.html\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this idea is the fact that you get another application you need to implement, maintain, deploy and scale.\r\n\r\nHope that

in API Gateway that makes this not work the way it needs to, you can add tags to an S3 object as you upload it, by injecting the right header into the request.\r\n\r\nS3&#39;s [PUT Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html) REST method supports a request header, `X-Amz-Tagging`, which allows you to specify one or more tag keys and values, and you should be able to inject this in the integration request -- though I&#39;m not certain whether API Gateway provides enough functionality to let you do string concatenation and apply the url-encoding this header expects.  You potentially won&#39;t need to use URL-encoding unless there are characters in the API keys that require it, and there may not be any such characters.\r\n\r\nI also discussed this in the answer to [Difference between object tags and object metadata?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42146207/1695906), which makes another important point -- tags may be appropriate for this, but metadata is not.  Object metadata is provided to the client every time an object is downloaded, which would potentially reveal those API keys to untrusted parties downloading the object.  Tags are not included with a download -- there&#39;s a separate subresource used for fetching those.  Your Lambda event handler will need to make the call to S3 to fetch the tags, if they&#39;re needed in the event handler, or if you just need it archived &quot;in case&quot; then the presence in the tags may be sufficient.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960468/get-aws-request-api-key-in-s3-bucket-trigger/57999623#57999623","title":"Get AWS request API key in S3 bucket trigger?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":2249322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f9ac86fec8cb9e504a2068989cada8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Halverson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2249322/peter-halverson"},"last_editor":{"reputation":186,"user_id":2249322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f9ac86fec8cb9e504a2068989cada8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Halverson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2249322/peter-halverson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569100866,"last_edit_date":1569100866,"creation_date":1568992770,"answer_id":58031152,"question_id":57960468,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58031152","body_markdown":"Following up on Michael&#39;s answer, APIGW does indeed support constructed header mappings, although it&#39;s a bit tricky. Turns out you can use a mapping template to set headers and params, not just transform the body. The full explanation is covered in [Use a Mapping Template to Override an API&#39;s Request and Response Parameters and Status Codes][1], but, briefly, I created an `application/json` integration request mapping template with the following content:\r\n\r\n    #set($tags=&quot;submitter_api_key_id=$util.urlEncode($context.identity.apiKeyId)&quot;)\r\n    #set($context.requestOverride.header.x-amz-tagging = $tags)\r\n    $input.json(&quot;$&quot;)\r\n\r\nNote setting the `x-amz-tagging` header is done as a side-effect of the body transform, which is just a pass-through (`$input.json(&quot;$&quot;)` injects the entire body as JSON).\r\n\r\nThe only other change was to grant tagging permissions to the API execution role, ala\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,\r\n        &quot;Statement&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Action&quot;: [\r\n                    &quot;s3:PutObjectTagging&quot;\r\n                ],\r\n                &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:s3:::&lt;origin-bucket&gt;/*&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat was it. My POSTed S3 objects are now created with a tag named `submitter_api_key_id`, which contains the ID of the API key associated with the request. I can then use that key to map to the identity of the actual submitter and enforce our business policies.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-override-request-response-parameters.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960468/get-aws-request-api-key-in-s3-bucket-trigger/58031152#58031152","title":"Get AWS request API key in S3 bucket trigger?"}],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":2249322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f9ac86fec8cb9e504a2068989cada8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Halverson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2249322/peter-halverson"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57999623,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569100866,"creation_date":1568649188,"question_id":57960468,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57960468","body_markdown":"As part of an asynchronous content handling system, we&#39;ve defined an API Gateway method bound to the S3 integration service that forwards POST requests to an S3 bucket. We then use an S3 event trigger to an `ObjectCreated` event to an SQS queue, which is eventually consumed by a Lambda function for subsequent processing.\r\n\r\nWe have a new processing requirement that requires us to identify the API Key ID used to authenticate the original APIGW request in the SQS handler lambda, but we&#39;ve not come up with an approach. We looked for a way to pass the `Authorization` header of the client request as part of the event content received by the processing lambda, without success – I suspect the incoming request to S3 to create the object may well be completely distinct from the context of the S3 trigger (which fires regardless of where the new object came from). We&#39;ve also looked for some way to map an `Authorization` header (or mapped query parameter) to S3 metadata, again, no joy. The AWS S3 integration service is a black box with black ports, not well documented, so I can&#39;t tell if there&#39;s a way to do this\r\n\r\nWorst case we can probably use the `RequestId` to correlate the `ObjectCreated` event with some kind of log entry, but that&#39;s more fragile than I&#39;d prefer; I&#39;d much rather do it as part of proxy integration configuration if possible.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960468/get-aws-request-api-key-in-s3-bucket-trigger","title":"Get AWS request API key in S3 bucket trigger?"},{"tags":["api","braintree","web-development-server","braintree-sandbox","braintree-data"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":557,"user_id":5510975,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/548bb6098727a48b21f47968ef92f69d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user5510975","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5510975/user5510975"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568701171,"creation_date":1568701171,"answer_id":57968394,"question_id":57960466,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57968394","body_markdown":"We contact the support team.
