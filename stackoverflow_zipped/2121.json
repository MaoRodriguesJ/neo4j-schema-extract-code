In this case, would the following be the &quot;right way&quot; to approach the problem?\r\n\r\n    std::cin.getline(smart_text.get(), 256);\r\n\r\nIn which case we&#39;re simply passing in the memory address of the pointer underneath the abstraction?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036590/using-getline-to-read-text-by-passing-in-smart-pointer-argument","title":"Using getline to read text by passing in smart pointer argument"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":74786,"user_id":364696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7eBCp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShadowRanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364696/shadowranger"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569029097,"post_id":58036588,"comment_id":102474822,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036588/how-do-you-simplify-these-loops#comment102474822_58036588"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12059859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f2fb08502edd4cbcbd853c0dae9939f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"peyo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12059859/peyo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":74786,"user_id":364696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7eBCp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShadowRanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364696/shadowranger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569085583,"post_id":58036588,"comment_id":102485127,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036588/how-do-you-simplify-these-loops#comment102485127_58036588"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":74786,"user_id":364696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7eBCp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShadowRanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364696/shadowranger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569029310,"creation_date":1569029310,"answer_id":58036604,"question_id":58036588,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036604","body_markdown":"Test both conditions at once to reduce it to one loop:\r\n\r\n    def funny_phrases(lst):\r\n        funny = []\r\n        for word in lst:\r\n            if len(word) &gt;= 6 and word.endswith(&#39;y&#39;):\r\n                funny.append(word)\r\n        return funny\r\n\r\nwhich can then be translated to a list comprehension, leaving:\r\n\r\n    def funny_phrases(lst):\r\n        return [word for word in lst if len(word) &gt;= 6 and word.endswith(&#39;y&#39;)]\r\n\r\nNote that I made two small changes beyond the loop improvements:\r\n\r\n1.

The end result I&#39;m looking for is that a boilerplate letter is pulled from a database, the sections that need specific input are extracted, a form is generated from those sections, the form then returns user data, and the letter is rebuilt with the user data integrated into the text of the letter. \r\n\r\nfor example, the string pulled from the database would look like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nClaim #: |string^clmNum^Claim Number: | - Ref#: |string^RefNum^Reference Number: |\r\n```\r\nand would end up like the following after it was rebuilt with user data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClaim #: 123456 - Ref#: 789012\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what I have working so far...\r\n\r\nThe sections between the | are pulled out, split, and loaded into an IEnumerable&lt;Foo&gt; \r\n\r\nMy foo model is:\r\n```\r\npublic class Foo\r\n{\r\n   public string InputType {get; set;}\r\n   public string InputName {get; set;}\r\n   public string InputLabel {get; set;}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI pass the IEnumerable to the view with a ViewModel\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class FormBuildViewModel\r\n{\r\n\r\n   public IEnumerable&lt;Foo&gt; FooProperty {get; set;}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then display the input items dynamically with the following Razor markup on my view.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;form&gt;\r\n@{ var e = Model.FooProperty.ToList();\r\n\r\n\r\n    foreach (var subItem in e)\r\n    {\r\n       &lt;div class=&quot;FormGroup-items&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;label&gt;@subItem.InputLabel&lt;/label&gt;\r\n         &lt;input name=&quot;@subItem.ObjName&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;\r\n       &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n&lt;..// form button stuff //..&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n```\r\nWhich creates the following HTML:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;form&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;FormGroup-items&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;Claim Number: &lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;input name=&quot;clmNum&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;FormGroup-items&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;Reference Number: &lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;input name=&quot;RefNum&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;..// button stuff //..&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n```\r\nI have everything working up to this point.  I need to take the data entered on the dynamically created form and get it back to the controller in a manner that I can index to rebuild the string. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using the @html.beginform similar to this\r\n\r\n```\r\n@using (Html.BeginForm())\r\n{\r\n    @for(int i=0; i&lt;Model.Count; i++)\r\n    {\r\n       @Html.CheckBoxFor(m =&gt; m[i].IsActive, new { @value = Model[i].Id })\r\n       @Html.DisplayFor(m =&gt; m[i].Name)\r\n    }\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Save&quot; /&gt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut to use @Html.BeginForm you need to know the names of the items before runtime, and it doesn&#39;t seem to work with a dynamically created form like this. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of is I need to load the form data into a List&lt; T &gt; and return that to the controller, but I can&#39;t think of a way to get C# to allow me to initialize a List&lt; T &gt; and load the values in the view. I know I&#39;ve got to be missing something, but I&#39;m kinda lost at this point. Any help would be appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036561/passing-an-ienumerable-to-a-view-to-generate-a-form-and-then-passing-form-data-b","title":"Passing an IEnumerable to a view to generate a form and then passing form data back to controller"},{"tags":["android","android-layout","android-drawable"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1891,"user_id":2828100,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/538592314/picture?type=large","display_name":"funct7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2828100/funct7"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1325,"user_id":6071729,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b527eb29f81fbbb44f6cb4a4a9000c54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mr.AF","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6071729/mr-af"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569028634,"post_id":58036560,"comment_id":102474767,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036560/android-1dp-stroke-drawable-cannot-be-drawn-in-a-1dp-height-view#comment102474767_58036560"},{"owner":{"reputation":1891,"user_id":2828100,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/538592314/picture?type=large","display_name":"funct7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2828100/funct7"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1325,"user_id":6071729,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b527eb29f81fbbb44f6cb4a4a9000c54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mr.AF","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6071729/mr-af"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569029075,"post_id":58036560,"comment_id":102474820,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036560/android-1dp-stroke-drawable-cannot-be-drawn-in-a-1dp-height-view#comment102474820_58036560"}],"owner":{"reputation":1891,"user_id":2828100,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/538592314/picture?type=large","display_name":"funct7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2828100/funct7"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569028371,"creation_date":1569028371,"question_id":58036560,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036560","body_markdown":"I have a regular XML stroke drawable like so:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;shape xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n    android:shape=&quot;line&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;stroke\r\n        android:width=&quot;1dp&quot;\r\n        android:color=&quot;#B2B2B2&quot;\r\n        android:dashWidth=&quot;4dp&quot;\r\n        android:dashGap=&quot;8dp&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/shape&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a view (or an image view) that uses the drawable as its background.\r\nWhen I set the height of that view to `1.5dp` or bigger, the line will render but `1dp` will not render the line.\r\n\r\nA `2dp` height view will draw the line at the center, making it position in the middle of other view layouts.\r\n\r\nI tried making the height `3dp` and use bottom paddings, but it won&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nWhat is going on and is there any solution for this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036560/android-1dp-stroke-drawable-cannot-be-drawn-in-a-1dp-height-view","title":"Android 1dp stroke drawable cannot be drawn in a 1dp height view"},{"tags":["vue.js","materialize","v-model"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":5034981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7eab9f5bbb63bab713236349954b97f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Madcap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5034981/madcap"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569169826,"creation_date":1569169826,"answer_id":58051231,"question_id":58036552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58051231","body_markdown":"I found a hack with jQuery but I didn&#39;t want to use jQuery in my code just for one task.

You are getting different plans based on the values being sniffed during compilation.  The various actions you are doing are causing (re-)compilations and you are getting the same plan sometimes and a different plan other times.  When you are getting a selective value sniffed, it is picking the seek plan.  When you get a non-selective value sniffed, it picks the scan plan.  So, downgrading the SLO will force a failover and thus flush the plan cache --&gt; new compilation, new opportunity to sniff a value during compilation.  When you free the procedure cache --&gt; new compilation.  When you drop or add an index, it forces a recompile for plans touching that table on next use.  \r\n\r\nYou can read more about this behavior here:\r\n[Blog post explaining parameter sniffing][1]\r\n\r\nYou can also use the query store to see the history for query plans (it is on-by-default in SQL Azure).  [Here][2] is a link explaining how you can use the query store.  Note that with the query store you can easily force a specific query plan if you want only one plan to run through the SSMS UI.\r\n\r\nThe parameter sniffing space is one where we have desire to do some more work in the future to make this behavior more transparent/less surprising for customers but have not yet been able to do so.  So, sorry this has been frustrating for you and I hope the workaround I&#39;ve posted will get you unblocked.  Rest assured we are very aware of the problem space and hope to do more here to make SQL better for workloads like this in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/queryoptteam/2006/03/31/i-smell-a-parameter/\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store?view=sql-server-2017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036533/sql-azure-stopped-using-index/58049091#58049091","title":"Sql Azure stopped using index"}],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":964065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24bdb9fa02a4df6f0cc96f7fe756e659?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ben","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/964065/ben"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58049091,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569154371,"creation_date":1569027966,"question_id":58036533,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036533","body_markdown":"Weirdest few hours using SQL Azure.

So, these are the things I tried (in order):\r\n\r\n- Reorganized index - nothing.  \r\n- Rebuilt index - nothing.  \r\n- Dropped and recreated - nothing.  \r\n- Cleared proc cache (using `ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE`) - nothing.  - - - Dropped and recreated with a different name - **worked**.\r\n \r\nI didn&#39;t take a screenshot of the execution plan when it was failing, but it was basically exactly the same as the execution plan below (of the final working index), except it did not include the usage of the index (circled) - ie. it was just doing the clustered index scan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Execution plan][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe final working query was:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX_SyncDetail_SyncStatusID_EntityTypeID_ApiConnectionID] ON [client_2].[SyncDetail]\r\n(\r\n\t[SyncStatusID] ASC,\r\n\t[EntityTypeID] ASC,\r\n\t[ApiConnectionID] ASC\r\n)WITH (STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, DROP_EXISTING = OFF, ONLINE = OFF) ON [PRIMARY]\r\nGO\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is _exactly_ the same as the original index (which was being ignored), except that a) the name is different; and b) the order of the columns used to be EntityTypeID, SyncStatusID, ApiConnectionID.\r\n\r\nI want to stress again that the index was working fine before our database downgrade.\r\n\r\nSo - any ideas what happened?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DXxYb.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036533/sql-azure-stopped-using-index","title":"Sql Azure stopped using index"},{"tags":["spring","mongodb","spring-boot","spring-mvc"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":4153576,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dddd7e5b3eb20fbfccf5ad7e885e2ddb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4153576/kumar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569034320,"creation_date":1569034320,"answer_id":58036897,"question_id":58036531,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036897","body_markdown":"By default, all the properties of document will be fetched. if you want to ignore some of the properties in the result, you can use filter option. \r\n\r\n            @Query(value = &quot;{&#39;title&#39; : ?0}&quot;, fields = &quot;{&#39;description&#39; : 0}&quot;)\r\n            BooksModel findBooksModelByTitle(String title);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036531/spring-boot-mongodb-get-only-certain-fields-from-database-into-model/58036897#58036897","title":"Spring Boot MongoDB get only certain fields from database into model"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9627427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Albin Vinoy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9627427/albin-vinoy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569034320,"creation_date":1569027929,"question_id":58036531,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036531","body_markdown":"I am trying to understand how to work with MongoDB and Spring Boot.

I&#39;m pretty new to C++ member function pointers and I&#39;ve read that casting them can be dangerous so that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036522/template-member-function-pointer-to-non-template-member-function-pointer","title":"Template member function pointer to non-template member function pointer"},{"tags":["macos","debugging","logging"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":3374794,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81bfe4f2334b22c489ce1dedab3de39a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"defense2000x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3374794/defense2000x"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569655703,"post_id":58036519,"comment_id":102673966,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036519/are-there-other-frameworks-in-macos-that-have-useful-env-vars-like-cgbitmap-cont#comment102673966_58036519"},{"owner":{"reputation":21458,"user_id":1118321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a56b8390b7457739ed8cc7cbd52bf251?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1118321","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1118321/user1118321"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":104,"user_id":3374794,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81bfe4f2334b22c489ce1dedab3de39a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"defense2000x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3374794/defense2000x"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569683838,"post_id":58036519,"comment_id":102679639,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036519/are-there-other-frameworks-in-macos-that-have-useful-env-vars-like-cgbitmap-cont#comment102679639_58036519"},{"owner":{"reputation":21458,"user_id":1118321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a56b8390b7457739ed8cc7cbd52bf251?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1118321","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1118321/user1118321"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":104,"user_id":3374794,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81bfe4f2334b22c489ce1dedab3de39a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"defense2000x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3374794/defense2000x"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569697093,"post_id":58036519,"comment_id":102682720,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036519/are-there-other-frameworks-in-macos-that-have-useful-env-vars-like-cgbitmap-cont#comment102682720_58036519"},{"owner":{"reputation":75729,"user_id":1312143,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d64f50f989e564c337a8a8bd653b8e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken Thomases","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312143/ken-thomases"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569816784,"post_id":58036519,"comment_id":102704821,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036519/are-there-other-frameworks-in-macos-that-have-useful-env-vars-like-cgbitmap-cont#comment102704821_58036519"},{"owner":{"reputation":21458,"user_id":1118321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a56b8390b7457739ed8cc7cbd52bf251?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1118321","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1118321/user1118321"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569818521,"post_id":58036519,"comment_id":102705105,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036519/are-there-other-frameworks-in-macos-that-have-useful-env-vars-like-cgbitmap-cont#comment102705105_58036519"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21458,"user_id":1118321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a56b8390b7457739ed8cc7cbd52bf251?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1118321","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1118321/user1118321"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569982823,"creation_date":1569982823,"answer_id":58194417,"question_id":58036519,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58194417","body_markdown":"Per @defense2000x&#39;s suggestion, I wrote a shell script to run strings on all the frameworks in /System/Library/Frameworks/ and `grep`ed for &quot;env&quot;.

Once complete, `await` will either return the result of the `Task`, or throw an exception that happened inside the `Task` (if there was one). So there is no point testing to see if a `Task` faulted if you already awaited it, because if it faulted, `await` would have thrown an exception.\r\n\r\nJust wrap it in a `try`/`catch` block.\r\n\r\nBut your code won&#39;t even compile because:\r\n\r\n1.

If you want it to change, you need to use your Random to assign another value.\r\n\r\nYour formula `random.nextInt(highRange -lowRange) + 1` isn&#39;t right if you&#39;re wanting a random number between `lowRange` and `highRange` inclusive. That&#39;s giving you a number between `lowRange + 1` and `highRange + 1`. The correct formula would be `random.nextInt(highRange - lowRange) + lowRange`.\r\n\r\nThe way to solve this would be create an additional variable for each bubble that stores the random int. You are already keeping a list for each of the two variables you&#39;re already storing (x and y). You could theoretically add a third, but it&#39;s to the point where you really just need to create a class for each bubble, so you can expand it easily if you add more features.\r\n\r\n    class Bubble {\r\n        int x;\r\n        int y;\r\n        int textureIndex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen replace your two array lists with:\r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;Bubble&gt; bubbles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\nAnd your `makeBubble` method should look like this:\r\n\r\n    void makeBubble(){\r\n        Bubble bubble = new Bubble();\r\n        bubble.x = (int)(random.nextFloat() * Gdx.graphics.getWidth());\r\n        bubble.y = Gdx.graphics.getHeight();\r\n        bubble.textureIndex = random.nextInt(3);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd your for loop for drawing them would look like this. I changed your textures array name here to `bubbleTextures` so `bubbles` can be used for the list of Bubble objects.\r\n\r\n    for (Bubble bubble : bubbles) {\r\n        batch.draw(bubbleTextures[bubble.textureIndex],  bubble.x, bubble.y); \r\n        bubble.y -= 4;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other issues I&#39;m seeing with your code, but I think it would be overwhelming to explain them all.

my own question...after thinking about it, even if I could fix this with config or something, maybe the choice of association (bidirectional one-to-many) is just inappropriate. This kind of association would be used more typically in a composition, when there are just a few child objects and you usually want to fetch them along with the parent using a fetch join IIRC. But these access events are numerous and rarely used, and frankly a big headache.

I have *zero* experience with VB, .NET, or VB.NET, I am a JS developer so this is all Greek to me.\r\n\r\nMy supervisor would like me to remove the &quot;MDI-ness&quot; of the application.  I.e. we are looking at MDImain.vb and in the previous application (pre-conversion) there is no MDImain.  This project was converted from VB6 to VB.NET and we are struggling to get things working again; the supe&#39;s opinion is that eliminating the MDI-ness of the application will help straighten it out.  **So the question is:** is there a straightforward way of making an MDI VB.NET application into a non-MDI one?\r\n\r\nNote: I have seen other similar threads with people recommending that the application simply be rewritten from scratch.  I wholeheartedly agree, and would like to do that, but our manager refuses this option as it he believes it will take too long.\r\n\r\nNote from comments: the original application was not MDI, this can be confirmed, for example, by running the existing executable and seeing that it is not an MDI application.  The VB6-to-VB.NET conversion in VS 2008 somehow made the old VB6 application into an MDI application without asking.  (I have shadowed a more recent conversion attempt and seen that adding MDI functionality is not part of the process as we encountered it.)  We are trying to figure out how to either prevent this MDI addition in another conversion attempt, or to undo it in the result, since we did not want it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036417/convert-vb-net-mdi-application-to-non-mdi","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"Convert VB.NET MDI Application to Non-MDI?"},{"tags":["vue.js","vuejs2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2276,"user_id":3508956,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/umLTo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"laptou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3508956/laptou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569026594,"post_id":58036416,"comment_id":102474484,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036416/vuejs-seems-to-be-loading-things-multiple-times#comment102474484_58036416"},{"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":594623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81eafd6302644940461eec9b1e31d516?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kevinkt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/594623/kevinkt"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2276,"user_id":3508956,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/umLTo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"laptou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3508956/laptou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569026810,"post_id":58036416,"comment_id":102474509,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036416/vuejs-seems-to-be-loading-things-multiple-times#comment102474509_58036416"}],"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":594623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81eafd6302644940461eec9b1e31d516?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kevinkt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/594623/kevinkt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":357,"user_id":594623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81eafd6302644940461eec9b1e31d516?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kevinkt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/594623/kevinkt"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569026781,"creation_date":1569026324,"last_edit_date":1569026781,"question_id":58036416,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036416","body_markdown":"Not sure what is happening with Vue JS, but in the console errors pop up 2-3 times, which is strange.

Making the actual merge produces a new commit `j`:\r\n\r\n    a -- b -- c ------ h -- j       &lt;-- Master\r\n               \\           /\r\n                d -- e -- i     &lt;-- Branch-A\r\n                 \\\r\n                  f -- g     &lt;-- Branch-B\r\n\r\nThis merge is *required* because existing commit `h` must be preserved, while new commits `d-e-i` become reachable from the tip of `master`: this requires a merge commit `j` whose parents are the two existing commits `h` and `i`.  (If `h` did not exist, a fast-forward operation would be possible: that changes the resulting graph shape, so its effect ripples through the rest of this answer.  Let&#39;s assume that `h` does exist, and/or you force a non-fast-forward merge anyway.)\r\n\r\nAt this point you now have the *option* of *deleting* the name `Branch-A` entirely (at any time), and also the *option* of copying existing commits `f` and `g` to new-and-improved commits `f&#39;` and `g&#39;`.  That&#39;s the rebase you&#39;re asking about.\r\n\r\n*Should* you rebase them?  That&#39;s a harder question.  But, provided everyone else agrees that original commits `f` and `g` can be abandoned in favor of the new-and-improved `f&#39;` and `g&#39;`, it&#39;s fine.  It might also make things prettier later.  If you decide not to rebase them, the question of how to do it is moot.\r\n\r\nIf you *do* decide to rebase them, your next question needs to be: upon which target commit?  Should `f&#39;` come after `i`, or should it come after `j`?  Let&#39;s draw both scenarios:\r\n\r\n    (option 1: after i)\r\n\r\n    a -- b -- c ------ h -- j       &lt;-- Master\r\n               \\           /\r\n                d -- e -- i     &lt;-- Branch-A\r\n                 \\         \\\r\n                  \\         f&#39; -- g&#39;   &lt;-- Branch-B\r\n                   \\\r\n                    f -- g   [abandoned]\r\n\r\n    (option 2: after j)\r\n\r\n                              f&#39; -- g&#39;   &lt;-- Branch-B\r\n                             /\r\n    a -- b -- c ------ h -- j       &lt;-- Master\r\n               \\           /\r\n                d -- e -- i\r\n                 \\\r\n                  f -- g  [abandoned]\r\n\r\nTo make option 2 happen, run:\r\n\r\n    git checkout Branch-B\r\n    git rebase Master\r\n\r\n(I prefer to use two separate commands here, but you can spell this `git rebase Master Branch-B` if you like: the extra `Branch-B` argument makes `git rebase` start by running `git checkout` first.)  Note that I&#39;ve deleted the name `Branch-A`: we didn&#39;t need it here.  You may or may not have deleted it at this point, and if not, you might delete it later.\r\n\r\nTo make option 1 happen, run:\r\n\r\n    git checkout Branch-B\r\n    git rebase Branch-A\r\n\r\nThis time we need the *name* `Branch-A` to easily find the hash ID of commit `j`.  So if you want to make option 1 happen, and don&#39;t want to have to run `git log` and cut and paste hash IDs, keep the name `Branch-A` around at least until this point.  After the rebase finishes, we don&#39;t need the name `Branch-A` any more and now it&#39;s safe to delete.\r\n\r\n*Technically*, we didn&#39;t need it before the rebase either, because we could look up the hash ID of `j` any time: `git log Master` starts at `j` and shows us that, then shows us one of `h` or `i`, and eventually we see `i` and therefore see its hash ID.  So we can find it the hard way no matter what—but if you keep the name for a little while, we don&#39;t *have* to do that.\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you use GitHub&#39;s &quot;rebase and merge&quot; or &quot;squash and merge&quot; clicky buttons, those *do not* do a standard merge.  Instead, they *copy* commits to new ones, similar to rebase.  That is, they&#39;ll make new and supposedly improved copies of the commits you&#39;re trying to incorporate.  In that case *none of your own existing names find the correct commit hash IDs any more* because all of *your* names still remember your original commits, with *their* hash IDs, not the copies / new-commits that GitHub will have made.  So if you *do* use GitHub&#39;s fancier operations, you will have to run `git fetch` to get the new commits *from* GitHub, then use other names, or raw commit hash IDs; you should ditch, or fix up, your own branch names soon, to avoid getting confused as to which commits were the originals and which were the new, and supposedly improved, copies.  (Is commit `f9131d9` the original, or is it `70abf32c`?  What about `a31cf2a` vs `0449acd`?  The hash IDs look totally random and keeping them straight is ... not fun.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036376/how-to-rebase-or-merge-a-branch-from-another-feature-branch-from-master/58036500#58036500","title":"How to rebase or merge a branch from another feature branch from master"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":2471205,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67285061ebcba657c5ac4cc36c3a441c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NyoNor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2471205/nyonor"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569028253,"creation_date":1569028253,"answer_id":58036555,"question_id":58036376,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036555","body_markdown":"This approach is &quot;overbranched&quot;.
