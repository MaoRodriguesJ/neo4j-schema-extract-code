However I haven&#39;t been able to find a way to test if state updates.\r\n\r\nI have a component `Dropdown` with a function `handleClick`:\r\n```\r\nconst Dropdown = props =&gt; {\r\n  const classes = useStyles();\r\n  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const handleClick = () =&gt; {\r\n    setOpen(prev =&gt; !prev);\r\n  };\r\n```\r\nI have a button in a `div` which when clicked will toggle the state of my hook:\r\n```\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n          &lt;Button\r\n            className=&quot;classes.menuButton&quot;\r\n            onClick={handleClick}\r\n            aria-label=&quot;menu&quot;\r\n          &gt;\r\n            &lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faChevronDown} /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Button&gt;\r\n&lt;/div\r\n```\r\nMy unit test is trying to mount the component, simulate a click, and then evaluate state.\r\n```\r\nit(&#39;clicking button toggles open&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n    let results;\r\n    function HookWrapper(){\r\n      results = Dropdown();\r\n      return null;\r\n     };\r\n    mount(&lt;HookWrapper /&gt;)\r\n    // console.log(results.state)\r\n    wrapper.find(&#39;button&#39;).simulate(&#39;click&#39;);\r\n    // console.log(wrapper.find(&#39;button&#39;).debug())\r\n    expect(results.open).toEqual(true)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\nI am getting an error telling me that results.open is undefined. \r\nIs there any way I can access the hooks state?\r\nI&#39;m also wondering if it would be better to turn this into a snapshot test. Take a snapshot after the button is clicked and compare.  \r\nAny help would be appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033434/accessing-react-hooks-state-with-jest-unit-test","title":"Accessing React Hooks State with Jest Unit Test"},{"tags":["python","matplotlib","curve-fitting"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14262,"user_id":1020470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/155b46c9d301fa5a4c1a2a9ad4f2849e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Mikofski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020470/mark-mikofski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569003772,"post_id":58033432,"comment_id":102469046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033432/curve-fitting-and-matplotlib#comment102469046_58033432"},{"owner":{"reputation":792,"user_id":1115277,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1cac16c4810b19ce83f367e391eea801?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"amaatouq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1115277/amaatouq"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14262,"user_id":1020470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/155b46c9d301fa5a4c1a2a9ad4f2849e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Mikofski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020470/mark-mikofski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569004180,"post_id":58033432,"comment_id":102469216,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033432/curve-fitting-and-matplotlib#comment102469216_58033432"},{"owner":{"reputation":14262,"user_id":1020470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/155b46c9d301fa5a4c1a2a9ad4f2849e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Mikofski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020470/mark-mikofski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569004537,"post_id":58033432,"comment_id":102469341,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033432/curve-fitting-and-matplotlib#comment102469341_58033432"},{"owner":{"reputation":14262,"user_id":1020470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/155b46c9d301fa5a4c1a2a9ad4f2849e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Mikofski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020470/mark-mikofski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569004732,"post_id":58033432,"comment_id":102469409,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033432/curve-fitting-and-matplotlib#comment102469409_58033432"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14262,"user_id":1020470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/155b46c9d301fa5a4c1a2a9ad4f2849e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Mikofski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020470/mark-mikofski"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14262,"user_id":1020470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/155b46c9d301fa5a4c1a2a9ad4f2849e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Mikofski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1020470/mark-mikofski"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569007618,"last_edit_date":1569007618,"creation_date":1569005324,"answer_id":58033766,"question_id":58033432,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58033766","body_markdown":"### No Centering\r\nHere&#39;s a quick example of fitting the points in polar coordinates:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = [0.125735  , 0.11753342, 0.11572967, 0.11963533, 0.1255283 ,\r\n     0.13183589, 0.13904629, 0.14754317, 0.15548172, 0.16429631,\r\n     0.17474308, 0.18641375]\r\ny = [0.11917991, 0.10663986, 0.09897077, 0.09291739, 0.08743263,\r\n     0.08346636, 0.08161819, 0.08132199, 0.08216186, 0.0834759 ,\r\n     0.08551088, 0.08770163]\r\nz = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n     6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ,\r\n     11, 12]\r\n\r\n# you need numpy\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nx = np.array(x)\r\ny = np.array(y)\r\n\r\nr = np.sqrt(x*x + y*y)\r\ntheta = np.arctan2(x, y)\r\n\r\nplt.scatter(theta, r, z, z)\r\nplt.colorbar()\r\nplt.grid()\r\nplt.title(&#39;polar coords&#39;)\r\nplt.xlabel(&#39;$\\\\theta$ [rad]&#39;)\r\nplt.ylabel(&#39;r&#39;)\r\n\r\np = np.polyfit(theta, r, 2)\r\nxfit = np.linspace(0.8, 1.15, 15)\r\nyfit = np.polyval(p, x)\r\n\r\nplt.plot(xfit, yfit, &#39;--&#39;)\r\nplt.legend([&#39;original data&#39;, &#39;fit&#39;])\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![polar coordinate fit][1]][1]\r\n\r\n### With Centering\r\nWe _might_ do better if we center the points first:\r\n```python\r\n# find the averages to find the centroid of the data\r\nx_avg = x.mean()\r\ny_avg = y.mean()\r\n\r\n# center the data\r\nx_star = x -

What am I missing?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a link: https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=G87J3CAFWM69\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is the code without a link:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;style&gt;\r\n    .header { grid-area: header; }\r\n    .menu { grid-area: menu; }\r\n    .main { grid-area: main; }\r\n    .right { grid-area: right; }\r\n    .footer { grid-area: footer; }\r\n\r\n    .grid-container {\r\n      display: grid;\r\n      grid-template-areas:\r\n        &#39;header&#39; &#39;menu&#39; &#39;main&#39; &#39;right&#39; &#39;footer&#39;;\r\n      grid-gap: 10px;\r\n      background-color: #2196F3;\r\n      padding: 10px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .grid-container &gt; div {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);\r\n      justify-content: center;\r\n      align-items: center;\r\n      padding: 20px 0;\r\n      font-size: 30px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {\r\n      grid-template-areas:\r\n        &#39;header header header header header header&#39;\r\n        &#39;menu main main main right right&#39;\r\n        &#39;menu footer footer footer footer footer&#39;;\r\n    }\r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;h1&gt;The grid-area Property&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;em&gt;grid-area&lt;/em&gt; property to name grid items.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You can refer to the name when you set up the grid layout, by using the &lt;em&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/em&gt; property on the grid container.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This grid layout contains six columns and three rows:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;grid-container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;Menu&lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;Main&lt;/div&gt;  \r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Right&lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033409/media-query-for-responsive-grid-using-grid-area","title":"Media query for responsive grid using grid-area"},{"tags":["python","json","google-api","google-calendar-api"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":8062338,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XoqO6PZNQnc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAwU/aHZasjh4rW8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reid Pryzant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8062338/reid-pryzant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569038570,"post_id":58036123,"comment_id":102475821,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033408/using-google-api-for-python-no-option-to-download-credentials-json-file/58036123#comment102475821_58036123"},{"owner":{"reputation":38512,"user_id":7108653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2EI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tanaike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30,"user_id":8062338,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XoqO6PZNQnc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAwU/aHZasjh4rW8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reid Pryzant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8062338/reid-pryzant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569049936,"post_id":58036123,"comment_id":102477229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033408/using-google-api-for-python-no-option-to-download-credentials-json-file/58036123#comment102477229_58036123"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":38512,"user_id":7108653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2EI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tanaike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569022392,"creation_date":1569022392,"answer_id":58036123,"question_id":58033408,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036123","body_markdown":"How about this answer?\r\n\r\nI think that from your image, you are trying to retrieve the file from API key.

I understand that it says **uninitialized** but Im not sure why. It seems it is looking for a constant instead of reading the class?\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by &quot;reading the class&quot;. Yes, Ruby is looking for a constant. Variable names that begin with a capital letter are constants, ergo, `HtmlBody` is a constant, `HeadingTags` is a constant, and `HtmlBody::HeadingTags` is the constant `HeadingTags` located in a class or module that is referenced by the constant `HtmlBody`.\r\n\r\n&gt; How are you supposed to include classes located in separated files inside a module?\r\n\r\nYou namespace a class inside a module by defining the class inside the module. If you are *sure* that the module already exists, you can define the class like this:\r\n\r\n    class HtmlBody::HeadingTags\r\n      # …\r\n    end\r\n\r\nHowever, if `HtmlBody` is not defined (or is not a class or module), this will fail.\r\n\r\n    module HtmlBody\r\n      class HeadingTags\r\n        # …\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThis will guarantee that module `HtmlBody` will be created if it doesn&#39;t exist (and simply re-opened if it already exists).\r\n\r\nThere is also a slight difference in constant lookup rules between the two, which is however not relevant to your question (but be aware of it).\r\n\r\n&gt; The is something that Im missing in Ruby and the **require/require_relative** probably.\r\n\r\nIndeed, your question stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what [`Kerne#load`](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-load) / [`Kernel#require`](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-require) / [`Kernel#require_relative`](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-require_relative) does.\r\n\r\nHere is the very complicated, detailed, in-depth explanation of all the incredibly convoluted stuff that those three methods do. Brace yourself! Are you ready? Here we go:\r\n\r\nThey run the file.\r\n\r\nWait … that&#39;s it? Yes, that&#39;s it! That&#39;s all there is to it. They run the file.\r\n\r\nSo, what happens when you run a file that looks like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     class HeadingTags\r\n&gt;       # …\r\n&gt;     end\r\n\r\nIt defines a class named `HeadingTags` in the top-level namespace, right?\r\n\r\nOkay, so what happens when we now do this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     require_relative &#39;./html_body/HeadingTags&#39;\r\n\r\nWell, we said that `require_relative` simply runs the file. And we said that running that file defines a class named `HeadingTags` in the top-level namespace. Therefore, this will obviously define a class named `HeadingTags` in the top-level namespace.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at your code: what happens, when we do this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     module HtmlBody\r\n&gt;       require_relative &#39;./html_body/HeadingTags&#39;\r\n&gt;     end\r\n\r\nAgain, we said that `require_relative` simply runs the file. Nothing more. Nothing less. Just run the file. And what did we say running that file does? It defines a class named `HeadingTags` in the top-level namespace.\r\n\r\nSo, what will calling `require_relative` *from within the module definition of `HtmlBody`* do? It will define a class named `HeadingTags` *in the top-level namespace*. Because `require_relative` simply runs the file, and thus the result will be exactly the same as running the file, and the result of running file is that it defines the class in the top-level namespace.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you actually achieve what you are trying to do? Well, if you want to define a class inside a module, you have to … define the class inside the module!\r\n\r\n**lib/html_body.rb**\r\n\r\n    require_relative &#39;html_body/heading_tags&#39;\r\n    require_relative &#39;html_body/anchor_tags&#39;\r\n    require_relative &#39;html_body/img_tags&#39;\r\n\r\n    module HtmlBody; end\r\n\r\n**lib/html_body/heading_tags.rb**\r\n\r\n    module HtmlBody\r\n      class HeadingTags\r\n        # …\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n**lib/html_body/anchor_tags.rb**\r\n\r\n    module HtmlBody\r\n      class AnchorTags\r\n        # …\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n**lib/html_body/img_tags.rb**\r\n\r\n    module HtmlBody\r\n      class ImgTags\r\n        # …\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n**main.rb**\r\n\r\n    require_relative &#39;lib/html_body&#39;\r\n    \r\n    HtmlBody::HeadingTags.new","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033389/ruby-how-to-include-classes-in-a-module/58034705#58034705","title":"Ruby - How to include classes in a Module"}],"owner":{"reputation":1268,"user_id":1578841,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/871c02ef5d3021372c8721db6b8d1076?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kitimenpolku","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1578841/kitimenpolku"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58034705,"answer_count":4,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569022717,"creation_date":1569003432,"question_id":58033389,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033389","body_markdown":"Im new in Ruby.

sure if this is the main reason, but anyway you can&#39;t exec PHP code form Javascript like that:\r\n```\r\nlocation.href = &quot;&lt;?php echo home_url();?&gt;/city/&quot; + &#39;...&#39;;\r\n```\r\nThis would result into invalid url and fail the redirect. If you need to transfer some values from PHP to JS, use `wp_localize_script()` function instead. Check detailes [here][1].\r\n\r\nTo debug other potential troubles you need to perform some separate tets:\r\n \r\n\r\n 1. PHP-side. Make sure that your `$categories`array is not empty and it has non-empty categories or simply check the `$select` output (without any related JS executed for now).\r\n 2. JS-side. Log each call of `onCatChange()` to Console to be sure that onchange event: a) fires correctly, 2) is not triggered by some other reason (e.g. loosing focus in old IE or other tricky surprises). Then log the the string value assigned to `location.href` and make sure that it is not broken and is a valid url.\r\n\r\nAdditional tips: \r\n\r\n - Always escape your output (`$category-&gt;slug`, `$category-&gt;name` -- they are not always reliable and sometimes may break your markup);\r\n - Probably missed backslashes when inserting line breaks into strings: should be `\\n`, not just `n`?\r\n - If you call a script with dependency `array(&#39;jquery&#39;)`, feel free to use jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript. This can help you avoid crossbrowser issues.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_localize_script","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033364/replacing-hierarchal-checkboxes-with-dropdown-selector-on-custom-taxonomy-inside/58037519#58037519","title":"Replacing hierarchal checkboxes with dropdown selector on custom taxonomy inside custom post type"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10963874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qaL2KfRTbyw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQN67sIOlQEIZyWwNFcbUIcff4XUMQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sam Kobe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10963874/sam-kobe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10963874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qaL2KfRTbyw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQN67sIOlQEIZyWwNFcbUIcff4XUMQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sam Kobe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10963874/sam-kobe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569043598,"creation_date":1569003313,"last_edit_date":1569004752,"question_id":58033364,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033364","body_markdown":"I have seen several blog posts on this topic but have not been able to implement them with success.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following (perhaps one of these is the solution and I am slightly off):\r\n\r\n 1. https://pagecrafter.com/dropdown-menu-of-all-terms-in-custom-taxonomy-wordpress/\r\n 2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52823925/wordpress-taxonomy-dropdown-is-not-working-with-hierarchical\r\n 3. https://www.noelsheppard.co.uk/create-dropdown-list-custom-taxonomy-terms/ (basically example 1)\r\n 4. https://shibashake.com/wordpress-theme/wordpress-custom-taxonomy-input-panels\r\n 5. lastly, read over [this][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a CPT of Properties, that has three custom taxonomies:\r\n\r\n 1. Guests\r\n 2. Rooms\r\n 3. City (The city taxonomy is populated through a custom function that watches for when a second CPT [Destinations] has new posts created and adds the same name as a taxonomy to the Properties City entries)\r\n\r\nI would like to ensure that when creating a Property post and setting its city that only one city(destination) is selected. I would like to use a dropdown for this action.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 1st(or 3rd) link above&#39;s example I have tried the below implementation:\r\n\r\nThe function for initializing in my functions.php:\r\n```\r\n// Creates dropdown taxonomy select for guest taxonomy in Properties.\r\nfunction dropdown_tax_init(){\r\n\r\n  $categories = get_categories(&#39;taxonomy=city&#39;);\r\n  $select     = &quot;&lt;select name=&#39;cat&#39; id=&#39;cat&#39; class=&#39;top-tags-dropdown&#39;&gt;n&quot;;\r\n  $select .= &quot;&lt;option value=&#39;-1&#39;&gt;Select Tag&lt;/option&gt;n&quot;;\r\n  foreach ($categories as $category) {\r\n      if ($category-&gt;count &gt; 0) {\r\n          $select .= &quot;&lt;option value=&#39;&quot; . $category-&gt;slug . &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; . $category-&gt;name . &quot;&lt;/option&gt;&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n  $select .= &quot;&lt;/select&gt;&quot;;\r\n  echo $select;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd_action( &#39;init&#39;, &#39;dropdown_tax_init&#39; );\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also call the js via my functions.php like so:\r\n```\r\nfunction admin_footer_script() {\r\n\twp_register_script(&#39;dropdown_tax_script&#39;, get_template_directory_uri() . &#39;/js/taxonomy-dropdown.js&#39;, array(&#39;jquery&#39;), &#39;1.0.0&#39;); // Conditional script(s)\r\n\twp_enqueue_script(&#39;dropdown_tax_script&#39;); // Enqueue it!\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd_action( &#39;admin_footer&#39;, &#39;admin_footer_script&#39; );\r\n```\r\n\r\nLasty, my js is as follows:\r\n```\r\nvar dropdown = document.getElementById(&quot;cat&quot;);\r\n\r\nfunction onCatChange() {\r\n    if (dropdown.options[dropdown.selectedIndex].value != -1) {\r\n        location.href = &quot;&lt;?php echo home_url();?&gt;/city/&quot; + dropdown.options[dropdown.selectedIndex].value + &quot;/&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ndropdown.onchange = onCatChange;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy javascript is showing in inspect in the admin footer.\r\n\r\nThe drop down flashes on load but the custom taxonomies do not load when I have the function in my function.php something is breaking the loading of custom taxonomies in the right sidebar in the Gutenberg editor. They never show up.\r\n\r\nHappy to go into further details, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dropdown_categories","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033364/replacing-hierarchal-checkboxes-with-dropdown-selector-on-custom-taxonomy-inside","title":"Replacing hierarchal checkboxes with dropdown selector on custom taxonomy inside custom post type"},{"tags":["c++","pointers","cout"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":179841,"user_id":434551,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Wzl8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"R Sahu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/434551/r-sahu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569003362,"post_id":58033363,"comment_id":102468878,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033363/why-after-cout-something-then-cout-pointer-the-pointer-gives-a-junk-value-if-o#comment102468878_58033363"},{"owner":{"reputation":49929,"user_id":5245033,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6dbfd37ccb940fd2afcd49e966ad97e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SergeyA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5245033/sergeya"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569005000,"post_id":58033363,"comment_id":102469512,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033363/why-after-cout-something-then-cout-pointer-the-pointer-gives-a-junk-value-if-o#comment102469512_58033363"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10399487,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BH4nsGf2e-4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMc/rWQGKVWtiWY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"AndrewFan0408","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10399487/andrewfan0408"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569003389,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569003302,"creation_date":1569003302,"question_id":58033363,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033363","body_markdown":"If I only cout the pointer, or cout the pointer first, it works fine, but the second time will give a junk value.\r\nIf I cout anything before I cout the pointer, the pointer also gives junk value.\r\n\r\n    int* computeSquares(int&amp;

This is different from the logic in some other answers which are not identifying those two words but instead identifying the last part of the string. Not completely clear to me which you wanted so just FYI on the difference.\r\n\r\n    library(stringr)\r\n    patt &lt;- paste(pattern, collapse = &#39;|&#39;)\r\n    c(rbind(str_remove(test, patt), str_extract(test, patt)))\r\n    \r\n    # [1] &quot;Some string that explains x. &quot;                        \r\n    # [2] &quot;Conflict&quot;                                             \r\n    # [3] &quot;Some string that explains y. Additional information. &quot;\r\n    # [4] &quot;Precaution&quot;                                           \r\n    # [5] &quot;Some string that explains z. Justification.   &quot;       \r\n    # [6] &quot;Conflict&quot; \r\n\r\n\\* See example below. This works because `c` will convert the matrix to a vector column-wise and you are creating the matrix with one element from each vector per column by rbind-ing the vectors together.\r\n\r\n    c(rbind(c(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;), c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;)))\r\n    #[1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;C&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033343/how-can-the-pattern-of-a-string-split-become-the-substring-itself/58033804#58033804","title":"How can the pattern of a string split become the substring itself?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":458,"user_id":11864854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YLZIl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hayden Y.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11864854/hayden-y"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569271466,"creation_date":1569271466,"answer_id":58069962,"question_id":58033343,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58069962","body_markdown":"In light of the fact that you may have cases you don&#39;t want to catch, here&#39;s what I would suggest:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest &lt;- c(&quot;Some string that explains x.

The problem is that, there is no real pattern for me to split all the strings with. Rather, I know what the different substrings I am looking for are, and I wish to use these as a pattern to perform the split without losing this pattern itself in the process.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say that a sample of strings are of the form: \r\n```\r\ntest &lt;- c(&quot;Some string that explains x. Conflict&quot;, \r\n          &quot;Some string that explains y. Additional information. Precaution&quot;,\r\n          &quot;Some string that explains z. Justification.   Conflict&quot;) \r\n```\r\nI wish to split those strings into the following list: \r\n```\r\n[1] &quot;Some string that explains x.&quot;\r\n[2] &quot;Conflict&quot;\r\n[3] &quot;Some string that explains y. Additional information.&quot;\r\n[4] &quot;Precaution&quot;\r\n[5] &quot;Some string that explains z. Justification.&quot;\r\n[6] &quot;Conflict&quot;\r\n```\r\nAt the center of my problem is I need to conserve the order. \r\n\r\nObviously, the pattern I mentioned is: \r\n```\r\npattern &lt;- c(&quot;Conflict&quot;, &quot;Precaution&quot;)\r\n```\r\nMost of the strings that I had initially had a double space between the explanatory part and the so-called pattern so I could simply use \r\n```\r\nunlist(strsplit(test, &quot;\\\\s{2,}&quot;))\r\n```\r\n\r\nto differentiate them. I now realize that some of them have only one space between them, and this method could no longer function since the explanatory string would end up being divided for each of its individual words. \r\n\r\nExtracting them was an option which I looked up but as I tried, I would lose the order I must preserve (I end up creating a new list with solely the extracted substring).\r\n\r\nWith `strsplit()`, I cannot use the said pattern for the function since by splitting the string with it, I remove the pattern itself. I tried to use a `gsub()` trick I found to surround the pattern with &quot;~&quot; and then split it accordingly but I found myself unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nNamely, \r\n```\r\n &gt; unlist(strsplit(test, pattern))\r\n[1] &quot;Some string that explains x. &quot;                        \r\n[2] &quot;Some string that explains y. Additional information. &quot;\r\n[3] &quot;Some string that explains z. Justification.   &quot;\r\n```     \r\n\r\nEssentially, how I could split the strings using the said pattern and get the desired result? Alternatively, is there a way to extract the pattern from the original strings and insert them in the list in the proper order?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033343/how-can-the-pattern-of-a-string-split-become-the-substring-itself","title":"How can the pattern of a string split become the substring itself?"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","routing","react-hooks"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":311,"user_id":10251777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29cd319fb5323d0317a3d84040c336c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"apachuilo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10251777/apachuilo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569007061,"creation_date":1569007061,"answer_id":58034054,"question_id":58033342,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58034054","body_markdown":"Okay so I updated your code sandbox [here][1]. \r\n\r\nChanges to `src/context/Auth/index.js`\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYour context provider was a bit awkward.

Since you are designing your own theme you should read about [WordPress l10n][1] to learn about PO and MO files. \r\n\r\nTypically in Wordpress you use _e(&#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39;) and __(&#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39;) to echo or return localized strings respectively. These functions use gettext to match the first string with the MO file&#39;s localized entry with the second argument which defines your text-domain. \r\n\r\n    _e(&#39;I will echo text&#39;, &#39;your-textdomain&#39;);\r\n\r\nIn order to get these functions to return the proper results from the MO file you need to populate the PO file. PO file editors can scan your theme folder looking for any instances of these _e() and __() functions and list them in an easy to edit UI. There are a variety of PO editors available. \r\n\r\nOnce you populate the strings you use the PO editor to create the MO file for that language. This is typically done in the &#39;languages&#39; folder of your theme. If you did it elsewhere you would now copy the PO/ MO files there. \r\n\r\nNow the final piece is to [register your text-domain][2] in your theme so the gettext function can locate the MO you just made. \r\n\r\n    add_action( &#39;after_setup_theme&#39;, &#39;my_theme_setup&#39; );\r\n    function my_theme_setup(){\r\n        load_theme_textdomain( &#39;my-theme&#39;, get_template_directory()

may have a convoluted solution for you:\r\n\r\nFirst, I convert your ranges to a `list` of `tuples` of `int`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n\r\nr = [&quot;12-48&quot;, &quot;40-80&quot;, &quot;60-105&quot;, &quot;110-130&quot;, &quot;75-400&quot;]\r\nr = [tuple(map(int, z.split(&quot;-&quot;))) for z in r]\r\n\r\n# [(12, 48), (40, 80), (60, 105), (110, 130), (75, 400)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I iterate all the ranges and remove any that are entirely encapsulated by another range. E.g: `(110, 130)` is within `(75, 400)`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhold = []\r\nfor idx1 in range(len(r)):\r\n    start_1, stop_1 = r[idx1]\r\n    for idx2, (start_2, stop_2) in enumerate(r):\r\n        if idx1 == idx2:\r\n            continue\r\n        if start_2 &lt; start_1 and stop_1 &lt; stop_2:\r\n            hold.append(idx1)\r\n\r\nwhile hold:\r\n    del r[hold.pop()]\r\n\r\n# [(12, 48), (40, 80), (60, 105), (75, 400)]\r\n```\r\nFinally, using a `pandas.DataFrame` I calculate the overlap and percentage overlap; label the rows that meet your exclusion criteria (overlap &gt; 10 and % &gt; 0.2). These rows are then removed in reverse order, and the overlaps are tested again after each removal until no more rows can be removed.\r\n\r\nThe DataFrame is then converted back into a list of strings in the same format they were supplied in.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(r, columns=[&quot;start&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;]).sort_values(&quot;start&quot;)\r\n\r\ndf[&quot;length&quot;] = df[&quot;stop&quot;] - df[&quot;start&quot;]\r\ndf[&quot;bool_1&quot;], df[&quot;bool_2&quot;] = True, True\r\n\r\nwhile any(df[&quot;bool_1&quot;].eq(True) &amp; df[&quot;bool_2&quot;].eq(True)):\r\n    df[&quot;overlap&quot;] = df[&quot;stop&quot;] - df[&quot;start&quot;].shift(-1)\r\n    df[&quot;pc&quot;] = df[&quot;overlap&quot;] / df[&quot;length&quot;]\r\n\r\n    df[&quot;bool_1&quot;] = df[&quot;overlap&quot;] &gt; 10\r\n    df[&quot;bool_2&quot;] = df[&quot;pc&quot;] &gt; 0.2\r\n    for i, row in df.sort_index(ascending=False).iterrows():\r\n        if row[&quot;bool_1&quot;] == row[&quot;bool_2&quot;] and row[&quot;bool_1&quot;] is not False:\r\n            df.drop(i, inplace=True)\r\n            break\r\n\r\nresult = df[&quot;start&quot;].astype(&quot;str&quot;).str.cat(df[&quot;stop&quot;].astype(&quot;str&quot;), sep=&quot;-&quot;).to_list()\r\n\r\n#&#160;[&#39;12-48&#39;, &#39;40-80&#39;, &#39;75-400&#39;]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033322/filter-a-list-of-integer-ranges-by-both-a-maximum-overlap-percentage-and-value/58035023#58035023","title":"Filter a list of integer ranges by both a maximum overlap percentage and value"}],"owner":{"reputation":74,"user_id":2993761,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4d233ffed6ad2e7702452892e3b45eaf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NJD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2993761/njd"},"last_editor":{"reputation":74,"user_id":2993761,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4d233ffed6ad2e7702452892e3b45eaf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NJD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2993761/njd"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569012636,"creation_date":1569003031,"last_edit_date":1569003276,"question_id":58033322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033322","body_markdown":"I have a list of ranges such as:\r\n\r\n    [12-48,40-80,60-105,110-130,75-400]\r\n\r\nAnd I need to filter out or remove the ranges which overlap more than x digits (So overlap more than 10 for example) and/or overlap more than x% (Lets say 20%) of the smallest of the compared ranges.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I use a for loop to check each range at a time and compare it to the next to see whether they overlap past my stated limits, and if so, remove it. This does not work as with in the example I show I get this result:\r\n\r\n    [12-48,75-400]\r\n\r\nThe range [40-80] should not have been removed because it does not overlap with our 2 remaining ranges past the limits but because it overlapped [60-105] and was the smaller of the 2, it was removed.

The chapter **4, Asynchronous Programming** has the information that you need to know to improve the performance.\r\n\r\nIn my experience those are my recommendations:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Create a main threat to handle the main program.\r\n\r\n2. Create a class to handle the Socket Server, which implements an asynchronous process to accept connections, using the methods `BeginAccept ` and `EndAccept`, [here][2] is a sample of how to use it.\r\nCreate another class to handled the socket connections, which has as a property the `Socket` object.\r\n\r\n  2.1 create a method to start the Reading process, which will be called by the Server class to start the communication between the endpoints. This methos will start the process of read in an asynchronous way.\r\n\r\n  2.2 To read and write in an asyncrhonous way, it is necessary to get the `NetworkStream` from the socket, and use the methods `BeginRead` and `EndRead`, to receive data,  and `BegineWrite` and `EndWrite` to send data. [Here][3] there is the documentation. \r\n\r\n&gt; In the case that your service only needs to connect to a Server, ignore the step 1and implement the Client class to start the connection to an specific EndPoint.\r\n\r\n3. Use a collection class, as can be a `Dictionary`, *Key-Value-Pair* collection, to store each Client Class and use the socket ID as the key to access to each Client Class.\r\n\r\n4. Due each Client Socket handles it own socket, i use to implements a way to reconnect at the same Client Socket, i this way each Client is responsable for itself.\r\n\r\n5. The main program will be responsable to create each Client Server and set the EndPoint of each client, as you need, and start to connect each of them. In this case, `TCPClient` allow you begin an asynchronous process for connect, using the methods [`BeginConnect` and `EndConnect`][4]. \r\n\r\n[Here][5] you can see more details about this issue.\r\n\r\nI hope this might be useful for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Writing-High-Performance-NET-Code-Watson-ebook/dp/B07BF68842\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/asynchronous-server-socket-example\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.networkstream?view=netframework-4.8\r\n  [4]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient.beginconnect?view=netframework-4.8\r\n  [5]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43327534/c-sharp-high-cpu-usage-on-listener-thread-sleeping-misses-disconnect/43332998#43332998","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033308/how-to-manage-large-number-of-tcp-connections-using-asp-net-and-c/58126132#58126132","title":"How to manage large number of TCP connections using ASP.NET and C#"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":11468235,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fPu-q1yotA4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcDenKpQ0tPYhKHLp3jPlhxxCmD_w/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kartoos khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11468235/kartoos-khan"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569542557,"creation_date":1569002963,"question_id":58033308,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033308","body_markdown":"I have an application which connects to a third party server let’s call it Server-A. I have been given four different ports i.e.\r\n4000, 40001, 40002, 40003. On each port I can create 20 connections so I can create 80 total connections with server-A. I want to create a service layer that should communicate with server-A on mentioned ports. The technology will be asp.net C#. \r\n\r\n**The problem statement**\r\n\r\n1- Application should be non-blocking/asynchronous to entertain 10 to 20 million request per day\r\n\r\n2- Whenever the service layer starts it create 20 connections on each port. (Total 80 connections)\r\n\r\n2- All connections should remain connected/alive 24/7 and reconnect whenever any connections drops/disconnects.

Should I add those to a static list one by one when a TCP socket is successful?\r\n - How can I know that a certain connection is dropped/disconnected? \r\n - How can I send certain requests on different ports?

First, the window size is 2 such that the data in two columns are combined. The window shifts 1 step (1 column) and the next set of two columns are combined. The output is a matrix for each window size. The window size continues to increase such that, the window  increases to 3 columns and the results from 3 columns are output into a new matrix. This continues until the window is the size of the maximum number of columns. \r\n\r\nI need to run a series of functions on each matrix within the list and output the answers into a data frame. The functions I need to apply are: \r\n\r\n1. Calculate total frequency for each row (ie. row totals ). I attempted this function: \r\n\r\n        freq &lt;- rowSums(mat[i:(i + j),])\r\n\r\n2. Calculate mean frequency for each row (ie. row totals/length of row). I attempted this function: \r\n\r\n        mean_freq &lt;- rowSums(mat[i:(i + j),])/length(mat[i:(i + j),])\r\n\r\n3. Multiply the window size * pi * 25.  \r\n\r\n        total_window_size &lt;- length(ncol(mat) - j))*pi*25\r\n\r\n4. Divide the mean frequency for each row by the total window size. \r\n\r\n        density &lt;- mean_freq/total_window_size\r\n\r\nBelow are the expected results for the functions above for each matrix in this example list (i.e., `result_mat1`, `result_mat2`...). The data frame `result_df` combines all the results for each sub data frame and is the final output I need: \r\n\r\ndf for window size 2                                          \r\n\r\n

Does it mean missing data in Kafka topic or missing out data from Kafka topic to Spark streaming?\r\nThe first one can&#39;t be handled unless you&#39;re producer of the data and you can change according to the reason. The second one is possible if the data is still available in Kafka topic managed by retention period on Kafka cluster.\r\n\r\nHow to maintain the auditing for the same ?\r\n\r\nThere are couple of things you could do. You can ask Kafka to manage those offsets by committing those offsets. Or you could write the offsets to any other location like HBase and from there you can get the message offsets upto which you&#39;ve successfully processed.

Cmake files for my project are [here](https://gist.github.com/NotAPenguin0/e1240e7de5df5c1919cd7674f1121f85).\r\n\r\nI am using Cmake GUI on windows, generator VS2017 (x64), platform toolset LLVM. \r\n\r\nAny insights on this issue are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The exact errors I&#39;m getting are simply\r\n```\r\n1&gt;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\LLVM\\bin\\lld-link.exe : error : undefined symbol: __imp_clang_getTranslationUnitCursor\r\n1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referenced by C:\\Users\\michi_000\\Desktop\\C++\\SaturnEngine\\CodeGen\\Serialization\\main.cpp:128\r\n1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;               SerializationCodeGen.dir\\Editor\\main.obj:(?get_cursor@TranslationUnit@@QEAA?AUCXCursor@@XZ)\r\n```\r\nFor each libclang function I call.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033260/unable-to-link-libclang-with-cmake-on-vs2017","title":"Unable to link libclang with cmake on VS2017"},{"tags":["excel","azure","azure-devops"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12096860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e367099676b51ca19203e835115876d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KingOfThePirates","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096860/kingofthepirates"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569437589,"post_id":58038676,"comment_id":102600672,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033257/when-publishing-from-excel-to-azure-how-to-add-all-items-in-azure-boards-includi/58038676#comment102600672_58038676"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":2865796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24ada1d62b010f481c0354f38b2b2b02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sebastian Segerer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2865796/sebastian-segerer"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569055540,"creation_date":1569055540,"answer_id":58038676,"question_id":58033257,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58038676","body_markdown":"You must choose the additional colums via the &quot;Team&quot; Ribbon, &quot;Choose Columns&quot; from the predefinied colums list.  \r\nThe columns added to excel this way will get updated in AzureDevops / TFS.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]  \r\n  \r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5gWx.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mrNF3.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033257/when-publishing-from-excel-to-azure-how-to-add-all-items-in-azure-boards-includi/58038676#58038676","title":"when publishing from excel to azure how to add all items in azure boards including items other than default 6 items"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12096860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e367099676b51ca19203e835115876d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KingOfThePirates","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12096860/kingofthepirates"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569055540,"creation_date":1569002676,"question_id":58033257,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58033257","body_markdown":"I have connected my azure boards to excel sheet but when I publish my data from excel to azure only the default values(ID, Title, Work Item type, State, Reason, Assigned To) are added.

start by mentioning that there is a deductive approach that works in O(n) and is  detailed in this [blog post](https://www.cnblogs.com/lz87/p/11518225.html). It boils down to checking the parity of the counts of the three types of elements in the list to determine which of a few fixed outcomes occurs.\r\n\r\nYou mention that you&#39;d prefer to use a recursive approach, which is O(n!). This is a good start because it can be used as a tool for helping arrive at the O(n) solution and is a common recursive pattern to be familiar with.\r\n\r\nBecause we can&#39;t know whether a given fusion between two Quxes will ultimately lead to an optimal global solution we&#39;re forced to try every possibility. We do this by walking over the list and looking for potential fusions. When we find one, perform the transformation in a new list and call `fuse_quxes` on it. Along the way, we keep track of the smallest length achieved.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s one approach:\r\n\r\n    def fuse_quxes(quxes, choices=&quot;RGB&quot;):\r\n        fusion = {x[:-1]: [x[-1]] for x in permutations(choices)}\r\n    \r\n        def walk(quxes):\r\n            best = len(quxes)\r\n    \r\n            for i in range(1, len(quxes)):\r\n                if quxes[i-1] != quxes[i]:\r\n                    sub = quxes[:i-1] + fusion[quxes[i-1], quxes[i]] + quxes[i+1:]\r\n                    best = min(walk(sub), best)\r\n    \r\n            return best\r\n    \r\n        return walk(quxes)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is pretty much the direction your provided code is moving towards, but the  implementation seems unclear. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t see any single or quick fix. Here are a few general issues:\r\n\r\n- Putting the `fusionCreatures1` function into a class allows it to mutate external state, namely `self.value` and `self.ans`. `self.value` in particular is poorly named and difficult to keep track of. It seems like the intent is to use it as a reference copy to reset `arr` to its default value, but `arr = self.value` means that when `fus_arr` is mutated in `fusion()`, `self.value` is as well. Everything is pretty much a reference to one underlying list.\r\n\r\n    Adding slices to these copies at least makes the program easier to reason about, for example, `arr = self.value[:]` and `fus_arr = fus_arr[:]` in the `fusion()` function. In short, try to write [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).\r\n\r\n    `self.ans` is also unclear and unnecessary; better to keep the result value relegated to a local variable within the recursive function.\r\n\r\n    It seems unnecessary to put a stateless function into a class unless it&#39;s a purely static method and the class is acting as a namespace.\r\n\r\n- Another cause of cognitive overload are branching statements like `if` and `break`. We want to minimize the frequency and nesting of these. Here is `fusionCreatures1` in pseudocode, with annotations for mutations and complex interactions:\r\n\r\n        def fusionCreatures1():\r\n            if ...\r\n                read mutated global state\r\n            for i in len(arr):\r\n                if complex length and index checks:\r\n                    break\r\n                if arr[i] != arr[i+ 1]:\r\n                    impure_func_that_changes_arr_length(arr)\r\n                    recurse()\r\n                    if new best compared to global state:\r\n                        mutate global state\r\n\r\n    You&#39;ll probably agree that it&#39;s pretty difficult to mentally step through a run of this function.\r\n\r\n- In `fusionCreatures1()`, two variables are unused:\r\n\r\n                arr1 = self.fusion(arr, i)\r\n                testlen = self.fusionCreatures1(arr)\r\n\r\n    The assignment `arr1 = self.fusion(arr, i)` (along with the `return fus_arr`) seems to indicate a lack of understanding that `self.fusion` is really an [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) function that mutates its argument array. So calling it means `arr1 is arr` and we have another aliased variable to reason about.\r\n\r\n    Beyond this, neither `arr1` or `testlen` are used in the program, so the intent is unclear.\r\n\r\n    A good [linter](https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/) will pick up these unused variables and identify most of the other complexity issues I&#39;ve mentioned.\r\n- Mutating a list while looping over it is usually disastrous. `self.fusion(arr, i)` mutates `arr` inside a loop, making it very difficult to reason about its length and causing an index error when the `range(len(arr))` no longer matches the actual `len(arr)` in the function body (or at least necessitating an in-body precondition). Making `self.fusion(arr, i)` pure using a slice, as mentioned above, fixes this problem but reveals that there is no recursive [base case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#base_case), resulting in a stack overflow error.\r\n- Avoid variable names like `arr`, `arr1`, `value` unless the context is obvious. Again, these obfuscate intent and make the program difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nSome minor style suggestions:\r\n\r\n- Use `snake_case` per [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Class names should be `TitleCased` to differentiate them from functions. No need to inherit from `object`--that&#39;s implicit.\r\n- Use consistent spacing around functions and operators: `range (0,len(arr)-1):` is clearer as `range(len(arr) - 1):`, for example. Use vertical whitespace around blocks.\r\n- Use lists instead of typing out `t1`, `t2`, ... `t7`.\r\n- Function names should be verbs, not nouns. A class like `fusionCreatures` with a method called `fusionCreatures1` is unclear. Something like `QuxesSolver.minimize(creatures)` makes the intent a bit more obvious.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for the solution I provided above, there are other tricks worth considering to speed it up. One is [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization), which can help avoid duplicate work (any given list will always produce the same minimized length, so we just store this computation in a dict and spit it back out if we ever see it again). If we hit a length of 1, that&#39;s the best we can do globally, so we can skip the rest of the search.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a full runner, including the linear solution translated to Python (again, defer to the blog post to read about how it works):\r\n\r\n    from collections import defaultdict\r\n    from itertools import permutations\r\n    from random import choice, randint\r\n    \r\n    def fuse_quxes_linear(quxes, choices=&quot;RGB&quot;):\r\n        counts = defaultdict(int)\r\n    \r\n        for e in quxes:\r\n            counts[e] += 1\r\n    \r\n        if not quxes or any(x == len(quxes) for x in counts.values()):\r\n            return len(quxes)\r\n        elif len(set(counts[x] % 2 for x in choices)) == 1:\r\n            return 2\r\n        \r\n        return 1\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def fuse_quxes(quxes, choices=&quot;RGB&quot;):\r\n        fusion = {x[:-1]: [x[-1]] for x in permutations(choices)}\r\n    \r\n        def walk(quxes):\r\n            best = len(quxes)\r\n    \r\n            for i in range(1, len(quxes)):\r\n                if quxes[i-1] != quxes[i]:\r\n                    sub = quxes[:i-1] + fusion[quxes[i-1], quxes[i]] + quxes[i+1:]\r\n                    best = min(walk(sub), best)\r\n    \r\n            return best\r\n    \r\n        return walk(quxes)\r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n        tests = [\r\n            [&#39;R&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;B&#39;],\r\n            [&#39;R&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;B&#39;],\r\n            [&#39;R&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;B&#39;],\r\n            [&#39;G&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;G&#39;],\r\n            [&#39;G&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;G&#39;],\r\n            [&#39;R&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;R&#39;],\r\n            [&#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;B&#39;]\r\n        ]\r\n    \r\n        for test in tests:\r\n            print(test, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, fuse_quxes(test))\r\n            assert fuse_quxes_linear(test) == fuse_quxes(test)\r\n    \r\n        for i in range(100):\r\n            test = [choice(&quot;RGB&quot;) for x in range(randint(0, 10))]\r\n            assert fuse_quxes_linear(test) == fuse_quxes(test)\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: none --&gt;\r\n    \r\n    [&#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;] =&gt; 1\r\n    [&#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;] =&gt; 2\r\n    [&#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;] =&gt; 2\r\n    [&#39;G&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;] =&gt; 1\r\n    [&#39;G&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;] =&gt; 2\r\n    [&#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;] =&gt; 5\r\n    [&#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;B&#39;] =&gt; 2\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58033228/recursion-in-python-for-a-daily-coding-challenge/58035612#58035612","title":"Recursion in Python for a daily coding challenge"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3930,"user_id":6510497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3go0E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6510497/aguy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3930,"user_id":6510497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3go0E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6510497/aguy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569039703,"last_edit_date":1569039703,"creation_date":1569038929,"answer_id":58037211,"question_id":58033228,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58037211","body_markdown":"Here is my suggestion. \r\n\r\nFirst, instead of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot; and &quot;B&quot; I use integer values 0, 1, and 2.

However I was stopped by the below problem. I tried to solve it using recursion but I feel I am missing a very important concept in recursion. My code works for all of the below examples except the last one it will break down. \r\n\r\nCan someone point to me the mistake that I made in this recursion code? Or maybe guide me through solving the issue?\r\n\r\nI know why my code breaks but I don&#39;t know how to get around the &quot;pass by object reference&quot; in Python which I think creating the bigger problem for me.\r\n\r\nThe coding question is:\r\n\r\n\r\n   &gt;On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: red, green, and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two of them are standing next to each other, they can transform into a single creature of the third color.\r\n\r\n   &gt;Given N Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such transformations.\r\n  &gt; For example, given the input `[&#39;R&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;B&#39;]`, it is possible to end up with a single Qux through the following steps:\r\n\r\n&gt;             Arrangement       |   Change\r\n&gt;
