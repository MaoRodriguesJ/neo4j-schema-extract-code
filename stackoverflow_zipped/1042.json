If it is an option for you, you may want to add `#vba` to your tags so other contributors may be able to help you as `#vba` it not my expertise.

There is a simple way to do this if the flutter app is being run on a **mobile device** which involves using the `pdf` package in tandem with the `dart:io` package. However, `dart:io` is only compatible with mobile devices and *not in the web browser*. Flutter merged the functionality of `flutter_web` into `flutter`, and although this product is still in its infancy stages, I believe there is likely a way to accomplish what I am looking to do. \r\n\r\nIf I simply select &quot;file&quot; then &quot;print&quot; in the browser, I get inconsistent formatting across devices which is a problem. \r\n\r\nIs there a work around for not being able to use `dart:io`?

For example, (&quot;&#128195;&quot; as String) will have a length (or `count`) of 1 while (&quot;&#128195;&quot; as NSString) will have a length of 2 (see [this][1] link for a more detailed explanation).\r\n\r\nYour code sets `maxLength` to 1 because the length of all the strings in your array, including the emoji, resolves to 1. However, it looks like somewhere within the implementation of `padding`, the length of the emoji is resolving to 2. So, `padding` is returning `nil` when you pass an emoji and a `maxLength` of 1.\r\n\r\nHere is some example code to help explain:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(&quot;&#128195;&quot; as String).count // `count` is 1\r\n(&quot;&#128195;&quot; as NSString).length // `length` is 2\r\n\r\n&quot;&#128195;&quot;.padding(toLength: 1, withPad: &quot; &quot;, startingAt: 0) // returns nil\r\n&quot;&#128195;&quot;.padding(toLength: 2, withPad: &quot; &quot;, startingAt: 0) // returns &quot;&#128195;&quot;\r\n&quot;&#128195;&quot;.padding(toLength: 3, withPad: &quot; &quot;, startingAt: 0) // return &quot;&#128195; &quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, this is a bit suspicious and does seem like a bug on Apple&#39;s part. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, calculating `maxLength` using `max(maxLength, (s as NSString).length))` or even simply ensuring that `maxLength` is greater than 1 for any array that contains an emoji should fix the crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.objc.io/blog/2017/12/19/decomposing-emoji/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294578/fatal-error-insufficient-space-allocated-to-copy-string-contents-ios-13-emoji/58295593#58295593","title":"Fatal error: Insufficient space allocated to copy string contents (iOS 13) Emoji"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6465,"user_id":3050403,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001232064133/picture?type=large","display_name":"kelin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3050403/kelin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571299923,"creation_date":1571299923,"answer_id":58427848,"question_id":58294578,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58427848","body_markdown":"**Workaround:**  \r\nAs we all agree - it&#39;s a system bug. The easies workaround will be to change `maxLength` calculation replacing `s.count` with `s.utf16.count`:\r\n    \r\n    let maxLength = fieldStrings.reduce(0) { (maxLength, s) in max(maxLength, s.utf16.count) }\r\n\r\nThe crash is caused by `padding(toLength:withPad:startingAt:)` when the `toLength` is less than the length of the corresponding `NSString`. `NSString.length` is implied here because the `padding()` is a part of Foundation. The `utf16.count` equals to the `length` of the corresponding `NSString`. Although the problem hides inside the `padding()` func, somehow it silently returns an invalid string and later the crash appears on `+` operation.

I noticed that two points (besides string appending itself) are essential here:\r\n\r\n 1. &#128195;emoji symbol &quot;page with curl&quot; - U+1F4C3\r\n 2. `padding(toLength:withPad)`\r\n\r\nThe crash also repeats with other emojis. \r\n  \r\nI don&#39;t think [this][1] question is a duplicate, because my case doesn&#39;t involve any multithreading or database. So, please, don&#39;t mark.\r\n  \r\nThis seems to me as a bug and I&#39;ll report it to Apple, but for now we need to find a workaround.\r\n   \r\nSwift 5.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58143558/insufficient-space-allocated-to-copy-array-contents","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294578/fatal-error-insufficient-space-allocated-to-copy-string-contents-ios-13-emoji","title":"Fatal error: Insufficient space allocated to copy string contents (iOS 13) Emoji"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","sftp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57561,"user_id":1832058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/relWs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"furas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832058/furas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570578638,"post_id":58294576,"comment_id":102954259,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294576/how-to-put-file-to-sftp-server-using-hostkey-in-python#comment102954259_58294576"},{"owner":{"reputation":1670,"user_id":6043544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fafb6acf4f4504b54e7484bc0c17cc7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6043544/oleg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":57561,"user_id":1832058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/relWs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"furas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832058/furas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570578709,"post_id":58294576,"comment_id":102954266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294576/how-to-put-file-to-sftp-server-using-hostkey-in-python#comment102954266_58294576"},{"owner":{"reputation":104685,"user_id":850848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c287735beca76400cb9b6d08bf591cb9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martin Prikryl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/850848/martin-prikryl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570598812,"post_id":58294576,"comment_id":102957899,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294576/how-to-put-file-to-sftp-server-using-hostkey-in-python#comment102957899_58294576"},{"owner":{"reputation":1670,"user_id":6043544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fafb6acf4f4504b54e7484bc0c17cc7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6043544/oleg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570642160,"post_id":58294576,"comment_id":102980222,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294576/how-to-put-file-to-sftp-server-using-hostkey-in-python#comment102980222_58294576"},{"owner":{"reputation":104685,"user_id":850848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c287735beca76400cb9b6d08bf591cb9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martin Prikryl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/850848/martin-prikryl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570650094,"post_id":58294576,"comment_id":102983732,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294576/how-to-put-file-to-sftp-server-using-hostkey-in-python#comment102983732_58294576"}],"owner":{"reputation":1670,"user_id":6043544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fafb6acf4f4504b54e7484bc0c17cc7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6043544/oleg"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571031353,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570571971,"creation_date":1570571971,"question_id":58294576,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294576","body_markdown":"I found bunch of information about how put file if you DON&#39;T have a hostkey, \r\n\r\nBut couldn&#39;t find anything about How to put file on SFTP server having a hostkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I have my hostkey .

At the bare minimum you need to use `.xlf` files as your translation file format.\r\n\r\nI think that this is best illustrated with an example, so lets say you wanted to get the [sample project][1] working **after you had deleted the i18n folder**\r\n\r\n - Step 1: Clone that project, and delete the i18n directory\r\n - Step 2: Modify the [gulp file][2] so that the `compile` function also generates nls metadata files in the `out` directory. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    function compile(buildNls) {\r\n    \tvar r = tsProject.src()\r\n    \t.pipe(sourcemaps.init())\r\n    \t\t.pipe(tsProject()).js\r\n    \t\t.pipe(buildNls ? nls.rewriteLocalizeCalls() : es.through())\r\n    \t\t.pipe(buildNls ? nls.createAdditionalLanguageFiles(languages, &#39;i18n&#39;, &#39;out&#39;) : es.through())\r\n    \t\t.pipe(buildNls ? nls.bundleMetaDataFiles(&#39;ms-vscode.node-debug2&#39;, &#39;out&#39;) : es.through())\r\n            .pipe(buildNls ? nls.bundleLanguageFiles() : es.through())\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Step 3: Run the `gulp build` command. This will generate several necessary metadata files in the `out/` directory\r\n - Step 4: Create and run a new gulp function to export the necessarry translations to the xlf file. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;export-i18n&#39;, function() {\r\n    \treturn gulp.src([&#39;package.nls.json&#39;, &#39;out/nls.metadata.header.json&#39;, &#39;out/nls.metadata.json&#39;])\r\n    \t\t.pipe(nls.createXlfFiles(&quot;vscode-extensions&quot;, &quot;node-js-debug2&quot;))\r\n    \t\t.pipe(gulp.dest(path.join(&#39;vscode-translations-export&#39;)));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Step 5: Get the resulting xlf file translated. Or, add some dummy values. I cant find if/where there is documentation for the file format needed, but this worked for me (for the extension):\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;xliff version=&quot;1.2&quot; xmlns=&quot;urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;file original=&quot;package&quot; source-language=&quot;en&quot; target-language=&quot;ja&quot; datatype=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;body&gt;\r\n        &lt;trans-unit id=&quot;extension.sayHello.title&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;source xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/source&gt;\r\n          &lt;target&gt;JA_Hello&lt;/target&gt;\r\n        &lt;/trans-unit&gt;\r\n        &lt;trans-unit id=&quot;extension.sayBye.title&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;source xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Bye&lt;/source&gt;\r\n          &lt;target&gt;JA_Bye&lt;/target&gt;\r\n        &lt;/trans-unit&gt;\r\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/file&gt;\r\n      &lt;file original=&quot;out/extension&quot; source-language=&quot;en&quot; target-language=&quot;ja&quot; datatype=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;body&gt;\r\n        &lt;trans-unit id=&quot;sayHello.text&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;source xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/source&gt;\r\n          &lt;target&gt;JA_Hello&lt;/target&gt;\r\n        &lt;/trans-unit&gt;\r\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/file&gt;\r\n      &lt;file original=&quot;out/command/sayBye&quot; source-language=&quot;en&quot; target-language=&quot;ja&quot; datatype=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;body&gt;\r\n        &lt;trans-unit id=&quot;sayBye.text&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;source xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Bye&lt;/source&gt;\r\n          &lt;target&gt;JA_Bye&lt;/target&gt;\r\n        &lt;/trans-unit&gt;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/file&gt;\r\n    &lt;/xliff&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Step 6: Stick that file in some known location, let&#39;s say `/path/to/translation.xlf`. Then add/run another new gulp task to import the translation. Something like:\r\n```\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;i18n-import&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n    \treturn es.merge(languages.map(language =&gt; {\r\n    \t\tconsole.log(language.folderName)\r\n    \t\treturn gulp.src([&quot;/path/to/translation.xlf&quot;])\r\n    \t\t\t.pipe(nls.prepareJsonFiles())\r\n    \t\t\t.pipe(gulp.dest(path.join(&#39;./i18n&#39;, language.folderName)));\r\n    \t}));\r\n    });\r\n\r\n```\r\n - Step 7: Run the `gulp build` again.\r\n\r\nThe `i18n/` directory should now be recreated correctly!

These devices all have some base line functionality, but they can also have 0 or more &quot;capabilities&quot; (beyond their basic functionality).\r\n\r\nRight now, there are something like 30+ &quot;other&quot; capabilities these devices &quot;might&quot; have\r\n\r\nFurther, to complicate the issue, the implementation of the capabilities on one device isn&#39;t the same on a different device (the world just doesn&#39;t work that way &#129320;)\r\n\r\n# The problem\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to design a API solution which will allow me to more easily manage this diverse range of functionality.\r\n\r\nMy initial attempt was to create a `protocol` for each capability and then conform each implementation of the device to these `protocol`s.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this is a mess.  As many of the capabilities aren&#39;t known until runtime and I&#39;d need to create a class for each possible combination of capabilities, which isn&#39;t workable.\r\n\r\nAlso, in order for the App to determine if the device has a capability, I need to use `if instance is capable` and `if let capability = instance as? Capability`, every where, which isn&#39;t always pretty or always practical.\r\n\r\nSome capabilities are mutable and the above just causes no end of compiler warnings.\r\n\r\nThere are other short comings as well, which require me to compromise the design, for example, to reduce the number of actual classes, I&#39;ve had to put in &quot;does support&quot; options on many of the capabilities, as the instance of a device &quot;might&quot; support the capability, but isn&#39;t know until I interragate the device at runtime.\r\n\r\n# &quot;A&quot; solution\r\n\r\nI then thought, what I&#39;d really like to do, is isolate the functionality of the capabilities into their own entities, seperate from the baseline devices themselves, so I can &quot;ask&quot; the device for an instance of the capability, and if it was capable of supporting it, it would return an instance, otherwise, it would return `nil`\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n    if let capability = device.capability(for: Capabilities.toggableSetting) {...}\r\n\r\nThe desire would be to use an `enum` to represent the supported capabilities, as this becomes self documenting, self validating, is readable and easily understood.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I came up with a really quick idea that looked something like\r\n\r\n\r\n    protocol Capability { }\r\n    \r\n    protocol ToggableSetting: Capability {\r\n    \tfunc set(value: String) //{}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    enum Capabilities {\r\n    \tcase toggableSetting\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    protocol Device {\r\n    \tfunc capability&lt;T: Capability&gt;(for capability: Capabilities) -&gt; T?\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class SomeImplementationOfToggableSetting: ToggableSetting {\r\n\t    func set(value: String) {\r\n    \t\t// NOOP\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class SomeDevice: Device {\r\n    \t\r\n    \tlet toggableSetting = SomeImplementationOfToggableSetting()\r\n    \t\r\n    \tfunc capability&lt;T&gt;(for capability: Capabilities) -&gt; T? where T : Capability {\r\n    \t\tswitch capability {\r\n    \t\tcase .toggableSetting: return toggableSetting as? T\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn nil\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    let test = SomeDevice()\r\n    let ts: ToggableSetting? = test.capability(for: .toggableSetting)\r\n    ts\r\n\r\nAs some of you will immediately see, this won&#39;t work, as it results in\r\n\r\n&gt; Protocol type &#39;ToggableSetting&#39; cannot conform to &#39;Capability&#39; because only concrete types can conform to protocols\r\n\r\nat `let ts: ToggableSetting? = test.capability(for: .toggableSetting)`\r\n\r\nSo, after some reading and research, I then came up with the idea of introducing a &quot;base&quot; class...\r\n\r\n    class AnyToggableSetting: ToggableSetting {\r\n    \tfunc set(value: String) { fatalError(&quot;Not yet implemented&quot;) }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich needs to be implemented...\r\n\r\n\r\n    class SomeImplementationOfToggableSetting: AnyToggableSetting {\r\n    \toverride func set(value: String) {\r\n    \t\t// NOOP\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then I could use it something like...\r\n\r\n    let ts: AnyToggableSetting? = test.capability(for: .toggableSetting)\r\n\r\nOkay, this works, but it&#39;s not as clean as I&#39;d like.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to decouple the implementation and work to the `protocol` as much as possible, so my code says, &quot;I want something that confirms too said `protocol`&quot; and &quot;not something that MUST extend from `AnySomething`&quot;\r\n\r\nThere are other issues with the design I&#39;d like to avoid if possible (properties don&#39;t inherit well for example)\r\n\r\n# The &quot;Question&quot;\r\n\r\nSo,

so much of a problem just a question on python threading. It is my understanding that python threads can not be processed in parallel due to the GIL and all threads are run concurrently on the same CPU core. I wanted to see if a IO heavy multithreading program I wrote was becoming CPU bound so  I wrote some code to test this, however, I got some results that is inconsistent with my understanding of python threads. It seems that when I start multithreading it increases CPU memory usage across all cores, which was contrary to what I expected. Does this mean that CPU1, for example, is offloading some other background tasks to the other cores since it has an increased load from the multithreading program or is there some parallelism in multithreading that I was unaware of ? or is the psutils module not suited for this analysis and the data I have is not accurate ?\r\n\r\nI have a multithreading program to download many different files where threads will spawn sub-threads. The program code is not really important so I will give the code I used to monitor the CPU memory usage per core. \r\n\r\nYou start the monitor thread prior to starting the main programs threads. The inputs are a threading.Event() (to kill monitor thread) and a max_time for timeouts. I also showed how to call it in the Example_thread class.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom threading import Thread\r\nimport psutil\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport psutil\r\n\r\nclass Example_thread(Thread):\r\n     def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n     \r\n     def run(self):\r\n        mon_event=threading.Event()\r\n        mon=monitor(mon_event,(exp_time + 12))\r\n        mon.start()\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        Insert desired code \r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        mem_usage={}\r\n        mon_event.set()\r\n        mem_usage=mon.evaluate()\r\n        return(mem_usage)\r\n\r\nclass monitor(Thread):\r\n    def __init__(self,event,max_time):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.event=event\r\n        self.mem_usage_dict={}\r\n        self.initial=time.time()\r\n        self.max_time=max_time\r\n        self.mem_usage_dict={&#39;time&#39;:[],&#39;CPU1&#39;:[],&#39;CPU2&#39;:[],&#39;CPU3&#39;:[],&#39;CPU4&#39;:[]}\r\n    \r\n    def run(self):\r\n        while not self.event.isSet():\r\n            ls=(psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True))\r\n            self.point=time.time()\r\n            self.mem_usage_dict[&#39;CPU1&#39;].append(ls[0])\r\n            self.mem_usage_dict[&#39;CPU2&#39;].append(ls[1])\r\n            self.mem_usage_dict[&#39;CPU3&#39;].append(ls[2])\r\n            self.mem_usage_dict[&#39;CPU4&#39;].append(ls[3])\r\n            self.mem_usage_dict[&#39;time&#39;].append(self.point-self.initial)\r\n            if (self.point-self.initial)&gt;self.max_time:\r\n                break\r\n            time.sleep(7)\r\n        print(&#39;Finished monitor&#39;)\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    def evaluate(self):\r\n        print(self.mem_usage_dict)\r\n        #can plot here if needed...\r\n        fig=plt.figure()\r\n        ax=fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\r\n        for key in self.mem_usage_dict.keys():\r\n            if key != &#39;time&#39;:\r\n                ax.plot(self.mem_usage_dict[&#39;time&#39;],self.mem_usage_dict[key],label=key)\r\n        ax.legend()\r\n        fig.show()\r\n        return (self.mem_usage_dict)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected to only see the memory usage for CPU1 (i.e. core 1) since the threads should only be able to run concurrently but instead I saw all the cores increase. In the plot below x-axis is time and y-axis is CPU memory usage in percent and CPU1-4 are each of the cores.\r\n\r\n![plot][1]\r\n[1]&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/KiRRNQn&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KiRRNQn.png&quot; title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294521/concurency-vs-parallelism-in-python-multithreading","title":"Concurency vs Parallelism in python multithreading?"},{"tags":["git","npm"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3466,"user_id":957186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTIlv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"klewis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/957186/klewis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570577293,"post_id":58294621,"comment_id":102954003,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294518/how-to-properly-update-mem-package-within-package-lock-json-file/58294621#comment102954003_58294621"},{"owner":{"reputation":3466,"user_id":957186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTIlv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"klewis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/957186/klewis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570584043,"post_id":58294621,"comment_id":102955237,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294518/how-to-properly-update-mem-package-within-package-lock-json-file/58294621#comment102955237_58294621"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":643,"user_id":10588376,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2jgpj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MarvinJWendt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10588376/marvinjwendt"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570572320,"creation_date":1570572320,"answer_id":58294621,"question_id":58294518,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58294621","body_markdown":"You have to be careful, some of your dependencies are using this package.

It could break more than it fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-automated-security-fixes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294518/how-to-properly-update-mem-package-within-package-lock-json-file/58294621#58294621","title":"How to properly update mem package within package-lock.json file"}],"owner":{"reputation":3466,"user_id":957186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTIlv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"klewis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/957186/klewis"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58294621,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570572320,"creation_date":1570571500,"question_id":58294518,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294518","body_markdown":"I&#39;m running npm version 6.1.0  There is is a package called mem within my package-lock.json file, which is not a part of my package.json file.

This is discouraged. quickFIX/n should deal with this when you set ResetSeqNum=Y in the settings (you already have that setting).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294513/quickfix-n-custom-fields-inside-logon/58294638#58294638","title":"QuickFix/n - Custom fields inside Logon"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11803463,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MMXghOz2sEs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfLm66fVhjMLIVHKxlFTO9lQygIuQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pablo Fernandes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11803463/pablo-fernandes"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58294638,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570573087,"creation_date":1570571490,"question_id":58294513,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294513","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create an initiator based on QuickFix/n.\r\nMy counterpart (server) demand the logon message to carry two custom fields.I already added those to the Data Dictionary, in the Fields as well as in the Logon message.\r\nIn the code i can manipulate the message to add the username and password, but i can&#39;t find how to load custom fields.\r\n\r\nHere are some excerpts from what i&#39;ve done so far:\r\n\r\n*TradeClientApp.cs*\r\n\r\n```...```\r\n```\r\npublic void ToAdmin(Message message, SessionID sessionID)\r\n        {\r\n            QuickFix.SessionSettings settings = new QuickFix.SessionSettings(&quot;./initiator.cfg&quot;);\r\n            List&lt;SessionID&gt;

I trust you translate, though.\r\n\r\n\t\tString articleList5PublishedAt = &quot;2019-10-09T09:02:00Z&quot;;\r\n\t\tInstant timelinePoint = Instant.parse(articleList5PublishedAt);\r\n\t\tInstant now = Instant.now();\r\n\t\tDuration elapsedTime = Duration.between(timelinePoint, now);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(timelinePoint);\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(now);\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(elapsedTime.toMinutes());\r\n\r\nWhen I ran this code just now, the output was:\r\n\r\n&gt;     2019-10-09T09:02:00Z\r\n&gt;     2019-10-09T13:17:01.291404Z\r\n&gt;     255\r\n\r\nFor a point on the timeline the `Instant` class is the right one to use. `LocalDateTime` cannot define a point on the timeline. Also the string from your JSON response, `2019-10-09T09:02:00Z`, parses directly into an `Instant`, so in this way everything fits nicely together.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294478/java-time-format-datetimeparseexception-text-09-10-2019-could-not-be-parsed-a/58305083#58305083","title":"java.time.format.DateTimeParseException: Text &#39;09/10/2019&#39; could not be parsed at index 0 could not be parsed, unparsed text found at index 19"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12183825,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aa12d59d98a7ab4fa6d9540625389d35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sashabeliy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12183825/sashabeliy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":119,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58302799,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570627081,"creation_date":1570571204,"last_edit_date":1570617031,"question_id":58294478,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294478","body_markdown":"I am developing news app and I have converted elapsed time from now to that date but when I run code I am getting following exception in my adapter class\r\n\r\njava.time.format.DateTimeParseException: Text &#39;09/10/2019&#39; could not be parsed at index 0 could not be parsed, unparsed text found at index 19\r\n\r\nbelow my Adapter class\r\n```java\r\n@Suppress(&quot;NULLABILITY_MISMATCH_BASED_ON_JAVA_ANNOTATIONS&quot;)\r\nclass TopHeadlinesAdapter(val context: Context) : RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;TopHeadlinesAdapter.MyViewHolder&gt;() {\r\n\r\n    var articleList : List&lt;Article&gt; = listOf()\r\n\r\n    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): MyViewHolder {\r\n\r\n        val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context).inflate(R.layout.news_list,parent,false)\r\n        return MyViewHolder(view)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    override fun getItemCount(): Int {\r\n        return articleList.size\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @SuppressLint(&quot;NewApi&quot;)\r\n    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: MyViewHolder, position: Int) {\r\n\r\n        holder.articleTitle.text = articleList.get(position).title\r\n        holder.articleSourceName.text = articleList.get(position).source.name\r\n        Picasso.get().load(articleList.get(position).urlToImage).into(holder.image)\r\n\r\n        val input = SimpleDateFormat(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd&#39;T&#39;HH:mm:ssX&quot;)\r\n        val output = SimpleDateFormat(&quot;dd/MM/yyyy&quot;)\r\n        var d = Date()\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            d = input.parse(articleList[5].publishedAt)\r\n        }\r\n        catch (e: ParseException) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace()\r\n        }\r\n        val formatted = output.format(d)\r\n        val timelinePoint = LocalDateTime.parse(formatted)\r\n        val now = LocalDateTime.now()\r\n\r\n        var elapsedTime = Duration.between(timelinePoint, now)\r\n\r\n        println(timelinePoint)\r\n        println(now)\r\n        elapsedTime.toMinutes()\r\n\r\n        holder.articleTime.text = &quot;${elapsedTime.toMinutes()}&quot;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fun setMovieListItems(articleList: List&lt;Article&gt;){\r\n        this.articleList = articleList\r\n        notifyDataSetChanged()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @SuppressLint(&quot;NewApi&quot;)\r\n    fun example( ) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class MyViewHolder(itemView: View?) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView!!) {\r\n\r\n        val image: ImageView = itemView!!.findViewById(R.id.imageView)\r\n        val articleTitle: TextView = itemView!!.findViewById(R.id.articleTitle)\r\n        val articleSourceName: TextView = itemView!!.findViewById(R.id.articleSourceName)\r\n        val imageCategory: ImageView = itemView!!.findViewById(R.id.imageCategory)\r\n        val articleTime: TextView = itemView!!.findViewById(R.id.articleTime)\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBelow is the JSON response:\r\n\r\n    &gt; {\r\n    &gt;     &quot;status&quot;: &quot;ok&quot;,\r\n    &gt;     &quot;totalResults&quot;: 38,\r\n    &gt;     &quot;articles&quot;: [\r\n    &gt;         {\r\n    &gt;             &quot;source&quot;: {\r\n    &gt;                 &quot;id&quot;: &quot;cnn&quot;,\r\n    &gt;                 &quot;name&quot;: &quot;CNN&quot;\r\n    &gt;             },\r\n    &gt;             &quot;author&quot;: null,\r\n    &gt;             &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The latest on the Trump impeachment inquiry: Live updates - CNN&quot;,\r\n    &gt;             &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The House is moving forward with its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

It is a site in which somebody will sell vehicles, either **cars** or **bikes**.\r\n\r\nHere the **Car** class:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Car {\r\n    private VehicleType vehicleType = VehicleType.CAR;\r\n    private String brand;               // Marque\r\n    private String model;               // Mod&#232;le\r\n    private int year;                   // Ann&#233;e\r\n    private VehicleState vehicleState;  // Etat du v&#233;hicule\r\n    private boolean isElectric;\r\n\r\n    private int kms;                    // Kilom&#233;trage\r\n    private GearBoxType gearBoxType;    // Bo&#238;te de vitesse\r\n    private FuelType fuelType;          // Type de carburant -- (ELECTRIC included)\r\n    private int powerCV;                // Unit: &quot;chevaux&quot;\r\n    private int cylinderL;              // Unit: liters\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd here is the **Bike** class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Bike {\r\n    private VehicleType vehicleType = VehicleType.BICYCLE;\r\n    private VehicleState vehicleState;  // Etat du v&#233;hicule\r\n    private String brand;               // Marque\r\n    private String model;               // Mod&#232;le\r\n    private int year;                   // Ann&#233;e\r\n    private boolean isElectric;\r\n\r\n    private int gearsNumber; // nombre de vitesses\r\n    private int traysNumber; // nombre de plateaux\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is the root, the `Ad` class\r\n```java\r\n@Document\r\npublic class Ad {\r\n    @Id\r\n    private String id;\r\n    private String title;\r\n    private String description;\r\n    private Date publicationDate;\r\n    private int price; // CHF\r\n\r\n    private Car|Bike vehicle; // &lt;----- I know this is not possible but it is the behaviour I want\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(In this example, there is only two types of vehicles but in real there are more).\r\n\r\nI thought maybe I could create an interface which extends **Car** and **Bike** class, but it is not a good idea because those classes will not have the same methods. For example **Bike** will not use `getFuelType()`.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I though about was to create different `Ad` for each type of vehicle, like `CarAd` and `BikeAd` which would respectively have only the vehicle that changes... And I find that very repetitive.\r\n\r\nI also though about creating a lot of abstract classes like **Vehicle** that would extend **MotorVehicle** that would extend **Car**, for example, but there would be a lot of classes for nothing... I also though about using the *decorator design pattern*, but then I thougt it would be too much inconsistent.\r\n\r\n# Is there a way to achieve what I want to do easily ?\r\n\r\n## Edit 1\r\nFor the moment I&#39;m doing it like that:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Document\r\npublic class Ad {\r\n    @Id\r\n    private String id;\r\n    private String title;\r\n    private String description;\r\n    private Date publicationDate;\r\n    private int priceCHF; // CHF\r\n\r\n    // Only one of them can exist others must be null\r\n    private Car car;\r\n    private TwoWheelers twoWheelers;\r\n    private Bike bike;\r\n\r\n    public Ad(String id, String title, String description, int priceCHF, Car car, TwoWheelers twoWheelers, Bike bike) throws Exception {\r\n        this.id = id;\r\n        this.title = title;\r\n        this.description = description;\r\n        this.priceCHF = priceCHF;\r\n        this.car = car;\r\n        this.twoWheelers = twoWheelers;\r\n        this.bike = bike;\r\n\r\n        checkConsistency();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Check whether only one type of vehicle is given\r\n     * @throws Exception\r\n     */\r\n    private void checkConsistency() throws Exception {\r\n        int counter = 0;\r\n        if (car != null) ++counter;\r\n        if (twoWheelers != null) ++counter;\r\n        if (bike != null) ++counter;\r\n\r\n        if (counter == 0) throw new Exception(&quot;Must have one vehicle in the ad, zero given&quot;);\r\n        if (counter &gt; 1) throw new Exception(&quot;Must have one vehicle in the ad, &quot; + counter + &quot; given&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomebody can tell me if it is a &quot;good&quot; way to do it ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294475/mongodb-can-i-have-a-subdocument-accepting-2-classes","title":"MongoDB: Can I have a subdocument &quot;accepting&quot; 2 classes?"},{"tags":["asp.net-core","iis"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20900,"user_id":3728901,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IT99v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Do Nhu Vy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3728901/do-nhu-vy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570584899,"post_id":58294473,"comment_id":102955388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294473/how-to-tell-when-a-self-hosted-asp-net-core-application-is-ready-to-receive-requ#comment102955388_58294473"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12688,"user_id":6265620,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uf6qO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tao Zhou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6265620/tao-zhou"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570587168,"creation_date":1570587168,"answer_id":58296153,"question_id":58294473,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58296153","body_markdown":"In general, after the application is started successfully, you will be able to send request.\r\n\r\nFor Application Start event, you could try `IHostApplicationLifetime` in .net core 3.0, if you are using previous version, you could try `IApplicationLifetime` which will be obsolete in future version.\r\n\r\nHere is a demo which is used to register event while application is started.\r\n\r\n    public class Startup\r\n    {\r\n        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)\r\n        {\r\n            Configuration = configuration;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }\r\n\r\n        // This method gets called by the runtime.

Conceptually, I understand the divide function however I believe that I am not implementing it correctly. I am supposed to be copying pairs of elements from the origDeck.cards to a left deck and a right deck using memcpy, so for example if the original deck was [1 2 3] the left deck could be [1] and the right deck could be [2 3], but I must account for every possible combination. Somebody else informed me that the leftDeck should be copying from 0-i, and the rightDeck from i+1, however I am unsure about how to implement that and and wondering if I am accomplishing my goal correctly. Additionally, the shuffle function is supposed to create the pointers used in divide and allocate memory for them, however I am not sure if I am doing this correctly either.

In other words, I do not want to restore comments that were soft-deleted by moderators. I want to restore the comments that were soft-deleted the very moment I soft-deleted the post.\r\n\r\nReason why it fails: I believe it fails with ```restored()``` because ```$post-&gt;deleted_at``` becomes ```null``` so I cannot use it in my ```where(...)``` condition anymore.\r\n\r\nQuestion: how do I hold the previous value of ```$post-&gt;deleted_at```, right before it was restored? I tried playing with ```getDirty()``` and ```getChanges()``` but these did not help, they hold no track of previous value in the observer.\r\n\r\nI also tried the following : \r\n```php\r\npublic function restoring(Post $post)\r\n{\r\n    $this-&gt;deleted_at = $post-&gt;deleted_at;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthinking it would allow me to &#39;persist&#39; the value of ```$post-&gt;deleted_at``` and be able to use it in my ```restored()``` method. But no. \r\n\r\nI noticed ```restored()``` only restores the first comment. It&#39;s like once a comment is restored, within a kind of loop, then ```$post-&gt;deleted_at``` because ```null``` (obviously, since it&#39;s ```restored``` and not ```restoring```) so it cannot continue restoring the other comments in the Collection. I think it throws the error because I guess the loop is then trying to do like ```where(&#39;deleted_at&#39;, &#39;&gt;=&#39;, null)``` (notice the ```null``)`.\r\nSure enough, this does works : \r\n```\r\npublic function restored(Post $post)\r\n{\r\n    $post-&gt;comments()\r\n        -&gt;onlyTrashed()\r\n        -&gt;get()\r\n        -&gt;each(function ($comment) {\r\n            $comment-&gt;restore();\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(please note this is ```restored()``` but I had to get rid of my ```where(...)```, but I DO need that ```where(...)``` condition).\r\n\r\nBasically and ***TL;DR*** : how can I get the &#39;old&#39; value of ```$post-&gt;deleted_at``` (the value right before it was restored), within my ```public function restoring(Post $post) { }``` \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294450/model-observers-restored-and-restoring","title":"Model observers : restored() and restoring()"},{"tags":["python","django","ajax","django-forms"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":158,"user_id":10303173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d06a483a3177651fdd09073a17d5a53?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10303173/martins"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570573369,"post_id":58294449,"comment_id":102953274,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294449/perform-some-calculations-using-django-form-which-framework#comment102953274_58294449"},{"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":5317267,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wRS7IzQtFiU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI4/u32JEBMJWQY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abhyudai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5317267/abhyudai"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570575720,"post_id":58294449,"comment_id":102953740,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294449/perform-some-calculations-using-django-form-which-framework#comment102953740_58294449"}],"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":1448859,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abe64d526c67a451a69a6ace664dca0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ste4lth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1448859/ste4lth"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570570986,"creation_date":1570570986,"question_id":58294449,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294449","body_markdown":"I have an input form with couple of input fields mostly numerical.

Listed below is my C program. The program is set-up for the user to input three variables: x0, x1 and x. Where, x0 and x1 are the lower and upper parameter boundaries, respectively (ranging from 0-1). The x variable is the user-input variable (ranging from 0-1). The x variable is then passed through multiple conditions, and based on the condition met a different membership function is used. \r\n\r\nI am not experiencing an error message, but the conditional statements are incorrect because all printf statements are outputted.

Since unrestricted access is not available  in browsers, this example dummies the `readFile` method mentioned in the book:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function readFile( filePath) { // dummied example\r\n      let fileContent =\r\n    \t` \r\n    \tvar days = [&quot;monday&quot;, &quot;tuesday&quot;, &quot;wednesday&quot;, &quot;thursday&quot;];\r\n    \texports.name = function(number) {\r\n    \t\treturn days[number];\r\n    \t};\r\n\r\n    \texports.number = function(name) {\r\n    \t\treturn days.indexOf(name);\r\n    \t};\r\n    \t`;\r\n    \treturn fileContent;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function require(InterFaceFile) { // from netbeans\r\n        // create a new function with first parameter named &quot;exports&quot;:\r\n        var code = new Function(&quot;exports&quot;, readFile(InterFaceFile));\r\n        var exports = {};\r\n        code(exports);\r\n        return exports;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // usage example\r\n\r\n    var weekdays = require(&quot;newjavascript.js&quot;); // create and save exports\r\n    console.log( weekdays.name( 1));\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\n *  The book (or netbeans) presents a simple implementation of `require` - node&#39;s `require` method has additional features such as calling the body code with the `exports` object as its `this` value.\r\n *  The two lines shown after the `require` function declaration in the post\r\n\r\n        console.log(weekDay.name(1));\r\n        output: &quot;weekDay.name is not a function&quot;\r\n    \r\n    are out of place and should be removed.\r\n\r\n *  In these examples `weekDay` is a variable name used to save the exports object returned by `require`, or in the case of the anonymous function, a window property name used as a variable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294389/cant-use-require-to-load-a-module/58296526#58296526","title":"Can&#39;t use &quot;require&quot; to load a module"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11098646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b2aa52f282961e0a0c370ffbfd099f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"evanr123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11098646/evanr123"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11098646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b2aa52f282961e0a0c370ffbfd099f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"evanr123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11098646/evanr123"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570590548,"creation_date":1570570589,"last_edit_date":1570576532,"question_id":58294389,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58294389","body_markdown":"I am not able to successfully use &quot;require&quot; to load a module.

That said, based on manual testing I&#39;ve done it does seem that the app will be notified of a change to `authorizedAlways` status after a user hits the initial `requestAlwaysAuthorization` prompt with `Allow While Using App`. Then when the user backgrounds the app for a little while they are reprompted with two options, `Keep Only While Using` or `Change to Always Allow`. The app seems to only get notified of an authorization status change if the user proceeds with `Keep Only While Using` selection (and the app is notified of a change to `authorizedWhenInUse`.)\r\n\r\nI had a hypothesis that there might be some weird state between the user being prompted for the background use (or the OS determining a prompt is required) and the user actually responding to the prompt, but my testing has pretty consistently shown that in that state the app is simply not receiving any location updates.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve hit a wall on troubleshooting this and am hoping its just an iOS 13 bug but I&#39;ve yet to hear of any other apps experiencing this issue. Would greatly appreciate any suggestions on further troubleshooting ideas or simply that your app has experienced this issue as well so I can stop banging my head on it!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58294372/why-is-ios-13-core-location-sometimes-returning-locations-with-coordinate-0-0-in","title":"Why is iOS 13 Core Location sometimes returning
