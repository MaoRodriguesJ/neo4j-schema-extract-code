Index signatures mean a few things, and they mean slightly different things depending where and how you ask.\r\n\r\nFirst, index signatures imply that *all declared properties in the type must have a compatible type*.\r\n\r\n    interface NotLegal {\r\n        // Error, &#39;string&#39; isn&#39;t assignable to &#39;number&#39;\r\n        x: string;\r\n        [key: string]: number;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is a definitional aspect of index signatures -- that they describe an object with different property keys, but a consistent type across all those keys. This rule prevents an incorrect type from being observed when a property is accessed through an indirection:\r\n\r\n    function fn(obj: NotLegal) {\r\n        // &#39;n&#39; would have a &#39;string&#39; value\r\n        const n: number = obj[String.fromCharCode(120)];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSecond, index signatures *allow writing to any index with a compatible type*.\r\n\r\n    interface NameMap {\r\n        [name: string]: number;\r\n    }\r\n    function setAge(ageLookup: NameMap, name: string, age: number) {\r\n        ageLookup[name] = age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is a key use case for index signatures: You have some set of keys and you want to store a value associated with the key.\r\n\r\nThird, index signatures *imply the existence* of any property you *specifically* ask for:\r\n\r\n    interface NameMap {\r\n        [name: string]: number;\r\n    }\r\n    function getMyAge(ageLookup: NameMap) {\r\n        // Inferred return type is &#39;number&#39;\r\n        return ageLookup[&quot;RyanC&quot;];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBecause `x[&quot;p&quot;]` and `x.p` have identical behavior in JavaScript, TypeScript treats them equivalently:\r\n\r\n    // Equivalent\r\n    function getMyAge(ageLookup: NameMap) {\r\n        return ageLookup.RyanC;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with how TypeScript views arrays, which is that array access is assumed to be in-bounds. It&#39;s also ergonomic for index signatures because, very commonly, you have a known set of keys available and don&#39;t need to do any additional checking:\r\n\r\n    interface NameMap {\r\n        [name: string]: number;\r\n    }\r\n    function getAges(ageLookup: NameMap) {\r\n        const ages = [];\r\n        for (const k of Object.keys(ageLookup)) {\r\n            ages.push(ageLookup[k]);\r\n        }\r\n        return ages;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, index signatures *don&#39;t* imply that *any arbitrary, unspecific property* will be present when it comes to relating a type with an index signature to a type with declared properties:\r\n\r\n    interface Point {\r\n        x: number;\r\n        y: number;\r\n    }\r\n    interface NameMap {\r\n        [name: string]: number;\r\n    }\r\n    const m: NameMap = {};\r\n    // Not OK, which is good, because p.x is undefined\r\n    const p: Point = m;\r\n\r\nThis sort of assignment is very unlikely to be correct in practice!\r\n\r\nThis is a distinguishing feature between `{ [k: string]: any }` and `any` itself - you can read and write properties of any kind on an object with an index signature, but it can&#39;t be used in place of any type whatsoever like `any` can.\r\n\r\nEach of these behaviors is individually very justifiable, but taken as a whole, some inconsistencies are observable.\r\n\r\nFor example, these two functions are identical in terms of their runtime behavior, but TypeScript only considers one of them to have been called incorrectly:\r\n\r\n    interface Point {\r\n        x: number;\r\n        y: number;\r\n    }\r\n    interface NameMap {\r\n        [name: string]: number;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function A(x: NameMap) {\r\n        console.log(x.y);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function B(x: Point) {\r\n        console.log(x.y);\r\n    }\r\n    const m: NameMap = { };\r\n    A(m); // OK\r\n    B(m); // Error\r\n\r\nOverall, when you write an index signature on a type, you&#39;re saying:\r\n * It&#39;s OK to read/write this object with an arbitrary key\r\n * When I read a specific property from this object through arbitrary key, it&#39;s always present\r\n * This object doesn&#39;t have *literally every* property name in existence for the purposes of type compatibility","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458308/what-does-a-typescript-index-signature-actually-mean/58458309#58458309","title":"What does a TypeScript index signature actually mean?"}],"owner":{"reputation":117487,"user_id":1704166,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d256baab2fcfd81b0f109d394404fd67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ryan Cavanaugh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1704166/ryan-cavanaugh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":117487,"user_id":1704166,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d256baab2fcfd81b0f109d394404fd67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ryan Cavanaugh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1704166/ryan-cavanaugh"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":275,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571578241,"creation_date":1571433426,"last_edit_date":1571578241,"question_id":58458308,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458308","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been writing TypeScript for a while and am confused about what an index signature means.\r\n\r\nFor example, this code is legal:\r\n\r\n    function fn(obj: { [x: string]: number }) {\r\n        let n: number = x.something;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut this code, which does basically the same thing, isn&#39;t:\r\n\r\n    function fn(obj: { something: number }) {\r\n        let p: { something: number } = x;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs this a bug?

This is more intriguing because this problem did not occur in higher levels of recursion(There are in total some 9 or 10 levels).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458307/vectorpointerinsertiterator-pointer-inserting-garbage-value","title":"vector&lt;pointer&gt;::insert(iterator,pointer) inserting garbage value"},{"tags":["java","nullpointerexception"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7040,"user_id":1255873,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dZChN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Abion47","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255873/abion47"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571433546,"post_id":58458302,"comment_id":103253544,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458302/constructor-throwing-an-npe-when-the-object-isnt-null-java#comment103253544_58458302"},{"owner":{"reputation":315501,"user_id":256196,"user_type":"moderator","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d84b558fd67be10d5a718fb94231909d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bohemian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/256196/bohemian"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571433915,"post_id":58458302,"comment_id":103253654,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458302/constructor-throwing-an-npe-when-the-object-isnt-null-java#comment103253654_58458302"},{"owner":{"reputation":660,"user_id":326242,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35cde28dc376b1403cf4de6cbebc80e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew Koster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/326242/andrew-koster"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571434097,"post_id":58458302,"comment_id":103253710,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458302/constructor-throwing-an-npe-when-the-object-isnt-null-java#comment103253710_58458302"},{"owner":{"reputation":26082,"user_id":981744,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qJi4S.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erwin Bolwidt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/981744/erwin-bolwidt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571434248,"post_id":58458302,"comment_id":103253751,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458302/constructor-throwing-an-npe-when-the-object-isnt-null-java#comment103253751_58458302"},{"owner":{"reputation":91904,"user_id":5221149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4qlq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221149/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571434372,"post_id":58458302,"comment_id":103253781,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458302/constructor-throwing-an-npe-when-the-object-isnt-null-java#comment103253781_58458302"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":91904,"user_id":5221149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4qlq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221149/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571434432,"post_id":58458451,"comment_id":103253795,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458302/constructor-throwing-an-npe-when-the-object-isnt-null-java/58458451#comment103253795_58458451"},{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12240717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCQGDrgPQD4vg3IyZq8y7v3TLAY_9aMdh3uooJWIw=k-s128","display_name":"NoneTaken","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12240717/nonetaken"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571434683,"post_id":58458451,"comment_id":103253860,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458302/constructor-throwing-an-npe-when-the-object-isnt-null-java/58458451#comment103253860_58458451"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":11500538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3adeaabf5bda4675f858a1edffc0701?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ajinkyad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11500538/ajinkyad"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571434251,"creation_date":1571434251,"answer_id":58458451,"question_id":58458302,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58458451","body_markdown":"Please check this line \r\n\r\n    Main.getAuctionManager().registerAuction(this);\r\n\r\nMain.getAuctionManager() is static method?

l:\r\n                newList.append(x-2)\r\n                \r\n    print(newList)\r\n\r\nby the way, i don&#39;t get it way you want to call another python function to run a piece of code. you have functions, use them to make things clear. and in this example you can avoid using the (if idx == 0 .... else ) and try to run the first list in the listOfList first and then use loop for the rest of the listOfList.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458301/return-loop-statements-code-from-external-script/58458641#58458641","title":"Return loop statements (code) from external

am newly encountering this error. I am not sure where it is coming form. I have run this bit of code literally thousands of times and now today for some stupid reason it is failing. I have been looking at this code and I it has not changed in months in addition to this still is the identical code that the VBA Recording tool generates. This is the Error message: [![Error Message][1]][1]\r\n\r\nand this is the bit of code that my program is getting stuck on:\r\n\r\n    Sheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;).Select\r\n    Cells(wHeaders, 1).Select\r\n    Range(Selection, ActiveCell.SpecialCells(xlLastCell)).Select\r\n    Selection.Copy\r\n    Workbooks(CurrWB).Activate\r\n    Sheets(CurrSheet).Select\r\n    Sheets(CurrSheet).Activate\r\n    \r\n    Cells(CurrRow, CurrCol).Select\r\n    ActiveSheet.PasteSpecial Format:=&quot;HTML&quot;, Link:=False, DisplayAsIcon:= _\r\n        False, NoHTMLFormatting:=True     &#39;THIS IS THE LINE WITH THE ERROR\r\n    \r\n    ActiveSheet.Paste\r\n    Selection.EntireColumn.AutoFit\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause there have been no changes and that the code builder is still creating this same line I am very confused. Help would be amazing. Also because I know that you are all going to ask, yes my variables are defined. \r\n\r\n    Dim CurrSheet As Variant\r\n    Dim CurrWB As Variant\r\n    Dim CurrCol As Variant\r\n    Dim CurrRow As Variant\r\n\r\nThere is one last one and that is passed in the `Sub` and that is `Sub CoolProg(Optional wHeaders As Integer = 1)`\r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFGUF.png\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n  I am not sure why this is the case but the error seems to go away when I make the following edit to the line where the debugger goes. \r\n\r\n    Worksheets(CurrSheet).PasteSpecial Format:=&quot;HTML&quot;, Link:=False, DisplayAsIcon:= _\r\n        False &#39;, NoHTMLFormatting:=True\r\n\r\nAll that I did was comment out the NoHTMLFormatting section, can someone help me understand why this works and maybe what is the underlying cause of this error. I want to make sure that I understand this so that I can fix what code I need to. \r\n\r\n**Update #2**\r\n   .... So this error only happens when I have a Google Chrome window open and I am running this code. I closed Chrome and it worked. There was a similar task that relied on this but I know to be VERY Compute heavy and it uses this sub within it and I couldn&#39;t get through it. I checked task manager and saw that chrome was at the top (PS it SUCKS resources) so I killed and and now it works. If someone can explain what is going on that would be amazing. \r\n\r\n**Update#3**\r\n\r\nI added a 2 second pause before the problematic line runs and it seems to solve the issue. I am not sure why this works but it seems that there is a larger resource draw and my machines needs the time for some of the resources to free up so that it will work. If someone has some insight as to why this is a solution that works that would be great.

How can I make it work by passing ICommand as parameter and invoking Execute method?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI just figured out if I remove lambda from EventCallback factory, it works but I don&#39;t know why\r\n\r\n    var onClick = EventCallback.Factory.Create(Receiver, Command.Execute);\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458251/blazor-onclick-from-child-component-does-not-cause-rerender","title":"Blazor onclick from child component does not cause rerender"},{"tags":["python-3.x","flask","mysql-connector-python"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12007744,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b17a0f270038ab1c6dd8d24cea53749?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lux Rodrz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12007744/lux-rodrz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571487744,"post_id":58459105,"comment_id":103262693,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458249/how-to-fix-typeerror-not-supported-between-instances-of-nonetype-and-int/58459105#comment103262693_58459105"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8430155,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/655d1d5c6571635c65c90670361700cf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Harshal Parekh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8430155/harshal-parekh"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571439850,"creation_date":1571439850,"answer_id":58459105,"question_id":58458249,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58459105","body_markdown":"    result = cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s&quot;, [username])\r\n\r\nThis line is causing the problem.

However, I&#39;m interested in the 0x80 bytes they ignore.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFPreface/qtffPreface.html\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_program_stream#Coding_details\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packetized_elementary_stream#PES_packet_header","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458238/how-to-parse-this-apple-specific-mpeg-file-header","title":"How to parse this Apple-specific MPEG file header?"},{"tags":["symfony4","symfony-forms","symfony-validator"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571475065,"post_id":58458235,"comment_id":103259854,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458235/symfony-4-3-5-formbuilder-and-errors-validation-for-update-parent-relation#comment103259854_58458235"},{"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":5260590,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2f89fc5f04467d08d7fb5238d11ee3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pionas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5260590/pionas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571562583,"post_id":58458235,"comment_id":103276455,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458235/symfony-4-3-5-formbuilder-and-errors-validation-for-update-parent-relation#comment103276455_58458235"},{"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571565869,"post_id":58458235,"comment_id":103277156,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458235/symfony-4-3-5-formbuilder-and-errors-validation-for-update-parent-relation#comment103277156_58458235"},{"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":5260590,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2f89fc5f04467d08d7fb5238d11ee3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pionas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5260590/pionas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571603190,"post_id":58458235,"comment_id":103286595,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458235/symfony-4-3-5-formbuilder-and-errors-validation-for-update-parent-relation#comment103286595_58458235"},{"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571637824,"post_id":58458235,"comment_id":103292991,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458235/symfony-4-3-5-formbuilder-and-errors-validation-for-update-parent-relation#comment103292991_58458235"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":5260590,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2f89fc5f04467d08d7fb5238d11ee3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pionas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5260590/pionas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571718534,"creation_date":1571718534,"answer_id":58497091,"question_id":58458235,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58497091","body_markdown":"I found a solution:\r\n\r\n    class VehicleType extends AbstractType {\r\n    \r\n        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options) {\r\n            $builder\r\n                    -&gt;add(&#39;name&#39;)\r\n                    -&gt;add(&#39;user&#39;, EntityType::class, [\r\n                        &#39;class&#39;

have an application object which can receive messages from multiple services running in multiple threads. The message gets dispatched internally by an instance of a dispatcher object *in the threads of the services*. The application can at any time change the current dispatcher. Dispatchers never get destroyed. The services never outlive the application.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example code\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;thread&gt;\r\n#include &lt;atomic&gt;\r\n#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\r\n#include &lt;functional&gt;\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nusing Msg = int;\r\n\r\nstruct Dispatcher\r\n{\r\n    virtual ~Dispatcher() = default;\r\n    virtual void dispatchMessage(Msg msg) = 0;\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct DispatcherA : Dispatcher\r\n{\r\n    void dispatchMessage(Msg msg)\r\n    {\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Thread-safe dispatch of &quot; &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; &quot; by A&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct DispatcherB : Dispatcher\r\n{\r\n    void dispatchMessage(Msg msg)\r\n    {\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Thread-safe dispatch of &quot; &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; &quot; by B&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct Application\r\n{\r\n    Application() : curDispatcher(&amp;a) {}\r\n    void sendMessage(Msg msg)\r\n    {\r\n        // race here as this is called (and dereferenced) from many threads\r\n        // and can be changed by the main thread\r\n        curDispatcher-&gt;dispatchMessage(msg);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void changeDispatcher()\r\n    {\r\n        // race her as this is changed but can be dereferenced by many threads\r\n        if (rand() % 2) curDispatcher = &amp;a;\r\n        else curDispatcher = &amp;b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    atomic_bool running = true;\r\n\r\n    Dispatcher* curDispatcher; // race on this\r\n    DispatcherA a;\r\n    DispatcherB b;\r\n};\r\n\r\nvoid service(Application&amp; app, int i) {\r\n    while (app.running) app.sendMessage(i++);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    Application app;\r\n    std::thread t1(std::bind(service, std::ref(app), 1));\r\n    std::thread t2(std::bind(service, std::ref(app), 20));\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; ++i) \r\n    {\r\n        app.changeDispatcher();\r\n    }\r\n    app.running = false;\r\n\r\n    t1.join();\r\n    t2.join();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am aware that there is a race condition here. The `curDispatcher` pointer gets accessed by many threads and it can be changed at the same time by the main thread. It can be fixed by making the pointer atomic and explicitly loading it on every `sendMessage` call.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want to pay the price of the atomic loads.\r\n\r\nCan something bad happen of this?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I can think of:\r\n\r\n * The value of `curDispatcher` can get cached by a service and it can always call the same one, even if the app has changed the value. I&#39;m ok with that. If I stop being ok with that, I can make it volatile. Newly created services should be ok, anyway.\r\n * If this ever runs on a 32-bit CPU which emulates 64-bit, the writes and reads of the pointer will not be instruction-level atomic and it might lead to invalid pointer values and crashes: I am making sure that this only runs on 64-bit CPUs.\r\n * Destroying dispatchers isn&#39;t safe. As I said: I&#39;m never destroying dispatchers.\r\n * ???","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458212/willingly-introducing-a-race-condition-on-a-64-bit-pointer-value","title":"Willingly

On the other hand, if loss_param2 is used, training begins at a much lower loss (around 41).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know why this would be occurring?\r\n\r\n(As an additional note, I am also running into a similar issue where if the metric is as a string I get a different result. However in model.fit, if use_multiprocessing is True the effect is negated (this also applies the other way around).)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458203/tensorflow-keras-sequential-model-trains-differently-if-loss-is-a-string-or-func","title":"TensorFlow Keras Sequential Model Trains

problem lies in the fact that you create a temporary `std::unordered_map` and return a reference to one of its contents. Let&#39;s inspect two behaviours that occur here:\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;1. Range-based for expansion:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom [the question you linked in the comments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30448182/is-it-safe-to-use-a-c11-range-based-for-loop-with-an-rvalue-range-init) we can see that the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    for ( for-range-declaration : expression ) statement\r\n\r\ntranslates directly to the following:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      auto &amp;&amp; __range = range-init;\r\n      for ( auto __begin = begin-expr,\r\n                 __end = end-expr;\r\n            __begin != __end;\r\n            ++__begin ) {\r\n        for-range-declaration = *__begin;\r\n        statement\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe important part is to understand that when you either create a temporary or provide an lvalue, a *reference* to it will be created (`auto&amp;&amp; __range`). If we&#39;re dealing with lvalues, we encouter the results we expect. However, when `range-init` returns a temporary object, things get a little more interesting. We encounter *lifetime extension*.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;2. Lifetime extension:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is way simpler than it may seem. If you return a temporary object to initialize (bind) a reference to it, the *lifetime of said object is extended to match the lifetime of said reference*. That means that if `range-init` returns a temporary, saving a reference to it (`__range`) extends the lifetime of that temporary up to the last curly bracket of the code I copy-pasted above. That&#39;s the reason for those most-outer brackets.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Your case:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nIn your case, we have quite a tricky situation. Inspecting your loop:\r\n\r\n    for (const int i : std::unordered_map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; {{0, std::vector&lt;int&gt; {1}}}.at(0)) {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe must acknowledge two things:\r\n\r\n1. You create a temporary `std::unordered_map`.\r\n2. `range-init` is not referring to your `std::unordered_map`. It refers to what `.at(0)` retuns - a value from that map.\r\n\r\nThis results in the following consequence - the lifetime of your map is **not** extended. That means that its destructor will be called at the end of the full expression (at the `;` from the `auto &amp;&amp; __range = range-init;`). When `std::unordered_map::~unordered_map` is called, it calls destructors of everything it manages - e.g. its keys and values. In other words, that destructor call will call the destructor of the vector you obtained a reference to via the `at(0)` call. Your `__range` is not a dangling reference.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458202/c-undefined-behavior-on-unordered-map-as-an-rvalue-in-a-range-based-for-loop/58458593#58458593","title":"C++ undefined behavior on unordered_map as an rvalue in a range-based for loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":11835453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1SoU6SNfONM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfiqu60nhsCoLsEij_d59cTamEkzQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dominic Abbott","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11835453/dominic-abbott"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12336,"user_id":8950365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c6ba3b19f86f1bea8cf76e691db4349?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rafix07","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8950365/rafix07"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58458593,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571436150,"creation_date":1571432766,"last_edit_date":1571435635,"question_id":58458202,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458202","body_markdown":"I hate to add to the myriad of questions about undefined behavior on stack overflow, but this problem has mystified me.\r\n\r\nWhen using a range-based for loop on an unordered_map that is created inline, I get an unexpected result.

Each receipt may have dozens of lines of items, and there may be hundreds of receipts per day. There may also be multiple stores, each with line items on receipts that are the same item as in other stores. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s our problem: over a 10-month date range (for example, a YTD report) we have 8 million receipt &quot;lines&quot; for a 22-store account. The report retrieves these from the DB and then loops over and &quot;collapses&quot; lines when the item is the same (so it gives a total per unique item for all 22 stores within the date range). We therefore run out of memory on the server (64GB) even before it finishes crunching all the data. When doing it for a smaller subset of stores, the report completes but it is unacceptably slow to load.\r\n\r\nIdeal solution: Is MapReduce what is needed here? How can we get this report to 1) generate on-demand without exceeding memory and 2) complete in a reasonable amount of time (maybe 15 seconds of load time or less?) \r\n\r\nWe&#39;re hosted on AWS and using a m5.4xlarge instance. We are using Play Framework (Java version) with a MySQL database.

If you want &quot;newly added as a new file in this commit&quot;, inspect the commit and its parent(s), perhaps using `git diff-tree` or similar.  Note that an all-new *file* has an all-zero mode in its parent, and a status letter of `A` (added), while a file modified from the its parent has a status letter of `M` (modified) and two nonzero hashes.  A file nominally deleted—a file that existed in the parent, but no longer does in the child—has a status letter of `D` (deleted).  If you enable rename detection, you&#39;ll get `R` status-es and similarity index values; you may want to disable this, or at least force the similarity testing to 100%.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458178/git-get-all-git-object-hashes-of-blobs-added-to-the-repository-by-a-commit/58458589#58458589","title":"GIT: Get all git object hashes of blobs added to the repository by a commit"}],"owner":{"reputation":2718,"user_id":1599926,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65f285be0b24fdd9516fba584de44f7e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel K.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1599926/daniel-k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2718,"user_id":1599926,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65f285be0b24fdd9516fba584de44f7e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel K.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1599926/daniel-k"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58458589,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571439985,"creation_date":1571432627,"last_edit_date":1571439985,"question_id":58458178,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458178","body_markdown":"Is it possible to get a list of all git object hashes of blobs which have been added to the repository by a given commit hash using the git command line tools?\r\n\r\nI already tried archiving this with the git plumbing tool ```git-diff-tree```.

Then I want to visit every commit in this order and collect firstly seen blob hashes on this branch per commit.\r\n\r\nThe end result should be something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:368d64862e6aa2a0110f201c8a5193d929e2956d\r\nB:03f15b592c7d776da37e3d4372c215b14ff8820f\r\nB:4b7f9e6624a66fec0510d76823303017e224c9d7\r\nB:c332b1e576af0dbb93cc875106bc06c3de6b74c8\r\nC:5521a02ce1bc4f147d0fa39a178512476764dd66 \r\nB:e5fa44f2b31c1fb553b6021e7360d07d5d91ff5e\r\nB:adc83b19e793491b1c6ea0fd8b46cd9f32e592fc\r\nC:a3db5c13ff90a36963278c6a39e4ee3c22e2a436\r\nB:4888920a568af4ef2d2f4866e75b4061112a39ea\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```C:``` commit\r\n```B:``` blob\r\n\r\nIf this isn&#39;t easily done it would be ok to do two passes. In the first pass blobs can be mentioned multipe times in different commits because of reasons you have pointed out:\r\n\r\n* adding a file with the same content in an other file\r\n* a file has the same content after it has been modified\r\n\r\nI could then do a second pass piping the file through ```awk &#39;!x[$0]++&#39;``` which will remove any duplicates. This wouldn&#39;t be very efficient but would get the result I want.\r\n\r\nI hope I made my intentions clear now.

say you had a website that was made with only mobile in mind, and you wanted to make it good to go for desktop, you wouldn&#39;t use transform scale, right? Simply don&#39;t use transform for that. Use media-queries and adjust the actual size of the elements accordingly. Using scale like that will mess with the pixel values and cause this blurry effect.\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t matter how big or small the media you&#39;re working with is, the principles of responsive design work the same. Use relative units instead of absolute ones and it&#39;s not that hard.\r\n\r\nIf you use `rem` units for font-sizes, margins and paddings and etc, and unitless line-heights, they are relative to the root font-size (which is normally 16px by default), so by modifying the font-size on the `html` element, they will all scale in proportion. For general layout structure, you can use percentages, or even better, use [CSS Grid and `fr` units][1].\r\n\r\nImages will require a bit more work, as you should provably use different images for different sizes, but for everything else, this does it.\r\n\r\nA demonstration:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    body {\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      font-family: sans-serif;\r\n      line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    p {\r\n      margin-top: 0;\r\n      margin-bottom: .75rem;\r\n      font-size: 1rem;\r\n      line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .main {\r\n      display: grid;\r\n      grid-template-rows: 7.5rem max-content 1fr;\r\n      min-height: 100vh;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .header {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      justify-content: center;\r\n      align-items: center;\r\n      background-color: blue;\r\n      color: yellow;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .header__title {\r\n      font-size: 2rem;\r\n      line-height: 2.25;\r\n      text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .navbar {\r\n      display:       flex;\r\n      background:    lightblue;\r\n      border-top:    0.125rem solid;\r\n      border-bottom: 0.125rem solid;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .navbar__item {\r\n      flex-grow: 1;\r\n      padding: .375rem .75rem;\r\n      text-align: center;\r\n      text-transform: capitalize;\r\n      text-decoration: none;\r\n      color: black;\r\n      font-size: 1.125rem;\r\n      line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .content {\r\n      background: silver;\r\n      padding: 1.5rem;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .content__title {\r\n      font-size: 1.125rem;\r\n      line-height: 2.25;\r\n      margin-top: 0;\r\n      margin-bottom: .75rem;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;main class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;\r\n      \r\n      &lt;header class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;h1 class=&quot;header__title&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n      &lt;/header&gt;\r\n      \r\n      &lt;nav class=&quot;navbar&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;navbar__item&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;navbar__item&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;navbar__item&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;navbar__item&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;navbar__item&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;navbar__item&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;navbar__item&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;/nav&gt;\r\n        \r\n      &lt;article class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;content__title&quot;&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

Let&#39;s say I&#39;m working with 4 screens, I&#39;m trying to make a web page that appears like it&#39;s not stretched, which means on a normal single screen showing one desktop it will look like it&#39;s been compressed 4 times.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve currently got a partial solution by creating a 4 desktop wide page, then using CSS trasform to scale the page by 1/4 horizontally.\r\n\r\nAlthough images are blurry, that could be mitigated by excluding transformation on elements with images.\r\n\r\n**The issue**\r\n\r\nWhen the scaling transform is done, the fonts are pixelated as if they went

When I am setting the max-width property of the image, is the browser thinking I am telling it to shrink the image to fit into its container width set explicitly? \r\n\r\nCodepen link: https://codepen.io/rpmcmurphy/pen/zYYoxjj\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .ola {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      width: 110px;\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    a {\r\n      text-decoration: none;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    a:first-child {\r\n      color: black;\r\n      background: yellow;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    img {\r\n      height: 30px;\r\n      width: auto;\r\n      max-width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    a:nth-child(2) {\r\n      color: yellow;\r\n      background: black;\r\n      font-size: 20px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;ola&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;img src=&quot;https://madmin.madcoderz.com/assets/images/favicon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/a&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458150/image-max-width-property-causing-unexpected-behavior","title":"Image max-width property causing unexpected behavior"},{"tags":["terraform","amazon-iam","terraform-provider-aws"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8962,"user_id":5343387,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15a14cec3014822297a08ed6dfae2563?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Schuchard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5343387/matt-schuchard"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571485116,"post_id":58458149,"comment_id":103262062,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458149/how-can-i-hide-aws-credentials-from-external-program#comment103262062_58458149"},{"owner":{"reputation":450,"user_id":6826691,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04fe7ab66caa3480f38bed035e80faea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6826691","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6826691/user6826691"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8962,"user_id":5343387,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15a14cec3014822297a08ed6dfae2563?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Schuchard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5343387/matt-schuchard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571510367,"post_id":58458149,"comment_id":103268240,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458149/how-can-i-hide-aws-credentials-from-external-program#comment103268240_58458149"},{"owner":{"reputation":8962,"user_id":5343387,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15a14cec3014822297a08ed6dfae2563?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Schuchard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5343387/matt-schuchard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571583262,"post_id":58458149,"comment_id":103281547,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458149/how-can-i-hide-aws-credentials-from-external-program#comment103281547_58458149"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":113,"user_id":8780756,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60afee6ed5938469b7e001b9af4bd255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Valentin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8780756/valentin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571434711,"creation_date":1571434711,"answer_id":58458512,"question_id":58458149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58458512","body_markdown":"in your scenario you will be great if you will go with: `Remote State` approach.\r\n\r\n`Remote State` allows Terraform to store the state in a remote store. Terraform supports storing state in places like Terraform Enterprise, Consul, S3, and more.\r\n\r\nThe setup is to create a bucket on AWS S3, it should not be readable or writeable by anyone, except the user who will be using for Terraform.\r\n\r\nThe code I added was;\r\n\r\n     terraform {\r\n        backend &quot;s3&quot; {\r\n          bucket = &quot;my-new-bucket&quot;\r\n          key = &quot;state/key&quot;\r\n          region = &quot;eu-west-1&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\nThis simply tells Terraform to use S3 as the backend provider for doing things like storing `tfstate` files.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget to run `terraform init` because it&#39;s a requirement, Terraform will notice that you changed from storing locally to storing in S3.\r\n\r\nOnce that is done You could delete the local `tfstate` files safe in the knowledge your details were safely stored on S3.\r\n\r\nHere is some useful docs: [Click docs][1] \r\n\r\nThe second approach is to use a Terraform `plugin` more info here: [Terraform plugin][2] \r\n\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-04-03-terraform-provider-secret.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458149/how-can-i-hide-aws-credentials-from-external-program/58458512#58458512","title":"How can I hide AWS credentials from external program?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":990,"user_id":4093955,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgNJt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yzT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4093955/yzt"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571516043,"creation_date":1571516043,"answer_id":58467609,"question_id":58458149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58467609","body_markdown":"There are a couple of things going on here.\r\n\r\nFirst, you are leaking your credentials because you are storing your `.tfstate` in GitHub.

So, basically if you want to follow this approach, you are forced to use `sensitive: true`, no matter what you team says. However, why get the credentials that way?

Thank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458137/size-of-a-2d-array-in-c","title":"Size of a 2d array in C++"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-mvc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":362,"user_id":1401699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80ad2877bab9185edcf03688987af2c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rakesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1401699/rakesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571433366,"post_id":58458136,"comment_id":103253491,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458136/issues-accessing-an-array-in-json-response#comment103253491_58458136"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12115488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef112d445a195eeb942be0906f6aa5d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan Brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115488/ryan-brown"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":362,"user_id":1401699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80ad2877bab9185edcf03688987af2c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rakesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1401699/rakesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571435084,"post_id":58458136,"comment_id":103253945,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458136/issues-accessing-an-array-in-json-response#comment103253945_58458136"},{"owner":{"reputation":10824,"user_id":2312877,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0510f99ab1ac9f932e34c2081745d710?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kritner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2312877/kritner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571435330,"post_id":58458136,"comment_id":103253992,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458136/issues-accessing-an-array-in-json-response#comment103253992_58458136"},{"owner":{"reputation":362,"user_id":1401699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80ad2877bab9185edcf03688987af2c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rakesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1401699/rakesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571435749,"post_id":58458136,"comment_id":103254073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458136/issues-accessing-an-array-in-json-response#comment103254073_58458136"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12115488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef112d445a195eeb942be0906f6aa5d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan Brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115488/ryan-brown"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":362,"user_id":1401699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80ad2877bab9185edcf03688987af2c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rakesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1401699/rakesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571438625,"post_id":58458136,"comment_id":103254686,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458136/issues-accessing-an-array-in-json-response#comment103254686_58458136"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":623,"user_id":10116812,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLdFH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mojtaba Nava","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10116812/mojtaba-nava"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571433330,"creation_date":1571433330,"answer_id":58458294,"question_id":58458136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58458294","body_markdown":"Change line:\r\n\r\n    SoftInfo = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;software&gt;&gt;(SoftResponse);\r\n\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n    SoftInfo = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;software&gt;(SoftResponse);\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458136/issues-accessing-an-array-in-json-response/58458294#58458294","title":"Issues accessing an array in JSON response"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":2086345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/814c030c8f19f4e213a31284bc0a418a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VJPPaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2086345/vjppaz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571433635,"creation_date":1571433635,"answer_id":58458354,"question_id":58458136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58458354","body_markdown":"Are you sure that the `SoftResponse` is an Array Json?

One which even threw me off, [because of this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14911132/1839439).\r\n\r\nHowever, in your case Germany was as you said on UTC+01:00, hence on your system the value of `$date` is `1970-01-01T00:00:00+01:00`.\r\n\r\nIf you reverse the scenario and try to find out what is the date corresponding to timestamp `0`, it should help you understand how time zones work with timestamps. \r\n\r\n\t$date = DateTime::createFromFormat (&#39;U&#39;, &#39;0&#39;);\r\n\t$date-&gt;setTimezone(new DateTimeZone(&#39;Europe/Berlin&#39;));\r\n\techo $date-&gt;format(DATE_ATOM); // 1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00\r\n\r\nBecause timestamps are the relative time difference from the UNIX epoch in seconds it will be a different time in different time zone. This count starts at midnight on January 1st, 1970 at UTC. While both Britain and Germany were on UTC+01:00 in 1970, the UNIX epoch started for them on `1970-01-01 01:00:00`\r\n\r\nIn terms of how to best deal with this, well... that is opinion-based. Probably most people would tell you to deal with time in UTC so you don&#39;t run into weird issues such as this, and only convert to the right timezone on display, but even [the great Jon Skeet had different opinion](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2019/03/27/storing-utc-is-not-a-silver-bullet/).

After going through the docs over and over, I tried using a custom fetch plugin\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst customFetchPlugin = {\r\n    requestWillFetch: ({ request }) =&gt; new Request(request, {\r\n        mode: &#39;no-cors&#39;\r\n    })\r\n};\r\n```\r\nand then used in the routing\r\n\r\n```\r\nworkbox.routing.registerRoute(\r\n        /(https:\\/\\/example\\.com\\/).*\\.(js|css)/,\r\n        new workbox.strategies.StaleWhileRevalidate({\r\n            cacheName: &#39;3rd-cache&#39;,\r\n            plugins: [\r\n                new workbox.cacheableResponse.Plugin({\r\n                    statuses: [0, 200]\r\n                }),\r\n                customFetchPlugin\r\n            ]\r\n        })\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks good to me, and I assumed it should not run into anymore CORS errors, but I am still getting CORS errors\r\n\r\n```\r\nAccess to fetch at &#39;https://example.com/xxx.js&#39; from origin &#39;https://myexample.com&#39; has been blocked by CORS policy: No &#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39; header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request&#39;s mode to &#39;no-cors&#39; to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\r\n```\r\nAt this moment, I have run out of ideas. Please let me know what might I be doing wrong to make this work ? Thanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458093/how-to-use-workbox-to-cache-cdn-assets-without-cors-support","title":"How to use workbox to cache CDN assets without CORS support"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33913,"user_id":560593,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99c93a3c235763708dd7263e197acdc6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Patrick Evans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560593/patrick-evans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571433153,"post_id":58458092,"comment_id":103253422,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458092/javascript-slider-dynamically-changed-html-css-not-changing-pictures#comment103253422_58458092"},{"owner":{"reputation":487,"user_id":11793145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c99c0db5c33cbc4233de927e2216051d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Harmenx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11793145/harmenx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571433834,"post_id":58458092,"comment_id":103253625,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458092/javascript-slider-dynamically-changed-html-css-not-changing-pictures#comment103253625_58458092"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11824854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7a59a7d64b08bdb04c455c211933a90?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jefry90","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11824854/jefry90"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571486907,"post_id":58458092,"comment_id":103262494,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458092/javascript-slider-dynamically-changed-html-css-not-changing-pictures#comment103262494_58458092"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11824854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7a59a7d64b08bdb04c455c211933a90?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jefry90","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11824854/jefry90"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11824854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7a59a7d64b08bdb04c455c211933a90?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jefry90","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11824854/jefry90"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571798998,"last_edit_date":1571798998,"creation_date":1571671369,"answer_id":58489425,"question_id":58458092,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489425","body_markdown":"I made some configuration.

follow these steps:\r\n\r\n 1. Run `npm install -g expo-cli` to install the latest Expo CLI globally.\r\n 2. Close your Expo CLI server if you are using it.\r\n 3. Make sure in `app.json` the `sdkVersion` is `33.0.0`\r\n 4. Change the `react` dependency in your `package.json` from `16.5.0` to `16.8.3`\r\n 5. Delete your project `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file\r\n 6. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` depending on your package manager.\r\n 7. Run `expo start -c` to clear your cache and start your application.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Bonus ##\r\n\r\nNow for any Expo based API or dependency you can install it by using `expo install` instead of `npm install` i.e. `expo install @expo/vector-icons`.\r\nThis is better than using the traditional `npm install` or `yarn install` as it will install the version of the dependency that&#39;s compatible with your current Expo SDK.\r\n\r\nHope this Helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458091/expo-project-error-could-not-connect-to-development-server-after-updating-expo-s/58458754#58458754","title":"Expo project error Could not connect to development server after updating expo SDK"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":4652123,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3ac9d1d4537ba62f3fea8ad1d4e5f17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank Gully","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4652123/frank-gully"},"last_editor":{"reputation":376,"user_id":7391342,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFD1Z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Abdeen M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7391342/abdeen-m"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58458754,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571441986,"creation_date":1571432136,"last_edit_date":1571436194,"question_id":58458091,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458091","body_markdown":"I created a project a while back and tried running it recently and got an error from expo saying that my SDK version is not up to date.

like your app is Scene based. For Scene based apps you can almost forget about the `AppDelegate` and focus on the `SceneDelegate`. There are two methods you now need to override in the `SceneDelegate` and one in the `AppDelegate`. I&#39;ll mimic Apple&#39;s guide for clarity:\r\n\r\nIf the user is opening the app and it&#39;s a fresh launch, you handle this in the `AppDelegate`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n     // AppDelegate.swift\r\n     func application(_ application: UIApplication, configurationForConnecting connectingSceneSession: UISceneSession, options: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) -&gt; UISceneConfiguration {\r\n         // Called when a new scene session is being created.\r\n         // Use this method to select a configuration to create the new scene with.\r\n\r\n         // Grab a reference to the shortcutItem to use in the scene\r\n         if let shortcutItem = options.shortcutItem {\r\n             shortcutItemToProcess = shortcutItem\r\n         }\r\n         \r\n         // Previously this method only contained the line below, where the scene is configured\r\n         return UISceneConfiguration(name: &quot;Default Configuration&quot;, sessionRole: connectingSceneSession.role)\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your app is still running in the background when the user clicks on the shortcut item, you handle that in the `SceneDelegate`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n    // SceneDelegate.swift\r\n    func windowScene(_ windowScene: UIWindowScene, performActionFor shortcutItem: UIApplicationShortcutItem, completionHandler: @escaping (Bool) -&gt; Void) {\r\n        // When the user opens the app through a quick action, this is now the method that will be called\r\n        (UIApplication.shared.delegate as!

I tried using some base R commands like paste but could not get rid of duplicate values.\r\n\r\nExample of something I tried:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nallver.mergeVerID &lt;- spread(allver.ids, Protein.ID, Ver.ID.Porder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Error: Each row of output must be identified by a unique combination of keys. \r\n    Keys are shared for 5311 rows:\r\n\r\nI also get this error using \r\n\r\n```r\r\nallver.mergeVerID &lt;- allver.ids %&gt;% group_by(Protein.ID) %&gt;% \r\n  summarise(Ver.ID.Porder= toString(Ver.ID.Porder), )\r\n```\r\n&lt;b&gt;OR &lt;/b&gt;\r\n```r\r\nallver.mergeVerID &lt;- aggregate(Ver.ID.Porder ~ Protein.ID, allver.ids, toString)\r\n```\r\nWhat does this error mean?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458086/how-do-i-take-row-values-from-a-column-and-combine-them-sep-by-based-on-dif","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How do I take row values from a column and combine them, sep by &quot;,&quot; based on different column value?"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1856,"user_id":6692606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3653dbd72e2fd66e0a741b97aa322e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ASDFGerte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6692606/asdfgerte"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571432251,"post_id":58458081,"comment_id":103253127,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458081/why-does-this-switch-case-in-the-function-always-use-case-1#comment103253127_58458081"},{"owner":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571432329,"post_id":58458081,"comment_id":103253146,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458081/why-does-this-switch-case-in-the-function-always-use-case-1#comment103253146_58458081"},{"owner":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571432400,"post_id":58458081,"comment_id":103253167,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458081/why-does-this-switch-case-in-the-function-always-use-case-1#comment103253167_58458081"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571432664,"post_id":58458081,"comment_id":103253263,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458081/why-does-this-switch-case-in-the-function-always-use-case-1#comment103253263_58458081"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12240670,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n23oTVxWccc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reu_igyozyvQVVowCr6NhwfQhAYfA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Carter Dimock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12240670/carter-dimock"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12240670,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n23oTVxWccc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reu_igyozyvQVVowCr6NhwfQhAYfA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Carter Dimock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12240670/carter-dimock"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571459412,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571433802,"creation_date":1571432098,"last_edit_date":1571433802,"question_id":58458081,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458081","body_markdown":"    function chooseAxis(){\r\n        var direction = Math.floor(Math.random() * (+5 - +1)) + +1;\r\n        var axis = 0;\r\n        switch (direction) {\r\n          case 1: \r\n            axis = -6;\r\n            break;\r\n          case 2:\r\n            axis = 6;\r\n            break;\r\n          case 3:\r\n            axis = -1;\r\n            break;\r\n          case 4:\r\n            axis = 1;\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n        return axis;\r\n      }\r\n\r\nIt needs to be able to choose one of the other cases or else it just gets caught in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nthe project this code comes from is here\r\nhttps://studio.code.org/projects/applab/fgtOEbm11J5laNdbgZAd8o2Z9-AopbT1DUiTIywu4ZU\r\nIt was a project I did in highschool that I just looked back at and wanted to try and fix.
