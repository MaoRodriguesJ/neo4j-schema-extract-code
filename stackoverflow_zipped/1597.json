My SWAG (Scientific Wild Ass Guess) is that the default printer is set to whatever the last user set it to.

As a result, with several dozens or hundreds of users, that file can become very long and cluttered with entries about all possible printers in the network.\\nRead my blog post from 5 years ago : https://dyngpgeek.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/using-dynamics-gp-in-a-citrix-ts-environment/\\nIt explains how to solve the problem.. Either use a personal user profile DEX.ini for each user, or use the \\&#39;per-user\\&#39; DEX.ini settings, which stores the values no longer in the physical .ini file itself, but rather in the DYNAMICS database for each user.\\nSee my comment at the end of the blog post about the pros &amp; cons of each option.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nBeat Bucher\\nBusiness Analyst, Dynamics GP SME\\nMontreal QC/Canada\\n@GP_Beat http://www.gp-geek.com\\nMontreal QC GPUG Chapter Leader\\nMBS MVP (2015-2018)\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nOriginal Message&#39;]","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162575/cant-get-details-inside-class-in-python/58163936#58163936","title":"Can&#39;t get details inside class in Python"}],"owner":{"reputation":660,"user_id":1190316,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/449621c9d3ab4f1bf0c86f9e8bd17d47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sindu_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1190316/sindu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":62610,"user_id":7429447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZMSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DebanjanB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7429447/debanjanb"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58163010,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569831692,"creation_date":1569825266,"last_edit_date":1569831318,"question_id":58162575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162575","body_markdown":"I am trying to scrape the following website using the python and selenium code.

quite sure you have encountered Google Analytics (GA) spam.  \r\nThis is because GA is JavaScript and your ID is listed in the html source.  \r\n\r\nSo anyone who wants to create spam on your data can use your ID.  \r\nWhy you ask... When you notice it you see that there are webpages listed you don&#39;t know in your GA data, you (the admin) open them and get a virus or worse.  \r\nDon&#39;t open the webpages...\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are as far as I know two ways to fix it. Regex filter wich is a common way.  \r\nAll webpages that has refferals from other domains you don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; you need to block.  \r\nThis takes time and is not a good approach.  \r\n\r\nMy method is to pass a dimension from the html to GA.  \r\nIf that dimension is missing the data is not real.\r\n\r\nYour JavaScript probably looks something like:  \r\n\r\n    .....\r\n     ga(&#39;require&#39;, &#39;linkid&#39;, &#39;linkid.js&#39;);\r\n      ga(&#39;require&#39;, &#39;displayfeatures&#39;);\r\n      ga(&#39;send&#39;, &#39;pageview&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we add a dimension which we pick up in GA admin tools \r\n\r\n    .....\r\n     ga(&#39;require&#39;, &#39;linkid&#39;, &#39;linkid.js&#39;);\r\n      ga(&#39;require&#39;, &#39;displayfeatures&#39;);\r\n      ga(&#39;send&#39;, &#39;pageview&#39;, {\r\n          &#39;dimension1&#39;:  &#39;FooBar&#39;\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to admin -&gt; Property (the middle column) and at the bottom you have `Dd Custom Definitions`.\r\nOpen Custom Dimensions and add the dimension you added to the html.  \r\n\r\nNow you can set up a filter in the view tab of GA admin to only show data with your custom dimension &quot;FooBar&quot;.  \r\n\r\nAny data that does not have this &quot;FooBar&quot; is spam that is not generated from your webpage.   \r\n\r\n\r\nJust remember you need to change all GA JavaScript codes and add the dimension.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can see this spam (if I&#39;m correct) in the Acquisition -&gt; All Traffic -&gt; Referrals report.  \r\nIf you see Sources that you don&#39;t recognize and looks odd it&#39;s most likely the spam.  \r\nBefore I used this method my Referrals looked something like this, there is about 50 of these fake referrals.  \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubtQy.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162546/massive-differences-between-google-analytics-and-own-data-collection/58162880#58162880","title":"Massive differences between Google Analytics and own data collection"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12141176,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb890b3032390c16215f83f9bd9c90dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frederick Bulsara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12141176/frederick-bulsara"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569827005,"creation_date":1569825101,"question_id":58162546,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162546","body_markdown":"The use of a web app is to be evaluated statistically. It has been publicly available since spring of this year. \r\n\r\nThe web app is linked to *Google Analytics*. The following is done for the own user data collection: \r\n\r\nA *Unique User ID* is created when the web app is called for the first time. It is stored in the *localStorage* and is compared each time the page is called up again. \r\n\r\n    if (localStorage.getItem(&quot;uuid&quot;) === null) {\r\n    \tlocalStorage.setItem(&quot;uuid&quot;, get_uuid());\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function get_uuid() {\r\n      return ([1e7]+-1e3+-4e3+-8e3+-1e11).replace(/[018]/g, c =&gt;\r\n        (c ^ crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(1))[0] &amp; 15 &gt;&gt; c / 4).toString(16)\r\n      )\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis data is written to a database together with other information (concrete page, time, device type, etc.). Users without *Javascript* or *localStorage* will not be included; however, they will probably not be able to use the web app correctly anyway. \r\n\r\nIf I now compare the data from *Google Analytics* with my own variant, the discrepancy is considerable.\r\n\r\n - Different users according to *Google*: about **900**\r\n - Different users due to *UUID*: about **400**\r\n\r\nAdditionally about **100** visits (or interactions) without *UUID* were registered.\r\n\r\nNow my question is why these big differences exist. In my opinion, my data collection should be pretty accurate. But maybe I have a thinking error with the approach of the *UUID*? Or could it be that *Google* counts quite differently; for example, any robots that don&#39;t leave a *UUID* behind? \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your answers and considerations.

Here is my case,\r\n\r\nI want to broadcast live karaoke using WebRTC on my Cordova App. Everything works when I use in-built microphone of mobile device. But in-built mic doesn&#39;t give great sound, so I choose to input audio via USB in mobile device (My latest phone only has USB connector but no 3.5mm audio jack). \r\n\r\nFirst issue: when I call getUserMedia method, it takes sound from USB along with device mic even if assign deviceid in constraint parameter. So there is always surrounding noise. I found no way to mute device mic in this case. I tried couple of Apps available on playstore to mute Mic but then audio from USB also gets muted. \r\n\r\nI tried using plugin &quot;cordova-plugin-audioinput&quot; which works exactly how I needed. It takes sound from USB only and converts that into MediaStream. But then it has an open [issue][1] of creating crackling sound.\r\n\r\n**Edit-1** I found that if I pass &quot;echoCancellation: false or sampleRate:48000&quot; as audio constraints in getUserMedia method then it doesn&#39;t take audio from USB. If I don&#39;t pass those params then audio quality is bad.\r\n\r\nCan someone suggest if there is way to get raw audio exactly and only from USB using getUserMedia method in cordova app for android.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/edimuj/cordova-plugin-audioinput/issues/100","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162538/cordova-webrtc-android-not-able-to-get-audio-from-usb-input","title":"Cordova + WebRTC + Android: Not able to get audio from USB input"},{"tags":["javascript","arrays"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569825156,"post_id":58162535,"comment_id":102706763,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162535/array-fill-method-does-not-work-when-filling-an-array-with-arrays#comment102706763_58162535"},{"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":8345731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bYou.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roskow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8345731/roskow"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569825335,"post_id":58162535,"comment_id":102706837,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162535/array-fill-method-does-not-work-when-filling-an-array-with-arrays#comment102706837_58162535"}],"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":8345731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bYou.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roskow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8345731/roskow"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569825111,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569825051,"creation_date":1569825051,"question_id":58162535,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162535","body_markdown":"I am working on a matrix spiral for coding interview practice.

The tree is given in parent-array representation, meaning the tree has n nodes with labels 0, 1, 2, .., n-1, and you are passed a length n array p, where p[i] returns the label of the parent of node i, except when i is the root of the tree in which case p[i] is -1. \r\n\r\nI guess one thing to note is that the problem was as stated above, so there were no extra conditions such as e.g. it being a binary tree.\r\n\r\nI thought this was a fairly straight forward problem, but the code that I submitted failed a &quot;Small Tree Case&quot; on the testing platform (which does not let you see the test cases). It passed the other tests, including a performance test on a large tree. I&#39;ve thought about it for a while but I still can not see what the flaw in my algorithm or handling of some edge case is. I guess one thing to note is that the problem was as stated above, so there were no extra conditions such as e.g. it being a binary tree.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef countLeaves(p):\r\n    n = len(p)\r\n    if p is None or n == 0 : return 0\r\n    if n == 1 or n == 2 : return 1\r\n    \r\n    leaves = set(range(n))\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        if p[i] == -1: # i is root of tree with &gt;1 node, can&#39;t be a leaf\r\n            leaves.discard(i)\r\n        else: # p[i] is parent of node i, can&#39;t be a leaf\r\n            leaves.discard(p[i])\r\n    \r\n    return len(leaves)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIn trying to fix the failed &quot;Small tree case&quot; I also tried returning None if p is None, returning None if n == 0, or both modifications together, but to no success. If anyone could point out what the error in my code may have been I would greatly appreciate it.

Sort the elements. (To remember their original indices in the array, associate the elements with their indices and retain those associations while sorting.)\r\n2. Set `L` to point to the lowest element and `H` to point to the highest element.\r\n3. While L is earlier than H:\r\n    - If the sum of `*L` (the number pointed to by `L`) and `*H` is *z*, stop. The desired elements are `*L` and `*H`.\r\n    - If the sum is less than *z*, advance `L`.\r\n    - If the sum is greater than *z*, decrease `H`.\r\n4. Stop. There is no solution.\r\n\r\nFloating-point rounding is not a problem because floating-point addition is (weakly) monotonic: If the floating-point sum of *x*&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *x*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the floating-point sum of *x*&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and *y* is less than or equal to the floating-point sum of *x*&lt;sub&gt;=1&lt;/sub&gt; and *y*. This means the test sum of `*L` and `*H` in the algorithm always correctly indicates whether `L` or `H` must be adjusted to continue the search—if the test sum is too low, then we need a higher number, so `L` must be advanced. Similarly, if the test sum is too high, `H` must be decreased. No solution can be missed this way.\r\n\r\n##Finding Real-Number Sum##\r\n\r\nIf the problem is to find two array elements *x* and *y* such that there sum is the target number *z* when added with real-number arithmetic, then the above algorithm suffices with a simple modification to the test.\r\n\r\nReplace step 3. above with:\r\n\r\n* Evaluate `s = *L + *H; z = s - *L; t = *H - z;` with floating-point arithmetic using round-to-nearest. Then, in real-number arithmetic, `s` + `t` is exactly `*L` + `*H`.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; `s` contains the most significant portion of the sum (the nearest value representable in floating-point), and `t` contains the error or deviation of `s` from the real-number sum of `*L` and `*H`. If `s` equals *z* and `t` equals zero, stop. The desired elements are `*L` and `*H`.\r\n* If `s` &lt; *z* or `s` = *z* and `t` &lt; 0, advance `L`.\r\n* Otherwise, decrease `H`.\r\n\r\n##Footnote##\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Muller et al, *Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic*, 2010, Theorem 4, pages 126-129.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162472/popular-two-sum-algorithm-problem-with-floating-point/58168294#58168294","title":"Popular Two Sum Algorithm Problem with Floating Point"}],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":3567004,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":11,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af4983fdc52fa08942b1091e55427ab7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3567004","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3567004/user3567004"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570117656,"creation_date":1569824753,"question_id":58162472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162472","body_markdown":"There is a popular algorithm problem known as Two Sum. For those who aren&#39;t aware of it, here&#39;s a quick description. You are given an array of numbers with n elements and a target number. You are supposed to find 2 numbers in the array such that they add up to the target number.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be found on Leetcode.\r\n\r\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/\r\n\r\nThe numbers in the array are typically given as integers. Here&#39;s my question. How would one go about solving this problem if the array was filled with floating point numbers instead? This problem is more difficult because of rounding errors.\r\n\r\nI recognize that this is a pretty general problem statement. For example, a solution to this problem will really depend on whether the target number is limited to integers or can be a float as well. I think in order for this problem to make sense, the target number must be limited to integers (correct me if I&#39;m wrong).

Then the other thread is supposed to run by the same rules.\r\n\r\nThis program is supposed to take two file input and figure out the message by concatenating both of the inputs from the files in a specific order and then printing out the output after it has deciphered it. \r\n\r\nThe inputs of these two files as shown below\r\n\r\n    Person1         Person2          \r\n    ---------       ---------- \r\n    t\t\t           0\r\n    0\t\t           h\r\n    i\t\t           0\r\n    s\t\t           0\r\n    0\t\t           i\r\n    0\t\t           s\r\n    0\t\t           a\r\n    t\t\t           0\r\n    e\t\t           0\r\n    0\t\t           s\r\n    t\t\t           0\r\n\r\n the above inputs should result in a string with this output\r\n\r\n&gt;

The `write` system call is indeed invoked, with expected characters in the `$RSI` register (which happens to be where the second argument to system calls must be for this particular platform).\r\n2. The system call is invoked from `__GI___libc_write` routine, which is a system call *wrapper* provided by `libc`.\r\n3. Python did not call `__libc_write` directly. It called `__GI__IO_fputs` (which is actually an alias for `fputs`.\r\n4. The Python *interpreter* translated the `print` into a call to `PyFile_WriteString`, and that function delegated the actual work to libc.\r\n\r\nThis is not at all unusual -- in fact most user-level programs do not execute system calls directly. Instead, they call `libc` routines, such as `write` or `fputs`, and let the libc worry how to implement these routines in terms of system calls.\r\n\r\nBy doing so, they can *abstract* the details of the particular machine and OS; they expect to find some `libc` on any machine, and only `libc` developers have to worry about actual system call details.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162427/how-are-system-calls-called/58194669#58194669","title":"How are system calls called?"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12105166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c32919552511b88a443891adb4026f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NDrummerboy087","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12105166/ndrummerboy087"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569985033,"creation_date":1569824544,"question_id":58162427,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162427","body_markdown":"So I understand what system calls are for and what they do.

This seems to be unnecessary for constant expressions.\r\n* It works by defining a union that can be used as the struct or the resulting `uint32_t`.\r\n* The mask is generated by setting all bits to 1, and then resetting only the given struct member to 0.\r\n* The bit offset is obtained by looking for the first 0-bit from the right.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the standard makes **no promisses** about the order of bitfields in a memory word (&quot;unit&quot;), not even that they are in the same memory word. For further details see the chapter &quot;Structure and union specifiers&quot; of the version of the standard your compiler complies to.\r\n\r\nBut if you need the values for other purposes you should think about your architectur, and of course of the possibilities of the C standard. As I said, presumably you&#39;re trying to solve a completely other problem.

not in your `SELECT` statement.\r\n\r\nSome other points:\r\n\r\n - Don&#39;t use `OTHERS` to catch all exceptions; instead catch specific expected exceptions and if an unexpected exception occurs then you are able to see that it has occurred and debug the issue rather than just silently hiding it.\r\n - [Don&#39;t use `COMMIT` in the stored procedure](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41998025/what-is-the-effect-of-placing-the-commit-after-dml-in-procedure/41998936#41998936); instead use it in the calling block so you can chain multiple stored procedures and `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` them all as a single transaction.\r\n\r\n**Call it**:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDECLARE\r\n  success NUMBER(1,0);\r\nBEGIN\r\n  insert_expt_excel( XMLType(

Or do I have to fall back to set_mempolicy()/numactl (LINUX)?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162375/pin-and-allocate-tensorflow-on-specific-numa-node","title":"pin and allocate tensorflow on specific NUMA node"},{"tags":["android","json","xml"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11546839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rhLHxZ7o0zM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALk/v409nS5z3Zc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"gauraw kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11546839/gauraw-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5923,"user_id":4079010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6JOy3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rahul Khurana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4079010/rahul-khurana"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569825422,"creation_date":1569824190,"last_edit_date":1569825422,"question_id":58162372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162372","body_markdown":"How to use auto text in android studio like i just touch the text and it will copied automatically and where i use that code in my android studio that its working on all my application \r\n\r\n    clipboard = (ClipboardManager) getSystemService(Context.CLIPBOARD_SERVICE);\r\n    Log.e(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;iron&quot;);\r\n    ClipData clip = ClipData.newPlainText(&quot;label&quot;, &quot;Text to copy&quot;);\r\n    clipboard.setPrimaryClip(clip);\r\n    public void onClick(View v) {\r\n            switch (v.getId()) {\r\n                case R.id.pages_tv:\r\n                    Intent p = new Intent(mContext, SubPagesActivity.class);\r\n                    p.putParcelableArrayListExtra(&quot;data&quot;, para_List);\r\n                    startActivity(p);\r\n                    break;\r\n                case R.id.next_btn:\r\n                    if (current_page &lt;
