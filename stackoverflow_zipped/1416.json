However Django can&#39;t see the file.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand if I send a file using `requests` (python) it works fine. What I have found so far is that `requests` adds a `Content-Length` header which `node-fetch` does not. Adding this manually does not solve the problem. `node-fetch` does add `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` but I don&#39;t think this should be a problem. In all cases there is the `Content-Type:multipart/form-data` header with a boundary defined.\r\n\r\nI have previously had this working with Flask, but there is some motivation to move to Django now.\r\n\r\nWould a missing `Content-Length` header cause this issue? Can anyone see something obvious I would be missing?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205299/how-to-send-multipart-form-with-a-file-from-node-to-django","title":"How to send multipart form with a file from node to django"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pyside2"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12154671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/45d83b3440e4bfabdc8189369018fcea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Haider","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154671/haider"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570117318,"post_id":58210083,"comment_id":102820641,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205298/how-to-show-python-dictionary-data-in-pyside2-window/58210083#comment102820641_58210083"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6276,"user_id":7767694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DoPOp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"S.

After some searching, I found the [Tigra Calendar][1]; which seemed ideal because all I needed was a CSS link, JS source script, and an Input field added to my aspx page.  It also had the advantage of offering client side operation so that it wasn&#39;t doing an autopostback on each click like the Calendar control was; I just had to add a &quot;date&quot; select button to send the page to the server.\r\n\r\nThe calendar appears to be working fine on my page, and I&#39;m able to use the value as an SqlDataSource query parameter for a GridView as a FormParameter.  The issues that I&#39;m running into are that I also have a Chart that seems to need to already have a date &quot;selected&quot; on Page_Load, and I also want the selected date to remain visible in the Input field after clicking the select button.\r\n\r\nWith the Calendar control, I was able to do both with the following TextBox1 and Calendar1 statements in the code behind:\r\n```\r\n    namespace Mvc   \r\n    {\r\n        public partial class LoadSumByDate : System.Web.UI.Page\r\n        {\r\n            protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n            {\r\n                if (!IsPostBack)\r\n                {\r\n                    TextBox1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString();\r\n                    Calendar1.SelectedDate = DateTime.Now;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n            }\r\n```\r\nHowever, an Input (tag?) apparently doesn&#39;t work the same as a Control. I&#39;ve tried doing similar as above for my SelDate Input, using a &quot;value&quot; in the input statement itself, etc., but without any success.  The only **documentation** that Tigra has seems to be for the Tigra Calendar Pro; which basically says that it can be done, just not how to do it;(and I don&#39;t know if it is in the Pro version only).

Based on the above requirements, the solution could be modified to fit the above use case.\r\n\r\nIf you use `nslookup google.com` in your console in windows, you will find a similar output: \r\n```\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\n\r\nServer:  UnKnown\r\nAddress:  192.168.0.1\r\n\r\nName:    facebook.com\r\nAddresses:  2a03:2880:f12f:183:face:b00c:0:25de\r\n\t  31.13.79.35\r\n```\r\nFollowing the [referenced solution][2], these two lines are the heart of our solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprocess = subprocess.Popen([&quot;nslookup&quot;, url], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\r\noutput = str(process.communicate()[0]).split(&#39;\\\\r\\\\n&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you print the output in the console, you&#39;ll get a similar result to this:\r\n```\r\n[&quot;b&#39;Server:  UnKnown&quot;, &#39;Address:  192.168.0.1&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;Name:    facebook.com&#39;, &#39;Addresses:  2a03:2880:f12f:183:face:b00c:0:25de&#39;, &#39;\\\\t  31.13.79.35&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &quot;&#39;&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis list is enough for the above use case.\r\nNext thing to do is to find a reliable way to always get the `6th element` which is `&quot;\\\\t 31.13.79.35&quot;`\r\n\r\nTo make things simpler, I used index slicing to get the `6th element` using `output[5]`. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tested this code about 10-15 times using different urls and I&#39;ve gotten similar results. A better way would be to somehow detect the address by iterating through the list items in output. \r\n\r\nAgain for the above use case, using `output[5]` works well enough. If someone can contribute a more reliable way to detect the ip address in the list, please do so.\r\n\r\n**get_ip_address.py**\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport subprocess\r\n\r\n\r\ndef get_ip_address(url):\r\n    process = subprocess.Popen(\r\n        [&quot;nslookup&quot;, url], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\r\n    output = str(process.communicate()[0]).split(&#39;\\\\r\\\\n&#39;)\r\n    address = output[5].replace(&#39;\\\\t &#39;, &#39;&#39;)\r\n    return address\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(get_ip_address(&#39;google.com&#39;))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Even though situation is described for expanding cluster, it also might happen during regular operation of big cluster. Basically, it&#39;s very likely, that _Kafka distributes partitions between broker nodes unevenly_.\r\n\r\n So, it might be that `kafka1.com:9092` is leader for big fraction of partitions in the cluster, and therefore,  has increased CPU/disk/network usage (because biggest fraction of consumers connects to it + overhead spent on replication). \r\n\r\n The solution to this problem is [**explicitly reassigning partitions**](https://kafka.apache.org/0101/documentation.html#basic_ops_partitionassignment).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **Uneven leader election (and repeated leader re-balancing)**\r\n \r\n This usually happens together with uneven partitions distribution. Basically, if leader nodes are overwhelmed, Kafka will decide to re-elect the leaders. However, since partitions are distributed unevenly - it doesn&#39;t help, causing more leader re-elections, and thus - increasing load on the cluster.\r\n\r\n The solution to this problem is [**increasing replication factor**](https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#replication-factor-parm) (together with [partition reassignment](https://kafka.apache.org/0101/documentation.html#basic_ops_increase_replication_factor)). \r\n\r\n It might look counter-intuitive (since, increasing replication factor increases replication overhead). However, this hints Kafka to distribute data between more nodes, thus *helping to off-load overwhelmed ones*.\r\n\r\n3. **Uneven message distribution between partitions (and corresponding broker nodes)**\r\n \r\n Basically, if application uses [DefaultPartitioner](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/DefaultPartitioner.java) (which is usually the case), you might not get round-robin distribution of messages between partitions. According Kafka FAQ: [if there are fewer producers than partitions, at a given point of time, some partitions may not receive any data](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/FAQ#FAQ-Whyisdatanotevenlydistributedamongpartitionswhenapartitioningkeyisnotspecified?). As a consequence - some partitions (and corresponding broker nodes) might be over-loaded with data, and others - under-loaded.\r\n\r\nAlso, if cluster overall is busy when there is no actual input messages - it&#39;s usually caused by Kafka trying to sync all replicas with offsets and ACKs.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205260/starting-a-lot-of-kafka-streams-loads-heavily-first-kafka-broker-in-a-list/58208046#58208046","title":"Starting a lot of kafka streams loads heavily first kafka broker in a list"}],"owner":{"reputation":73,"user_id":6300748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n5Pq4WrVZHs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANA/FuLvgqmquW0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Taras Danylchuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6300748/taras-danylchuk"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570093579,"creation_date":1570032297,"question_id":58205260,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205260","body_markdown":"I have kafka cluster of 15 nodes:\r\n```kafka1.com:9092,kafkaN.com:9092...,kafka10.com:9092```\r\n\r\nAlso I have application of 10 nodes which consumes around 100 topics(from 2 to 240 partitions).

For lists, I think you need to redefine the `readList` method in your `Read Card` instance. If you do that then the predefined instance `Read a =&gt; Read [a]` will automagically call your own `readList`, and everything should work.\r\n\r\nOne possible definition:\r\n\r\n    instance Read Card where\r\n      ...\r\n    \r\n      readList str = do\r\n          (card, rest) &lt;- reads str\r\n          if null rest then return ([card], &quot;&quot;)\r\n              else fmap (Data.Bifunctor.bimap (card:) id) (readList rest\r\n\r\nOr maybe:\r\n\r\n    import Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    instance Read Card where\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n      readList = readP_to_S (many (readS_to_P reads))\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nHowever, note also that a default `Show` and `Read` instance has some advantages:\r\n\r\n* It is usual — that is, people will know what to expect. With a custom instance, it is necessary to inspect the instance definition in order to use it correctly, while a default instance can be used immediately and effortlessly _(except for a lot of typing)_.\r\n* It is automatically generated — so it is unlikely there to be errors. It gives you a solid ground to stand on, for free, while a custom definition needs to be thoroughly checked if you want to ship the code in good faith.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it may be more reasonable to put the same code into monomorphic functions, like say `parseCard`, `parseCards`, `renderCard` and `renderCards`, and have the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nActually, I think custom `Read` instances are an obscure corner of Haskell. When I was researching for a similar problem a while ago, I could not find any guides on this subject. _(Compare with the abundance of guides on, say, cellular automata or free monads.)_ This is maybe because people mostly live with the default derived instances until they really need to parse a lot of data, which is when advanced parsing libraries, such as `parsec`, come into play.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205250/reading-a-custom-data-type-with-error-prelude-read-no-parse/58212397#58212397","title":"Reading a custom data type with error Prelude.read: no parse"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12154552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b6a8fe84f2022d2465baa28050d437b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alphawolf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154552/alphawolf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2397,"user_id":2108477,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f30268b2a1d0a8a18012e602cd3cb783?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ignat Insarov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2108477/ignat-insarov"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570080595,"creation_date":1570032261,"last_edit_date":1570078280,"question_id":58205250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205250","body_markdown":"I am extremely new to functional programming and I have few custom data types of the following to represent a deck of cards.\r\n\r\n**Data type for Suit**\r\n```\r\ndata Suit = Spade | Club | Diamond | Heart\r\n  deriving (Eq, Ord, Enum, Bounded)\r\n\r\ninstance Show Suit where\r\n  show Spade = &quot;S&quot;\r\n  show Club = &quot;C&quot;\r\n  show Diamond = &quot;D&quot;\r\n  show Heart = &quot;H&quot;\r\n\r\ninstance Read Suit where\r\n  readsPrec _ [] = []\r\n  readsPrec _ (s: str) = case s of\r\n    &#39;S&#39; -&gt; [(Spade, str)]\r\n    &#39;C&#39; -&gt; [(Club, str)]\r\n    &#39;D&#39; -&gt; [(Diamond, str)]\r\n    &#39;H&#39; -&gt; [(Heart, str)]\r\n    _ -&gt; []\r\n```\r\n**Data type for Rank**\r\n```\r\ndata Rank = Two | Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven | Eight | Nine | Ten\r\n          | Jack | Queen | King | Ace\r\n  deriving (Eq, Ord, Enum, Bounded)\r\n\r\ninstance Show Rank where\r\n  show Ace = &quot;A&quot;\r\n  show King = &quot;K&quot;\r\n  show Queen = &quot;Q&quot;\r\n  show Jack = &quot;J&quot;\r\n  show rank = show $ fromEnum rank + 2\r\n\r\ninstance Read Rank where\r\n  readsPrec _ [] = []\r\n  readsPrec _ (s: str) = case s of\r\n      &#39;A&#39; -&gt; [(Ace, str)]\r\n      &#39;K&#39; -&gt; [(King, str)]\r\n      &#39;Q&#39; -&gt; [(Queen, str)]\r\n      &#39;J&#39; -&gt; [(Jack, str)]\r\n      _   -&gt; readNum\r\n    where\r\n      readNum\r\n        | s &gt;= &#39;2&#39; &amp;&amp; s &lt;= &#39;9&#39; = [(toEnum (ord s - ord &#39;2&#39;) :: Rank, str)]\r\n        | s == &#39;1&#39; = readZero str -- Read a following 0\r\n        | otherwise = []\r\n      readZero (&#39;0&#39;: rest) = [(Ten, rest)]\r\n      readZero _ = []\r\n```\r\n**Data type for Card**\r\n```\r\ndata Card = Card Suit Rank\r\n  deriving (Eq)\r\n\r\ninstance Show Card where\r\n  show (Card suit rank) = show suit ++ show rank\r\n\r\ninstance Read Card where\r\n  readsPrec _ str = do\r\n     (s, rest) &lt;- reads str\r\n     (r, end) &lt;- reads rest\r\n     return (Card s r, end)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I typed ```read &quot;S3H5&quot; :: Card``` in my stack ghci console, it shows an exception error of ```*** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse```. \r\n\r\n**May I ask how to fix this?**\r\n\r\nI have a string of Card information, for instance, &quot;S3HA&quot; which represents two Cards:\r\n\r\n- Spade Three\r\n- Heart Ace\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to achieve:\r\n\r\nWhen I read the string of &quot;S3HA&quot;, I want the output to be an array of\r\n\r\n```[Card Spade Three, Card Heart Ace]```\r\n\r\n**Please advise!

Instead of sending HTTP GET readiness probe every second, is there a way to set pod as unready when it starts to process a POST request.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205189/how-to-set-pod-as-unready-without-using-readinessprobe","title":"How to set pod as unready without using readinessProbe?"},{"tags":["azure-data-factory","azure-data-factory-2","arm-template"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1341,"user_id":3932615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB1Ma.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3932615/neil-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570195424,"post_id":58235177,"comment_id":102847422,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205188/how-to-add-variables-to-the-data-factory-arm-template/58235177#comment102847422_58235177"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":105,"user_id":10653466,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04d570e279514ab8dfc0b9bb89893a36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chiragMishra-msft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10653466/chiragmishra-msft"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570187127,"creation_date":1570187127,"answer_id":58235177,"question_id":58205188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58235177","body_markdown":"You can add parameters to your Azure data factory by having a parameters JSON file and deploying the ADF with the parameters as follows :\r\n\r\nNew-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name MyARMDeployment -ResourceGroupName ADFTutorialResourceGroup -TemplateFile C:\\ADFTutorial\\ADFTutorialARM.json -TemplateParameterFile C:\\ADFTutorial\\ADFTutorialARM-Parameters.json\r\nFor more information, please refer the following doc :\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-resource-manager-template#parameters-json\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205188/how-to-add-variables-to-the-data-factory-arm-template/58235177#58235177","title":"How to add variables to the data factory ARM Template"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1341,"user_id":3932615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB1Ma.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3932615/neil-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570436297,"post_id":58252856,"comment_id":102899142,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205188/how-to-add-variables-to-the-data-factory-arm-template/58252856#comment102899142_58252856"},{"owner":{"reputation":1341,"user_id":3932615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB1Ma.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3932615/neil-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570436810,"post_id":58252856,"comment_id":102899338,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205188/how-to-add-variables-to-the-data-factory-arm-template/58252856#comment102899338_58252856"},{"owner":{"reputation":1341,"user_id":3932615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB1Ma.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3932615/neil-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570443687,"post_id":58252856,"comment_id":102902468,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205188/how-to-add-variables-to-the-data-factory-arm-template/58252856#comment102902468_58252856"},{"owner":{"reputation":216,"user_id":3603134,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/748001012/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kamil Nowinski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3603134/kamil-nowinski"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1341,"user_id":3932615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB1Ma.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3932615/neil-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570452330,"post_id":58252856,"comment_id":102906638,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205188/how-to-add-variables-to-the-data-factory-arm-template/58252856#comment102906638_58252856"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":216,"user_id":3603134,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/748001012/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kamil Nowinski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3603134/kamil-nowinski"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570314942,"creation_date":1570314942,"answer_id":58252856,"question_id":58205188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58252856","body_markdown":"Your example is not so bad.

When I shift the window to another monitor having another screen scaling, I receive and process the `WM_DPICHANGED_AFTERPARENT` message.\r\n\r\nMy owner drawn combo box (with style `CBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED`) is already filled with items which height I need to update according to the new scaling factor. For this I calculate the new height and call:\r\n\r\n    SetItemHeight(-1, height); // resizes the closed box\r\n    SetItemHeight(0, height); // do this on every item&#39;s index from 0 to n\r\n\r\nProblem: A combo box not yet opened in former scaling, but opened after having changed the items&#39; height appears wrong. The list opens with the second half of all entries and the lower half is empty. Closing and re-opening it fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nI tried workarounds I know from other update problems like `Invalidate()`, show and hide the combo box, but it doesn&#39;t help.\r\nComplete re-filling all entries works, but this is slow and leads into flickering (I&#39;m having 12 such boxes in that window).\r\n\r\nAny idea? Thank you!\r\n\r\nEDIT: The problem obviously only occurs when **increasing** the items&#39; height (so when moving my window from the 100% to the 200% monitor).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205173/change-a-combo-box-items-height-lateron-for-dpi-awareness","title":"Change a combo box&#39; items&#39; height lateron (for DPI awareness)"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","multithreading","python-2.x","python-3.7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":67453,"user_id":354577,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd5da70153eaf04130797a71d78a01ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/354577/chris"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570034130,"post_id":58205172,"comment_id":102789537,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205172/python-2-to-3-slower-thread-execution#comment102789537_58205172"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11709814,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ozhg74QXBgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfvdR3mX0ub3kWMzpw9NPke9btGEQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"DTake","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11709814/dtake"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":67453,"user_id":354577,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd5da70153eaf04130797a71d78a01ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/354577/chris"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570034303,"post_id":58205172,"comment_id":102789628,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205172/python-2-to-3-slower-thread-execution#comment102789628_58205172"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11709814,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ozhg74QXBgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfvdR3mX0ub3kWMzpw9NPke9btGEQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"DTake","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11709814/dtake"},"last_editor":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570031931,"creation_date":1570031911,"last_edit_date":1570031931,"question_id":58205172,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205172","body_markdown":"Can someone tell me if the threading was slowed from Python 2 to Python 3? I&#39;m currently converting my Python 2 software to Python 3, and now it is all laggy due to the fact that I have simultaneous threads.\r\n\r\nMy software basically acquires data, displays it and saves it to a file. I start doing this in a given thread A. Thread A then starts an acquisition using a thread B (which receives data through a callback from an API, every 1ms, and puts it in a queue; all in Thread B), and a file-writing thread C (which receives data through a queue). Furthermore, Thread A (after starting Threads B and C) also has a loop which continuously gets gata from the data queue and sends it for display.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;ve noticed that if I don&#39;t start the file-writing thread, my code is fast as an eagle. However, when I initialise it, it gets slow as a turtle (for example, the callback from the API which receives data, gets data only every 100ms or so). This code was fast with Python 2 but now in Python 3 is slow, without changing anything from my code. Any clue on how to fix this?\r\n\r\nPS. I don&#39;t use any asyncio stuff in here.

Allocate two conversion descriptors:\r\n    ```\r\n    iconv_t cd0 = iconv_open(&quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n    iconv_t cd1 = iconv_open(&quot;ASCII//TRANSLIT&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n    ```\r\n 2. Use a loop that converts part of the string repeatedly, through iconv() with `cd1`. When the call fails with errno == EILSEQ, you know that it&#39;s because of a character that cannot be transliterated to ASCII.\r\n 3. At this point use an iconv() call with `cd0`, to convert one and only one character. You do this by calling iconv() with in = 1, then if that fails with in = 2, and so on up to in = 4. (If all of these fail, you must have invalid input; your best bet is to skip one input byte and leave a single &#39;?&#39; in output.)\r\n 4. After the no-op conversion of a single character, go back to step 2.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205170/iconv-retaining-characters-that-cannot-be-converted-to-ascii/58209725#58209725","title":"iconv - retaining characters that cannot be converted to ascii"}],"owner":{"reputation":6622,"user_id":131050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3be77c4c9c91bb4e70ae93a2e23752e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jeffreyveon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/131050/jeffreyveon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":572,"user_id":1616622,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AD515.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saxtheowl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1616622/saxtheowl"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570084274,"creation_date":1570031909,"last_edit_date":1570084274,"question_id":58205170,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205170","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using iconv&#39;s transliterate function to convert a unicode string to the nearest ASCII equivalent.

(I would think so based on other parts of your code.)  \r\n\r\nThis statement does not enable the ECHO and ECHOE attributes, but ends up merely preserving whatever state they are already in.  \r\nThis is a latent bug that is, by dumb luck, likely never to be triggered.\r\n\r\nSince both of the following statements use the same index, VMIN,  shouldn&#39;t one of them be indexing VTIME instead?  \r\n\r\n        new_settings.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;\r\n        new_settings.c_cc[VMIN] = 0;  \r\n\r\n---  \r\n\r\n&gt; i have created a conditional statement that when the users press backspace it should remove the previous character by going one character back.\r\n\r\nNote that your code only tries to &quot;*remove the previous character&quot;* that is displayed.  \r\nThere is no attempt to &quot;*remove the previous character&quot;* from the input buffer.  \r\nThis is probably another bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; But when i press Backspace instead of removing the character it prints ^? on that line.\r\n\r\nThat doesn&#39;t seem to be an accurate reporting of what your code does.  \r\n\r\nWhen I executed your code in a PC terminal window (LXTerminal 0.2.0), I end up seeing just `^` rather than the `^?` that you report for the Backspace key.  \r\nTo be clear, the Backspace key is echoed/displayed as `^?` (because ECHOCTL is enabled by default), but your program tries to perform additional processing in response to that particular input, and that results in displaying just `^`.\r\n\r\nYour code assumes that each input character is echoed (i.e. displayed) as a single character.  \r\nThat&#39;s a faulty assumption.  \r\nA key that generates an ASCII control code instead of a printable character will be echoed/displayed as two characters (as you reported).  \r\nA &quot;special&quot; key (from a PC keyboard) that doesn&#39;t readily map to an ASCII code will be read as an escape sequence, i.e. a sequence of several (3 to 5 or more) characters.  \r\n\r\nIf you expect to &quot;erase&quot; or overwrite the previous character as well as the echoed Backspace, then your code would need to go back (at least) three (3) characters.  \r\nIn other words  \r\n\r\n            const char delbuf[] = &quot;\\b \\b&quot;;\r\n\r\nneeds to be   \r\n\r\n            const char delbuf[] = &quot;\\b\\b\\b   \\b\\b\\b&quot;;\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a complete solution because it can only &quot;remove&quot; a single previous character, and a previous control character or an escape sequence will not be handled correctly.  \r\nThis answer is only to explain why you are not getting the result you expect.  \r\n\r\n---  \r\n\r\nBe aware that the use of local echo (by termios) could be considered part of the problem since you don&#39;t seem to grasp the ramifications.  \r\nNon-canonical mode typically suppresses any automatic echoing so that handling of control characters and escape sequences is simplified.  \r\n\r\nFYI if there was no automatic echo, then the `backspace, space, backspace` sequence you tried to use could be effective (because there is only the one previous character to overwrite and there would be no echo of the Backspace).\r\n\r\n---  \r\n\r\nNote that your code uses a *busy wait* to check/retrieve the keyboard input (because VTIME is likely set to 0 and VMIN is 0).  \r\nThis is the *most* inefficient method of input that wastes CPU cycles, and on a battery-powered system drains the battery faster than necessary.  \r\nEven if you added a delay, the code would still be inefficiently *polling* the system buffer for data instead of utilizing the efficient *event-driven* capabilities provided by the OS.  \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205140/backspace-b-not-clearing-text-in-non-canonical-mode-termios/58211729#58211729","title":"Backspace(\\b) not clearing text in Non-canonical mode termios"}],"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":6567890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e27a30b399982655663b8483e0c21c70?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Osama X&#228;w&#227;&#241;z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6567890/osama-x%c3%a4w%c3%a3%c3%b1z"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11437,"user_id":1599004,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df9d2a02744f666e97375e05fdc54255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sawdust","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1599004/sawdust"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58211729,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570130166,"creation_date":1570031812,"last_edit_date":1570071193,"question_id":58205140,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205140","body_markdown":"i am trying to clear text by pressing the backspace key, i am using termios in non canonical mode. i have created a conditional statement that when the users press backspace it should remove the previous character by going one character back.\r\n\r\nBut when i press Backspace instead of removing the character it prints `^?` on that line.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want to use canonical mode.\r\n\r\nMy Code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;termios.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

Fortunately, there are just 12 distinct types of files and thus 12 types of names...starting with &#39;ABC&#39;, &#39;CN&#39;, &#39;CZ&#39;, etc.  Thanks for the look here.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on your comments, Abraham, it seems like my code should look like this, right...\r\n\r\n\r\n    file_list=[]\r\n    path = &#39;dbfs/rawdata/2019/06/28/Parent/&#39;\r\n    files  = dbutils.fs.ls(path)\r\n    for file in files:\r\n        if(file.name.startswith(&#39;ABC&#39;)):\r\n           file_list.append(file.name)\r\n    df = spark.read.load(path=file_list)\r\n\r\nIs this correct, or is this not correct?  Please advise.  I think we are close, but this still doesn&#39;t work for me, or I wouldn&#39;t be re-posting here.

There is only one pass where the `params` would be replaced by its values. In my case `params` i.e. `start_date` and `end_date` are themselves templates which means they would be replace by their corresponding macro definitions (i.e `{{ macros.my_plugin.start_date(execution_date) }}` ) but not with the output of those `macros` i.e. something like `2019-10-10`. On doing some trial runs I figured out that I don&#39;t really had to pass in `start_date` and `end_date` as params to the `PostgresOperator`. I could just template out `start_date` and `end_date` in my Sql file and as part of initial pass of templating these variables will the replaced by their corresponding values as computed via `macros` representing them. \r\n\r\nHopefully this will help someone in future who is as new to templating in `airflow` as I am.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205125/templating-in-airflow/58368615#58368615","title":"Templating in Airflow"}],"owner":{"reputation":1581,"user_id":2649963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6Iqt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prateek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649963/prateek"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58368615,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571009921,"creation_date":1570031779,"question_id":58205125,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205125","body_markdown":"Folks, pretty new to Airflow.

If that gets returned on the POST I can do the rest.

Just because &quot;the os should be able to access the screen&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that **you** (in userland) should be able to do that. And most certainly, under Windows you have no unfettered screen access, not least because of DRM: there is a [protected media path (PMP)][pmp] for protected video and audio content, and you won&#39;t be able to sniff it from an arbitrary process.\r\n\r\nSo: whatever night light you may implement by accessing the screen contents, won&#39;t work as soon as any protected content is displayed, e.g. from Netflix, Hulu, Youtube Red, system DVD player, BluRay player, etc. To get around PMP you&#39;d need to write a driver, sign it using an EV code signing certificate, and then submit it for automated [attestation signing by Microsoft][as]. And you&#39;d not dare put it on the web, because Microsoft would blacklist that driver (i.e. its presence in the kernel would cause PMP-using applications to refuse to play protected content), and perhaps quickly at that.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, there are several ways that Windows could implement it, but we don&#39;t care because we&#39;re not writing a direct replacement for the Windows Night Light component. All we have access to is userland. Here&#39;s what we got to work with, then:\r\n\r\n1. The most legacy-compatible way would be to [`SetDeviceGammaRamp`][ramp], but this has caveats: Windows doesn&#39;t allow compressing the color too much, and it&#39;s quite arbitrary about what it allows. So that API may fail if you try to do &quot;too much&quot;.\r\n\r\n2. The next most compatible approach would be to use the [Magnification Api][magapi].\r\n\r\n3. The last approach, working only on your own application&#39;s window, would be to apply a [shader to your window][shader].\r\n\r\n[as]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/attestation-signing-a-kernel-driver-for-public-release\r\n[pmp]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/protected-media-path\r\n[ramp]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8359607/correct-usage-of-setdevicegammaramp\r\n[magapi]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32929962/1329652\r\n[shader]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32929962/1329652","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205092/how-is-windows-10-night-light-implemented/58206627#58206627","title":"How is Windows 10 Night Light implemented?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4824,"user_id":2742717,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d1dec1aa6accf3589489ebd42634f7a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Swift - Friday Pie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2742717/swift-friday-pie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4824,"user_id":2742717,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d1dec1aa6accf3589489ebd42634f7a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Swift - Friday Pie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2742717/swift-friday-pie"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570086466,"last_edit_date":1570086466,"creation_date":1570038599,"answer_id":58206762,"question_id":58205092,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58206762","body_markdown":"This can be emulated using color correction scheme.
