normally, obfuscators will minify the code and perhaps make things more obscure. As is already well established on the internet, you cannot prevent viewable source code (i.e. JavaScript in the browser), or even any code executed on a client computer at all, from being hacked. Not only that, but there are deobfuscators and code inferencers (e.g. [JSNice][1]) out there that make viewing and understanding the source code extraordinarily easy.\r\n\r\nWhat if your goal, however, would just be to make it extremely difficult to **tamper** with the code, or perhaps even to **steal the code and put it on another website**? The goal would be to deter people enough that they would rather rewrite the code from scratch than steal or tamper with your existing work.\r\n\r\nWhat methods might one employ to accomplish this effectively? (I&#39;m also interested in any well-defined concepts in this area.) Rules are:\r\n\r\n 1. Can&#39;t significantly bog down the client-side code, to the point that it&#39;s laggy on slower computers.\r\n 2. Utilizing server code in any way is allowed, e.g. sending different arrangements of the code to the client, sending hash strings, etc. (This does not include replacing the client altogether, of course; there will be live user interaction and such.)\r\n 3. Regular load times of a few seconds or less is acceptable.\r\n 4. Browser JavaScript is the preferred answer language/environment, but other ideas such as hosting JavaScript in a client application or using a standard client are also welcome.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jsnice.org","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400301/how-might-you-obfuscate-code-for-the-purpose-of-mitigating-tampering-and-or-thef","title":"How might you obfuscate code for the purpose of mitigating tampering and/or theft?"},{"tags":["java","generics"],"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11861129"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571164330,"post_id":58400299,"comment_id":103146610,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400299/why-is-a-wild-card-type-argument-not-within-bounds-in-wrapper-around-a-selfrefer#comment103146610_58400299"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12221720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d748f3f3f49fb28fd1c3f24a53e3c500?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sniperrifle2004","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12221720/sniperrifle2004"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571164733,"post_id":58400299,"comment_id":103146781,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400299/why-is-a-wild-card-type-argument-not-within-bounds-in-wrapper-around-a-selfrefer#comment103146781_58400299"},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11861129"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571165088,"post_id":58400299,"comment_id":103146951,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400299/why-is-a-wild-card-type-argument-not-within-bounds-in-wrapper-around-a-selfrefer#comment103146951_58400299"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12221720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d748f3f3f49fb28fd1c3f24a53e3c500?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sniperrifle2004","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12221720/sniperrifle2004"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12221720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d748f3f3f49fb28fd1c3f24a53e3c500?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sniperrifle2004","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12221720/sniperrifle2004"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":96,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571236960,"creation_date":1571162471,"last_edit_date":1571236960,"question_id":58400299,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400299","body_markdown":"I have an interface that contains methods that return or require instances of the imlementing type.

However, as it moved closer towards the center of the screen, it becomes upwards of 100 pixels off.

The `required` prop is just passed down to the `input` element which will get used by the wrapping `form` [(explanation of required)](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_required.asp). So if the form isn&#39;t the one calling your submit function, `required` will be ignored.\r\n\r\nLastly, I only provided a simple validate function, if you want it to be more comprehensive, just add more checks and return specific errors or an array of errors instead of a simple true or false. You could also skip the validation function completely if a simple required check is all you need.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400278/how-to-add-validation-in-material-ui-form-input-fields/58401223#58401223","title":"How to add validation in Material ui form input fields"}],"owner":{"reputation":1160,"user_id":5288074,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25380be006e12602a7627270d2bb5956?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5288074/lara"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1160,"user_id":5288074,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25380be006e12602a7627270d2bb5956?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5288074/lara"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58401223,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571168186,"creation_date":1571162399,"last_edit_date":1571162798,"question_id":58400278,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400278","body_markdown":"I have a react functional component built using Material ui form which contains `TextField` and `onChange` event is handled in &quot;Container Component&quot;.

And certain standard libraries, like [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/lib/webpacker/railtie.rb#L77), insist on injecting `TaggedLogging`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve come up with the metaprogramming hack below to prevent `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging::Formatter#call` from overriding the superclass implementation (in this case from Ougai):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyBunyanFormatter &lt; Ougai::Formatters::Bunyan\r\n  def extend(mod)\r\n    return super unless mod.method_defined?(:call)\r\n    \r\n    call_original = self.method(:call)            # 1. preserve original\r\n    super(mod)                                    # 2. overridden here\r\n    define_singleton_method(:call, call_original) # 3. de-overridden here\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s clunky and counterintuitive, and I&#39;m not excited about it.\r\n\r\nThe other alternative, [at least in the case of Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/lib/webpacker/railtie.rb#L74), seems to be to write a custom logger that implements `tagged()`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyLogger &lt; Ougai::Logger\r\n  def tagged(*tags)\r\n    # do something with tags\r\n    yield self\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis at least doesn&#39;t involve any metaprogramming shenanigans, but I wonder if I can count on other libraries besides Webpacker not to inject `TaggedLogging` anyway.\r\n\r\nSurely I&#39;m not the first person to have this problem since people started trying to do structured logging from Rails apps.

When I run the script from inside the custom IDE, I get an error related to the `import Camelot` line, which says &quot;Camelot module not found.&quot;\r\n\r\nI do know there is a folder for the custom IDE where I should place .py files for importing.  The problem is the only file I can find for Camelot in my file structure is a `camelot.exe` file.  Does anyone know what .py file actually gets imported for the `import Camelot` command?\r\n  [1]: https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400256/python-import-camelot-module-not-found-inside-custom-ide","title":"Python Import Camelot module not found inside custom IDE"},{"tags":["oracle","oracle11g"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10385,"user_id":1156452,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/okUnm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"thatjeffsmith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1156452/thatjeffsmith"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571162933,"creation_date":1571162933,"answer_id":58400404,"question_id":58400254,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400404","body_markdown":"I see at least two issues, you can&#39;t declare foreign key constraints like that, and you can&#39;t have a column named DATE - because it&#39;s a reserved word.\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE TRANSACTION_ORDER (\r\n           NATIONAL_ID      VARCHAR2(20),\r\n           CONSTRAINT ID_XFK FOREIGN KEY ( NATIONAL_ID )\r\n                  REFERENCES CLIENT ( NATIONAL_ID ),\r\n           ACCOUNT_NO       VARCHAR2(25),\r\n           CONSTRAINT NO_XFK FOREIGN KEY ( ACCOUNT_NO )\r\n                  REFERENCES ACCOUNT ( ACCOUNT_NO ),\r\n           TRANSACTION_ID   VARCHAR2(20),\r\n           CONSTRAINT TRAN_ID_XFK FOREIGN KEY ( TRANSACTION_ID )\r\n                  REFERENCES TRANSACTION ( TRANSACTION_ID ),\r\n           DATES            DATE NOT NULL,\r\n           TIME             NUMBER(10) NOT NULL,\r\n           PLACE            VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,\r\n           NEW_BALANCE      VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL\r\n    );\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t change DATE to &quot;DATE&quot; to get around the reserved word issue - that will cause you problems in your application stack later, and esp as people try to query the data back out.

AWS account has users. We are now trying to use CI using Terraform to manage the old users and the new users. Terraform requires complete control of the service - agreed, but how can I make it work with what exists? \r\nProblem : I am able to add groups,roles,policies to the new users created via terraform but I am unable to add groups/policies/edit the users that were previously created on AWS account.\r\n\r\nI am on Terraform version 12.\r\n\r\nI have tried to use the data resource and count to check for its existence \r\n```\r\n#data &quot;aws_iam_user&quot; &quot;upload_iam_user&quot; {\r\n#  user_name = &quot;${var.service_name}&quot;\r\n#}\r\n\r\n#resource &quot;aws_iam_user&quot; &quot;upload_iam_user&quot; {\r\n#  count= &quot;${data.aws_iam_user.upload_iam_user != &quot;null&quot; ? 0 : 1}&quot;\r\n#  name = &quot;${var.service_name}&quot;\r\n#}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis data only checks if it exists but, it does not perform the creation if it does not exist and errors out to say that the user does not exist.\r\n\r\n```provider &quot;aws&quot; {\r\n  region                  = &quot;${var.aws_region}&quot;\r\n  shared_credentials_file = &quot;~/.aws/credentials&quot;\r\n  profile                 = &quot;aws-users-account\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;aws_iam_user&quot; &quot;upload_iam_user&quot; {\r\n  name = &quot;${var.service_name}&quot;\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;aws_iam_access_key&quot; &quot;upload_iam_access_key&quot; {\r\n  user = &quot;${aws_iam_user.upload_iam_user.name}&quot;\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;aws_iam_user_login_profile&quot; &quot;upload_iam_password&quot; {\r\n  user    =

&quot;${aws_iam_user.upload_iam_user.name}&quot;\r\n  groups = &quot;${var.group_name}&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code works only for new users. what is the logic I can use to \r\nfirst : check if the input user exists, if it does, then add the group list that is given\r\nsecond: check if the inpout user exists, if no, create it and add the groups\r\n\r\nTIA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400231/using-terraform-how-to-check-and-edit-users-on-aws-that-already-exist","title":"Using terraform - how to check and edit users on

struggle with linking one (tooltip) element to another element. The tooltip element should show up once the user hovers the other element. \r\n\r\nMy idea is to set up a jQuery hover function accordingly to manipulate the display property.\r\n\r\n**So my questions basically are**\r\n\r\n1. How to structure this kind of function in jQuery? Right now there is no effect at all when hovering, even when I just try `alert(&quot;Test&quot;)` on hover. It seems the created elements are not recognized by the mouse pointer.\r\n\r\n2. How to place the tooltip element next to the initial element when hovering? (Right now the tooltip elements are hidden by default and don&#39;t take any place in the HTML body)\r\n\r\n**This is the JS part, where no hover effect is showing yet (example with one tooltip)**\r\n```\r\n$( &quot;#id10&quot;

I want to implement it separately, it should be independent. \r\n\r\nI also used react-router so please help me to achieve my goal ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400213/how-to-import-sass-file-to-single-components-in-react","title":"How to Import sass file to single components in React"},{"tags":["r","dataframe","dplyr","running-total"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4786,"user_id":4421870,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38f9356608b91648b260644fc7a1b6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mako212","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4421870/mako212"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571162764,"post_id":58400212,"comment_id":103145961,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400212/running-count-of-a-character-variable-when-a-condition-matches-in-r#comment103145961_58400212"},{"owner":{"reputation":18357,"user_id":8380272,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3ZL-hcLCA44/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAag/L1xahsLXycQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Onyambu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8380272/onyambu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571162791,"post_id":58400212,"comment_id":103145970,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400212/running-count-of-a-character-variable-when-a-condition-matches-in-r#comment103145970_58400212"},{"owner":{"reputation":16611,"user_id":6851825,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H8RgwclGboU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE4/ozMptPuddJ0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jon Spring","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6851825/jon-spring"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571162801,"post_id":58400212,"comment_id":103145980,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400212/running-count-of-a-character-variable-when-a-condition-matches-in-r#comment103145980_58400212"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":10605121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-un5tBTnqRJQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAaCM/_zXQGMfKpX4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Israel Gir&#243;n-Palacios","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10605121/israel-gir%c3%b3n-palacios"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4786,"user_id":4421870,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38f9356608b91648b260644fc7a1b6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mako212","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4421870/mako212"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571163250,"post_id":58400212,"comment_id":103146175,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400212/running-count-of-a-character-variable-when-a-condition-matches-in-r#comment103146175_58400212"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":10605121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-un5tBTnqRJQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAaCM/_zXQGMfKpX4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Israel Gir&#243;n-Palacios","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10605121/israel-gir%c3%b3n-palacios"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571168134,"post_id":58400587,"comment_id":103148165,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400212/running-count-of-a-character-variable-when-a-condition-matches-in-r/58400587#comment103148165_58400587"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":25763,"user_id":7128934,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oI2SB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"d.b","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128934/d-b"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25763,"user_id":7128934,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oI2SB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"d.b","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128934/d-b"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571164329,"last_edit_date":1571164329,"creation_date":1571163820,"answer_id":58400587,"question_id":58400212,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400587","body_markdown":"    library(dplyr)\r\n    df %&gt;%\r\n        group_by(box.a) %&gt;%\r\n        mutate(count = pmax(0, lag(cumsum(selection == box.a)), na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\r\n        ungroup()\r\n    ## A tibble: 7 x 4\r\n    #  box.a box.b selection count\r\n    #  &lt;fct&gt;

Put all of the pieces together on the producer side, and keep things real simple on the READER ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nDuh...\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400208/snowflake-reader-account-1-db-2-schemas/58400521#58400521","title":"Snowflake: READER ACCOUNT, 1 DB, 2 Schemas"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12189964,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d20326616b3a0ab02fddcfa25331fe3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DaveTurpin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12189964/daveturpin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12189964,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d20326616b3a0ab02fddcfa25331fe3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DaveTurpin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12189964/daveturpin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571163489,"creation_date":1571162136,"last_edit_date":1571162799,"question_id":58400208,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400208","body_markdown":"I am running into strange behavior when attempting to share 2 schemas from a single database to a SNOWFLAKE READER ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nAssuming both schemas on the producer database are properly shared the commands to create the database and shares on the READER ACCOUNT would look something like:\r\n\r\n    CREATE DATABASE myDB_A from share producerAccount.Producer_SHARE_Schema_A;\r\n    CREATE DATABASE myDB_B from share producerAccount.Producer_SHARE_Schema_B;\r\n\r\nWhere \r\n\r\n - Producer_SHARE_Schema_A is a share that looks like myDB.Schema_A and\r\n - Producer_SHARE_Schema_B is a share that looks like myDB.Schema_B\r\n\r\nWhat seems to happen is myDB_A will have Schema_A and when the second command is run, myDB_A also picks up Schema_B.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would need a command that allows us to add a second schema to the database, using an ALTER approach:\r\n\r\n    CREATE DATABASE myDB_A from share producerAccount.Producer_SHARE_Schema_A;\r\n    **ALTER DATABASE myDB_B ADD share producerAccount.Producer_SHARE_Schema_B**;\r\n\r\nThe final question...

The tutorial is based on **YOLOV3** which is one of the state-of-the-art object detection models which is fast enough to be used in real-time and videos. On the page you mentioned, in **step 1** it explains how to prepare and annotate your dataset. Your data can have many categories of objects (like cars, hololens, etc) but you need to set this number in before training. Also, in the annotation step (giving label to the objects) you should assign the right names to the objects.\r\n\r\nThere is a link on this page that explains how to prepare your own data:\r\n[Object Detection Training — Preparing your custom dataset](https://medium.com/deepquestai/object-detection-training-preparing-your-custom-dataset-6248679f0d1d)\r\n\r\nIf the data is already prepared make sure it is in Pascal Voc format as it is necessary to be consistent with the model you are using. In the end, you only need one model to detect all kinds of objects. The accuracy depends on the number of iterations, the number of objects in each class, variety in shape, size, color, angle, etc of the objects and so on.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400185/create-custom-detection-model-image-object-detection/58400482#58400482","title":"Create custom detection model - Image Object Detection"}],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":8050649,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7fbf43bad5e6da15fb4b87fcdac0ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tony Starkus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8050649/tony-starkus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":6129428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7dab9d0dec9975a9de1237243c42804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hadi GhahremanNezhad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6129428/hadi-ghahremannezhad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58400482,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571163344,"creation_date":1571162044,"last_edit_date":1571162868,"question_id":58400185,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400185","body_markdown":"I have some questions about object detections in images/videos.\r\n\r\nI tried this tutorial with success:\r\n[Train Object Detection AI with 6 lines of code](https://medium.com/deepquestai/train-object-detection-ai-with-6-lines-of-code-6d087063f6ff)\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we train a model to detect hololens.

It depends on used widgets and columnspans.  \r\nYou are using `sticky=&#39;nsew&#39;` overall, change to `sticky=&#39;ew&#39;` if you don&#39;t want to grow to `sn`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne possible option is, to use different `weight=` values, to give the Grid Manager a hint, which widget you want to be **more weighted**, e.g:\r\n```\r\n            f.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)\r\n            f.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=1)\r\n            f.grid_columnconfigure(2, weight=2)\r\n            f.grid_columnconfigure(3, weight=4)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother option is, to use `.grid_columnconfigure(c, minsize=&lt;minsize&gt;)`.  \r\nThis forces the Grid Manager to obey a `minsize=` for a column.\r\n&gt;**Source**: `tkinter.__init__: def grid_columnconfigure(...`  \r\n&gt;Valid resources are:\r\n&gt;\r\n- minsize (minimum size of the column),\r\n- weight (how much does additional space propagate to this column)\r\n- pad (how much space to let additionally)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the results are also not predictable, at best at fixed window size.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo get it work on window resizing, bind the `&lt;Configure&gt;` event to the `Frame` and   \r\nset the same **calculated** `minsize=` for every column.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1] [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport tkinter as tk\r\n\r\n\r\nclass App(tk.Tk):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n\r\n        f = tk.Frame(self)\r\n        f.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)\r\n        f.bind(&#39;&lt;Configure&gt;&#39;, self.on_configure)\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n            \r\n    def on_configure(self, event):\r\n        w = event.widget\r\n        columns = w.grid_size()[0]\r\n        minsize = w.winfo_width() // columns\r\n\r\n        for c in range(columns):\r\n            w.grid_columnconfigure(c, minsize=minsize)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    App().mainloop()\r\n```\r\n***Tested with Python: 3.5 -

The only way to ensure they are all the same size is if I set their `width` configuration to something like `width=10`.\r\n\r\nDesired layout:\r\n\r\n    +---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |                             L1                          |\r\n    +--------------+------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n    |      L2      |            |              |              |\r\n    +--------------+------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n    |                     E1                   |      B1      |\r\n    +--------------+------------+ -------------+--------------+\r\n    |      L3      |            |              |              |\r\n    +--------------+------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n    |                     E2                   |              |\r\n    +--------------+------------+ -------------+--------------+\r\n    |              |            |      B2      |      B3      |\r\n    +--------------+------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nTried to make the columns as close to even scale as possible. But the layout is a grid of 5 rows and 4 columns. The top label `L1` would span all columns in the first row. The two entry widgets `E1` and `E2` would span the first 3 columns in their respective rows. For some reason, `B2` is receiving less size.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Best I can determine is that the `Entry`  widget causes weighted issues, but I do not know why. The same topic is answered by Bryan Oakley [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11473405/8371266) but I am confused as to why a default width on a widget doesn&#39;t become overwritten by the weight keyword of the grid manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400184/buttons-differently-sized-in-equally-weighted-grid-manager","title":"Buttons differently sized in equally weighted grid manager?"},{"tags":["android","mapbox-android"],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11291132,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Xpdro73MQxQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAdI/obI6sCsIulU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rakesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11291132/rakesh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11291132,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Xpdro73MQxQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAdI/obI6sCsIulU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rakesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11291132/rakesh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571248459,"creation_date":1571162022,"last_edit_date":1571248459,"question_id":58400181,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400181","body_markdown":"   Hello I am making Navigation App using Mapbox in which if user moves object and line will move together.Right now i am passing static lat long and\r\n    I refered https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/examples/moving-icon-with-trailing-line/ for animation but nothing is working App is working properly but polyline is not creating.

For instance:\r\n`desired_func(haystack, needle, get_depth = 1)` for the previous example would result in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nXY01 = list(\r\n  &quot;Z1&quot; = LETTERS[1:5],\r\n  &quot;Z2&quot; = LETTERS[6:10]\r\n)\r\n\r\n&gt; str(XY01)\r\nList of 2\r\n $ Z1: chr [1:5] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; ...\r\n $ Z2: chr [1:5] &quot;F&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;I&quot; ...\r\n````\r\n\r\nVery grateful for help! :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400176/r-find-object-by-name-in-deeply-nested-list","title":"R: Find object by name in deeply nested list"},{"tags":["r","stl","powerpoint","dml","rvg"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12222104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/073ccbd0fe8afe445675346b52c10740?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fireyrainchain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12222104/fireyrainchain"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571161977,"creation_date":1571161977,"question_id":58400174,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400174","body_markdown":"I am having trouble with plotting STL onto a PowerPoint slide in r.

seem to be getting confused between local and global variables. For `RandomNum` to be able to change the value of `Num1`, you need to make the variable global, otherwise, it will create a separate `Num1` variable that only applies for the duration of the `RandomNum` function. This is called scope. \r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n    def f():\r\n        a = 2 # this a is local to the f() function.\r\n        print(&#39;Inside of f (local scope), a =&#39;, a)\r\n    \r\n    a = 1 # this is set in the global scope\r\n    f()\r\n    print(&#39;On the global level (global scope) a =&#39;, a) # Now that are f() function is finished, a will go back to being equal to 1\r\n\r\nOutputs\r\n\r\n&gt; Inside of f (local scope), a = 2 \r\n\r\n&gt; On the global level (global scope) a = 1 \r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, you can declare a variable as being global, like so.\r\n\r\n    def f():\r\n        global a # this time a will refer to the same variable inside and outside of our f() function\r\n        a = 2\r\n        print(&#39;Inside of f (local scope), a =&#39;, a)\r\n    \r\n    a = 1\r\n    f()\r\n    print(&#39;On the global level (global scope) a =&#39;, a)\r\n\r\nAnd then you get\r\n\r\n&gt; Inside of f (local scope), a = 2\r\n\r\n&gt; On the global level (global scope) a = 2\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\nIf we apply this to your code, we can fix it like so.\r\n\r\n    import random\r\n    MinNum = int(0)\r\n    MaxNum = int(0)\r\n    Num1 = int(36)\r\n    \r\n    def RandomNum(x,y,z):\r\n        global MinNum, MaxNum, Num1\r\n        MinNum = x\r\n        MaxNum = y\r\n        Num1 = z\r\n        Num1 = Num1 - random.randint(MinNum, MaxNum)\r\n    \r\n    RandomNum(5,17,Num1)\r\n    print(Num1)\r\n\r\nHowever, it is far more common to have a function return something, instead of manipulating global variables.

This is how roughly how I use them:\r\n\r\n```\r\nToolTip tooltip = new ToolTip();\r\ntooltip.SetToolTip(someControl, someString);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**It works well in other places of the project, but in case of one ToolTip object in one Form in one Project, its tooltips do not show if I do not use a debugger**. That is, everything works perfectly in Debug mode with debugging, or Release mode with debugging, but in either mode without debugging, the tooltips simply do not show. Other tooltip objects in the same class which I use in conjuction with ToolTip.Show method instead of SetToolTip method do work! And in other projects, using SetToolTip method works just as fine. \r\n\r\n## What I tried ##\r\nI made a MouseHover event which looked like this:\r\n```\r\nprivate void someControl_MouseHover(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    tooltip.Show(&quot;Test&quot;, someControl);\r\n    SystemSounds.Exclamation.Play();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe event clearly fired, because I could hear the sound, but I still could not see the tooltip without a debugger!\r\nSo I made this change:\r\n```\r\nprivate void someControl_MouseHover(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    tooltip = new ToolTip();\r\n    tooltip.Show(&quot;Test&quot;, someControl);\r\n    SystemSounds.Exclamation.Play();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand now I could actually see the tooltip even without a debugger, but only on this particular Control (which made sense since I created a new ToolTip object).\r\n\r\nSo I thought since this helped maybe its something with the way my tooltip object was initialized (the line &quot;ToolTip tooltip = new ToolTip();&quot; was a declaration of a private field), so I put in &quot;ToolTip tooltip = new ToolTip();&quot; in the Form constructor right before the SetToolTip methods are called, but that did not help. It does not help even if I initialize the tooltip outside the Form constructor.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is that after trying the build out without a debugger, and then using the debugger again, the tooltips still don&#39;t show! I need to rebuild the solution to get them to work with debugger again.\r\n\r\nI tried the built .exe on a different machine too, and the tooltips don&#39;t show there either.\r\n\r\nIf I use the Design view of the Form to create a ToolTip object and then set tooltips for each Control in the Design view manually, the same thing happens! Maybe its because it calls that SetToolTip method as well.\r\n\r\nI also tried a clean installation of VS 2015 Professional (v 14.0.25431.01 Update 3) with no success.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI think there has to be something that changes when the project build is started without the debugger, as this change stays until the solution is rebuilt. But since I am not a software engineer and not knowledgeable about what Visual Studio actually does differently with my code if I use a debugger vs. when I do not use it, I have no idea how to troubleshoot this issue anymore. I don&#39;t even know what information to provide you with. The project is huge and I suspect the issue is not reproducible, since I think the issue is not with the code, but with some VS setup stuff. I just hope someone could point me in the right direction here.\r\n\r\nThe project where this issue appears uses NET 4.5.2 just like all the others and there are no differences with that project that I have discovered.\r\n\r\nIt also looks the the issue is connected to the ToolTip.SetToolTip method, as ToolTip.Show method works normally.\r\n\r\n## TL; DR ##\r\n\r\nOne of my WinForms tooltips shows up perfectly if I use a debugger, and doesn&#39;t show at all if I don&#39;t. It is the only thing which seems to be broken.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400159/winforms-tooltips-are-not-showing-when-visual-studio-debugger-is-not-attached","title":"WinForms tooltips are not showing when Visual Studio debugger is not attached"},{"tags":["python","python-2.7","dataframe"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1154,"user_id":7434857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1fC8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reznik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7434857/reznik"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571165312,"last_edit_date":1571165312,"creation_date":1571162664,"answer_id":58400337,"question_id":58400156,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400337","body_markdown":"You can simple change\r\n`df[&#39;the price;&#39;]` to  `df[&#39;the price;&#39;][:-2]`\r\n\r\nit called string slicing in python, you can read more about it in [here][1]\r\n\r\nThanks @[stovfl][2] to spot a mistake in my answer\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.pythoncentral.io/cutting-and-slicing-strings-in-python/\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/7414759/stovfl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400156/how-to-remove-the-last-character-from-a-column-of-data-from-a-cvs-file/58400337#58400337","title":"How to remove the last character from a column of data from a CVS file?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12222103,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCvTQRjRgB1fwUDY7eVkXOG5U9hoIkzoIat-ALV=k-s128","display_name":"mario hristov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12222103/mario-hristov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77063,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571165312,"creation_date":1571161904,"last_edit_date":1571162985,"question_id":58400156,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400156","body_markdown":"I am trying to do a linear relation using a csv file with 3 columns of data.

It is a csv in which each row has this form:\r\n\r\n    x : Double, y : Double, class : String\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEach row of this dataset incudes the coordinates of a point and the class of this point. \r\n\r\nMy goal is, after some calculations, to calculate a new value based on this dataset and to create an RDD using the dataset given combined with a new column holding the new value, with a **key-value** pair. \r\n\r\nThe RDD would have as a **key** the coordinates, (x,y) of each point and as **value** the class AND the new value with the name icch_id : String!\r\n\r\nThe correct form for this RDD in my mind would include two tuples, which would be like this :\r\n\r\n    (x : Double, y : Double),(icch_id : String, class : String)\r\n\r\nI reach a point in my application after some calculations where I have this RDD to work with : \r\n\r\n**DATA_RDD :** \r\n\r\n    (icch_id : String, x : Double, y : Double, class : String) \r\n\r\nA print of a part of this RDD is shown bellow:\r\n\r\n    //DATA_RDD print:\r\n    (ICCH_1,4.3,3.0,Iris-setosa)\r\n    (ICCH_1,4.4,2.9,Iris-setosa)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I am writing this code to convert it to the key-value form I want which is the one I wrote above : \r\n\r\n    val DATA_RDD_Final  = DATA_RDD\r\n          .keyBy{case (_, x, y, _) =&gt; (x, y)}\r\n          .mapValues{ case (icch_id, _, _, pclass) =&gt; (icch_id,pclass) }\r\n          .groupByKey()\r\n\r\n**And at this point the problem begins.** \r\n\r\nIf I print the **DATA_RDD_Final** the result is :\r\n\r\n    //A part of the Result:\r\n    ((5.4,3.0),CompactBuffer((ICCH_1,Iris-versicolor))) //Almost Correct!\r\n    ((6.7,3.3),CompactBuffer((ICCH_3,Iris-virginica), (ICCH_3,Iris-virginica))) //Wrong!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The problem:** Instead of a simple Tuple I get a CompactBuffer with exactly the same duplicates of the Value Tuple.\r\n\r\nAnd I am asking: \r\n\r\n 1. Why this happens? Is it a code problem? \r\n 2. I am using databricks community edition. Does this affect something?\r\n 3. Is there a way, after I create the DATA_RDD_Final, to remove all duplicates and return the form I wanted from the start?\r\n\r\nThank you so much on behalf ans sorry for the long post!\r\n\r\n  ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400150/key-value-rdd-why-same-duplicates-value-tuples-scala","title":"Key-Value RDD: Why same duplicates Value Tuples?

database and JMS connections are generally considered &quot;expensive&quot; and should usually be pooled.\r\n\r\nIn a pooled use-case the number of connections in the pool is really defined by your performance requirements, hardware capacity, etc. It&#39;s usually refined via benchmarking and tuning. There are almost always trade-offs between performance and resource utilization so it&#39;s your job to find the right balance. Even general recommendations are hard to make for pool size because the use-cases can vary so widely.\r\n\r\nIn a non-pooled use-case it&#39;s worth noting that a single JMS connection can service multiple sessions concurrently (although the sessions themselves can&#39;t be used concurrently). JMS sessions are much less expensive to create than JMS connections. Therefore, in a non-pooled use-case it generally makes sense to reduce the number of JMS connections to be as low as reasonably possible and make use of multiple sessions.\r\n\r\nAside from a few bits of setup for the connection all substantive JMS client work is done through the session. JDBC connections have no such &quot;session&quot; idea. Most of the work is done directly on the connection object. Therefore, I&#39;m not sure the comparison here is really valid.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400120/connection-pool-for-activemq/58401277#58401277","title":"Connection pool for
