Django creates a database table behind the scenes to track which migrations have been applied, so as long as the apps, models, and migration files are identical in the second app it should work without having to fake any migrations.\r\n\r\nThat said, this sounds like a mess to maintain going forward. I think what I would do is create a single Django project that talks to the database, then create an API in that first project that all other apps can interface with to communicate with the database. That way you avoid duplicating code or having to worry about keeping multiple projects in sync.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126278/how-can-i-use-one-database-with-multiple-django-servers/58126737#58126737","title":"How can I use one database with multiple django servers?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":9471220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8CRMT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"umi0410","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9471220/umi0410"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569607588,"post_id":58127101,"comment_id":102665483,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126278/how-can-i-use-one-database-with-multiple-django-servers/58127101#comment102665483_58127101"},{"owner":{"reputation":2508,"user_id":4964373,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7HSZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Usman Maqbool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4964373/usman-maqbool"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":85,"user_id":9471220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8CRMT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"umi0410","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9471220/umi0410"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569608355,"post_id":58127101,"comment_id":102665787,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126278/how-can-i-use-one-database-with-multiple-django-servers/58127101#comment102665787_58127101"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2508,"user_id":4964373,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7HSZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Usman Maqbool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4964373/usman-maqbool"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569552348,"creation_date":1569552348,"answer_id":58127101,"question_id":58126278,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58127101","body_markdown":"In my project, I have the same case that I have 2 Django servers and 1 database.\r\n\r\nI did that I run on server 1\r\n\r\n    python manage.py makemigrations\r\nand \r\n    \r\n    python manage.py migrate\r\n\r\nand on server 2 I just run:\r\n\r\n    python manage.py makemigrations\r\n\r\nI did not run migrate commands on server 2\r\n\r\nNow if there is any change on model then I run `makemigrations` command on both servers and `migrate` command on any of one server.

followed this tutorial: https://medium.com/@vijayabhaskar96/multi-label-image-classification-tutorial-with-keras-imagedatagenerator-cd541f8eaf24\r\nand wrote some of my code for multilabel classification. I had it working with one-hot encoding on a small scale but I had to move to option 2 mentioned in the article because I have 6000 classes and therefore one hot was not viable. I managed to train the network and it said 99% accuracy and 83% f1 score. However, when I&#39;m trying to test the network, for every image it&#39;s outputting some combination of only 3 labels when there are 6000 possible labels. I wondered if maybe the code to test the model was incorrect. I tried using the code mentioned in the post and it doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n    test_generator.reset()\r\n    pred = model.predict_generator(test_generator, steps=STEP_SIZE_TEST, verbose=1);\r\n    pred_bool = (pred &gt; 0.5)\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n&gt;unorderable `types: list() &gt; float()`\r\n\r\n I&#39;ve tried hard to fix this and not figured it out and I can&#39;t find any examples online of anyone doing something similar.

If I kill and tensorflow training instance and restart, the documentation states that it will resume from the latest checkpoint saved under model_dir. Usually however we see a sizable dip in the metrics such as AUC, logloss etc. I never really understood the reason behind such dip. All the relevant information is saved in the checkpoint file for tensorflow to reconstruct the state before it gets killed, except possibly the iterator of the input dataset (under estimator framework). Historically this has discouraged me and others from restarting tensorflow training by loading from existing checkpoints, because metrics are almost guaranteed to worsen.\r\n\r\n  Today I did something slightly more aggressive by bringing up a training instance with 1 chief and 7 workers on a single machine, without parameter server. This is supposed to run under the STANDALONE distribution strategy with the chief spawning multiple worker threads. When I killed training and restarted from the latest checkpoint with the same distributed setup, however, the metrics dropped by almost half of its entire gain since inception! Note that the multiple jumps in the tensorboard plots below are due to multiple restart I initiated from the same saved checkpoint.\r\n\r\n  I then started looking at the gradient histogram/distribution plots, and noticed that the gradient of all the bias weights, especially the last one bias_3, increased significantly in variance after restart. Clearly something is wrong, but comparing the variables in the checkpoints before and after restart reveals that the values are still evolving continuously, albeit with a bigger than normal jump. To prevent inadvertent overfitting, I shuffled my input files (about 100 of those) with a different random seed so that the restart does not go back to the beginning of the original training epoch. In any case, the training has lasted for more than a few epochs so that it&#39;s highly unlikely to be a case of overfitting on seen training data.\r\n\r\n  Besides that, I can&#39;t think of any reason why the gradients would experience such enormous jumps, causing the metrics to tank. \r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n \r\nCuriously, I found that the Adagrad of the bias vector of the last layer of my DNN stays constant at 0.1, even though the gradients are clearly nonzero, albeit extremely small. I don&#39;t think this explains the jump after restart because the serialized Adagrad value should be close to the one stored in memory.\r\n\r\n    python -m inspect_checkpoint --file_name model.ckpt-720730 --tensor_name bias_3/Adagrad\r\n    tensor_name:  bias_3/Adagrad\r\n    [0.1]\r\n    \r\n    python -m inspect_checkpoint --file_name model.ckpt-591678 --tensor_name bias_3/Adagrad\r\n    tensor_name:  bias_3/Adagrad\r\n    [0.1]\r\n\r\nFor comparison the Adagrad of bias2 appears to be change dramatically over 200k steps (batch size 1024). \r\n\r\n    python -m inspect_checkpoint --file_name model.ckpt-720730 --tensor_name bias_2/Adagrad\r\n    tensor_name:  bias_2/Adagrad\r\n    [80.608215    1.0615484   1.1355964  89.86574    90.919426   80.83253\r\n      1.7569603   1.2538469  69.11257    77.651375   89.71191     0.7492978\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    python -m inspect_checkpoint --file_name model.ckpt-591678 --tensor_name bias_2/Adagrad\r\n    tensor_name:  bias_2/Adagrad\r\n    [47.73241     1.0530229   1.1187999  50.532574   51.123966   40.66552\r\n      1.7377361   1.2532469  36.016315   45.788876   50.346928    0.7473773\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nFor completeness, I am using dropout throughout the DNN, but no regularization of any kind.

I do not see why I can&#39;t update an object by rendering a template that displays only a single field from the objects form.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126260/unable-to-update-django-object-when-declaring-only-one-field-in-template-form","title":"Unable to update Django object when declaring only one field in template form"},{"tags":["bash"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4001,"user_id":3286605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUxFl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Duc Filan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3286605/duc-filan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569544277,"post_id":58126257,"comment_id":102640485,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126257/to-sort-and-list-every-word-listed-in-the-documents-available-to-me-i-need-to-f#comment102640485_58126257"},{"owner":{"reputation":23406,"user_id":9072753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPmGy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Cuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9072753/kamil-cuk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569544548,"post_id":58126257,"comment_id":102640523,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126257/to-sort-and-list-every-word-listed-in-the-documents-available-to-me-i-need-to-f#comment102640523_58126257"},{"owner":{"reputation":23406,"user_id":9072753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPmGy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Cuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9072753/kamil-cuk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569544820,"post_id":58126257,"comment_id":102640571,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126257/to-sort-and-list-every-word-listed-in-the-documents-available-to-me-i-need-to-f#comment102640571_58126257"},{"owner":{"reputation":2492,"user_id":7939871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1199ba5dde05e4083823a058c5ac6bed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"L&#233;a Gris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7939871/l%c3%a9a-gris"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569545364,"post_id":58126257,"comment_id":102640668,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126257/to-sort-and-list-every-word-listed-in-the-documents-available-to-me-i-need-to-f#comment102640668_58126257"},{"owner":{"reputation":23406,"user_id":9072753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPmGy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Cuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9072753/kamil-cuk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569545432,"post_id":58126257,"comment_id":102640687,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126257/to-sort-and-list-every-word-listed-in-the-documents-available-to-me-i-need-to-f#comment102640687_58126257"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":12100701,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0c7ac360e6f1df11b79c1e167f707f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MATT_BOOTY","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12100701/matt-booty"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569547380,"post_id":58126551,"comment_id":102641015,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126257/to-sort-and-list-every-word-listed-in-the-documents-available-to-me-i-need-to-f/58126551#comment102641015_58126551"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2492,"user_id":7939871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1199ba5dde05e4083823a058c5ac6bed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"L&#233;a Gris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7939871/l%c3%a9a-gris"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2492,"user_id":7939871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1199ba5dde05e4083823a058c5ac6bed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"L&#233;a Gris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7939871/l%c3%a9a-gris"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569547852,"last_edit_date":1569547852,"creation_date":1569547202,"answer_id":58126551,"question_id":58126257,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58126551","body_markdown":"Here is an implementation of your words counting script:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\r\n\r\nif [ $# -gt 0 ];

I found for a specific region geomesa is not returning all the node in the bounding box.\r\n\r\nFor example, I fired 3 queries:\r\n\r\n 1. BBOX(-122.0,47.4,-122.01,47.5)  - Output has 5,477 Unique Features \r\n 2. BBOX(-122.0,47.5,-122.01,47.6)  - Output has 9,879 Unique Features\r\n 3. BBOX(-122.0,47.4,-122.01,47.6)  - Output has 13,374 Unique Features\r\n\r\nLooking into these bounding box I think Feature of Query 1 + Query 2 should be equal to Query 3. But actually, they are not same. The sad part is the Summation of Quer1 and Query2 has some elements which are not present in the Query 3 data itself. \r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the image after plotting it on Kepler.

I am trying to create a function that takes the first item in an array and adds an ```a1``` to the end of it, along with the next item of the array. Then, the 3rd item gets an ```a2``` added to it along with the fourth item, and so on. Also, I want to do this multiple times and create multiple arrays with the function parameter ```orderNum```. I am having a hard time trying to find out how to do this, but I am guessing it has something to do with a ```1 -1 1 -1``` sequence. Anyway, here is my code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction orderArray (orderNum, array) {\r\n   var orderNum_Array = [];\r\n\r\n   for (var i = 0; i &lt;= array.length; i++) {\r\n      if (Math.pow(-1, i +1) &lt; 0) {\r\n         array[i] = orderNum_Array [i];\r\n\r\n         orderNum_Array[i] = orderNum_Array[i].toString();\r\n\r\n         orderNum_Array.concat(&quot;a&quot; + i);\r\n      }else if (Math.pow(-1, i +1) &gt; 0) {\r\n         array[i] = orderNum_Array [i + 2];\r\n\r\n         orderNum_Array[i + 2] = orderNum_Array[i + 2].toString();\r\n\r\n         orderNum_Array.concat(&quot;a&quot; + (i + 2));\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAny and all help all would be greatly appreciated.

This package allows the user/developer to either include numerous pre-written units in their project which are explicitly designed to work with this custom control, or write their own to do the same as one of the existing ones. Think of it like a &quot;plugin&quot; where code is implemented in its own unit, which inherits a particular object and does custom implementation of that common object.\r\n\r\nEach &quot;plugin&quot; unit has an `initialization` clause at the bottom which registers this class with a global list. So long as that unit is &quot;used&quot; anywhere in the project, it gets registered into a global list, which this custom control makes use of to populate a list of all possible &quot;plugin&quot; units.\r\n\r\nFor example, this custom control has a property:\r\n\r\n    property PluginIndex: Integer read FPluginIndex write SetPluginIndex;\r\n\r\nInternally, this index corresponds with one of the &quot;plugins&quot; which was registered from within the `initialization` section of its corresponding unit.\r\n\r\nThese &quot;plugins&quot; are registered via a global object which is instantiated like this upon first use:\r\n\r\n    function Plugins: TMyPluginList;\r\n\r\n    implementation\r\n\r\n    var\r\n      _Plugins: TMyPluginList;\r\n    \r\n    function Plugins: TMyPluginList;\r\n    begin\r\n      if _Plugins= nil then\r\n        _Plugins:= TMyPluginList.Create;\r\n      Result:= _Plugins;\r\n    end;\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that, since the control is implemented within a package (and installed into IDE), yet the &quot;plugin&quot; units are &quot;used&quot; from within another project, the package doesn&#39;t pick up the presence of these units, and therefore this custom control is also unable to access the global list, since it&#39;s in an entirely different context.\r\n\r\nWhen interacting with this control on the form in design-time, if I set this `PluginIndex` in design-time, it fails because the control hasn&#39;t had any &quot;plugins&quot; register themselves in the global list. But, in run-time, assigning that same property works just fine.\r\n\r\nHow do I do this in a way that my application which uses this custom control (which relies on client-uses of each &quot;plugin&quot; unit) is able to actually detect these units used?\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nThe end goal of what I&#39;m doing is to allow this single custom control to be simply dropped on the form, then have specific units &quot;used&quot; in that same form, and finally on this single custom control instance, choose the index of which of those &quot;plugins&quot; to actually use at any given time. I&#39;m trying to encapsulate and automate as much of the process as possible, making it easier for a developer to simply drop this custom-control and not have to write a bunch of other code to make it work. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nI realize that this may be interpreted as these &quot;plugin&quot; units being a part of the package. That is not the case. Although currently I have no choice but to add these &quot;plugin&quot; units to the package in order to make design-time work right, I don&#39;t want it to be a part of the package, and rather up to the developer using this custom control. They can add a combination of pre-made &quot;plugin&quot; units as well as custom-made ones, simply by &quot;using&quot; them in their application. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126218/how-can-i-make-the-ide-aware-of-units-used-in-a-project-which-uses-my-package","title":"How can I make the IDE aware of units used in a project which uses my package?"},{"tags":["asp.net-core","select","razor",".net-core","selected"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10027998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZG5V7v2Hl4U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2I9hBCvj9hn61C1oms6b1YZKfMow/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lynn Demarest","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10027998/lynn-demarest"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569599914,"post_id":58127278,"comment_id":102662335,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126216/struggling-with-the-razor-select-helper/58127278#comment102662335_58127278"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11874,"user_id":5751404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpggY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nan Yu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5751404/nan-yu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11874,"user_id":5751404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpggY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nan Yu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5751404/nan-yu"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569554106,"last_edit_date":1569554106,"creation_date":1569553704,"answer_id":58127278,"question_id":58126216,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58127278","body_markdown":"    &lt;select id=&quot;PageNumber&quot;

3 tables.

What I&#39;m trying to do is to get all labels when selection all issues. The problem is that when my labels table is empty, no results are returned even the issues table has entries. This is my select:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM issues AS i INNER JOIN objects AS o ON i.related_id = o.related_id INNER JOIN labels AS l ON i.issue_id = l.issue_id WHERE i.tb_id = 2\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the label JOIN, I&#39;m getting my expected result. But when I try to JOIN the empty labels table, no results are returned. So there are at the end 2 possible scenarios:\r\n\r\n 1. Labels table is empty -&gt; return no labels for the issue\r\n 2. Labels table is not empty -&gt; return all labels as array or object (I don&#39;t know, array would be better I think)\r\n\r\nSo do you have any idea what I&#39;m doing wrong here?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTnHS.png\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126191/join-a-sql-table-which-could-be-empty","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Join a SQL table which could be empty"},{"tags":["xml","ros","map-projections","utm","mercator"],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11364528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eda6e34e1e793892ca538b6e34ae8e45?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"autonomobil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11364528/autonomobil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569543150,"creation_date":1569543150,"question_id":58126190,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58126190","body_markdown":"I have a question regarding the creation of the WMTS server requests and with that the calculation of the tile number.\r\n\r\nFrom [this](https://www.bezreg-koeln.nrw.de/brk_internet/geobasis/luftbilderzeugnisse/digitale_orthophotos/index.html) german governmental-website I can get the address for their WMTS server: https://www.wmts.nrw.de/geobasis/wmts_nw_dop. I can successfully integrate it into josm as an image layer (wmts:https://www.wmts.nrw.de/geobasis/wmts_nw_dop) and it gets displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nI can watch the server request made by josm in the terminal, which is something like:`2019-09-26 18:54:31.651 INFO: GET https://www.wmts.nrw.de/geobasis/wmts_nw_dop/tiles/nw_dop/EPSG_25832_16/16/17680/35107 -&gt; HTTP_1 200 (13.3 kB)`\r\nYou can view this tile image: https://www.wmts.nrw.de/geobasis/wmts_nw_dop/tiles/nw_dop/EPSG_25832_16/16/17680/35107\r\n\r\nIn this [rviz-plugin](https://github.com/gareth-cross/rviz_satellite) I entered the string for the request: `https://www.wmts.nrw.de/geobasis/wmts_nw_dop/tiles/nw_dop/EPSG_25832_16/{z}/{y}/{x}`\r\n\r\nIf I let rviz_satellite figure out the y and x, I&#39;m getting trash in rviz:\r\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/fJldJM9.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this is because the images/tiles are in EPSG25832-projection method, but rviz-satellite thinks in Mercator-projection. And I need the images to be in EPSG25832, because of other data which gets displayed.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the WMTSCapabilities.xml of the map-server you can see there are images available up to zoom level 16 and other info: https://www.wmts.nrw.de/geobasis/wmts_nw_dop/tiles/nw_dop/EPSG_25832_16/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml\r\n\r\nI had a look at [the methods, which the rviz-satellite seems to use to calculate the x and y](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames#Lon..2Flat._to_tile_numbers), which is something like this:\r\n```\r\n// in Coordinates.h:\r\nint const n = 1 &lt;&lt; zoom;\r\ndouble x = n * ((coord.lon + 180) / 360.0);\r\ndouble y = n * (1 - (std::log(std::tan(lat_rad) + 1 / std::cos(lat_rad)) / M_PI)) / 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I think I need to do something like this, because of the EPSG25832/UTM projection:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Mercator_projection\r\n\r\nI already had a look at https://josm.openstreetmap.de/doc/org/openstreetmap/gui/jmapviewer/Tile.htm to see how openstreetmap does it, but I didn&#39;t find anything.\r\n\r\n**So all in all: How to calculate the

Declare your API functions with ```__declspec(dllexport)``` just before your C++ functions return type. Using a #define for this can be handy.\r\n\r\nIn C# land, make sure you have using ```System.Runtime.InteropServices;``` Then, make a static method handle for your api using ```[DllImport(&quot;dll_name.dll&quot;, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]``` method attribute for your method then ```static extern returnType CallCPPFunction();``` You&#39;ll have to write a custom data parser using this method as the returned data is simply a bunch of bytes (Meaning C# will attempt to cast the received data from C++ as the return type you specify in C#). You could make a struct in C# constructed with a byte array, and set that as the constructor parameter, however, you can make your job a lot easier by sending one or more ```int*``` as parameters to the C# function that hold useful data like ```sizeof(object)``` or significant markers in the objects data to make parsing it easier. Keep in mind the memory here is simultaneously managed by C# and C++, so if you pass an ```int*``` holding the ```sizeof(object)``` you&#39;ll still need to ```delete``` that pointer in C++, but make sure you don&#39;t do stuff like that when C# or C++ is still using the data. You could do some ```unsafe``` code in C# where C++ passes a bool* that starts as false, then C# marks it as true when it&#39;s done reading the data.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not an expert in this Marshalling business, but I have successfully used this exact method of transferring data in this manner in the past. It&#39;s entirely possible there&#39;s some way to use the C++ types in C# so that this data parsing isn&#39;t necessary, or C# somehow using the .h files to do stuff, but if there is, I don&#39;t know it. Here&#39;s the tutorial that I watched to figure out the concept myself, but it&#39;s a bit long and I couldn&#39;t find another one that was the same thing I was looking for:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jGgTHJoCY\r\n\r\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, the data parsing won&#39;t even be necessary if you re-create the C++ struct in C# such that the first data member defined is the same associated data member in the C# struct, second C++ member to the second in C# etc. Keep in mind the size of the data types needs to match, or the data will be offset once it hits a data member whose size in C++ and C# don&#39;t match. If your struct contains sub-types you&#39;d need to re-create those in C# too; all the way down to the primitive type level.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126169/how-to-pass-an-array-of-structs-from-c-to-c/58127558#58127558","title":"How to pass an array of structs from c++ to c#?"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":9124975,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5bf0bee0440a87c722448ca9c66a607?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Darren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9124975/darren"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569556355,"creation_date":1569542994,"question_id":58126169,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58126169","body_markdown":"I have been researching this for a while but can not find a solution.\r\n\r\nI am writing a program that is using a c++/CLI wrapper.

Whether or not it is parsing those components correctly is unclear.\r\n- My construction of the Private Key JWT may be flawed.\r\n- The construction of the Token Request may be flawed.\r\n- The configuration of my application registration on the Azure Portal may be wrong.\r\n\r\nAny pointers on how to narrow this down or resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126164/how-to-fix-invalid-signature-api-error-when-submitting-a-token-request-in-open","title":"How to fix &quot;Invalid Signature&quot; API error when submitting a token request in OpenID flow?"},{"tags":["javascript","d3.js","nested","linechart"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":6471247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1fff2d35f768a333dd9c22dfaee792c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zelda1234","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6471247/zelda1234"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569547256,"post_id":58126266,"comment_id":102640990,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126162/nested-line-chart-not-showing-up/58126266#comment102640990_58126266"},{"owner":{"reputation":76227,"user_id":5768908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjGM7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gerardo Furtado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768908/gerardo-furtado"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":106,"user_id":6471247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1fff2d35f768a333dd9c22dfaee792c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zelda1234","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6471247/zelda1234"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569547429,"post_id":58126266,"comment_id":102641018,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126162/nested-line-chart-not-showing-up/58126266#comment102641018_58126266"},{"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":6471247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1fff2d35f768a333dd9c22dfaee792c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zelda1234","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6471247/zelda1234"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569684654,"post_id":58126266,"comment_id":102679831,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126162/nested-line-chart-not-showing-up/58126266#comment102679831_58126266"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76227,"user_id":5768908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjGM7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gerardo Furtado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768908/gerardo-furtado"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569543951,"creation_date":1569543951,"answer_id":58126266,"question_id":58126162,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58126266","body_markdown":"You have a couple of problems. First, you&#39;re not using your line generator. It should be:\r\n\r\n    .attr(&quot;d&quot;, function(d) {\r\n        return valueLine(d)\r\n    })\r\n\r\nSecond, you are parsing the date strings, but then converting them to strings again. So, change your line generator (or do not use them as a key, which returns a string):\r\n\r\n    var valueLine = d3.line()\r\n        .x(function(d) {\r\n            return xScale(new Date(d.key));\r\n        })\r\n        .y(function(d) {\r\n            return yScale(d.value);\r\n        })\r\n\r\nFinally, each datum for the line generator must be an array itself. So:\r\n\r\n    var paths = regYear.selectAll(&quot;.line&quot;)\r\n        .data(function(d) {\r\n            return [d.values]\r\n        })\r\n\r\nHere is your code with those changes (and a little CSS for the paths):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    path {\r\n      fill: none;\r\n      stroke: black;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;Nested Chart&lt;/title&gt;\r\n        &lt;script src=&quot;https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\r\n          .pagebreak {\r\n            page-break-before: always;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          .axis path,\r\n          .axis line {\r\n            fill: none;\r\n            stroke: black;\r\n            shape-rendering: crispEdges;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          .axis text {\r\n            font-family: sans-serif;\r\n            font-size: 11px;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          .point {\r\n            fill: none;\r\n            size: 2px\r\n          }\r\n\r\n        &lt;/style&gt;\r\n      &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;div style=&quot;width:800px;

This is what is causing the warning message. That closing `)` should be at the end, between the `}` and the `;`.\r\n\r\nMistake 2 is using a normal function, leading to `this` being incorrect inside the function. An arrow function will preserve the `this` value from the surrounding scope.\r\n\r\nI suggest using an IDE or a linter that can pick up on these kinds of problems.

The dimensionality and strides I chose were purely illustrative. There&#39;s no reason why the window size has to be the same as your stride or that you can&#39;t go higher than 3 dimensions.\r\n\r\n**Applications**\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this practically, all you have to do is intercept the output of im2col before turning it back into an image. For example, if you want to do pooling, you could take the mean or the maximum across the 0th axis. If you want to do a convolution, you just need to multiply this by your flattened convolutional filter.\r\n\r\nThere may be more efficient alternatives to this already implemented under the hood of Tensorflow, etc. that are faster than &quot;im2col.&quot; This is not meant to be the MOST efficient implementation. And of course, you could possibly optimize my code further by eliminating the intermediate reshaping step in &quot;im2col,&quot; but it wasn&#39;t immediately obvious to me so I just left it at that. If you have a better solution, let me know. Anyways, hope this helps someone else looking for the same answer!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126125/is-it-possible-to-extend-im2col-and-col2im-to-n-d-images/58126294#58126294","title":"Is it possible to extend &quot;im2col&quot; and &quot;col2im&quot; to N-D images?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7092731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4da2af2fc77dbb1b87e97071db609cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"QRabbani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7092731/qrabbani"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7092731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4da2af2fc77dbb1b87e97071db609cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"QRabbani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7092731/qrabbani"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569588931,"creation_date":1569542466,"last_edit_date":1569546407,"question_id":58126125,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58126125","body_markdown":"&quot;Im2col&quot; has already been implemented, [Implement MATLAB&#39;s im2col &#39;sliding&#39; in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30109068/implement-matlabs-im2col-sliding-in-python &quot;Python&quot;), efficiently for 2-D images in Python.

The operation successfully worked and we continue execution\r\n 2. The operation failed and the system threw an exception\r\n 3. The operation was cancelled by either the system (a timeout) or by user interaction\r\n\r\nIn C# we can handle these 3 different &quot;paths&quot; like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    await myService.doAsync();\r\n}\r\ncatch(TaskCanceledException ex)\r\n{\r\n   // Here, we know that somehow the Task was cancelled.

It implies that I might not know precisely what I am doing at the moment (e.g. I might not interpret well either the script or the error messages from R), but I have to get it done. Therefore, I beg your pardon for possible misunderstandings or inaccuracies.\r\n\r\nIn short, the situation is the following.\r\nI have created a function through which I scrape information from 2 nodes of psycotherapists&#39; profiles; the function is showed on this [stackoverflow post][1]. \r\n\r\nThen I create a loop where that function is used on a few psycotherapists&#39; profiles; the loop is in the above post as well, but I report it below because that is the part of the script that generates some problems (additionally to what I solved in the above mentioned post).\r\n\r\n    j &lt;- 1\r\n    MHP_codes &lt;-  c(150140:150180) #therapist identifier\r\n    df_list &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;list&quot;, length(MHP_codes))\r\n      for(code1 in MHP_codes) {\r\n        URL &lt;- paste0(&#39;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/illinois/&#39;, code1)\r\n        #Reading the HTML code from the website\r\n        URL &lt;- read_html(URL)\r\n        df_list[[j]] &lt;- tryCatch(getProfile(URL), \r\n                                 error = function(e) NA)\r\n        j &lt;- j + 1\r\n      }\r\n\r\nwhen the loop is done, I bind the information from different profiles into one data frame and save it.\r\n\r\n    final_df &lt;- rbind.fill(df_list)\r\n    save(final_df,file=&quot;final_df.Rda&quot;)\r\n\r\nThe function (getProfile) works well on individual profiles. \r\nIt works also on a small range of profiles ( c(150100:150150)). \r\nPlease, note that I do not know what psychoterapist id is actually assigned; so, many URLs within the range do not exist. \r\n\r\nHowever, generally speaking, tryCatch should solve this issue. When an URL is non-existent (and thus the ID is not associated to any psychoterapist), each of the 2 nodes (and thus each of the 2 corresponding variables in my data frame) are empty (i.e. the data frame shows NAs in the corresponding cells).\r\n\r\nHowever, in some IDs ranges, two problems might happen.\r\n\r\nFirst, I get one error message such as teh following one:\r\n\r\n*Error in open.connection(x, &quot;rb&quot;) : HTTP error 404.*\r\n\r\nSo, this happens despite the fact that I am usign tryCatch and despite the fact that it generally appears to work (at least, until the error message appear).\r\n\r\nMoreover, after the loop is stopped and R runs the line:\r\n\r\n```final_df &lt;- rbind.fill(df_list)```\r\n\r\nA second error message appears:\r\n\r\n*Warning message:\r\nIn df[[var]] :\r\n  closing unused connection 3 (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/illinois/150152)*\r\n\r\nIt seems like there is a specific problem with that one empty URL.\r\nIn fact, when I change ID range, the loop works well despite non-existent URLs: on one hand, when the URL exists the information is scraped from the website, on the other hand, when the URL does not exists, the 2 variables associated to that URL (and thus to that psyciotherapist ID) get an NA.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, perhaps, to tell R to skip the URL if it is empty? Without recording anything?\r\nThis solution would be excellent, since it would shrink the data frame to the existing URLs, but I do not know how to do it and I do not know whether it is a solution to my problem.\r\n\r\nAnyone who is able to help me sorting out this issue?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58054707/web-scraping-and-looping-through-pages-with-r/58055188","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126097/trycatch-function-works-on-most-non-existent-urls-but-it-does-not-work-in-at-l","title":"tryCatch function works on most non-existent URLs, but it does not work in (at least) one case"},{"tags":["bash","cmd"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":7587050,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mEUBX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"grego","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7587050/grego"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569548363,"creation_date":1569548363,"answer_id":58126665,"question_id":58126096,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58126665","body_markdown":"Figured out how to convert the single line in Mac to two lines in Windows cmd.exe:\r\n\r\nThis line: ```$ bcdata dump bc-airports --bounds $(fio info aoi.shp --bounds)```\r\ntranslates to:\r\n\r\n```FOR /F &quot;tokens=* USEBACKQ&quot; %g IN (`fio info W:\\FOR\\RSI\\DKL\\General_User_Data\\gamos\\zfire_polys_2.shp --bounds`) do (SET &quot;variableHere=%g&quot;)```           \r\nand\r\n```bcdata dump bc-airports --bounds %variableHere%```\r\n\r\nThe first line is just to set the variable ```variableHere``` to the value returned by ```fio info W:\\FOR\\RSI\\DKL\\General_User_Data\\gamos\\zfire_polys_2.shp --bounds``` (it&#39;s a string like 5356.345 4785.456 ).\r\n\r\nThen this line \r\n```bcdata dump bc-airports --bounds %variableHere%``` just reads in the value of the variable.\r\n\r\nEasy!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126096/convert-a-single-line-mac-bash-script-to-a-single-line-cmd-exe-line/58126665#58126665","title":"Convert a single-line Mac bash script to a single-line cmd.exe line"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":7587050,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mEUBX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"grego","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7587050/grego"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569548363,"creation_date":1569542205,"question_id":58126096,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58126096","body_markdown":"I am trying to edit a Mac bash script line into  a line that works in cmd.exe\r\n\r\nThis line:\r\n```$ bcdata dump bc-airports --bounds $(fio info aoi.shp --bounds)```\r\n\r\nobviously doesn&#39;t work in cmd.exe due to the $ characters.

My network in a nutshell has:&lt;br&gt;\r\n1) endorsement policy - org1 AND org2&lt;br&gt;\r\n2) 2 nodes for org1, 2 nodes for org2, 1 for org3 and 1 for org4&lt;br&gt;\r\n3) chaincode in Golang&lt;br&gt;\r\n4) 3 orderers (Raft)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am generating load using a script that sends transactions to a node.js API layer. The API layer uses the fabric-network sdk. The sdk network config includes all the peer nodes listed above for endorsement and ordering.\r\n\r\nAll load is generated using an Org1 user and therefore that user/org wallet is used for all transactions.\r\n\r\nI expect org1 and org2 nodes to get (SDK load balanced) endorsement requests, based on the policy described above. \r\nI also expect the ordering service to disseminate blocks to all 6 peer nodes.\r\nWith these in mind, I expect my org1 and org2 peer nodes to display similar if not identical performance profiles.\r\n\r\nHowever, I see that org1 peer nodes hog RAM (~4GB) while org2 nodes are a fraction of that RAM usage. Additionally, the org1 nodes never seem to give up memory and just keep growing. \r\n\r\nthe only difference as mentioned above is that I am using org1 user for all transactions.

note that the opinions below are my own, regardless of any literature that might exist on the topic. They are not supposed to be considered science, regardless of how &quot;science&quot; might be defined.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe short answers:\r\n\r\n1. We have no idea how the human brain actually works - referring here to mathematical computations, comparisons etc.\r\n\r\n2. It is guaranteed that the human brain works radically different from any computer.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMaybe I am not accurate in my &quot;metaphor&quot;, but I reached this conclusion: the human brain does many (most?) calculations &quot;visually&quot;: you just look and you know the correct answer. A computer would need very complex algorithms, and it might still not be able to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, the human brain is able to generate a totally different problem, with the same result / answer like the original, but a lot easier to calculate. And that, without us even being aware of that, most of the times.\r\n\r\nIt was already mentioned in a comment: for the example of your problem, a human would not sort that list of digits. He would just countdown from 4 to 1.\r\n\r\nIf the problem would provide different numbers, e.g. {5, 21, 48, 16}, the brain cores would &quot;visually&quot; detect the maximums and minimums in the list, and rearrange them in the correct order, without real comparisons (at least, we are not aware of them).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe human brain is definitely multi-core. But the cores are not independent like in a computer, which only exchange some data. They are permanently reconfigurable, and I suspect that these &quot;cores&quot; of the brain actually overlap, not only regarding data, but also regarding execution.\r\n\r\n---\r\nTo understand the kind of computing done in &quot;biological computers&quot;:\r\n\r\nReferences: [Rod_cell][1], [Cone_cell][2], [Optic_nerve][3]\r\n\r\nMath:\r\n\r\n- **100 million** rod cells;\r\n- **7 million** cone cells;\r\n- Each human optic nerve contains **between 770,000 and 1.7 million** nerve fibers\r\n\r\nNow you see, a max of 1.7 million optic nerves connect 107 million sensors to the brain. That is actually the &quot;definition&quot; of **image / video compression**. The eye (retina?) is a standalone computer in itself. If it is able to do video compression, then it MUST be able (my opinion) to sort a short list without the need to relay the data to the brain. That could be an explanation WHY we know an answer to a problem just looking at it - we receive the answer together with the problem - all work was done elsewhere.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt seems &quot;obvious&quot; that the biological computers perform mathematical comparisons at some level, it is just that we have no idea where and how they are made. Maybe in a low level &quot;driver&quot;? Maybe they are off-loaded to some other processing unit? A &quot;hardware accelerator&quot;? Maybe, hopefully, the future will tell us.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126073/code-is-doing-more-swapping-compared-to-human-level-method/58129085#58129085","title":"Code is doing more swapping compared to human-level method"}],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":12100635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b44a749f3fe873f87d45c449ee2099d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S&#252;mer Kol&#231;ak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12100635/s%c3%bcmer-kol%c3%a7ak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":71,"user_id":12100635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b44a749f3fe873f87d45c449ee2099d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S&#252;mer Kol&#231;ak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12100635/s%c3%bcmer-kol%c3%a7ak"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569574714,"creation_date":1569541975,"last_edit_date":1569542480,"question_id":58126073,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58126073","body_markdown":"If a human wants to re-arrange the numbers `1,2,3,4` from the biggest to the smallest, the human will check to see if the second number is bigger than the first number, but will not swap locations until done examining the rest of the numbers.\r\n\r\nThe new order becomes : `4,2,3,1`\r\n\r\nHowever the code below will swap the locations of &quot;`1`&quot; and &quot;`2`&quot; soon as it determines &quot;`2`&quot; is bigger than &quot;`1`&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe new order becomes : `2,1,3,4`\r\n\r\nThe program will do more swapping than a human will be doing..&lt;br&gt;\r\nand thus perhaps it is less efficient than human method ?\r\n\r\nIs there a way to apply the efficiency of human method to this program ? or perhaps the human method is not more efficient but simply appears that way ?\r\n\r\n\tint a[] = {1,2,3,4};\r\n\tint total;\r\n\ttotal = 4;\r\n\r\n\tint i;\r\n\tint i2;\r\n\tint holder = 0;\r\n\r\n\tfor (i=0; i&lt;total;) {\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (i2=i+1; i2&lt;total;) {\r\n\r\n\t\tif(a[i] &lt; a[i2]) {\r\n\t\tholder = a[i];\r\n\t\ta[i] = a[i2];\r\n\t\ta[i2] = holder;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n \t\ti2=i2+1;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\ti=i+1;\r\n\t}\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126073/code-is-doing-more-swapping-compared-to-human-level-method","title":"Code is doing more swapping compared to human-level method"},{"tags":["android","c","cmake","openssl","native"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9962504,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2ba45e19a215745b46fbb6c2a236591?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Original","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9962504/original"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569574814,"creation_date":1569574814,"answer_id":58131204,"question_id":58126071,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58131204","body_markdown":"Turned out that structure of my jniLibs was something like:\r\n```\r\narm64-v8a\r\n    include\r\n        ...\r\n    lib\r\n        libcrypto.so\r\n        libssl.so\r\nx86\r\n    include\r\n        ...\r\n    lib\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\nopposed to:\r\n```\r\narm64-v8a\r\n    include\r\n        ...\r\n    libcrypto.so\r\n    libssl.so\r\nx86\r\n    include\r\n        ...\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nWhich solves initial problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126071/cannot-load-prebuilt-openssl-library-in-android-project/58131204#58131204","title":"Cannot load prebuilt OpenSSL library in Android project"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9962504,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2ba45e19a215745b46fbb6c2a236591?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Original","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9962504/original"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9962504,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2ba45e19a215745b46fbb6c2a236591?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Original","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9962504/original"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58131204,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569574814,"creation_date":1569541943,"last_edit_date":1569553694,"question_id":58126071,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58126071","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to link the OpenSSL `.so` prebuilt files so I can use it in my native C files.

Is it possible to make a query without SQL with this tools?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126046/sql-api-is-not-supported-for-this-database-error","title":"Sql api is not supported for this database Error"},{"tags":["json","amazon-s3","parquet","amazon-kinesis-firehose"],"owner":{"reputation":612,"user_id":4078249,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/86dafd29ac331022197e140c692f25eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"learningMyWayThru","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4078249/learningmywaythru"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569541676,"creation_date":1569541676,"question_id":58126045,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58126045","body_markdown":"I am writing json data into Firehose with S3 configured as destination with firehose configured to convert data to Firehose.
