Part of this effort involves creating a user interface to make it easy for users to map the random column names they have in their input files to the &quot;standard&quot; column names that the dashboard is going to expect.\r\n\r\nI actually got this code working nicely. But the app needs to do this same mapping exercise for several different input files (each with their own set of standard column names), so it seemed like a good candidate to modularize!\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the workflow:\r\n\r\n 1. The user loads a &quot;mapping input&quot; file. If they&#39;ve done this mapping\r\n    exercise before, I want to use this file to pre-populate the\r\n    drop-downs. I&#39;m also pulling the list of standard column names from\r\n    this table. Each standard column name gets an associated drop down.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n 2. They load their file to be wrangled - the one with the wackly column\r\n        names. The column names in this file will become the options in the\r\n        drop-downs.\r\n 3. As the user starts mapping their column names to the different\r\n    standard name drop downs, their selections will disappear from the\r\n    other drop-down lists. This makes it easier to map columns in files\r\n    with many columns.\r\n\r\nI feel like I am so close. The issue is when the module runs updateSelectInput. I&#39;m using updateSelectInput to remove options from the drop-downs that have already been used. This works, but it clears out the pre-populated values that were set in the renderUI function.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the code with the pre-populated values working (having removed the problematic updateSelectInput):\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Load libraries and options ----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\noptions(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n\r\n# Modules -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\ninput_ui &lt;- function(id, row_label, file_description) {\r\n    ns &lt;- NS(id) \r\n    fluidRow(\r\n        uiOutput(ns(&quot;colmapping&quot;)) # References the dynamic dropdowns created by the server module.\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n# Creates dynamic dropdowns which ultimately will be used to rename columns from a number of different files.\r\ninput_server &lt;- function(input, output, session, parent) {\r\n    \r\n    # Create a fake file with misnamed columns that need remapped. \r\n    input_file &lt;- reactive({\r\n            return(data.frame(Account.Number = 1:2,\r\n                              Account.Name = c(&quot;Account 1&quot;, &quot;Account 2&quot;),\r\n                              Quota.2018 = c(1000, 2000)))\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    # Get a list of what the columns SHOULD be named.

currently working with [sequelize v5][1] on a backend project, we&#39;re using postgresql as a database.\r\n\r\nI know that sequelize can define hooks as a mean to implement triggers, however, I require the implementation (or definition) of database triggers directly on the database.\r\n\r\nI defined hooks as it was [detailed in the docs][2], but noticed that it failed to formally define a trigger on the database. \r\n\r\n    hooks: {\r\n      beforeUpdate: (instance, options) =&gt; {\r\n        sequelize.models.themodelIwantToUse.create({\r\n          actionType: &#39;UPDATE&#39;,\r\n

instance.dataValues.createdAt,\r\n          createdBy: instance.dataValues.createdBy\r\n        })\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe project manager insists on declaring triggers, so I did the following:\r\n\r\n    sequelize.query(&quot;&quot; +\r\n    &quot;CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION the_model_i_want_to_use_log_func() &quot; +\r\n      &quot;    RETURNS TRIGGER &quot; +\r\n      &quot;AS $$ &quot; +\r\n      &quot;BEGIN &quot; +\r\n      &quot;    IF TG_OP = &#39;UPDATE&#39; OR TG_OP = &#39;DELETE&#39; THEN &quot; +\r\n      &quot;        INSERT INTO a_schema.the_model_i_want_to_use(key, action_type, old_value, new_value, created_at, created_by) VALUES (NEW.key, TG_OP, OLD.value, NEW.value,  NEW.created_at, NEW.created_by); &quot; +\r\n      &quot;        RETURN NEW; &quot; +\r\n      &quot;    END IF; &quot; +\r\n      &quot;&quot; +\r\n      &quot;    RETURN NEW; &quot; +\r\n      &quot;END; &quot; +\r\n      &quot;$$ &quot; +\r\n      &quot;    LANGUAGE plpgsql; &quot; +\r\n      &quot;DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS general_config_log ON a_schema.the_model_i_want_to_use; &quot; +\r\n      &quot;CREATE TRIGGER general_config_log &quot; +\r\n      &quot;AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON a_schema.the_model_i_want_to_use&quot; +\r\n      &quot;FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE the_model_i_want_to_use_log_func(); &quot;\r\n    );\r\n\r\nthe problem (as you can tell) with the snippet above, is that it will rewrite the triggers and functions every time squelize is instanced.\r\n\r\nI know this will break if we change database (to MySql for example), but that&#39;s not an issue i&#39;m worried with at the moment.\r\n\r\nIs there a different or *correct* aproach to declaring triggers with sequelize?\r\n  [1]:

This is a key part of being able to navigate self-balancing tree data structures - being able to search downwards, find and do something with a target node, and then trace backwards to the root node of the tree where it started navigating from, manipulating it as you work your back way up. Using recursion is one way (i.e. using the program stack) or you need to implement your own stack (e.g. use a Queue or LinkedList) but unless your code has a memory structure recording where it&#39;s been, unfortunately it&#39;ll always get lost.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142129/avl-tree-implementation-without-storing-height/58142348#58142348","title":"AVL Tree Implementation - Without Storing Height"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10029291,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0290371c59020612683b4061afc9b8fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xdmtk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10029291/xdmtk"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569630394,"creation_date":1569625832,"question_id":58142129,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58142129","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently in the middle of an AVL Tree insert implementation, and I am struggling with maintaining the balance factors while inserting and backtracking up the tree.\r\n\r\nVirtually every AVL implementation I can find as an example uses the height of a node&#39;s two sub-tree&#39;s to calculate the balance factor, something along the lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode.balance = node.right.height - node.left.height\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is perfectly fine if your Node class looks something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Node {\r\n    int value, height;\r\n    Node left, right;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough the problem is that for this particular implementation, it is &#39;against the rules&#39; to keep track of the height of the node, and instead we can only keep track of the balance factor. So the Node class instead looks like \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Node {\r\n    int value, balance;\r\n    Node left, right;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that maintaining the balance factor of a node is conceptually similar to maintaining the height  for each insert into the tree, but for the life of me I can&#39;t figure out all of the situations in which the balance factor should change for a particular node.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment I&#39;ve got setting the balance factor implemented by instead recursively calling the height function for each and every node ( not optimal! ) to make sure my rotations and general insertion is correct.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode.balance = height(node.right) - height(node.left)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `height()` recursively traverses the tree to find the longest path to a leaf.\r\n\r\nAnd I have verified that the rotation logic is indeed correct, but when I start writing code to maintain the balances by +-1 increments backtracking up the tree, the code immediately turns into spaghetti, as I am clearly not understanding something fundamental about the node balance factor. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see that code, I&#39;ve posted it below ( its a bit long ). And the below implementation is also a String AVL Tree, but the idea is the same. \r\n\r\nAny input is appreciated, Thanks!\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass StringAVLNode {\r\n\tprivate String item;\r\n\tprivate int balance;\r\n\tprivate StringAVLNode left, right;\r\n\r\n\t// just one constructor, please\r\n\tpublic StringAVLNode(String str) {\r\n\t\titem = str;\r\n\t\tbalance = 0;\r\n\t\tleft = null;

So even though `data.table` knows that `sumV2` is sorted, it doesn&#39;t know that it&#39;s all the same value and therefore has to find where the groups within `sumV2` start and end.\r\n\r\nMy guess that it would be technically possible to write `data.table` in a way where keying doesn&#39;t just sort but actually stores the start/end rows of each group within keyed variables, but that this could potentially take up a lot of memory for data.tables with lots of groups.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, it seems like the recommendation might be to not repeat the same by statement over and over again and instead do everything you need to do in a single by statement.  This is probably a good recommendation in general, but is not the case with a small number of groups. See the following counterexample:\r\n\r\nI rewrote this in what I assumed would be the fastest possible way using data.table (only a single by statement, and making use of GForce):\r\n\r\n\r\n    library(data.table)\r\n    n &lt;- 1e8\r\n    y_unkeyed_5groups &lt;- data.table(sample(1:5,n, replace=TRUE),rnorm(n),rnorm(n))\r\n    y_unkeyed_10000groups &lt;- data.table(sample(1:10000,n, replace=TRUE),rnorm(n),rnorm(n))\r\n    \r\n    x &lt;- copy(y_unkeyed_5groups)\r\n    system.time({\r\n      x[, product:=V3*V2]\r\n      outDT &lt;- x[,list(sumV2=sum(V2),sumProduct=sum(product)),keyby=V1]\r\n      outDT[,`:=`(out=sumProduct/sumV2,sumProduct=NULL) ]\r\n      setkey(x,V1)\r\n      x[outDT,sumV2:=sumV2,all=TRUE]\r\n      x[,product:=NULL]\r\n      outDT\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    # Detected that j uses these columns: V3,V2 \r\n    # Assigning to all 100000000 rows\r\n    # Direct plonk of unnamed RHS, no copy.\r\n    # Detected that j uses these columns: V2,product \r\n    # Finding groups using forderv ... 0.350s elapsed (0.810s cpu) \r\n    # Finding group sizes from the positions (can be avoided to save RAM) ... 0.000s elapsed (0.000s cpu) \r\n    # lapply optimization is on, j unchanged as &#39;list(sum(V2), sum(product))&#39;\r\n    # GForce optimized j to &#39;list(gsum(V2), gsum(product))&#39;\r\n    # Making each group and running j (GForce TRUE) ... 1.610s elapsed (4.550s cpu) \r\n    # Detected that j uses these columns: sumProduct,sumV2 \r\n    # Assigning to all 5 rows\r\n    # RHS for item 1 has been duplicated because NAMED is 3, but then is being plonked. length(values)==2; length(cols)==2)\r\n    # forder took 0.98 sec\r\n    # reorder took 3.35 sec\r\n    # Starting bmerge ...done in 0.000s elapsed (0.000s cpu) \r\n    # Detected that j uses these columns: sumV2 \r\n    # Assigning to 100000000 row subset of 100000000 rows\r\n    # Detected that j uses these columns: product \r\n    # Assigning to all 100000000 rows\r\n    # user  system elapsed \r\n    # 11.00    1.75    5.33 \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    x2 &lt;- copy(y_unkeyed_5groups)\r\n    system.time({\r\n      x2[,sumV2:=sum(V2),keyby=V1]\r\n      outDT2 &lt;- x2[, list(sumV2=sumV2[1],out=sum(V3*V2)/sumV2[1]),keyby=V1]\r\n    })\r\n    # Detected that j uses these columns: V2 \r\n    # Finding groups using forderv ... 0.310s elapsed (0.700s cpu) \r\n    # Finding group sizes from the positions (can be avoided to save RAM) ... 0.000s elapsed (0.000s cpu) \r\n    # lapply optimization is on, j unchanged as &#39;sum(V2)&#39;\r\n    # Old mean optimization is on, left j unchanged.\r\n    # Making each group and running j (GForce FALSE) ... \r\n    # collecting discontiguous groups took 0.714s for 5 groups\r\n    # eval(j) took 0.079s for 5 calls\r\n    # 1.210s elapsed (1.160s cpu) \r\n    # setkey() after the := with keyby= ... forder took 1.03 sec\r\n    # reorder took 3.21 sec\r\n    # 1.600s elapsed (3.700s cpu) \r\n    # Detected that j uses these columns: sumV2,V3,V2 \r\n    # Finding groups using uniqlist on key ... 0.070s elapsed (0.070s cpu) \r\n    # Finding group sizes from the positions (can be avoided to save RAM) ... 0.000s elapsed (0.000s cpu) \r\n    # lapply optimization is on, j unchanged as &#39;list(sumV2[1], sum(V3 * V2)/sumV2[1])&#39;\r\n    # GForce is on, left j unchanged\r\n    # Old mean optimization is on, left j unchanged.\r\n    # Making each group and running j (GForce FALSE) ... \r\n    # memcpy contiguous groups took 0.347s for 5 groups\r\n    # eval(j) took 0.265s for 5 calls\r\n    # 0.630s elapsed (0.620s cpu) \r\n    # user  system elapsed \r\n    # 6.57    0.98    3.99 \r\n    \r\n    all.equal(x,x2)\r\n    # TRUE\r\n    all.equal(outDT,outDT2)\r\n    # TRUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, well it turns out that the efficiency gained by not repeating by statements and using GForce doesn&#39;t matter that much when there are only 5 groups.

Should I use `variable[1]` or should I include that variable in the by statement and use `.BY$variable`? Let&#39;s assume that I want the return value to include `variable` as column.\r\n\r\nIt seems pretty clearly from the following tests that putting additional variables in the `by` statement slows things down, even discounting the cost of keying by that new variable (or using trickery to tell `data.table` that no additional keying is necessary). Why is it that additional already-keyed `by` variables slow things down?  \r\n\r\nI guess I had hoped that including already-keyed `by` variables would be a convenient syntactical trick to including those variables in the return data.table without explicitly naming them in the `j` statement, but it seems like this is inadvisable since there is some sort of overhead associated with additional by variable, even if they&#39;re already keyed. So my question is, what causes this overhead? \r\n\r\nSome example data:\r\n\r\n    library(data.table)\r\n    n &lt;- 1e8\r\n    y &lt;- data.table(sample(1:5,n,replace=TRUE),rnorm(n),rnorm(n))\r\n    y[,sumV2:=sum(V2),keyby=V1]\r\n\r\nTiming shows that using the approach using `variable[1]` (in this case, `sumV2[1]`) is faster. \r\n\r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    system.time(x[, list(out=sum(V3*V2)/sumV2[1],sumV2[1]),keyby=V1])\r\n    system.time(x[, list(out=sum(V3*V2)/.BY$sumV2),keyby=list(V1,sumV2)])\r\n\r\nI guess this is not surprising, since `data.table` has no way of knowing that the groups defined by setkey(V1) and setkey(V1,sumV2) are actually identical.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I do find surprising is that even if the data.table is keyed on `setkey(V1,sumV2)` (and we entirely ignore the time it takes to set the new key), using `sumV2[1]` is still faster. Why is this?\r\n\r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    setkey(x,V1,sumV2)\r\n    system.time(x[, list(out=sum(V3*V2)/sumV2[1],sumV2[1]),by=V1])\r\n    system.time(x[, list(out=sum(V3*V2)/.BY$sumV2),by=list(V1,sumV2)])\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlus, the time it takes to do `setkey(x,V2,sumV2)` is non-negligible. Is there any way to trick data.table into skipping actually rekeying x by just telling it that the key isn&#39;t actually changing substantively?\r\n\r\n\r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    system.time(setkey(x,V1,sumV2))\r\n\r\nAnswering my own question, it seems like we can skip sorting when setting key just by assigning the &quot;sorted&quot; attribute. Is this allowed? Will it break things?\r\n\r\n        \r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    system.time({\r\n      setattr(x, &quot;sorted&quot;, c(&quot;V1&quot;,&quot;sumV2&quot;))\r\n      x[, list(out=sum(V3*V2)/.BY$sumV2),by=list(V1,sumV2)]\r\n    })\r\n\r\nWhether it&#39;s bad practice or could potentially break things, I do not know. But using `setattr` trickery is considerably faster than explicit keying:\r\n\r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    system.time({\r\n      setkey(x,V1,sumV2)\r\n      x[, list(out=sum(V3*V2)/.BY$sumV2),by=list(V1,sumV2)]\r\n    })\r\n\r\nbut even using `setattr` trickery combined with using `sumV2` in the by statement is still not as a fast as leaving `sumV2` out of the by statement entirely:\r\n\r\n\r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    system.time(x[, list(out=sum(V3*V2)/sumV2[1],sumV2[1]),keyby=V1])\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that using setting key via attributes and using sumV2 as a length-1 by variable within each group *should* be faster than only keying on V1 and using sumV2[1]. If `sumV2` isn&#39;t specified as a `by` variable, then the entire vector of repeated values in `sumV2` needs to get generated for each group prior to being subsetted to `sumV2[1]`. Compare this to when `sumV2` is a `by` variable, there is only a length-1 vector for `sumV2` in each group. Obviously my reasoning here is incorrect. Can anyone explain why? Why is `sumV2[1]` is the fastest option even compared to making `sumV2` a by variable after using `setattr` trickery?\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I was surprised to learn that using `attr&lt;-` was no slower than `setattr` (both instantaneous, implying no copying at all). This is contrary to my understanding that base R `foo&lt;-` functions make copies of the data.\r\n\r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    system.time(setattr(x, &quot;sorted&quot;, c(&quot;V1&quot;,&quot;sumV2&quot;)))\r\n    x &lt;- copy(y)\r\n    system.time(attr(x,&quot;sorted&quot;) &lt;- c(&quot;V1&quot;,&quot;sumV2&quot;))\r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant `SessionInfo()` used for this question:\r\n\r\n    data.table version 1.12.2\r\n    R version 3.5.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142097/efficiently-dealing-with-repeated-values-within-a-by-group-using-data-table","title":"Efficiently dealing with repeated values within a by group using data.table"},{"tags":["javascript","axios","cross-domain","fetch-api","ssh-tunnel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":51982,"user_id":3993662,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20ce5cf17ddc888ba9d7b5e639f040b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chris p bacon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3993662/chris-p-bacon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569659003,"post_id":58142096,"comment_id":102674478,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142096/accessing-endpoint-via-ssh-tunnel#comment102674478_58142096"},{"owner":{"reputation":570,"user_id":1147769,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bBly.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1147769/rich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":51982,"user_id":3993662,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20ce5cf17ddc888ba9d7b5e639f040b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chris p bacon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3993662/chris-p-bacon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569663463,"post_id":58142096,"comment_id":102675239,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142096/accessing-endpoint-via-ssh-tunnel#comment102675239_58142096"},{"owner":{"reputation":1110,"user_id":1139105,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3xAB.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"janniks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1139105/janniks"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569923153,"post_id":58142096,"comment_id":102744124,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142096/accessing-endpoint-via-ssh-tunnel#comment102744124_58142096"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":570,"user_id":1147769,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bBly.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1147769/rich"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570433841,"post_id":58182178,"comment_id":102898141,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142096/accessing-endpoint-via-ssh-tunnel/58182178#comment102898141_58182178"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1110,"user_id":1139105,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3xAB.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"janniks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1139105/janniks"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569923241,"creation_date":1569923241,"answer_id":58182178,"question_id":58142096,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58182178","body_markdown":"Try replacing **`localhost`** with **`127.0.0.1`**\r\n\r\nThis could be related to the address resolution in the browser vs. Postman.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142096/accessing-endpoint-via-ssh-tunnel/58182178#58182178","title":"Accessing endpoint via SSH tunnel"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8641,"user_id":1234087,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/623981dff194e144f20676961a2b6dba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mos&#232;

It looks like @current_user is being defined within a method as an instance variable, so that it may be used outside the method.  However, in the logged_in? method, no @ symbol is needed to call on it.  In fact, if I add rewrite logged_in? to use @current_user, it no longer works as intended!\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule SessionsHelper\r\n\r\n  # Logs in the given user.\r\n  def log_in(user)\r\n    session[:user_id] = user.id\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # Returns the current logged-in user (if any).\r\n  def current_user\r\n    if session[:user_id]\r\n      @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # Returns true if the user is logged in, false otherwise.\r\n  def logged_in?\r\n    !current_user.nil?\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try this in ruby, I&#39;m unable to use an instance variable in this way.  The example I tried is below.  When I call method2, I get an error that isn&#39;t fixed until I add an @ symbol in front of var1.  Can anyone help me understand this?

formatting doesn&#39;t overwrite row background color. \r\n\r\n**Edit2**: Adding explanation regarding `col_highlight` added.\r\n\r\nStarting at the beginning we have `col_highlight = c(5,8)-1` which creates a vector storing the columns we wish to have different formatting (bold, red font). We subtract one since arrays in javascript are zero-based.\r\n\r\nThe following line for `rhandsontable` allows us to pass in `col_highlight = col_highlight` so that we can later access these selected columns through `instance.params.col_highlight` in the renderer function later on. Once we access them and assign them to `hcols`, we make sure it is an array if it wasn&#39;t already.\r\n\r\nThe statement `if (hcols.includes(col))` checks to see if the `hcols` array contains the column (`col`) being rendered. If the column rendered is 5, this is contained in the vector (5, 8), and the `td.style` would be set to bold and red.\r\n\r\nNote that since `hrows` would only change background color, and `hcols` would only change font bold and color, one does not overwrite the other, and can be used together.\r\n\r\n[![table with select yellow background row and red and bold columns][2]][2]\r\n  \r\n  [1]: http://jrowen.github.io/rhandsontable/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HqMwO.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142090/color-a-whole-row-in-rhandsontable-based-on-a-string-value-in-one-column/58145762#58145762","title":"Color a whole row in rhandsontable based on a string value in one column"}],"owner":{"reputation":597,"user_id":3245256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d0358a02c42afeea4b4bb3920e6337b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3245256","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3245256/user3245256"},"last_editor":{"reputation":597,"user_id":3245256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d0358a02c42afeea4b4bb3920e6337b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3245256","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3245256/user3245256"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58145762,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570109856,"creation_date":1569625343,"last_edit_date":1569697716,"question_id":58142090,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58142090","body_markdown":"I have an rhandsontable and I want the WHOLE ROW to be yellow if the cell in the text in the last column (&quot;Comments&quot;) includes string &quot;missed&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe code below highlights any cell that has a value &#39;missed&#39;, but not the whole row.

The main key is that the &quot;for&quot; attribute in the &lt;partial&gt; tag needs to be a &quot;model&quot; attribute.  Using the &quot;for&quot; attribute is fine for display purposes in the partial view, but if your partial view is going to display a form and post the data back, then the &quot;model&quot; attribute is necessary for correct model binding to the form:\r\n\r\n    &lt;partial name=&quot;path to partial&quot; model=&quot;@Model.ChildViewModel&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nSee the following information from Microsoft on migrating from Html.Partial() to the &lt;partial&gt; tag: [Partial Tag Helper in ASP.NET Core][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/built-in/partial-tag-helper?view=aspnetcore-3.0#migrate-from-an-html-helper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142086/core-2-2-partial-view-posts-one-property-from-parent-view-model-but-the-posted-m","title":"Core 2.2 partial view posts one property from parent view model but the posted model has null property values"},{"tags":["pandas"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":161,"user_id":5693199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153748534338959/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fish11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5693199/fish11"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569654928,"post_id":58142085,"comment_id":102673829,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142085/printdataframe-is-taking-a-very-long-time#comment102673829_58142085"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11127947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/243aca79d60f1fadd360c914d564a31f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nathan wendt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11127947/nathan-wendt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569652897,"creation_date":1569625284,"last_edit_date":1569652897,"question_id":58142085,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58142085","body_markdown":"I am calling print() on a relatively small pandas.DataFrame() object (26 rows x 6 columns) and it is taking 30+ seconds to print.\r\n\r\nCreating the dataframe took a fraction of a second.

If you are no longer blocked by your source code nor your dependencies to fully transition to Python 3, why would you continue to also support Python 2?\r\n\r\nNowadays you would probably not bother supporting Python 2 in a stand-alone app, but when that document was written, Python 2 was the norm, so supporting both versions was essential for widely used applications and libraries.\r\n\r\n&gt; Is that only a consideration for when you might have users on both Python 2 and Python 3?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n&gt; If nothing imports my Python app, then there&#39;s no risk in fully migrating to Python 3 and dropping Python 2 support, correct? \r\n\r\nIt depends on the user base that your app targets.  You can expect most personal / consumer users to have Python 3 on their machines, or to be able to install it if it is not present or not the default Python (though note installing Python 3 may non-trivial for non-technical users).\r\n\r\nCommercial or institutional users *may* be required to use operating systems that don&#39;t have Python 3 installed, and may not have the rights to install Python 3 themselves.  In this case you would need to support Python 2 until these organisations upgrade to a suitable OS version.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142070/confusion-transitioning-from-python-2-to-python-3-why-support-both/58146052#58146052","title":"Confusion transitioning from Python 2 to Python 3: Why support both?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2411,"user_id":2823719,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":11,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1130352991/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ronald Aaronson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2823719/ronald-aaronson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569674374,"creation_date":1569674374,"answer_id":58146398,"question_id":58142070,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58146398","body_markdown":"This topic is particularly germane if you have developed code for the Python Package Index (PyPI) in Python 2 and are porting it to support both Python 2 and Python 3.

I&#39;ve written many scripts, but this time I think this one is too big for me. I&#39;m working on a script that would check the number of hours based on the schedule from the file and sum them up.\r\n\r\nI have a file with weekly schedule. By using grep it returns me time schedule (for example 13:00 - 20:30 or 13:30 - 21:30). Those files will come always in the same format, only the hours will be different so my grep query will always work. The only difference is that sometimes it will return four lines (with hours), sometimes less, sometimes more, dependes what&#39;s in the given file (I can always use grep -c if the number of those lines matters). \r\n\r\nWhen I subtract the finishing time from the starting time, the result is correct, although it won&#39;t work if the hours are a bit odd (for example 14:00 - 16:17). How can I achive that (2h and 17minutes)?\r\n\r\nAnd then I think I should use a loop. I tried a couple of things and got super confused and decided to come here.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far (26to31August is obviously the file with the schedule).\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n\r\n    #COUNT=$(grep -c &#39;[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]&#39; 26to31August)\r\n    FINISH=$(grep &#39;[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]&#39; 26to31August |head -1 |awk &#39;{ print $3 }&#39;)\r\n    START=$(grep &#39;[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]&#39; 26to31August |head -1 |awk &#39;{ print $1 }&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    VAR1=$(date -d &quot;${FINISH}&quot; +%s)\r\n    VAR2=$(date -d &quot;${START}&quot; +%s)\r\n \r\n    HOURS=$((VAR1-VAR2))\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECS2HOURS=$(expr $HOURS / 3600)\r\n    echo &quot;That day it&#39;s $SECS2HOURS hours&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nI want the script to echo each of those lines telling me how many hours it is per line and then add them all together. \r\n\r\nShould I use For loop? Should I use a function in the loop? \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll apprecieate your answers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142064/bash-time-schedule-and-loops-script","title":"bash: time schedule

Then you re-declare $favorites as an array when you add the brackets after it, but that is ignored because it is already an array, or as Alex suggests your array might lose it&#39;s format when you do that. Then with the = you push the post_id so it ends up at the end of the array. \r\n\r\nSo you end up with:\r\n\r\n    $this-&gt;wms_update_user_meta( array(&#39;stuff returned from wms_get_user_meta, $post_id);\r\n\r\nThat would explain why your 7 is always at the end of your data. \r\n\r\nI would take a look at the mws_get_user_meta function and make sure you are sending the right arguments.

kind of new to Docker, and I&#39;m running into an issue I can&#39;t find a straightforward explanation for. I have a pretty simple Dockerfile that I&#39;m building into an image, but when I deploy the image to Kubernetes as a pod, the results aren&#39;t what I expect.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM ubuntu:16.04\r\nRUN mkdir workspace\r\nWORKDIR /workspace\r\nCOPY . /workspace\r\nCMD [&quot;ls&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I check the logs for the deployment, there are no files listed in the /workspace folder, even though the folder itself exists. However, if I change my `COPY`&#39;s destination to a default linux folder like `/usr`, the files are there as I&#39;d expect. My suspicion is that this has something to do with storage persistence, but since I&#39;m copying the files into the folder when I build my image and the folder persists in the pod, I&#39;m at a loss for why this happens. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142042/docker-doesnt-copy-files-to-created-directories","title":"Docker doesn&#39;t COPY files to created directories"},{"tags":["html","shopify","liquid","shopify-template"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":420,"user_id":4878262,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfaf202f10cff2e6a1686a4297e61866?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lukasz Formela","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4878262/lukasz-formela"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569922074,"post_id":58142041,"comment_id":102743596,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142041/shopify-liquid-consecutive-for-loops-iterating-out-of-order#comment102743596_58142041"},{"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":3078958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vzQED.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jehy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3078958/jehy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":420,"user_id":4878262,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfaf202f10cff2e6a1686a4297e61866?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lukasz Formela","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4878262/lukasz-formela"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569947865,"post_id":58142041,"comment_id":102757845,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142041/shopify-liquid-consecutive-for-loops-iterating-out-of-order#comment102757845_58142041"},{"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":3078958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vzQED.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jehy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3078958/jehy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":420,"user_id":4878262,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfaf202f10cff2e6a1686a4297e61866?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lukasz Formela","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4878262/lukasz-formela"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569957848,"post_id":58142041,"comment_id":102761526,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142041/shopify-liquid-consecutive-for-loops-iterating-out-of-order#comment102761526_58142041"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":3078958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vzQED.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jehy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3078958/jehy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":42,"user_id":3078958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vzQED.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jehy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3078958/jehy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569966314,"last_edit_date":1569966314,"creation_date":1569957803,"answer_id":58191076,"question_id":58142041,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58191076","body_markdown":"The issue was due to pagination altering the order of the product listings *after* in-stock / out-of-stock loops generated html.

I need to submit it as as a single `.h` file.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to build i&#39;m getting errors on every mention of `LLnode`, `fwdPtr`, and `theData`. That is every element of the structure so Ive done something very wrong there. Also, the `struct` definition itself is marked with a `syntax error`\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate &lt;class V&gt;\r\nclass LL\r\n{\r\n\tprivate:\r\n\t\tLLnode * header;\r\n\t\tstruct &lt;V&gt; LLnode;\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tLLnode * fwdPtr; // has a pointer member\r\n\t\t\tV theData; // the data within the node\r\n\t\t};\r\n\r\n\tpublic:\r\n\t\tLL()\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\theader = nullptr;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\tvoid push_front(string data)  \r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tLLnode * new_node;\r\n\t\t\tnew_node = new LLnode;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tnew_node -&gt; theData = data;\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (header == nullptr)  \t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t{\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\theader = new_node;                    \r\n\t\t\t\tnew_node -&gt; fwdPtr = nullptr;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\telse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tLLnode * temp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\ttemp = header;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\theader = new_node;\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tnew_node -&gt; fwdPtr = temp;\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\t}\r\n        .... more functions below ....\r\n```\r\nIn the `main()`, upon which the function will be tested, a new linked list will be instantiated with `&lt;string&gt;` cast as the type. This is why I moved the `struct LLnode` inside the `private` member section of `class LL`. This is also why I am using `V` throughout the structure. Because that cast needs to reach down to the structure itself so when I dynamically allocate memory for nodes it will know to accept `string` data\r\n\r\nI know I will need to change the function definitions to include `V` and use `V` throughout with some of the variables. But I don&#39;t understand where and why. Im confused on how template classes relate to pointer and programmer defined structures. I understand the simple examples of template classes/functions in my textbook but I am lost here. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here are the error messages im receiving (as

+ &#39;k&#39; + &#39;=([^&amp;#]*)&#39;).exec(window.location.href);\r\n r2 = new RegExp(&#39;[\\?&amp;]&#39; + &#39;v&#39; + &#39;=([^&amp;#]*)&#39;).exec(window.location.href);\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142023/node-js-pre-render-dynamic-blog-and-server-static-html","title":"Node JS pre-render dynamic blog and server static html"},{"tags":["ruby"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15842,"user_id":580346,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba17945a06aac247b06548d5afe341e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mrzasa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/580346/mrzasa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569624653,"post_id":58142021,"comment_id":102670166,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142021/ruby-loop-until-set-time-and-if-the-condition-return-false-then-raise-and-except#comment102670166_58142021"},{"owner":{"reputation":74,"user_id":8888900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-34iG5_Wbu_U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/u2vjcbM4O-Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Blue Three Wheeler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8888900/blue-three-wheeler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569624717,"post_id":58142021,"comment_id":102670180,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142021/ruby-loop-until-set-time-and-if-the-condition-return-false-then-raise-and-except#comment102670180_58142021"},{"owner":{"reputation":6314,"user_id":3625433,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvUeh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lacostenycoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3625433/lacostenycoder"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569632397,"post_id":58142021,"comment_id":102671186,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142021/ruby-loop-until-set-time-and-if-the-condition-return-false-then-raise-and-except#comment102671186_58142021"},{"owner":{"reputation":67133,"user_id":2483313,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIBTG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"spickermann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2483313/spickermann"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569648925,"post_id":58142021,"comment_id":102672965,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142021/ruby-loop-until-set-time-and-if-the-condition-return-false-then-raise-and-except#comment102672965_58142021"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":425,"user_id":3907426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00cfb0223918d4ffe4847bce16c8e2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3907426/adrian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569716401,"post_id":58145921,"comment_id":102686210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142021/ruby-loop-until-set-time-and-if-the-condition-return-false-then-raise-and-except/58145921#comment102686210_58145921"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":425,"user_id":3907426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00cfb0223918d4ffe4847bce16c8e2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3907426/adrian"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569670638,"creation_date":1569670638,"answer_id":58145921,"question_id":58142021,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58145921","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t really understand the `1.upto(2)` part, but from your description I&#39;m guessing this is what you are trying to accomplish, right?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nstart = Time.now\r\nwhile (Time.now - start) &lt;

&lt;#-Recurse#&gt; | Where-Object {$_.Extension -eq &#39;.jpg&#39;}\r\n    # Perform the same steps below on every file that we got above by using foreach\r\n    foreach ($jpg in $jpgs) {\r\n        # Store the original file name in a variable for working on\r\n        [string]$originalBaseName = &quot;$($jpg.BaseName)&quot;\r\n        # Use RegEx to split the file name\r\n        [string]$substringToReplace = ($originalBaseName -split &#39;-[0-9]+-&#39;)[1]\r\n        # Re-add the &#39;-&#39; to the string which you want to remove from the file name\r\n        [string]$substringToReplace = &#39;-&#39; + $substringToReplace\r\n        # Remove the portion of the file name you want gone\r\n        [string]$newBaseName = $originalBaseName -replace &quot;$substringToReplace&quot;,&#39;&#39;\r\n        # Rename the file with the new file name\r\n        Rename-Item -Path &quot;$($jpg.FullName)&quot; -NewName &quot;$newBaseName$($jpg.Extension)&quot;\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142014/is-there-a-way-i-can-bulk-remove-part-of-a-filename-for-900ish-files/58142324#58142324","title":"Is there a way I can bulk remove part of a filename for 900ish files?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11420586,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a46de341415e1540656befed53461282?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AdmiralTuuvok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11420586/admiraltuuvok"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58142324,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1569629862,"creation_date":1569624489,"question_id":58142014,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58142014","body_markdown":"Need a way to remove parts of a filename.\r\n\r\nHave tried some Basic notepad++ stuff lol\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SM8QbWq.jpg\r\n\r\nImage shows mainly what I need!\r\n\r\ne.g\r\n\r\nsevenberry_island_paradise-SB-4131D1-4-S5090015(.jpg)\r\nto\r\nsevenberry_island_paradise-SB-4131D1-4(.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe item codes are after the SB-, e.g 4131D1-4, everything after this I don&#39;t want.\r\n\r\nAny way of removing this from all these files would be a huge huge huge help!!\r\n\r\nThanks!!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142014/is-there-a-way-i-can-bulk-remove-part-of-a-filename-for-900ish-files","title":"Is there a way I can bulk remove part of a filename for 900ish files?"},{"tags":["apache","centos7","ssi"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":1261114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f986c36043e7aa172b738f3a95d5d897?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WCS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1261114/wcs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570456102,"post_id":58249638,"comment_id":102908803,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58142013/how-to-get-server-side-includes-to-work-on-apache-which-is-installed-on-centros/58249638#comment102908803_58249638"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":1261114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f986c36043e7aa172b738f3a95d5d897?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WCS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1261114/wcs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":17,"user_id":1261114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f986c36043e7aa172b738f3a95d5d897?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"WCS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1261114/wcs"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570289134,"last_edit_date":1570289134,"creation_date":1570288459,"answer_id":58249638,"question_id":58142013,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58249638","body_markdown":"Got ssi to work on Centros 8 by setting XBitHack on.\r\n\r\nhttpd.conf:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Directory &quot;/var/www/html&quot;&gt;\r\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\r\n        AllowOverride All\r\n        Options +Includes\r\n        # AddType text/html .shtml\r\n        # AddHandler server-parsed .shtml\r\n        XBitHack on\r\n         Require all granted\r\n    &lt;/Directory&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd in the /var/www/html do:\r\n\r\n    chmod +x test.shml\r\n\r\nindex.htm:\r\n\r\n&gt;

I&#39;m doing some manipulations on an object in a collection, and then immediately afterwards getting it with a GET call.\r\n\r\n\r\n``` js\r\npost(&#39;/cars/1/wheels&#39;, {}...)\r\n.delete(&#39;/cars/1/doors/1&#39;)\r\n.delete(&#39;/cars/1/doors/2&#39;)\r\n.get(&#39;/cars/1&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created the REST-Api using async functions, and added `await` before all manipulating `MongoDB` calls. \r\n\r\nHowever, when the car object is fetched from the car collection above, it sometimes is not the current object with the manipulations, (It is outdated and will contain the two doors for example). It&#39;s rather unpredictable. When I check in the database all the manipulations have gone trough.\r\n\r\nCould it be that MongoDB is returning a cached version of the object in the collection? Is it possible to tell MongoDB to make a manipulation and force it to update the cache?\r\n\r\n# Edit:\r\nI&#39;m having a hard time isolating the problem and, I can&#39;t even find a deterministic way to reproduce the problem, so I&#39;m unable to create a minimum runnable example. The issue occurs, and when I do exactly the same thing again it doesn&#39;t occur.\r\n\r\nThe text above was just an illustrative example, this is what I&#39;m actually doing. I&#39;m doing three deletes in rapid succession and then getting the editor like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n\r\ndelete(/api/editors/editorId/editor-files/file1.png)\r\n.then(data =&gt; \r\n   delete(/api/editors/editorId/editor-files/file2.png)\r\n)\r\n.then(data =&gt; \r\n   delete(/api/editors/editorId/editor-files/file3.png)\r\n)\r\n.then(data =&gt; \r\n   get(/api/editors/editorId)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is part of the server code\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n.delete(&#39;/api/editors/:editorId/editor-files/:name&#39;, async function (req, res, next) {\r\n\r\n    const editor = await dbo.collection(&quot;editors&quot;).findOne({\r\n        _id: ObjectId(req.params.editorId)\r\n    })\r\n    if(!req.user || req.user._id.toString() !==  editor.authorId) return res.send({needLogin:true})\r\n\r\n    const fileInfo = editor.editedArticle.uploadedFiles.find( file =&gt; file.name === req.params.name )\r\n\r\n    // Delete binary\r\n    await dbo.collection(&#39;files&#39;).deleteOne({\r\n        _id: ObjectId(fileInfo.mediaId)\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    // Delete file info\r\n    await dbo.collection(&quot;editors&quot;).updateOne(\r\n        {_id: ObjectId(req.params.editorId)},\r\n        { \r\n            $pull: { &#39;editedArticle.uploadedFiles&#39;: { name:req.params.name } },\r\n        },\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    await updateArticleCardThumbnail(req.params.editorId, dbo)\r\n\r\n    res.send({})\r\n})\r\n\r\nasync function updateArticleCardThumbnail(editorId, dbo) {\r\n    const editor = await dbo.collection(&quot;editors&quot;).findOne({\r\n        _id: ObjectId(editorId)\r\n    })\r\n    const uploadedFiles = editor.editedArticle.uploadedFiles\r\n    let base64 = await getArticleCardThumbnailBase64FromUploadedFiles(uploadedFiles, dbo)\r\n    await dbo.collection(&#39;editors&#39;).updateOne(\r\n        {_id: ObjectId(editorId),},\r\n        {$set: { \r\n            &#39;editedArticle.cardThumbnailBase64&#39; : base64\r\n        }}\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync function getArticleCardThumbnailBase64FromUploadedFiles(uploadedFiles, dbo) {\r\n    let images = uploadedFiles.filter( f =&gt; /png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|bmp/ig.test(f.mimetype))\r\n    let imageNameBackground = images.find( f =&gt; /^thumbnail\\..*$/.test(f.name))\r\n    let backgroundImage = imageNameBackground || images[0]\r\n    let base64\r\n    if(backgroundImage) {\r\n        const imageWithBinary = await dbo.collection(&quot;files&quot;).findOne({ _id: ObjectId(backgroundImage.mediaId) })\r\n        const buffer = await sharp(imageWithBinary.data.buffer).resize(\r\n            500, 500, {\r\n                fit: &#39;inside&#39;,\r\n            }\r\n        ).toBuffer()\r\n        base64 = `data:${backgroundImage.mimetype};base64,${buffer.toString(&#39;base64&#39;)}`\r\n    }\r\n    return base64\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the GET endpoint i&#39;m just getting the editor with: `db.collection(&quot;editors&quot;).find(filter).toArray()`\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve logged the requests, so I know that the deletes returns before get.

This means the CLR will perform the work, so you won&#39;t find any source code doing the work.  If we dig into the CLR source code (here showing the coreclr) for the divide operator for floating point values:\r\n\r\n```template &lt;typename TFp, typename TFpTraits&gt;\r\nTFp FpDiv(TFp dividend, TFp divisor)\r\n{\r\n#ifdef _TARGET_ARMARCH_\r\n    // From the ECMA standard:\r\n    //\r\n    // If [dividend] is zero and [divisor] is zero\r\n    //   the result is NaN.\r\n    // If [dividend] is infinity and [divisor] is infinity\r\n    //   the result is NaN.\r\n\r\n    if (dividend == 0 &amp;&amp; divisor == 0)\r\n    {\r\n        return TFpTraits::NaN();\r\n    }\r\n    else if (!_finite(dividend) &amp;&amp; !_isnan(dividend) &amp;&amp; !_finite(divisor) &amp;&amp; !_isnan(divisor))\r\n    {\r\n        return TFpTraits::NaN();\r\n    }\r\n#endif // _TARGET_ARMARCH_\r\n\r\n    return dividend / divisor;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see it&#39;s handling some preconditions, then calling into the compiler&#39;s intrinsic operation.  On x86 that will in turn be a `FDIV` call, which is documented as raising a divide by zero flag, which the C runtime, thanks to IEEE 754, will turn into an infinity.  This infinity works it way back up the chain to your C# app.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58141996/where-is-the-code-that-does-floating-point-division-for-c/58142137#58142137","title":"Where is the code that does floating-point division for C#?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7928,"user_id":33311,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8148eaa9bda456c075c8abde84796e03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lernkurve","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/33311/lernkurve"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58142137,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569625974,"creation_date":1569624264,"question_id":58141996,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58141996","body_markdown":"###Question\r\n\r\nI would like to see the piece of code that does a floating-point division and returns `Infinity` when dividing by zero. Where can I find it?\r\n\r\n###Code example\r\n\r\nThe motivation of wanting to know that comes from this code taken from the .NET documentation. I would have expected to get a `DivideByZeroException` but instead I get `Infinity`.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dividebyzeroexception?view=netframework-4.8#remarks\r\n\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    \r\n    public class Example\r\n    {\r\n       public static void Main()\r\n       {\r\n          int number1 = 3000;\r\n          int number2 = 0;\r\n    \r\n          Console.WriteLine((double)number1 / number2);\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n    // The example displays the following output:\r\n    //        Infinity\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\n\r\nI found the documentation stating that floating-point division by zero does not throw an exception, so that&#39;s fine:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dividebyzeroexception?view=netframework-4.8#remarks\r\n\r\n&gt; Dividing a floating-point value by zero doesn&#39;t throw an exception; it\r\n&gt; results in positive infinity, negative infinity, or not a number\r\n&gt; (NaN), according to the rules of IEEE 754 arithmetic. Because the\r\n&gt; following example uses floating-point division rather than integer\r\n&gt; division, the operation does not throw a DivideByZeroException\r\n&gt; exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Code in .NET Framework\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, I hovered over the &quot;/&quot; division sign and Resharper shows\r\n\r\n    double double.operator /(double left, double right)\r\n\r\nAnd now, I&#39;d like to see the implementation of that to see how that `Infinity` is returned.

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df[&#39;a&#39;]\r\n0    1\r\n1    2\r\n2    3\r\nName: a, dtype: int64\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df[&#39;b&#39;]\r\n   b  b\r\n0  5  1\r\n1  9  1\r\n2  1  1\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df.columns.get_loc(&#39;a&#39;)\r\n0\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df.columns.get_loc(&#39;b&#39;)\r\narray([False,  True, False,  True, False, False])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI would recommend renaming your duplicate column names and avoiding the uncertainty that comes with having duplicate names in the future.

The device connected to the serial port is not guaranteed to support the requested baud rate, even if the port itself supports that baud rate.\r\n     * @property {number} [dataBits=8] Must be one of these: 8, 7, 6, or 5.\r\n     * @property {number} [highWaterMark=65536] The size of the read and write buffers defaults to 64k.\r\n     * @property {boolean} [lock=true] Prevent other processes from opening the port. Windows does not currently support `false`.\r\n     * @property {number} [stopBits=1] Must be one of these: 1 or 2.\r\n     * @property {string} [parity=none] Must be one of these: &#39;none&#39;, &#39;even&#39;, &#39;mark&#39;, &#39;odd&#39;, &#39;space&#39;.\r\n     * @property {boolean} [rtscts=false] flow control setting\r\n     * @property {boolean} [xon=false] flow control setting\r\n     * @property {boolean} [xoff=false] flow control setting\r\n     * @property {boolean} [xany=false] flow control setting\r\n     * @property {object=} bindingOptions sets binding-specific options\r\n     * @property {Binding=} Binding The hardware access binding. `Bindings` are how Node-Serialport talks to the underlying system.

BTW, we have a white list of exceptions that we don&#39;t report.  Think client abort exceptions.  For us, there really isn&#39;t any reason to report those.\r\n\r\nFor tasks that happen due to a user request, but shouldn&#39;t interfere with a user&#39;s result, we wrap those actions with a try/catch and then will send an email if that side action fails.\r\n\r\nAn example of a side action would be to update the search index if someone saves new data to the database.  The end user just wants to know that their item was saved successfully to the database, but they don&#39;t need to know that the update to the search index failed.  We (the developers do), but in general, the end user doesn&#39;t care.\r\n\r\nThen for backend tasks that require their own threads, we have created a thread that does a try/catch statement and will send an email if an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nA example of a task like this is reindexing your search index.  That can be a long running process and we don&#39;t want to keep an http connection open for the entire time that process is running, so we create a new thread for the reindexing to run in.  If something goes wrong, we want to know about it.\r\n\r\nHere is some example code to show you how we implement our services...\r\n\r\n    @Transactional\r\n    public UUID saveRecord(RecordRequest recordRequest) {\r\n\r\n        Record newRecord = this.recordFactory.create(recordRequest);\r\n\r\n        this.recordRepository.add(newRecord);\r\n\r\n        this.updateSearch(newRecord);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void updateSearch(Record record) {\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n\r\n            this.searchIndex.add(record);\r\n\r\n        catch(Exception e) {\r\n\r\n            this.errorService.reportException(e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is the code for our exception handling filter:\r\n\r\n    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n\r\n            filterChain.doFilter(request, response);\r\n\r\n        } catch (Throwable exception) {\r\n\r\n            this.handleException(request, response, exception);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void handleException(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, Throwable throwable) {\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n\r\n            this.doHandleException(request, response, throwable);\r\n\r\n        } catch (Exception handlingException) {\r\n\r\n            LOG.error(&quot;This exception that was not handled by the UnhandledExceptionFilter&quot;, throwable);\r\n            LOG.error(&quot;This exception occurred reporting an unhandled exception, please see the &#39;cause by&#39;

Twice...\r\n\r\nWe solved this problem by using Spring Integration (with activemq backed queues) to limit the number of emails sent.\r\n\r\nThen we used a counting strategy to track how many of the same exception are being sent and then try to bundle those emails into one email with the count of how many times that particular exception occurs.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58141963/get-all-exceptions-in-java-and-send-them-remotely/58262762#58262762","title":"Get all exceptions in Java and send them remotely"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":1103606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d93cc650b93939ea91066fcb5aefae0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Penzov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1103606/peter-penzov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570653730,"post_id":58311833,"comment_id":102985092,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58141963/get-all-exceptions-in-java-and-send-them-remotely/58311833#comment102985092_58311833"},{"owner":{"reputation":5971,"user_id":2561365,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/152534c42df05f9c540fc912f9a6e2d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew Mairose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2561365/andrew-mairose"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":118,"user_id":1103606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d93cc650b93939ea91066fcb5aefae0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Penzov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1103606/peter-penzov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570653946,"post_id":58311833,"comment_id":102985194,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58141963/get-all-exceptions-in-java-and-send-them-remotely/58311833#comment102985194_58311833"},{"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":1103606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d93cc650b93939ea91066fcb5aefae0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Penzov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1103606/peter-penzov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570656164,"post_id":58311833,"comment_id":102985996,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58141963/get-all-exceptions-in-java-and-send-them-remotely/58311833#comment102985996_58311833"},{"owner":{"reputation":5971,"user_id":2561365,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/152534c42df05f9c540fc912f9a6e2d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew Mairose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2561365/andrew-mairose"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":118,"user_id":1103606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d93cc650b93939ea91066fcb5aefae0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Penzov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1103606/peter-penzov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571087006,"post_id":58311833,"comment_id":103116137,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58141963/get-all-exceptions-in-java-and-send-them-remotely/58311833#comment103116137_58311833"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5971,"user_id":2561365,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/152534c42df05f9c540fc912f9a6e2d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew Mairose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2561365/andrew-mairose"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5971,"user_id":2561365,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/152534c42df05f9c540fc912f9a6e2d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew Mairose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2561365/andrew-mairose"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570653369,"last_edit_date":1570653369,"creation_date":1570653019,"answer_id":58311833,"question_id":58141963,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311833","body_markdown":"Look into Spring&#39;s [`@ControllerAdvice`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ControllerAdvice.html) annotation.

We don&#39;t send emails for `ClientAbortExceptions`, as those occur often when a user closes their browser while a request is being processed.\r\n\r\n    @ControllerAdvice\r\n    public class GlobalExceptionHandler {\r\n    \r\n        private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class);\r\n\r\n        private static final String ERROR_EMAIL_ADDRESS = &quot;foo@bar.com&quot;;\r\n        private static final String APPLICATION_ERROR_SUBJECT = &quot;Foo Error Occurred&quot;;\r\n        private static final String USER_AGENT = &quot;user-agent&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        @ExceptionHandler(value = Exception.class)\r\n        @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)\r\n        public ResponseEntity defaultErrorHandler(final HttpServletRequest request, final Principal principal, final Exception e) {\r\n            final String userTime = principal.getName() + &quot; triggered an error at &quot; + new Date();\r\n            final String userAgent = &quot;User-Agent: &quot; + StringUtils.trimToEmpty(request.getHeader(USER_AGENT));\r\n            final String url = &quot;URL: &quot; + StringUtils.trimToEmpty(request.getRequestURL().toString());\r\n            final String httpMethod = &quot;HTTP method: &quot; + request.getMethod();\r\n    \r\n            final StringBuilder emailSb = new StringBuilder();\r\n            emailSb.append(userTime).append(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n            emailSb.append(userAgent).append(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n            emailSb.append(url).append(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n            emailSb.append(httpMethod).append(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n    \r\n            if(e instanceof ClientAbortException){\r\n                logger.debug(&quot;Not sending email for socketExceptions&quot;);\r\n            }else {\r\n                emailSb.append(ExceptionUtils.getStackTrace(e));\r\n                //just a simple util class we use to send emails with javax.mail api\r\n                EmailUtil.sendEmail(ERROR_EMAIL_ADDRESS, ERROR_EMAIL_ADDRESS, APPLICATION_ERROR_SUBJECT,\r\n                                    emailSb.toString());\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            return new ResponseEntity(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58141963/get-all-exceptions-in-java-and-send-them-remotely/58311833#58311833","title":"Get all exceptions in Java and send them remotely"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":95,"user_id":2738014,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8R0R6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nabeel Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2738014/nabeel-ahmed"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570655394,"creation_date":1570655394,"answer_id":58312357,"question_id":58141963,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312357","body_markdown":"You can follow these step to send error remotely.
