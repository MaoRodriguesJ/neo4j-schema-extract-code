It is uncommon to override this option. When running multiple instances of Solr on the same host, it is more common to use the same server directory for each instance and use a unique Solr home directory using the `-s` option. Example: `bin/solr start -d newServerDir`\r\n\r\n&gt; **`-s &lt;dir&gt;`:** Sets the `solr.solr.home` system property; Solr will create core directories under this directory. This allows you to run multiple Solr instances on the same host while reusing the same server directory set using the `-d` parameter. If set, the specified directory should contain a `solr.xml` file, unless `solr.xml` exists in ZooKeeper. The default value is `server/solr`. This parameter is ignored when running examples (`-e`), as the `solr.solr.home` depends on which example is run.

You are correct, you need your CA certificate that has the template attached to it from JITP, your device certificate, and your private key.\r\nFor device certificate &amp; private key, these should be unique per device, and should be placed on the device once (via running the provisioning demo or via a direct write to the file names expected in\r\niot_pkcs11_pal.c at manufacturing time)\r\n\r\nFor the CA &quot;JITP/JITR Certificate&quot;, you have 2 options- you can either modify the iot_pkcs11_pal.c to take in this certificate and store it, or if JITR certifciate is the same between all devices, you can just leave the #define keyJITR_DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_PEM in the code.\r\n\r\nWith multiple devices, one more thing to consider is the Thing Name- you can use a field of the device certificate to communicate your &quot;Thing Name&quot; to AWS IoT, for example the device certificate CommonName field.  The #define clientcredentialIOT_THING_NAME can be replaced with a function (ie getThingName()) which parses the certificate and stores the thing name somewhere that other libraries can refer to it. Thing Name should be unique per device- some people use a device unique ID for Thing Names.\r\n\r\nWhen the device connects with a CA set up with JITP, since each device certificate is unique, it can create a different thing (and register the device certificate and attach a policy) for each different device.\r\n\r\n2. Yes this is valid given that you place the device certificate &amp; private key at manufacturing and programatically retrieve your thing name as mentioned above.\r\n\r\n3. Once your device is registered with AWS IoT and able to connect and send MQTT messages, you could use AWS IoT Rules to set up rules for what to do with data coming in ([This tutorial][1] shows adding data from MQTT messages to DynamoDB, triggering a Lambda Function to execute code that you write, or sending an SNS message)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules-tutorial.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58499046/how-to-embed-aws-just-in-time-provisioning-jitp-into-your-microcontroller-run/58512983#58512983","title":"How to embed AWS Just In Time Provisioning (JITP) into your microcontroller (running Freertos)"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":9115897,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N6lVC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"monkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9115897/monkey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571782649,"creation_date":1571729021,"question_id":58499046,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58499046","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get an application running in amazon freertos that uses the just in time provisioning mechanism to allow provisioning of a fleet of devices.  \r\n\r\nI have run through the steps to [set up a demo application in freertos][1] for an Espressif ESP32 device. This works fine, but it involves effectively manually copying in your credentials directly into the source code, in one of the scripts you run. Good proof of concept, but no good for production. \r\n\r\nI have separately run through the process of [setting up JITP][2] in the AWS backend. The last step is to manually invoke mosquitto from bash to send up a fake message, mimicking an MQTT transmission from a device. \r\n\r\nThis has the effect of correctly provisioning a device. \r\n\r\nMy question is how do I take these building blocks and build multiple hardware devices and have them all provision and connect successfully to AWS IOT. \r\n\r\nSome specific points:\r\n1. What files go into the device firmware? I confess a lack of expertise in the crypto and certificates side. My guess would be I need to put root.cert; deviceVertAndCACert.crt; deviceCert.key into the device and ping the MQTT request exactly as per the fake message. But how does this vary for multiple devices? What distinguishes one device from another?\r\n\r\n2. I assume the actual code in the hardware device is the same for all devices.

use Freemarker templates in Ktor web server framework.\r\nBy default, I pass a FreeMarkerContent to the response:\r\n\r\n            get(&quot;/login&quot;) {\r\n                val resp = FreeMarkerContent(&quot;login.ftl&quot;, NO_PARAM, &quot;e&quot;)\r\n                call.respond(resp)\r\n            }\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to is to add a special post process applied on the rendered web page, so my process pipe should be: template + data --[Freemarker]--&gt; rendered page --[Post processor]--&gt; final page. How could I insert a post process phase into?\r\n\r\nMy ideas:\r\n\r\n 1.  Render the page manually, then apply the processor also manually\r\nFor this, I need a Freemarker instance to call and render the output, which should be text based to be able to get and post process. At the moment I can&#39;t find how to get this instance and how to produce rendered page.\r\n 2. Inject some kind of processor into the process pipeline\r\nI need some way to add processor to the pipeline, but it only pass a Content which is executed by the call.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** \r\n\r\nI found out I can create new feature and by the example I did it. After hours of try, code dumping and several failed attempts, I was able to intercept the output of the Freemarker, but couldn&#39;t do anything with it to get the rendered text. \r\n\r\nFinally, seeing that the Freemarker adapter is thin, I made an awful (hopfuly temporal), solution: I cloned the Freemarker feature source and created my own version, injecting my post-process code:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * Represents a content handled by [GlossaryFreeMarker] feature.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param template name that is resolved by freemarker\r\n     * @param model to be passed during template rendering\r\n     * @param etag value for `E-Tag` header (optional)\r\n     * @param contentType of response (optional, `text/html` with UTF-8 character encoding by default)\r\n     */\r\n    class GlossaryFreeMarkerContent (\r\n            val template: String,\r\n            val model: Any?,\r\n            val etag: String? = null,\r\n            val contentType: ContentType = ContentType.Text.Html.withCharset(Charsets.UTF_8)\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * Freemarker support feature.

This solution has limitations (all my pages should be Freemarker templates) This solution is awful. This solution is surely not the right way to do it...

Another thing I tried was to dump the memory diff - from one point in time to another (ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/399115/63883): `dump memory ./dump_diff3.dump 0x0f3da000 0x0f43e000` I&#39;m seeing that there a bunch of certificate information being saved in the resident set:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI figured this would probably mean a leak in some of the python libraries. I updated the requests library and all the dependencies, but the leak is still there and still there is a bunch of certificate information being saved.\r\n\r\n**Question:** What would be the next step to try? My thinking was to upgrade the OpenSSL library and the python wrapper (listing the versions below) - but I&#39;m interested in some other troubleshooting techniques and solutions:\r\n\r\n    root@688213:~# dpkg -l &#39;*openssl*&#39;\r\n    Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\r\n    | Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\r\n    |/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\r\n    ||/ Name                               Version                Architecture           Description\r\n    +++-==================================-======================-======================-=========================================================================\r\n    ii  libgnutls-openssl27:amd64          3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5      amd64                  GNU TLS library - OpenSSL wrapper\r\n    ii  openssl                            1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.15     amd64                  Secure Sockets Layer toolkit - cryptographic utility\r\n    ii  openssl-blacklist                  0.5-3                  all                    Blacklists for  OpenSSL RSA keys and tools\r\n    un  python-openssl-doc                 &lt;none&gt;                 &lt;none&gt;                 (no description available)\r\n    ii  python3-openssl                    17.3.0-1~0+ubuntu16.04 all                    Python 3 wrapper around the OpenSSL library\r\n    un  python3-openssl-dbg                &lt;none&gt;                 &lt;none&gt;                 (no description available)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZS0f.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58499032/how-to-proceed-with-memory-leak-troubleshooting-related-to-a-python-process","title":"How to proceed with memory leak troubleshooting related to a Python process?"},{"tags":["reactjs","typescript","jestjs","simulate"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":8060041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3HjOF3URnDk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAbGM/cWSbLe199C0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"lek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8060041/lek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571732645,"post_id":58499031,"comment_id":103328724,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58499031/wrapper-doesnt-find-node-after-react-version-upgrade-from-16-4-0-to-16-8-6#comment103328724_58499031"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12255420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1524901e5cad2b7a6d159a2b2549c683?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kishor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12255420/kishor"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7279,"user_id":2071697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7d1ded508aa80214b01298b83562406?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"skyboyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2071697/skyboyer"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571732943,"creation_date":1571728972,"last_edit_date":1571732943,"question_id":58499031,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58499031","body_markdown":"I am trying to upgrade react version for an app, and jest file fails at simulate(), saying- \r\n&quot;Method simulate is only meant to be run on a single node. 0 found instead&quot;\r\n\r\nI think something is wrong with wrapper.

A `List&lt;Car&gt;` as `Neighbors` would work much more directly, and avoids a *lot* of problems.

My goal is to update the counter variables with the result from the execution of the function.\r\n\r\nI have them declared as such\r\n\r\n    int cor_letters = 0;\r\n    int cor_place = 0;\r\n\r\nand then call my function like\r\n\r\n    res = compare(input, secret_word, &amp;cor_letters, &amp;cor_place);\r\n\r\nMy `compare` function header is:\r\n\r\n    bool compare(string user_input, string secret, int * correct_letters, int * correct_place)\r\n\r\nand in my `compare` code, when I get the final values of the counters, I update them as such:\r\n\r\n    correct_letters = &amp;cor_l;\r\n    correct_place = &amp;cor_p;\r\n\r\nI arrived at this solution after carefully reading through my compiler errors, and this seems to work.

But its the final assignments that I&#39;m confused by - the pointers (note they&#39;re the var names from the function header) are then being updated to the address of the temporary inner function variables that I&#39;m using. Why does this get me the values?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m more of a visual learner, and pointers are hard to grasp by just reading some text, so if you wouldn&#39;t mind making some quick text diagram to represent what&#39;s going on, that would be great.

How can I make Spring to use my custom validator to validate method input??\r\n\r\nPS obviously I can inject validator and invoke it directly, but that is not what I want.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498981/is-it-possible-to-use-custom-spring-validator-to-validate-method-input-just-like","title":"Is it possible to use custom Spring validator to validate method input just like input of controller method in MVC?"},{"tags":["vuejs2","jestjs","axios"],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":5209016,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bwgsG9PjtL0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQc/RN6bACHYWHA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rushabh sojitra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5209016/rushabh-sojitra"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7279,"user_id":2071697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7d1ded508aa80214b01298b83562406?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"skyboyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2071697/skyboyer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571732954,"creation_date":1571728743,"last_edit_date":1571732954,"question_id":58498976,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498976","body_markdown":"I am using JEST for testing \r\n\r\nThis is my api.js which is a list of endpoints\r\n\r\n    import axios from &#39;axios&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    const apiClient = axios.create({\r\n        baseURL: &#39;http://172.16.3.171:8085&#39;,\r\n        \r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    export default {\r\n        \r\n        displayApplications()\r\n        {\r\n            return apiClient.get(&#39;/getData/application/list&#39;);\r\n        },\r\n        getActiveApplicationsCount(){\r\n            return apiClient.get(&#39;/getData/ActiveApplicationCount&#39;);\r\n        },\r\n        getInactiveApplicationsCount(){\r\n            return apiClient.get(&#39;/getData/InActiveApplicationCount&#39;);\r\n        },\r\n        getTotalApplicationsCount(){\r\n            return apiClient.get(&#39;/getData/AllApplicationCount&#39;);\r\n        },\r\n        postSaveApplication(){\r\n            return apiClient.post(&#39;/getData/application/addOrUpdate&#39;,formData);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere i am calling the display function in `methods{}`:\r\n\r\n    async displayData(){\r\n        try {\r\n          console.log(&#39;in displayData:---*****---&#39;)\r\n          const response =  await this.$api.displayApplications().then(res =&gt;

as Delimiter\r\n\r\nI then have this button, called $createbutton, and when it is pressed this happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$createbutton.Add_Click({\r\n\r\n    $first = $firstname.Text\r\n    $last = $lastname.Text\r\n    $login = $loginname.Text\r\n    $phone = $phonework.Text\r\n    $d = $delimiter.Text\r\n\r\n    $txt | Set-Content &#39;users.txt&#39;\r\n\r\n$first+$d+$last+$d+$login+$d+$phone | Add-Content &#39;users.txt&#39;\r\n\r\n})\r\n```\r\nSo when I open my users.txt file I&#39;ll have this:\r\nDonald;Duck;DuckyDonald;123456789\r\n\r\nSo, my form &quot;works&quot; without issues, but only when I create one user at a time. Now what I would like is to be able to input multiple FirstName,LastName,LoginName,Phonework and when I press the button it will automatically sort out the different values depending on which position they&#39;re at.  \r\n\r\nSo let&#39;s say I enter this information:  \r\nDonald,Mickey,Goofy as FirstName  \r\nDuck,Mouse,Goof as LastName  \r\nDuckyDonald,MousyMick,GoofDaGoof as LoginName  \r\n123,456,789 as PhoneWork  \r\n; as Delimiter  \r\n\r\nI would like it to paste it like this in the users.txt file:    \r\nDonald;Duck;DuckyDonald;123  \r\nMickey;Mouse;MousyMick;456  \r\nGoofy;Goof;GoofDaGoof;789  \r\n\r\nNow, the possible issues I&#39;m seeing with this is:\r\nIf I have a set &quot;Delimiter&quot; and using &quot;,&quot; when I enter several names, it will include both &quot;,&quot; and &quot;;&quot; - How should I deal with that?\r\n\r\nAs to why I am asking about this, is because I don&#39;t really know Powershell well enough to know how to achieve something like this or if it even is possible? \r\nNow, I don&#39;t want a &quot;solution&quot; per se, I would rather much more enjoy a &quot;push&quot; in the right direction to what I could do differently. If you have any documentation I could follow, or if you have any other tips, anything is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498973/how-to-sort-textbox-input-value-to-a-output-file-with-a-delimiter","title":"How to sort TextBox input value to a output file with a delimiter?"},{"tags":["kubernetes","kubernetes-helm","nginx-ingress"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3063,"user_id":4747193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WBKGw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"weibeld","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4747193/weibeld"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3063,"user_id":4747193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WBKGw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"weibeld","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4747193/weibeld"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571731083,"last_edit_date":1571731083,"creation_date":1571729878,"answer_id":58499253,"question_id":58498972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58499253","body_markdown":"Remove the curly braces and delimit the `udp-services-configmap` argument with a period:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm upgrade --install ${release_name} \\\r\n--set controller.extraArgs.udp-services-configmap=default/cm-udp-services \\\r\nstable/nginx-ingress\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if you use a `values.yaml` file, the usual way to write it is:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ncontroller:\r\n  extraArgs:\r\n    udp-services-configmap: default/cm-udp-services\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need curly braces in YAML, except for denoting an empty object (`extraArgs: {}`).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498972/why-i-get-some-strange-chars-when-i-deploy-with-helm-via-the-command-line/58499253#58499253","title":"Why I get some strange chars when I deploy with Helm via the command line?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1315,"user_id":1163667,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c09jd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kostas Demiris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1163667/kostas-demiris"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1315,"user_id":1163667,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c09jd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kostas Demiris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1163667/kostas-demiris"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58499253,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571823400,"creation_date":1571728719,"last_edit_date":1571823400,"question_id":58498972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498972","body_markdown":"I am trying to deploy [the nginx-ingress helm chart][1] and I want to provide some `extraArgs`.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that, when I try to pass the arguments from the console\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm upgrade --install ${release_name} \\\r\n--set controller.extraArgs={udp-services-configmap=default/cm-udp-services} \\\r\nstable/nginx-ingress\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get this when I `describe` the deployment.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Args:\r\n      /nginx-ingress-controller\r\n      --default-backend-service=default/tcp-udp-ic-nginx-ingress-default-backend\r\n      --election-id=ingress-controller-leader\r\n      --ingress-class=nginx\r\n      --configmap=default/tcp-udp-ic-nginx-ingress-controller\r\n      --0=udp-services-configmap:default/cm-udp-services\r\n```\r\n\r\nI just don&#39;t understand why I get this **0=**.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I add the extra argument via the `values.yml` file, \r\n\r\n```\r\n  ## Additional command line arguments to pass to nginx-ingress-controller\r\n  ## E.g. to specify the default SSL certificate you can use\r\n  ## extraArgs:\r\n  ##   default-ssl-certificate: &quot;&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;secret_name&gt;&quot;\r\n  extraArgs: {\r\n               udp-services-configmap=default/cm-udp-services\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\neverything is ok.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else encounter this?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services.md\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nEven though weibeld&#39;s answer solved the problem, I observe that when I deploy the IC, the service unfortunately does not have the ports that are stated in the config-map open.

1`, so it will add numbers only once, independent of the occurences. If a number is 5 times in the vector, the first 3 will be ignored, the 4th will make it into the new vector and the 5th will be ignored again. So you can remove the `erase` of the duplicates\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;algorithm&gt;\r\n     \r\n    using namespace

The Data seems to be output in the right quantity, the comparison leads to wrong results.\r\n\r\nHere is my current approach to this problem:\r\n```\r\n$diskPaths = Get-ChildItem &#39;c:\\ClusterStorage\\*&#39; -Recurse -Include *.vhd, *.vhdx | % &quot;Path&quot;\r\nforeach($node in (Get-Clusternode -Cluster CLUSTER01)){\r\n$vm = (Get-VM -ComputerName $node)\r\n$vmDisk= (Get-VMHardDiskDrive -ComputerName $node -VMName ($tempvar1.Name)  -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | % &quot;Path&quot;)\r\n```\r\nThen, some magic is done to basically format the data so it is the same layout. Not really, basically all I do is turn everything to lowercase, because NTFS is case insensitive. Finally, I run this:\r\n```\r\nCompare-Object -ReferenceObject $vmDisk -DifferenceObject $diskPaths | % &quot;InputObject&quot;\r\n```\r\nI also check if it is Attached, but that still does nothing. It even manages to show disks of running VMs as unattached. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just my fault or if Hyper-V just does a bad job of this.\r\n\r\nWhat I expect of this code is to output a list of paths. These paths lead to VHDs that are not attached to anything, meaning:\r\nThe disk is not attached to a VM with the State &#39;off&#39;\r\nThe disk is not attached to a VM with the State &#39;on&#39;\r\n\r\nSo the VHD is not attached to ANYTHING. It just lies there because we forgot to delete it after we deleted the VM. Simple as that. The output in reality is a list of paths that point to VHDs, some are correctly listed here, others belong to a turned off VM or even a running one.\r\n\r\nI am currently using Powershell 4.0 on Windows Server 2016 Datacenter.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498940/powershell-script-is-picks-up-vhds-from-running-vms-as-unattached","title":"Powershell Script is picks up VHDs from running VMs as unattached"},{"tags":["oracle","batch-file","report","builder","reportbuilder"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11347,"user_id":7818749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4a72453e116debb802d55e88c2572e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerhard Barnard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7818749/gerhard-barnard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571729243,"post_id":58498938,"comment_id":103327109,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498938/create-reports-with-oracle-6i-and-batch-database-change#comment103327109_58498938"},{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":9659682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54aa7d2b5afd71fc88f5ceb4666733f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KleeSchulz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9659682/kleeschulz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11347,"user_id":7818749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4a72453e116debb802d55e88c2572e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerhard Barnard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7818749/gerhard-barnard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571729542,"post_id":58498938,"comment_id":103327246,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498938/create-reports-with-oracle-6i-and-batch-database-change#comment103327246_58498938"},{"owner":{"reputation":11347,"user_id":7818749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4a72453e116debb802d55e88c2572e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerhard Barnard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7818749/gerhard-barnard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571729637,"post_id":58498938,"comment_id":103327277,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498938/create-reports-with-oracle-6i-and-batch-database-change#comment103327277_58498938"},{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":9659682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54aa7d2b5afd71fc88f5ceb4666733f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KleeSchulz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9659682/kleeschulz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11347,"user_id":7818749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4a72453e116debb802d55e88c2572e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerhard Barnard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7818749/gerhard-barnard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571729871,"post_id":58498938,"comment_id":103327389,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498938/create-reports-with-oracle-6i-and-batch-database-change#comment103327389_58498938"},{"owner":{"reputation":11347,"user_id":7818749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4a72453e116debb802d55e88c2572e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerhard Barnard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7818749/gerhard-barnard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571730028,"post_id":58498938,"comment_id":103327460,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498938/create-reports-with-oracle-6i-and-batch-database-change#comment103327460_58498938"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":9659682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54aa7d2b5afd71fc88f5ceb4666733f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KleeSchulz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9659682/kleeschulz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20441,"user_id":6738015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FYDxX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Compo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6738015/compo"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571734318,"creation_date":1571728553,"last_edit_date":1571734318,"question_id":58498938,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498938","body_markdown":"I automate our reports.

Given that the bishop starts on rank `r`, it can move up no more than `r - 1` ranks before landing on the first rank. It may hit the first file before that if `c &lt; r`, in which case it will only be able to move `c - 1` squares. For example if the bishop starts at `r = 5` and `c = 4`, it will be able to move three squares, not four. Thus the top-left formula is `min(r - 1, c - 1)`, which can be refactored to `min(r, c) - 1`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when heading towards the bottom-left corner, the rank increases while the file decreases. The bishop can move at most `8 - r` ranks and at most `c - 1` files, so the bottom-left formula is `min(8 - r, c - 1)`. That can be refactored to `8  max(r, 9  c)`, although this expression seems more convoluted.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498929/what-is-the-logic-behind-calculating-diagonals-on-a-chessboard/58523851#58523851","title":"What is the logic behind calculating diagonals on a chessboard?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12123964,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAgIo-RiQ3h2icrFUoyBkw8mM0ms3jFV_t2s63r=k-s128","display_name":"Syed Sher Ali Hussain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12123964/syed-sher-ali-hussain"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12123964,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAgIo-RiQ3h2icrFUoyBkw8mM0ms3jFV_t2s63r=k-s128","display_name":"Syed Sher Ali Hussain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12123964/syed-sher-ali-hussain"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571836834,"creation_date":1571728485,"last_edit_date":1571728852,"question_id":58498929,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498929","body_markdown":"Given the position of a Bishop on an 8 * 8 chessboard, the task is to count the total number of squares that can be visited by the Bishop in one move.

this, i would suggest to use a component to wrap your application where you have your toast. For example:\r\n\r\nApp.js\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;Provider store = { store }&gt;\r\n              &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\r\n                  &lt;AppContainer/&gt;\r\n              &lt;/View&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Provider&gt;\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhere your `AppContainer` would have a render method similar to this:\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n        return (\r\n            &lt;Frament&gt;\r\n                &lt;StatusBar barStyle=&quot;default&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;AppNavigator /&gt;\r\n                &lt;Toast&gt;&lt;/Toast&gt;\r\n            &lt;/Fragment&gt;\r\n            )\r\n    }\r\nThen (as you are using redux) you can connect your `AppContainer`. After that, just make this component aware of changes on redux using `componentDidUpdate`\r\n\r\n\r\n    componentDidUpdate = (prevProps) =&gt; {\r\n        if(this.props.redux_toast.visible !== prevProps.redux_toast.visible){\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                toastVisible : this.props.redux_toast.visible,\r\n                toastMessage: this.props.redux_toast.message\r\n            })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is just an example on how it could be done by using redux, I don&#39;t know how your toast or redux structure is, but it should be an available solution for your use case.\r\n\r\nEDIT.\r\n\r\nThis is how it should look like:\r\n\r\n    //CORE\r\n    import React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    //REDUX\r\n    import { Provider } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\n    import store from &#39;./redux/store/store&#39;;\r\n    import AppContainer from &#39;./AppContainer&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    export default () =&gt;

was trying to implement the &quot;Bonferroni inequality&quot; which models the probability of the union of many independent events for a data science use case on GCP BigQuery using a Javascript UDF. However I&#39;m quite unfamiliar with JS and have no clue of the good practices.\r\n\r\nThe formula to apply is the following:\r\n\r\n    P(U Ai) = SUM(P(Ai)) - SUM(P(Ai)*P(Aj)) + SUM(P(Ai)*P(Aj)*P(Ak) - ... i != j != k\r\n\r\nMy input for this function is an array of the single event probabilities: \r\n```\r\n[P(A1), P(A2), P(A3), ...] \r\n```\r\nI instinctively made &quot;for loops&quot; in rows to get the result however, it hurts to see a code this ugly so was wondering if any of you had an idea on how to achieve it in a more elegant and optimized way?\r\n\r\nHere is the function I wrote for a level 4 Bonferroni inequality : \r\n\r\n    function unionBoundProbability(probList){\r\n    \r\n      var intersection2 = 0;\r\n      var intersection3 = 0;\r\n      var intersection4 = 0;\r\n      var i = 0;\r\n      var j = 0;\r\n      var k = 0;\r\n      var l = 0;\r\n      var sum = 0;\r\n      var product = 1;\r\n    \r\n      var sum = probList.reduce((a, b) =&gt; a + b, 0);\r\n    \r\n      for(i = 0; i &lt; probList.length; i++){\r\n        product *= probList[i];\r\n        for(j = i+1; j &lt; probList.length; j++){\r\n          intersection2 += probList[i]*probList[j];\r\n          for(k = j+1; k &lt; probList.length; k++){\r\n            intersection3 += probList[i]*probList[j]*probList[k];\r\n            for(l = k+1; l &lt; probList.length; l++){\r\n              intersection4 += probList[i]*probList[j]*probList[k]*probList[l];\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      switch (probList.length) {\r\n        case 0:\r\n          return 0;\r\n          break;\r\n        case 1:\r\n          return probList[0];\r\n          break;\r\n        case 2:\r\n          return sum - product;\r\n          break;\r\n        case 3:\r\n          return sum - intersection2 + product;\r\n          break\r\n        case 4:\r\n          return sum - intersection2 + intersection3 - product;\r\n        case 5 :\r\n          return sum - intersection2 + intersection3 - intersection4 + product;\r\n        default:\r\n          return Math.max((sum - intersection2 + intersection3  - intersection4), Math.max.apply(Math, probList));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is to calculate an approximation of the probability of the union of all the probabilities passed as the input. \r\n\r\nIf I have less than 5 probabilities, then the switch statement applies the exact formula. Otherwise, the default case applies the Bonferroni approximation, (As I&#39;m modeling the chance of a signal to be received, if the estimation is less than the probability with the best antenna then I keep the best antenna).\r\n\r\nThank you for your help","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498907/avoid-multiple-loops-in-js-implementation-of-bonferroni-inequality","title":"Avoid multiple loops in JS implementation of Bonferroni inequality"},{"tags":["selenium","page-factory"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10874073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gzoz7C9wt_c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbjItl8z9DVmb6ah3KRX0ISnFwFxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"pavan kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10874073/pavan-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571743863,"post_id":58499052,"comment_id":103335005,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498904/selenium-how-to-use-different-locators-for-an-element-using-pom-pagefactory/58499052#comment103335005_58499052"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":140,"user_id":6523855,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e4fe1e37ed158ffffd921e177a785b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"john","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6523855/john"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571729040,"creation_date":1571729040,"answer_id":58499052,"question_id":58498904,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58499052","body_markdown":"Yes it is possible to implement PageFactory for different versions. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe usually have a build tag in the class  like build_tag = &quot;ver1&quot; or &quot;ver2&quot;, you can put your different locators under different UI Map and call according to the version tag.\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498904/selenium-how-to-use-different-locators-for-an-element-using-pom-pagefactory/58499052#58499052","title":"Selenium: How to use different locators for an element using POM/PageFactory"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":293,"user_id":7964299,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mmYcg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naveen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7964299/naveen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571733100,"creation_date":1571733100,"answer_id":58500099,"question_id":58498904,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58500099","body_markdown":"There is also an option to add multiple conditions on the same locator using OR AND conditions in XPATH. \r\n\r\nMore detailed at [W3][1] and [example][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10247978/xpath-with-multiple-conditions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498904/selenium-how-to-use-different-locators-for-an-element-using-pom-pagefactory/58500099#58500099","title":"Selenium: How to use different locators for an element using POM/PageFactory"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10874073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gzoz7C9wt_c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbjItl8z9DVmb6ah3KRX0ISnFwFxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"pavan kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10874073/pavan-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10874073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gzoz7C9wt_c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcbjItl8z9DVmb6ah3KRX0ISnFwFxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"pavan kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10874073/pavan-kumar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571740654,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571744182,"creation_date":1571728376,"last_edit_date":1571744182,"question_id":58498904,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498904","body_markdown":"Consider the locator for an Element changes for different versions of the product.

So far, the only examples I&#39;ve found are relevant to Spring Boot.\r\nFor example, Spring Boot applications are able to define properties to access a Keycloak server and specify realm and client:\r\n\r\n    keycloak.realm=spring-boot-quickstart\r\n    keycloak.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth\r\n    keycloak.ssl-required=external\r\n    keycloak.resource=app-authz-rest-employee\r\n    keycloak.bearer-only=true\r\n    keycloak.credentials.secret=secret\r\n    keycloak.securityConstraints[0].authRoles[0]=user\r\n    keycloak.securityConstraints[0].securityCollections[0].name=protected\r\n    keycloak.securityConstraints[0].securityCollections[0].patterns[0]=/*\r\n    keycloak.policy-enforcer-config.enforcement-mode=ENFORCING\r\n    keycloak.policy-enforcer-config.claimInformationPointConfig.claims[http.uri]={request.relativePath}\r\n\r\nIs there an equivalent configuration you can use for a Java Enterprise Application? Within the web.xml it seems you can only specify KEYCLOAK as auth-method:\r\n\r\n     &lt;auth-method&gt;KEYCLOAK&lt;/auth-method&gt;\r\n\r\nbut that simply redirects to keycloak login challenge. I&#39;d like rather to use Tokens. Maybe System Properties or other ways?\r\nThanks \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498853/oauth2-access-token-in-java-ee-applications","title":"OAuth2 Access Token in Java EE Applications"},{"tags":["python","mongodb","docker","dockerfile"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":337,"user_id":1270559,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7145e8c1efb11af65274e70f88745057?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"vanhonit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1270559/vanhonit"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571728367,"post_id":58498851,"comment_id":103326710,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498851/the-command-bin-sh-c-apt-get-update-returned-a-non-zero-code-100-in-docker#comment103326710_58498851"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11083321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yCOsyC4KzaI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANc/4iHKTPTYqmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Avinash Barde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11083321/avinash-barde"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571728466,"post_id":58498851,"comment_id":103326759,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498851/the-command-bin-sh-c-apt-get-update-returned-a-non-zero-code-100-in-docker#comment103326759_58498851"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11083321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yCOsyC4KzaI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANc/4iHKTPTYqmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Avinash Barde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11083321/avinash-barde"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571728507,"post_id":58498851,"comment_id":103326780,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498851/the-command-bin-sh-c-apt-get-update-returned-a-non-zero-code-100-in-docker#comment103326780_58498851"},{"owner":{"reputation":26349,"user_id":10008173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3ea5d6d5d63e054acb8cfa95a39240d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David Maze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10008173/david-maze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571735462,"post_id":58498851,"comment_id":103330411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498851/the-command-bin-sh-c-apt-get-update-returned-a-non-zero-code-100-in-docker#comment103330411_58498851"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11083321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yCOsyC4KzaI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANc/4iHKTPTYqmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Avinash Barde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11083321/avinash-barde"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":-1,"user_type":"moderator","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a007be5a61f6aa8f3e85ae2fc18dd66e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Community","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571749411,"creation_date":1571728175,"last_edit_date":1571749411,"question_id":58498851,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498851","body_markdown":"My DockerFile as follows:\r\n```\r\nFROM python:3.6\r\nRUN wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | apt-key add -\r\nRUN echo &quot;deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse&quot; | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list\r\nRUN apt-get update\r\nRUN apt-get install -y mongodb-org\r\nADD . /app\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\r\nRUN mongod --fork --config /etc/mongod.conf\r\nEXPOSE 9000\r\n```\r\nAt `apt-get update` getting an error :\r\n```\r\nReading package lists...\r\nE: Failed to fetch http://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/binary-amd64/by-hash/SHA256/6233101b7f58c6cf71fe1cd46b962cf358fc5626ed8cb94201f5e0e939e91d73  Connection failed [IP: 151.101.36.204 80]\r\nE: Some index files failed to download.

subclassed the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` so you&#39;ll also need to use that when verifying the token. Django makes that easy, the `PasswordResetConfirmView` has the `token_generator` as class attribute, so you only need to subclass it to override the token generator it&#39;s using:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CustomPasswordResetConfirmView(auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView):\r\n    token_generator = activation_token\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in your url patterns use this view for the `&#39;password-reset/confirm/&lt;uidb64&gt;/&lt;token&gt;/&#39;` path.\r\n\r\nAlso you need to make sure you encode the `uid` correctly. You can verify you did it correctly by checking in your django shell:\r\n```\r\nuid = force_text(urlsafe_base64_decode(uidb64))\r\nUser.objects.get(pk=uid)\r\n```\r\nwhich should return the user.\r\n\r\nNote that your `_make_hash_value` method is not secure: It&#39;s always going to generate the same hash during the one day that the timestamp remains valid. So it can be re-used multiple times even after the user changed the password and anyone with access to the email will be able to reset the password again. That&#39;s why the original `_make_hash_value` of Django&#39;s generator uses the password, so after it&#39;s changed, it cannot be used again.\r\n\r\nWorse, I can make the token for any of your users, and reset their password this way, because I don&#39;t need to know anything but their id, which is an integer, so I can just try until I hit an id that exists in your db.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58498838/passwordresetconfirmview-is-not-working-proeprly/58499731#58499731","title":"PasswordResetConfirmView is not working proeprly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":12063349,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JMPYML-jJBg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfS0I1pDzhTqgSC2Ct4NaqYwhQEew/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Hello World","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063349/hello-world"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46,"user_id":12063349,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JMPYML-jJBg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfS0I1pDzhTqgSC2Ct4NaqYwhQEew/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Hello World","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063349/hello-world"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58499731,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571735848,"creation_date":1571728150,"last_edit_date":1571731098,"question_id":58498838,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58498838","body_markdown":"Here I am not using  `PasswordResetView` because i am sending email through my dynamic email configuration so for this I made my own view which generates the token using `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` and it also sends the email to the user. the password reset link in my email looks like this `http://127.0.0.1:8000/password-reset/confirm/NQ/5as-b3502199950ff028a6ef/` \r\n\r\nBut after click in that link it redirect to the `password_reset_confirm` which is good but in this view the `{{form.as_p}}` is not working.It is only displaying the button but before using `auth-views.PasswordresetView` the form was working but now the form is not being passed in the template.\r\n\r\nHow can i solve this?\r\n\r\nurls.py\r\n\r\n     path(&#39;password-reset/&#39;,views.send_password_reset_email,name=&#39;password_reset&#39;),\r\n        path(&#39;password-reset/done/&#39;,auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(template_name=&#39;password_reset_done.html&#39;),name=&#39;password_reset_done&#39;),\r\n        path(&#39;password-reset/confirm/&lt;uidb64&gt;/&lt;token&gt;/&#39;,\r\n             auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(template_name=&#39;password_reset_confirm.html&#39;,                                                 success_url=reverse_lazy(&#39;password_reset_complete&#39;),),name=&#39;password_reset_confirm&#39;),\r\n\r\nviews.py\r\n\r\n    def send_password_reset_email(request):\r\n        form = CustomPasswordResetForm()\r\n        if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;:\r\n            form = CustomPasswordResetForm(request.POST)\r\n            if form.is_valid():\r\n                email = form.cleaned_data[&#39;email&#39;]\r\n                user = get_user_model().objects.get(email__iexact=email)   \r\n                site = get_current_site(request)\r\n                mail_subject = &quot;Password Reset on {} &quot;.format(site.domain)\r\n                message = render_to_string(&#39;password_reset_email.html&#39;, {\r\n                    &quot;user&quot;: user,\r\n                    &#39;domain&#39;: site.domain,\r\n                    &#39;uid&#39;: urlsafe_base64_encode(force_bytes(user.pk)).decode(),\r\n                    &#39;token&#39;: activation_token.make_token(user)\r\n                })\r\n                config = EmailConfiguration.objects.order_by(&#39;-date&#39;).first()\r\n                backend = EmailBackend(host=config.email_host, port=config.email_port, username=config.email_host_user,\r\n                                       password=config.email_host_password, use_tls=config.email_use_tls)\r\n                email = EmailMessage(subject=mail_subject, body=message, from_email=config.email_host_user, to=[user.email],\r\n                                     connection=backend)\r\n                email.send()\r\n                return redirect(&#39;password_reset_done&#39;)\r\n    \r\n        return render(request, &#39;password_reset.html&#39;,{&#39;form&#39;:form})\r\n\r\npassword_reset_email.html\r\n\r\n    {% block reset_link %}\r\n    http://{{domain}}{% url &#39;password_reset_confirm&#39;
