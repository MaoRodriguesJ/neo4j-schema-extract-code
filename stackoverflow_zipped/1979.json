It&#39;s designed to cover scenarios where you want to run GPU intensive tasks, both Graphical and otherwise, in the cloud and view the results locally.  Specifically from the introduction page:\r\n\r\n&gt; **3D Graphics Visualization**\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; HPC workloads across industry verticals such as Oil &amp; Gas, Life Sciences, and Design &amp; Engineering are getting increasingly complex and consume massive amounts of data. NICE DCV&#39;s streaming protocol eliminates the need to ship output files to client devices and provides a smooth and bandwidth-efficient experience to stream HPC 3D graphics remotely.\r\n\r\nBe aware, it&#39;s not completely free software:\r\n\r\n&gt; **Amazon EC2:**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; There is no additional cost for using NICE DCV on AWS. Customers pay only for the EC2 resources that they use.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **Third Party Cloud and On-Premises:**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; For more details on NICE DCV licensing, resellers, and pricing, please contact  nice-sales@amazon.com\r\n\r\nMost people will use it in one of the AWS supported regions, so there is no cost beyond the costs with running the EC2 instance itself.  It just needs to be able to talk to some components in AWS to verify it&#39;s properly licensed.  If you&#39;re running it somewhere else, like on-premises, or in the GovCloud regions, you&#39;ll need to work with NICE and/or AWS directly to procure a license.\r\n\r\nIf you consider going that route, I&#39;d highly recommend testing it out either in a region where it is supported, or use the 15 day free trial to verify it&#39;ll work for your scenarios.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071047/rdp-into-ec2-not-able-to-use-gpu/58083514#58083514","title":"RDP into EC2 not able to use GPU"}],"owner":{"reputation":1520,"user_id":1207596,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3803563560305dee9de7ccaf6d2e38d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"A L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1207596/a-l"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58083514,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569338388,"creation_date":1569278781,"question_id":58071047,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58071047","body_markdown":"My teammate is running into an issue where 3D rendering is extremely slow.

method that cannot be awaited (this will potentially turn into a debugging nightmare as any exceptions will be lost to the void, etc.) -- so let&#39;s have the Register method return a `Task` instead:  \r\n```csharp\r\nasync public Task Register(PessoaViewModel pessoaViewModel)\r\n{\r\n    var registerCommand = _mapper.Map&lt;RegisterNewPessoaCommand&gt;(pessoaViewModel);\r\n    var pessoaId = await Bus.SendCommand(registerCommand);\r\n\r\n    // use `pessoaId` as needed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf for some reason `async`/`await` is unavailable, the following option is also possible (though, note that this option is synchronous and will block current thread execution, etc.):  \r\n```csharp\r\npublic void Register(PessoaViewModel pessoaViewModel)\r\n{\r\n    var registerCommand = _mapper.Map&lt;RegisterNewPessoaCommand&gt;(pessoaViewModel);\r\n    var pessoaId = Bus.SendCommand(registerCommand).GetAwaiter().GetResult();\r\n\r\n    // use `pessoaId` as needed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFor completeness, I&#39;ll add that it would also be possible to use `Bus.SendCommand(registerCommand).Result;` but this is generally considered bad practice as it will obfuscate any exceptions inside of an aggregate exception, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, [here&#39;s](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13159176/12093051) a solid answer to a similar question about how the unwrapping occurs.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071013/how-to-get-the-integer-value-returned-in-task-int-format-asp-net-core-mvc/58071489#58071489","title":"How to get the integer value returned in Task &lt;int&gt;

I&#39;ve looked into it, theres a similar question on [here][1] that says the issue has to do with a dependency that my project does not have.  So I think it has to do with the material-ui component using `useEffectLayout` and the testing env doesnt like that for some reason.  Im running my test with yarn and jest `yarn test` to run the test suite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

across several posts and articles that compare dates, but what I haven&#39;t found is comparing dates where either the first date or second date might not be a workday.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to create a loop that incremented on the `SHIFT_BEGIN_DATE` after the `DATE_RECEIVED` until `WORK_DAY_INDICATOR = &#39;Y&#39;`, but a colleague suggested that I use `MAX()` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first attempt:\r\n\r\n    (SELECT \r\n      MAX(FACILITY_CALENDAR.SHIFT_BEGIN_DATE) AS MAXDATE,\r\n      PRICE_QUOTE.DATE_RECEIVED,\r\n      PRICE_QUOTE.DATE_COMPLETED,\r\n      PRICE_QUOTE.QUOTE_ID\r\n    FROM FACILITY_CALENDAR AS FC\r\n    LEFT JOIN PRICE_QUOTE AS PQ ON (PQ.DATE_RECEIVED + 1 day) = FC.SHIFT_BEGIN_DATE\r\n    WHERE FC.WORK_DAY_INDICATOR = &#39;Y&#39;\r\n    GROUP BY\r\n      PRICE_QUOTE.DATE_RECEIVED,\r\n      PRICE_QUOTE.DATE_COMPLETED,\r\n      PRICE_QUOTE.QUOTE_ID)\r\n\r\nThis code is giving dates where the `WORK_DAY_INDICATOR = &#39;N&#39;`.\r\n\r\nThen I tried using this article&#39;s example below, but I need to create a join between the `PRICE_QUOTE` table and the `FACILITY_CALENDAR`, which goes wrong whether I join on `DATE_RECEIVED` or `DATE_COMPLETED`.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3resource.com/sql/aggregate-functions/max-date.php\r\n\r\n    SELECT ord_num, ord_amount, ord_date, agent_code\r\n    FROM orders\r\n    WHERE ord_date=(\r\n    SELECT MAX(ord_date) FROM orders WHERE agent_code=&#39;A002&#39;);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect that when a `DATE_RECEIVED` is a Friday and the facility&#39;s next workday is Monday, then the `MAXDATE` should be Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddendum: Not all weekdays are work days; some are holidays, so it doesn&#39;t work to use days of the week or number of days in a weekend to separate the work days from non-work-days.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070991/select-first-workday-after-date","title":"Select first workday AFTER

technologies that execute parameterized SQL statements allow parameters at some specific points in the SQL statement **ONLY**.\r\n\r\nFor example, DB2 does not allow parameters to limit the returned rows: while this parameterized JDBC statement is valid:\r\n\r\n    select * from t where status = ? order by amount fetch first 10 rows only\r\n\r\n...this one is not:\r\n\r\n    select * from t where status = ? order by amount fetch first ? rows only\r\n\r\nMy guess is you are facing a similar limitation of the engine, or the driver.\r\n\r\nThe best workaround I&#39;ve found so far is to *inject* the problematic parameters as a string, concatenating it to the SQL statement. For example, in Java you could do:\r\n\r\n    // parameters\r\n\r\n    int status = 3;\r\n    int maxRows = 10;\r\n\r\n    // execution\r\n\r\n    PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(\r\n      &quot;select * from t where status = ? order by amount fetch first &quot; \r\n      + maxRows\r\n      + &quot; rows only&quot;\r\n    );\r\n    ps.setInt(1, status);\r\n    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();\r\n\r\nBoth parameters are used, but in different ways:\r\n\r\n1. `status` is included as a traditional JDBC parameter.\r\n2. `maxRows` is injected as a plain String (SQL Injection).\r\n\r\nIn your case, you can use the second strategy for the parameter `continuousexcessivehours`. \r\n\r\nMany ORMs offer solutions to accomplish this. For example MyBatis offers `#{status}` for the first case, and `${maxRows}` for the second one. Did you spot the difference?\r\n\r\nFinally, a last word of advice: be careful with SQL injection. Only perform string injection for a parameter if you are sure your know the origin of its value, and it&#39;s not coming from an unknown source.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070990/how-to-pass-in-variable-in-over-clause/58071442#58071442","title":"How to pass in variable in over clause"}],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":10255244,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81088feabb11cd74d7696927be9274aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sql-noob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10255244/sql-noob"},"last_editor":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58071442,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569332171,"creation_date":1569278349,"last_edit_date":1569302354,"question_id":58070990,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070990","body_markdown":"I am trying to pass in a variable into an over clause. \r\n\r\nInitially I had it hard coded to something like ``` over (partition by deviceid order by readdate rows between current row and 2 following) ```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do something like \r\n``` over (partition by deviceid order by readdate rows between current row and continuousexcessivehours following) ```\r\n\r\nor something like \r\n``` over (partition by deviceid order by readdate rows between current row and ISNULL(continuousexcessivehours, 2) following) ```\r\n\r\n\r\nError I get:  Error: [Amazon](500310) Invalid operation: syntax error at or near &quot;continuousexcessivehours&quot;

Client uploads file to API\r\n2. API uploads file to S3\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n1. Client requests pre-signed URL from API\r\n2. API generates and responds with URL\r\n3. Client uploads to S3\r\n\r\nThe one thing I am struggling with is limiting what files can be uploaded. We want to allow for uploading images and videos, but not potentially dangerous files like executables. I&#39;ve been trying to utilize the Bucket Policy to enforce  a `$Content-Type` of `video/mp4`, but I am still able to upload images. Here is how I am generating the URL (PHP in this case, mostly taken from the [S3 docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/s3-presigned-post.html)):\r\n\r\n    $formInputs = [&#39;acl&#39; =&gt; &#39;public-read&#39;, &#39;key&#39; =&gt; &#39;test1.mp4&#39;, &#39;Content-Type&#39; =&gt; &#39;video/mp4&#39;];\r\n    $options = [\r\n        [&#39;acl&#39; =&gt; &#39;public-read&#39;],\r\n        [&#39;bucket&#39; =&gt; $bucket],\r\n        [&#39;key&#39; =&gt; &#39;test1.mp4&#39;],\r\n        [&#39;eq&#39;, &#39;$Content-Type&#39;, &#39;video/mp4&#39;]\r\n    ];\r\n    $expires = &#39;+2 hours&#39;;\r\n    $postObject = new \\Aws\\S3\\PostObjectV4(\r\n        $client,\r\n        $bucket,\r\n        $formInputs,\r\n        $options,\r\n        $expires\r\n    );\r\n\r\nAfter plugging the `$postObject-&gt;getFormInputs()` into Postman and POSTing an image as the file, it accepts the upload. If I request the file from S3, I am able to access it however it is returned with `Content-Type: video/mp4` and doesn&#39;t play in a browser; but I am still able to upload the file which doesn&#39;t seem to make sense.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this option only mandates that the field be included in the form inputs (if I remove the `Content-Type` field from the inputs, it fails). The `Content-Type` header seems to be completely irrelevant, as does the actual mime-type of the file. If that is the case, this rule seems incredibly useless for POST/PUT (maybe less so for GET).\r\n\r\nIs it possible to restrict the file type that is allowed to be uploaded without relying on the data that is sent in the form inputs? Or do I need to check the file after upload either in my application or in Lambda and verify that it is correct?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070977/how-do-you-enforce-content-type-in-s3-pre-signed-posts","title":"How do you enforce Content-Type in S3 pre-signed POSTs?"},{"tags":["css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":7725169,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvNsv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Weeks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7725169/matthew-weeks"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569278628,"post_id":58070976,"comment_id":102537521,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070976/overriding-values-with-css-specifity-or-always-being-specific-best-practice#comment102537521_58070976"},{"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":5083416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19cbde5d9991e7592fa5aeafcf1c3055?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stray","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5083416/stray"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":142,"user_id":7725169,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvNsv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Weeks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7725169/matthew-weeks"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569297241,"post_id":58070976,"comment_id":102540867,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070976/overriding-values-with-css-specifity-or-always-being-specific-best-practice#comment102540867_58070976"},{"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":7725169,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvNsv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Weeks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7725169/matthew-weeks"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569334123,"post_id":58070976,"comment_id":102558614,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070976/overriding-values-with-css-specifity-or-always-being-specific-best-practice#comment102558614_58070976"}],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":5083416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19cbde5d9991e7592fa5aeafcf1c3055?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stray","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5083416/stray"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569278270,"creation_date":1569278270,"question_id":58070976,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070976","body_markdown":"This is simply a question of whether it is better practice to have a default value for a base class, which is overwritten with css specificity rules, or whether it&#39;s better to not ever apply the original css in cases where it is not wanted.\r\n\r\nWhat is best practice?

Primitive types from `byte` through `long` will be widened to `long`, and `float` to `double`.  `BigInteger`s can be converted to `BigDecimal`s, and `BigDecimal` references will be copied.\r\n\r\n    public static class Builder {\r\n    \tBigDecimal first;\r\n    \tBigDecimal second;\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic void setFirst(long value) { first = new BigDecimal(value); }\r\n    \tpublic void setFirst(double value) { first = new BigDecimal(value); }\r\n    \tpublic void setFirst(BigInteger value) { first = new BigDecimal(value); }\r\n    \tpublic void setFirst(BigDecimal value) { first = value; }\r\n    \tpublic void setSecond(long value) { second = new BigDecimal(value); }\r\n    \tpublic void setSecond(double value) { second = new BigDecimal(value); }\r\n    \tpublic void setSecond(BigInteger value) { second = new BigDecimal(value); }\r\n    \tpublic void setSecond(BigDecimal value) { second = value; }\r\n    \tpublic Range build() {\r\n    \t\tif (first == null || second == null) {\r\n    \t\t\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Must supply both values.&quot;);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\treturn new Range(first, second);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe Builder pattern allows validation before building the desired object, and it bypasses the &quot;constructor explosion&quot; that would occur attempting to cover every possible combination.  With _n_ possible types, you have 2 * _n_ builder setter methods instead of _n_&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; constructors.\r\n\r\nI included `long`, even though it can be widened to `double` legally, for precision reasons, because there are [very high values of type `long` that can&#39;t be precisely represented as `double`s][2].\r\n\r\nThen, your constructor becomes:\r\n\r\n    public Range(BigDecimal first, BigDecimal second) {\r\n        if (first.compareTo(second) &lt; 0) {\r\n            this.inferior = first;\r\n            this.superior = second;\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n        \tthis.inferior = second;\r\n        \tthis.superior = first;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI changed the `== -1` to `&lt; 0` to match the `compareTo` contract, and added the `else` case that switches them if needed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\r\n[2]:

Thanks so much for any help you can provide!\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070964/inserting-data-from-pandas-data-frame-to-sqlite-using-sqlite-query","title":"Inserting data from pandas data frame to Sqlite using Sqlite query"},{"tags":["sockets","networking"],"owner":{"reputation":140,"user_id":8245814,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e309445f00c4fd192d11fbc98e05af95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pinteco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8245814/pinteco"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569278166,"creation_date":1569278166,"question_id":58070962,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070962","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve a homework that should be deliverd in a month.

The provided value would need to be a compile-time constant, such as the literal string `&quot;additional policy&quot;` on the previous line.\r\n\r\nThe *conceptual* problem however is that the default value isn&#39;t even really needed here and is making for some duplicated logic.  The class has only one constructor, and that constructor has a `String` parameter.  So any time an instance of the class is created, a `String` is required.\r\n\r\nThus you can solve both the conceptual and the technical problem at once.  The conceptual problem is solved in that you can always rely on the provided value and don&#39;t need a default value.  And the technical problem is solved in that you can initialize your class member in the constructor instead of at the class level.  For example:\r\n\r\n    String s1;\r\n    InsurancePolicy j;\r\n    \r\n    public InsurancePolicy(String s1){\r\n        this.s1 = s1;\r\n        this.j = new InsurancePolicy(s1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nA couple things to note in this case as well:\r\n\r\n - Class members like this should probably be explicitly `private` as well.  If external access to these members is needed, create getter/setter methods.  Your class appears to have such methods for `j` already, which is a good start.\r\n - Consider adding logic to the constructor to validate the provided `String` value if necessary.  That is, to protect against `null` or empty string or anything else that may otherwise break the logic downstream.\r\n - If the `String` value used to initialize `InsurancePolicy` can also be derived from an `InsurancePolicy` object (and I see no reason why it shouldn&#39;t) then you are duplicating your data here.  The class member `s1` is *most likely* not needed at all and should be removed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070958/how-to-declare-a-string-in-a-parameter-object-and-then-return-the-string-in-a-ge/58081259#58081259","title":"how to declare a string in a parameter object and then return the string in a get method?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11938843,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9aa841ece819b76efd0a1a20957bf9f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11938843","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938843/user11938843"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11938843,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9aa841ece819b76efd0a1a20957bf9f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11938843","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938843/user11938843"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569331170,"creation_date":1569278090,"last_edit_date":1569280431,"question_id":58070958,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070958","body_markdown":"I need a void setSupplementalInsurance(InsurancePolicy policy) method to sets a supplemental insurance policy for the policy. and a InsurancePolicy getSupplementalInsurance(): returns the supplemental insurance policy for the policy, if one exists.

After using the `Variant` form to add all the parts in various quantities to the variant, I&#39;d like to show all of the parts with quantities on the `variants#show` page.\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant code from my models:\r\n\r\n    class Variant &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n      has_many :parts_list_items, dependent: :destroy\r\n      has_many :parts, through: :parts_list_items, dependent: :nullify\r\n    \r\n      accepts_nested_attributes_for :parts\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    class PartsListItem &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n      belongs_to :variant\r\n      belongs_to :part\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    class Part &lt; ApplicationRecord\r\n      has_many :parts_list_items, dependent: :destroy\r\n      has_many :variants, through: :parts_list_items, dependent: :nullify\r\n    end\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd my VariantsController:\r\n\r\n    class VariantsController &lt; ApplicationController\r\n      def update\r\n        respond_to do |format|\r\n           if @variant.update(variant_params)\r\n             format.html { redirect_to @variant, notice: &#39;Variant was successfully updated.&#39; }\r\n           else\r\n             format.html { render :edit }\r\n           end\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    \r\n      private\r\n      def variant_params\r\n        params.require(:variant).permit(:account_id, :product_id, :sku,\r\n                                        :choice_ids =&gt; [], :part_ids =&gt; [])\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd my form (views/variants/_edit_form.html.erb):\r\n\r\n    &lt;%= simple_form_for @variant do |f| %&gt;\r\n      &lt;%= f.simple_fields_for :parts_list_items do |item| %&gt;\r\n        &lt;%= item.input_field :quantity %&gt;\r\n        &lt;%= item.association :parts %&gt;\r\n      &lt;% end %&gt;\r\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this works just fine:\r\n\r\n    &lt;%= simple_form_for @variant do |f| %&gt;\r\n      &lt;%= f.association :parts, as: :check_boxes %&gt;\r\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\r\n\r\nSo, it works to associate parts directly to the variant through the `PartsListItem` join model. The trouble begins when I start trying to add the quantity for each associated part.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong with this nested form? Is there a problem with my controllers or associations?\r\n\r\nDo I need to create an additional model called `PartsList` that `has_many :parts_list_items` with additional associations? That seems like an extra step and that there should be a way to put the `:quantity` on the `PartsListItem` model.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I would like to have my X-Axis ```&lt;VictoryAxis&gt;``` run parallel to a negative y value instead of along 0 on the Y-Axis. The issue I&#39;m running into is that the vertical Grid lines are center aligning on 0 still but extending down below my X-Axis when I want them to start at my axis. Is there a trick to do this? Can&#39;t find anything in docs.\r\n\r\nHere is a code sample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div &gt;\r\n      &lt;VictoryChart\r\n        width={800} height={300}\r\n        theme={VictoryTheme.material}\r\n      &gt;\r\n        &lt;VictoryAxis\r\n          axisComponent={&lt;LineSegment type={&quot;axis&quot;} /&gt;}\r\n          dependentAxis={true} //this means it is y axis?\r\n          standalone={false}\r\n          key=&quot;Y access&quot;\r\n          style={{\r\n            tickLabels: { fontSize: 10, padding: 5 }\r\n          }}\r\n          domain={[-50, 50]}\r\n        /&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;VictoryAxis name=&quot;X access&quot;\r\n          standalone={false}\r\n          axisValue={-50} // NEED this axis to draw at bottom of Y axis\r\n          domain={[1994, 2019]}\r\n        /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/VictoryChart&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is like so:\r\n[Link to image of result](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj_uXHFXJCwolINDsY9tJfeRG9KP4Q)\r\n\r\nIf I add manual offsets to the ```LineSegment``` via the ```gridComponent``` property like below it works but this seems hacky and I have to figure out the height and width of my canvas to get it to work. Seems like I&#39;m missing something:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// adjusted VictoryAxis:\r\n &lt;VictoryAxis name=&quot;X access&quot;\r\n          standalone={false}\r\n          axisValue={-50} // NEED this axis to draw at bottom of Y axis\r\n          domain={[1994, 2019]}\r\n          gridComponent={&lt;LineSegment y1={50} y2={250}/&gt;} // do something here with LineSegment primitive properties to get it to start at proper y val...\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Link to image of result](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj_uXHFXJCwolINE0WS1hukduVgnrw)\r\n\r\nHoping VictoryChart veterans can point me in right

In your dataset the time listed is corresponding with the end of the previous bar. To accommodate instances where a bar passes over midnight, it may be easier for the time to correspond with the start of the bar. In the code below I&#39;ve modified your original dataset to use this approach. The first time in the list will be the first time listed on the x-axis of the plot.\r\n\r\n    times = [dt.time(0,30,0),\r\n             dt.time(6,0,0),\r\n             dt.time(7,0,0),\r\n             dt.time(9,10,0),\r\n             dt.time(15,30,0),\r\n             dt.time(18,0,0),\r\n             dt.time(19,0,0)]\r\n    \r\nRather than plotting the `dt.time()` on the x-axis, it could be easier to plot the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day. Below we use a list comprehension to convert the `times` into the number of seconds elapsed.\r\n\r\n    seconds = [(x.hour * 3600 + x.minute * 60 + x.second)\r\n               for x in times]\r\n\r\nNote: I removed the `NaN` at the beginning of `values` and added a fictional `5.5` to the end so that the example of a bar going from 19:00 to 0:30 could be shown.\r\n    \r\n    # manually add the y-axis values\r\n    values = [13.5,\r\n              25.5,\r\n              50.5,\r\n              55.5,\r\n              20.5,\r\n              38.5,\r\n              5.5]\r\n    \r\nNow we create two lists that will be used to specify where on the x-axis the ticks should be placed, and what label to assign to each of those ticks. If the number of seconds elapsed is divisible by 1800 (30 minutes), that number will be used as one of the ticks. `start_time` will be the number of seconds elapsed for the first item in `times`. This is where the x-axis will begin. \r\n\r\n    start_time = (times[0].hour * 3600 + times[0].minute * 60 + times[0].second)\r\n    xticks = [x + start_time for x in range(60 * 60 * 24) if x % 1800 == 0]\r\n\r\nIn order to display the time rather than the number of seconds elapsed, we must use `dt.timedelta()` to convert the integer to a `dt.time`. If the `start_time` is a value greater than `0`, then there will be `xticks` with values of at least `86400`. We must subtract `86400` from these values to prevent the `xticklabels` from appearing as `one day, 0:30`.\r\n\r\n    def label_format(seconds):\r\n        if seconds &gt;= 86400:\r\n            seconds -= 86400\r\n            \r\n        return str(dt.timedelta(seconds=seconds))\r\n    \r\n    xticklabels = [label_format(x) for x in xticks]\r\n    \r\nNow we can create the plot. Since we&#39;re creating a histogram style chart with unequal bar widths, we need a way to specify the bar width. `bar_traits()` can be used to determine the starting point and width of the bar based on the starting point of the x-axis and the starting point of the next bar.\r\n\r\n    def bar_traits(ix, second, seconds, start_time):\r\n        if ix &lt;

my_lambda(33));\r\n\r\n[Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=c3d8c94fcc774518cc78734cebf17985) \r\n\r\nThe principle here remains the same, the only real difference is that the lambda is now on the heap.\r\n\r\nStoring them in a `Vec` then becomes relatively straightforward, as by now we&#39;ve proven that they&#39;re &quot;normal&quot; types. Nothing prevents you from creating a vector of closures, but you will need to box them (`Vec` requires each element to be `Sized`, and there is no way to target two different closures by signature) and they will need to have the same signature:\r\n\r\n    let my_vector: Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn Fn(u16) -&gt; u16&gt;&gt; = vec![\r\n        Box::new(|i| i + 1),\r\n        Box::new(|i| i - 1),\r\n    ];\r\n    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, my_vector[0](33))\r\n\r\nIf they have disparate signatures, you will need to write your own structure to contain them and bucket them by signature, and it is not a simple task.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe benchmark case:\r\n\r\n- C++:\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;functional&gt;\r\n    int main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n      std::vector&lt;std::function&lt;int(int)&gt;&gt; funcs;\r\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++) {\r\n        funcs.push_back([&amp;] (int n) { return n + 1; });\r\n        int result = funcs[i](33);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Rust:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    fn main() {\r\n       let mut lambdas:Vec&lt;Box&lt;Fn(u32) -&gt; u32&gt;&gt; = vec![];\r\n       for i in 0..10000000 {\r\n         lambdas.push(Box::new(|i| i+1));\r\n         lambdas[i](3);\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\nCompilation options:\r\n\r\n- G++: `-O3 --std=c++0x`\r\n- Cargo: `--release`\r\n\r\nThe results:\r\n\r\n- C++ peak heap size:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ```none\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n      n        time(i)         total(B)   useful-heap(B) extra-heap(B)    stacks(B)\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     68    383,911,899      268,512,208      268,508,160         4,048            0\r\n     69    555,878,425      805,387,160      805,379,072         8,088            0\r\n     70    765,593,697      805,387,160      805,379,072         8,088            0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Rust peak heap size:\r\n\r\n    ```none\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n      n        time(i)         total(B)   useful-heap(B) extra-heap(B)    stacks(B)\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     46    210,486,321      268,440,920      268,436,765         4,155            0\r\n     47    210,486,371      268,440,976      268,436,805         4,171            0\r\n     48    210,486,496      268,441,064      268,436,885         4,179            0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThe conclusions:\r\n\r\n- C++ `std::function` wrappers are heap-allocated.

have a little doubt about a loop that I am doing, because it is returning empty values.\r\n\r\nFirst, I am receiving my items like this:\r\n\r\n    $items = Session::get(&#39;items&#39;);\r\n    $deco = json_decode($items, true);\r\n\r\nIf I return `$deco` I get this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n     &quot;items&quot;:[\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;id&quot;:1,\r\n            &quot;inventoryID&quot;:1,\r\n            &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Product 1&quot;,\r\n            &quot;quantity&quot;:1,\r\n            &quot;unit_price&quot;:20,\r\n            &quot;image&quot;:&quot;img.png&quot;\r\n          },\r\n\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;id&quot;:2,\r\n            &quot;inventoryID&quot;:1,\r\n            &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Product2&quot;,\r\n            &quot;quantity&quot;:1,\r\n            &quot;unit_price&quot;:25,\r\n            &quot;image&quot;:&quot;img.png&quot;\r\n           }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, in the loop (which I use to change the values of some keys for the integration of paypal) I have this:\r\n\r\n    $results = [];\r\n        foreach($deco[&#39;items&#39;] as $element) {\r\n\r\n            $name=$element[&#39;title&#39;];\r\n            $quantity=$element[&#39;quantity&#39;];\r\n            $sku= $element[&#39;id&#39;];\r\n            $price=$element[&#39;unit_price&#39;];\r\n    \r\n           \r\n            $item = new Item();\r\n            $item -&gt; setName($name)\r\n            -&gt;setCurrency(&#39;USD&#39;)\r\n            -&gt;setQuantity($quantity)\r\n            -&gt;setSku($sku) \r\n            -&gt;setPrice($price);\r\n    \r\n            $results[]=$item;\r\n        }  \r\n\r\nIf I return `return $item`(outside the loop) I get (as expected) only one value, and not all of the collection:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Product2&quot;,\r\n    &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;USD&quot;,\r\n    &quot;quantity&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;sku&quot;: 2,\r\n    &quot;price&quot;: &quot;25&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut if I return `return $results` the var that I need, it gives me this (it does the {} of the items as I need, but returns empty):\r\n\r\n    [\r\n    {},\r\n    {}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n**Thw whole code looks like:**\r\n\r\n    public function test(){\r\n        $items = Session::get(&#39;items&#39;);\r\n        $deco = json_decode($items, true);\r\n        $results = [];\r\n        foreach($deco[&#39;items&#39;] as $element) {\r\n\r\n            $name=$element[&#39;title&#39;];\r\n            $quantity=$element[&#39;quantity&#39;];\r\n            $sku= $element[&#39;id&#39;];\r\n            $price=$element[&#39;unit_price&#39;];\r\n    \r\n           \r\n            $item = new Item();\r\n            $item -&gt; setName($name)\r\n            -&gt;setCurrency(&#39;USD&#39;)\r\n            -&gt;setQuantity($quantity)\r\n

The other point, which is more stylistic, is that you don&#39;t strictly need to include all the `else` statements. In particular, you can just include the `for(j in...)` statement directly under the `if(class...==&quot;numeric&quot;)` clause, without `else next`, because `else next` just forces it to not run the rest if `class!=&quot;numeric&quot;`, but you&#39;ve already specified that `class` is `&quot;numeric&quot;`, so you don&#39;t need to specify that again.

If a column contains an integer or character, the loop should skip it and continue onto the next column.

Those values need to remain as they are. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this script is to use it on future data sets with the same structure and while I am open to suggestions with packages, I would like to use loops if possible.

not using the async generator correctly, but before we get to that, let&#39;s clean up the implementation slightly:\r\n\r\n    async function* paginated_generator(source, opts = {}) {\r\n        let buffer = await source(opts)\r\n\r\n        while (true) {\r\n            yield * buffer.items\r\n\r\n            if (!buffer.paging.next) return\r\n\r\n            buffer = await source({ ...opts, next: buffer.paging.next })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen you call an async generator function, it returns an async generator object, which implements both the async iterator and async iterable protocols.\r\n\r\nThere are a few differences between the syntax and protocols of asynchronous and synchronous counterparts for generator functions and iteration protocols:\r\n\r\n* The `next()` method of the [async iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of#Iterating_over_async_generators) returns `Promise&lt;{ value: T, done: boolean }&gt;` while the [iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol) just returns `{ value: T, done: boolean }`.\r\n* Async iterables use the [`Symbol.asyncIterator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator) method instead of the [`Symbol.iterator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator) method.\r\n* Async iterables can be consumed with [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) instead of [`for...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how your usage (probably) should look, based on the context you&#39;ve provided:\r\n\r\n    const Notification = require(&#39;./Notification&#39;)\r\n\r\n    async* notifications_paginated (opts = {}) {\r\n        const instance = this || opts.instance\r\n        const gen = paginated_data(`${instance.api}/news/my`, {\r\n            limit: opts.limit || instance.paginated_size,\r\n            key: &#39;news&#39;,\r\n            prev: opts.prev,\r\n            next: opts.next,\r\n            headers: instance.headers\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        for await (const item of gen) {\r\n            yield new Notification(item)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can then consume your `notifications_paginated()` as an async iterable or async iterator of `Notification` objects.\r\n\r\nIf you were to attempt to buffer all the items in `notifications_paginated()` before returning, then your API might as well not use pagination at all since buffering the items defeats the purpose of paginating in the first place.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070847/javascript-async-generators-changing-type-of-yielded-value/58070999#58070999","title":"Javascript async generators changing type of yielded

In principle, they might return even combinations of values from multiple tables, multiple rows, or no rows at all even. What would you want DELETE to do then?\r\n\r\nSo, for DELETE, you need to specify which rows in the *table* you&#39;re operating on are deleted. You can do it with a simple WHERE clause, or with a USING clause.\r\n\r\nIf you want CTEs with DELETE, the closest would be to use USING, put a subquery there, and join its result with the table. In many cases that&#39;s a very useful approach, but it is causing a join, which has a performance impact. Example:\r\n\r\n    delete from CALL_CENTER t\r\n    using (\r\n      select cc_call_center_sk from CALL_CENTER\r\n      where 1=1 AND t.CC_REC_START_DATE &gt; &#39;2000-01-01&#39;\r\n    ) AS sub\r\n    where sub.cc_call_center_sk = t.cc_call_center_sk.\r\n\r\nBut again, for your query it doesn&#39;t make much sense, and what @cddt wrote is probably your best bet.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070845/is-there-an-alternative-to-query-with-delete-snowflake-sql-statement-with-cte/58131800#58131800","title":"is there an alternative to query with DELETE snowflake SQL statement with CTE?"}],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":6840374,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98d45e05a26796c1d8f47109b735c693?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Erick Salas-Chaverri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6840374/erick-salas-chaverri"},"last_editor":{"reputation":27,"user_id":6840374,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98d45e05a26796c1d8f47109b735c693?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Erick Salas-Chaverri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6840374/erick-salas-chaverri"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569576914,"creation_date":1569277200,"last_edit_date":1569282520,"question_id":58070845,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070845","body_markdown":"On snowflake, is there an alternative to query with DELETE SQL statement with CTE? seems it is not possible.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nwith t as (\r\nselect *  from &quot;SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA&quot;.&quot;TPCDS_SF100TCL&quot;.&quot;CALL_CENTER&quot;\r\n), p as (select t.CC_REC_END_DATE, t.CC_CALL_CENTER_ID , t.CC_REC_START_DATE from t where 1=1 AND t.CC_REC_START_DATE &gt; &#39;2000-01-01&#39;)\r\n\r\ndelete from p\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example: if we use a select, we got some results.\r\n[![CTE with simple SQL select][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nbut if I use a delete.
