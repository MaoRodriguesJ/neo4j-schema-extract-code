You should replace sha256 here with a Key Derivation Function (KDF) such as PBKDF2 or scrypt. Then it would be fine. A properly tuned KDF can get the hashing rate down to dozens a second or fewer, even on good hardware (there are various competing factors here because the attacker doesn&#39;t have the same language and hardware restrictions you likely do, but even in the worst cases this value can be kept very low in cryptographic terms).\r\n\r\nBut even if you used sha256 here, it would be dramatically stronger than an unsalted hash. It makes every hash different. This means that if multiple people have the same password (very common), then breaking one doesn&#39;t break all users having the same password. This protects against rainbow tables, and particularly protects people who have very common passwords (password, dragon, mustang, etc.)\r\n\r\nBut it also protects against other password-collision attacks. For example, say I want to know Alice&#39;s password, and I can see it has the same hash as Bob. I now know that tricking either of them into revealing their password through some means will reveal both of their passwords.\r\n\r\n&gt;Doesn&#39;t that make it trivial for attackers to just recompute sha256(raw_password+salt) for all rows if the entire users table is compromised?\r\n\r\nThis is thinking about the problem backwards. If the attacker knew `raw_password`, then yes, this would be trivial. But that&#39;s exactly the thing the attacker does not know (and if they did, they wouldn&#39;t need to do any hashing). So the attacker must make a full search of each row of the database, which even with just a single SHA-256 is quite slow.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 96 characters you can easily type on most English keyboards. The complete space of those for an 8-character string is 96^8 or about 7x10^15. At 20M per second, that&#39;s about 360M seconds or roughly 11 CPU-years per row. That&#39;s not an impossible space to crack, but it&#39;s still not fast. (Obviously there are many thing pushing in both directions; users don&#39;t choose passwords randomly, but they also aren&#39;t limited to 8 characters. This computation is just for illustration.)\r\n\r\nA key take-away is that knowing the salt gives you no information at all about `sha256(salt+password)` if you don&#39;t know the password, too. That&#39;s a key feature of all cryptographic hashes (including the SHA series). If knowing part of the data gave you any information about the hash of the entire data, then that would tell us that the hash isn&#39;t secure.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251010/why-is-it-considered-ok-to-store-both-the-password-hash-and-salt-in-the-same-pla/58251756#58251756","title":"Why is it considered OK to store both the password hash and salt in the same place?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3763,"user_id":1815412,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13eb7cacf20e7789e9ebd5e814c42cb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Maximus S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1815412/maximus-s"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58251756,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570305271,"creation_date":1570298893,"question_id":58251010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251010","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s assume for each user, we store the user&#39;s password hash and a unique salt in the same table. For example, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser_email, sha256(raw_password+salt), salt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFAIK, this is a conventional practice and considered safe because it prevents attacks using rainbow tables. The reasoning is since attackers don&#39;t have a precomputed list of `sha256(raw_password+salt)` they are forced to recompute this for every row, and this will take a lot of time.\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t understand the reasoning above. According to this [old post](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/51877/how-long-does-it-take-to-perform-a-single-sha256), one core can run `sha256` more than 20M times per second.

At least not a MySQL database.\r\nInstead, try to store images in the filesystem and only store the filesystem path in the database.\r\nConsider renaming the files to long unique random names and storing that along with the original filename in the database.\r\n\r\nUsing PHP you can serve your files using their original names:\r\n\r\n    header(&#39;Content-Type: image/jpeg&#39;);\r\n    header(&#39;Content-disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;&#39;.$filenameOriginal.&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n    readfile($filenameStorage);\r\n\r\nMySQL is great att manipulating text, large blobs of binary data are a different story though. You should also ask yourself what you are gaining by storing images in the database.\r\n\r\nAbout compression. Images are commonly compressed quite well so further compressing them for database storage is usually not feasible.\r\n\r\nI would also strongly urge you to look into Prepared Statements for MySQL.\r\n[https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php][1]\r\n\r\nThat allows you to use queries like:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO images_tbl(image) VALUES(?)\r\n\r\nThe question mark signifies a variable which you pass to MySQL as binary with a separate function. This prevents SQL injection attacks which addslashes() definitely will not.\r\n\r\n[https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.bind-param.php][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php\r\n  [2]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.bind-param.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250975/how-can-i-compress-blob-image-when-retrieving-to-database/58252991#58252991","title":"How can I compress blob image when retrieving to database?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12168463,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC7CcQgakgWZ7Cd4xLCEpnbhxKyTsm3n9zvmdjG=k-s128","display_name":"KarlMarx Dizon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12168463/karlmarx-dizon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12168463,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC7CcQgakgWZ7Cd4xLCEpnbhxKyTsm3n9zvmdjG=k-s128","display_name":"KarlMarx Dizon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12168463/karlmarx-dizon"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58252991,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570316690,"creation_date":1570298647,"last_edit_date":1570302571,"question_id":58250975,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250975","body_markdown":"Im using the following code to upload the image in my database:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;form&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;image&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;submit name=&quot;upload&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    $mysqli=new mysqli(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;root&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;mydb&quot;);\r\n\r\n      if (isset($_POST[&#39;upload&#39;])) {\r\n    \t$photo = addslashes(file_get_contents($_FILES[&quot;image&quot;][&quot;tmp_name&quot;]));\r\n    \r\n    \t$result=$mysqli-&gt;query(&quot;INSERT INTO images_tbl(image) VALUES(&#39;$photo&#39;)&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    ?&gt;\r\n\r\nand retrieve the photo this way:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    $result=$mysqli-&gt;query(&quot;SELECT image FROM image_tbl&quot;);\r\n        while ($test=mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {\r\n          \t$getphoto = $test[&#39;image&#39;];\r\n        }\r\n         echo&#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/jpeg;base64,&#39;.base64_encode($getphoto).&#39;&quot; style=&quot;width: 40px; 40px;&quot; class=&quot;w3-round&quot; draggable=&quot;false&quot; /&gt; &#39;;\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen I upload a large image it loads the original file size.

Each item from the Recycleview should have a button ( like this https://imgur.com/qlEJCkk : a + button to add tasks and an &quot;x&quot; button for each task to delete it)\r\n\r\nI have tried to implement it from some other examples of onClickListeners but nothing worked so far\r\n\r\nthis is the ADAPTER:\r\n```\r\npublic class ExpandableAdapter extends ExpandableRecyclerViewAdapter&lt;RoutineViewHolder, TaskViewHolder&gt; {\r\n    public ExpandableAdapter(List&lt;? extends ExpandableGroup&gt; groups) {\r\n        super(groups);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public RoutineViewHolder onCreateGroupViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\r\n        View v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.expandable_recyclerview_routine, parent, false);\r\n        return new RoutineViewHolder(v);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public TaskViewHolder onCreateChildViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\r\n        View v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.expandable_recyclerview_task, parent, false);\r\n        return new TaskViewHolder(v);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onBindChildViewHolder(TaskViewHolder holder, int flatPosition, ExpandableGroup group, int childIndex) {\r\n        final Tasks tasks = (Tasks) group.getItems().get(childIndex);\r\n        holder.bind(tasks);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onBindGroupViewHolder(RoutineViewHolder holder, int flatPosition, ExpandableGroup group) {\r\n        final Routine routine = (Routine) group;\r\n        holder.bind(routine);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nRoutineViewHolder:\r\n```\r\nimport com.thoughtbot.expandablerecyclerview.viewholders.GroupViewHolder;\r\n\r\npublic class RoutineViewHolder extends GroupViewHolder implements View.OnClickListener {\r\n    private TextView mTextView;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    public RoutineViewHolder(View itemView) {\r\n        super(itemView);\r\n\r\n        mTextView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.exp_routine);\r\n        itemView.setOnClickListener(this);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    public void bind(Routine routine){\r\n        mTextView.setText(routine.getTitle());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTaskViewHolder:\r\n```\r\npublic class TaskViewHolder extends ChildViewHolder {\r\n    private TextView mTextView;\r\n    private CheckBox mCheckBox;\r\n    private Boolean checkVal;\r\n\r\n    public TaskViewHolder(View itemView) {\r\n        super(itemView);\r\n        mTextView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.exp_task);\r\n        mCheckBox=itemView.findViewById(R.id.exp_task_checkbox);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void bind(Tasks tasks) {\r\n        mTextView.setText(tasks.name);\r\n        checkVal=((tasks.checkBox==1)?Boolean.TRUE:Boolean.FALSE);\r\n        mCheckBox.setChecked(checkVal);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nas you can see I have 2 ViewHolders : RoutineViewHolder and TaskViewHolder.

buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n&quot;Tasks&quot; should have the + button to add tasks underneath it \r\nand each task should have an X button to delete that specific task\r\n\r\nthe expandable

Refer to ˙?aggregate` for further information. Second, the answer to each of your three questions is yes. Third, your level 1 summary is equivalent to your data frame. \r\n\r\nAs you are using `aggregate()`, I will first illustrate how to attain a list of the grouped summaries using `aggregate()`:\r\n\r\n```r \r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\nformula_list &lt;- \r\n  list(\r\n    GDP ~ Year + Continent + Country + State.Province + City,\r\n    GDP ~ Continent + Country + State.Province + City, \r\n    GDP ~ Country + State.Province + City, \r\n    GDP ~ State.Province + City,\r\n    GDP ~ City\r\n    )\r\n\r\nsummaries &lt;- formula_list %&gt;% \r\n  map( ~ aggregate(.x, FUN = sum, data = myData))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also possible to replace `aggregate()` with a fully `dplyr` based approach. The upside to that is replacing the notoriously inefficient `aggregate()`. The downside is that we will have to deal with quosures, which are a somewhat more advanced topic (consult `vignette(&quot;programming&quot;)` for further information). \r\n\r\n```r \r\nvar_combs &lt;- list(\r\n  vars(Year, Continent, Country, State.Province, City),\r\n  vars(Continent, Country, State.Province, City),\r\n  vars(Country, State.Province, City),\r\n  vars(State.Province, City),\r\n  vars(City)) \r\n\r\nsummaries &lt;- var_combs %&gt;% \r\n  map(~ myData %&gt;% \r\n          group_by(!!!.x) %&gt;% \r\n          summarize(GDP = sum(GDP)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext comes applying your code for calculating quartiles to each element of the list. As you also vary the grouping variable, we need to iterate over two lists, therefore we will be using `purrr::map2()`:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ngrp_var &lt;- list(\r\n  vars(Year),\r\n  vars(Continent),\r\n  vars(Country),\r\n  vars(State.Province),\r\n  vars(City)\r\n)\r\n\r\nmap2(summaries[1:3], \r\n     grp_var[1:3], \r\n     ~ .x %&gt;%  \r\n       group_by(!!!.y) %&gt;% \r\n       mutate(Quantile = cut(GDP,\r\n                             breaks = quantile(GDP, c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)), \r\n                             labels = 1:4, \r\n                             include.lowest = TRUE))\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will notice that I had to subset the lists to just the first three elements. The code you wrote for calculating the quartiles fails if one of the groups has only one observation (which makes sense: you cannot calculate quartiles for a sample of one). This will always be the case for the last of the five, as it contains only one element per group by definition. It is also questionable if your result is particularly meaningful if you just have two or three observations per group.\r\n\r\n\r\nData:\r\n```r\r\nmyData &lt;- structure(list(\r\n    Year = c(2019,

It is easiest to describe the issue with an example:\r\n\r\nThe variables in my data (myData): GDP in years 2017, 2018, and 2019 at 4 levels of granularity: Continent, Country, State (or Province), and City. \r\n(Note: GDP numbers are arbitrary; only used to make easier calculations)\r\n\r\nmyData:\r\n\r\n       |------|---------------|---------|------------|-------------|------|\r\n       | Year | Continent\t  | Country\t| State      | City\t       | GDP  |\r\n       |------|---------------|---------|------------|-------------|------|\r\n       | 2019&#160;| North America | Canada\t| Alberta\t | Edmonton\t   | 13   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| North America | Canada\t| Alberta\t | Calgary\t   | 9    |\r\n       | 2018 |&#160;North America | Canada\t| Alberta\t | Edmonton\t   | 3    | \r\n       | 2018&#160;| Asia\t      | India \t| Bihar\t     | Patna       | 19   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| Asia\t      | India \t| Bihar      | Gaya\t       | 8    |\r\n       | 2017&#160;| Asia\t      | India \t| Bihar\t     | Patna\t   | 22   | \r\n       | 2019&#160;| Asia\t      | India \t| Bihar\t     | Gaya\t       | 19   |\r\n       | 2019 | Asia\t      | India \t| Bihar  \t | Patna\t   | 16   |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| North America |\tUSA\t    | California | San Diego   | 23   |\r\n       | 2017&#160;| North America |\tUSA\t    | California | Los Angeles | 18   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| North America |\tUSA\t    | California | Los Angeles | 25   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| North America |\tUSA\t    | Florida\t | Tampa\t   | 14   |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| North America |\tUSA\t    | Florida\t | Miami\t   | 19   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Guangdong\t | Shenzhen    | 29   |\r\n       | 2017&#160;| Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Guangdong\t | Shenzhen\t   | 26   |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Guangdong  | Shenzhen\t   | 33   |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Guangdong\t | Guangzhou   | 20   |\r\n       | 2018 |&#160;Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Guangdong\t | Guangzhou   | 19   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| North America |\tCanada\t| Quebec\t | Montreal\t   | 11   |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| North America |\tCanada\t| Quebec\t | Montreal\t   | 7    |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Shandong\t | Yantai\t   | 30   |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Shandong\t | Jinan\t   | 16   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Shandong\t | Yantai\t   | 17   |\r\n       | 2018 |&#160;Asia\t      |\tChina\t| Shandong\t | Jinan\t   | 11   |\r\n       | 2019&#160;| Asia\t      | India \t| U.P.\t     | Allahabad   | 21   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| Asia\t      | India \t| U.P.\t     | Agra\t       | 15   |\r\n       | 2018&#160;| Asia\t      | India \t| U.P.\t     | Allahabad   | 13   |\r\n       | 2019 |&#160;Asia\t      | India \t| U.P.\t     | Agra\t       | 18   |\r\n       |------|---------------|---------|------------|-------------|------|\r\n\r\nThe overall goal is to calculate GDP Quantiles (1 = 0-25%, 2 = 25%-50%,...etc.) at varying levels of granularity. Here is exactly what I am looking for: \r\n\r\n - Quantiles for each Year; (subset entire dataset for the 3 Years)\r\n - Quantiles for each Continent; (subset data by Continent)\r\n - Quantiles for each Country; (subset data by Continent and Country)\r\n - Quantiles for each State.Province; (subset data by Continent, Country, and State.Province)\r\n - Quantiles for each City; (subset data by Continent, Country, State.Province, and City)\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI currently have two steps in this process: \r\n\r\n 1. Subset data at each level.\r\n 2. Calculate quantiles (based off GDP values) for each subset.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe subset by summing/adding GDP at each level. (Note: This step will generate dataframes with less and less rows as we move down to level 5.) Here is what I have done and it is rather manual and repetitive, so I would like to find a better way: \r\n\r\n    Level_1.Year &lt;- aggregate(\r\n        GDP ~ \r\n          Year + \r\n          Continent + \r\n          Country + \r\n          State.Province + \r\n          City, \r\n        FUN = sum, \r\n        data = myData)\r\n    \r\n    Level_2.Continent &lt;- aggregate(\r\n        GDP ~ \r\n          Continent + \r\n          Country + \r\n          State.Province + \r\n          City, \r\n        FUN = sum, \r\n        data = myData)\r\n        \r\n    Level_3.Country &lt;- aggregate(\r\n        GDP ~ \r\n          Country + \r\n          State.Province + \r\n          City, \r\n        FUN = sum, \r\n        data = myData)\r\n    \r\n    Level_4.State.Province &lt;- aggregate(\r\n        GDP ~ \r\n          State.Province + \r\n          City, \r\n        FUN = sum, \r\n        data = myData)\r\n    \r\n    Level_5.City &lt;- aggregate(\r\n        GDP ~ \r\n          City, \r\n        FUN = sum, \r\n        data = myData)\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo now that we have the subsets, we calculate the quantiles for each subset. Since they are all different lengths and do not have the same variables, I have resorted to manual/repetitive calculations (again...) for each subset:\r\n\r\n    Level_1.Year_quantiles &lt;- Level_1.Year %&gt;% \r\n            group_by(Year) %&gt;% \r\n            mutate(Quantile = cut(GDP,\r\n                breaks = quantile(GDP, \r\n            c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)), \r\n                labels = 1:4, \r\n                include.lowest = TRUE))\r\n    \r\n    Level_2.Continent_quantiles &lt;- Level_2.Continent %&gt;% \r\n            group_by(Continent) %&gt;% \r\n            mutate(Quantile = cut(GDP,\r\n                breaks = quantile(GDP, \r\n            c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)), \r\n                labels = 1:4, \r\n                include.lowest = TRUE))\r\n    \r\n    Level_3.Country_quantiles &lt;- Level_3.Country %&gt;% \r\n            group_by(Country) %&gt;% \r\n            mutate(Quantile = cut(GDP,\r\n                breaks = quantile(GDP, \r\n            c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)), \r\n                labels = 1:4, \r\n                include.lowest = TRUE))\r\n            . \r\n            .\r\n            .\r\n    \r\n    # All the way through Level_5.City; I think you get the point. \r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIs there a way to (1) subset each level in a more efficient way, then (2) store each subset in a list of dataframes, then (3) add quantiles to each dataframe in the list? \r\n\r\nIf theres a better way to do this entire process, please let me know! Also, if you have any comments or recommendations, I would love to hear them.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250953/subsetting-data-by-levels-of-granularity-and-applying-a-function-to-each-data-fr","title":"Subsetting data by levels of granularity and applying a function to each data frame in R"},{"tags":["python-3.x","list","loops","for-loop","nested-lists"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13818,"user_id":494134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ca0f8158fe405abdbf211622853bb3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gordon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/494134/john-gordon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570298928,"post_id":58250952,"comment_id":102872410,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250952/how-can-we-get-this-output#comment102872410_58250952"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":575,"user_id":5506167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/972ec90324677544d0d8f049a8b2d4fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Saleh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5506167/saleh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570299654,"creation_date":1570299654,"answer_id":58251102,"question_id":58250952,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58251102","body_markdown":"Your sort key is not correct.

problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mobile application receives the push with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      if (this.platform.is(&#39;cordova&#39;)) {\r\n\r\n        this.fcm.subscribeToTopic(&#39;TOPIC&#39;);\r\n\r\n\r\n            this.fcm.getToken().then(token =&gt; {\r\n              // save this server-side and use it to push notifications to this device\r\n              console.log(`Obtained token: ${token}`);\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            this.fcm.onTokenRefresh().subscribe(token =&gt; {\r\n              // save this server-side and use it to

the push notification comes thru with no problem via the other application or even using the firebase console.\r\nHowever when outside of the app, the push notification does not pop up in the system tray.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250949/ionic-app-does-not-receive-push-notification-when-in-background","title":"Ionic app does not receive push notification when in

You can overload the operators so that you can do arithmetic with the value as you would normally do.\r\nUsually I would resort to templates to implement such functionality but I think the example below is easier to understand.\r\n\r\n    class MyInt\r\n    {\r\n        public:\r\n        MyInt(int minval, int maxval);\r\n        \r\n        MyInt&amp; operator=(MyInt const&amp; rhs);\r\n        MyInt&amp; operator=(int rhs);\r\n        \r\n        private:\r\n        int _val;\r\n        int _minval;\r\n        int _maxval;\r\n        \r\n        bool _is_inrange(int val);\r\n    };\r\n\r\nWhenever you perform an operation on the class it needs to check whether the result is in the correct range. Of course the data type you base your class on needs to be able to accomodate the desired value range. I used `int` as an example. If you use templates you could set select the base data type when instantiating the class.\r\n\r\n    MyInt::MyInt(int minval, int maxval)\r\n    {\r\n        _minval = minval;\r\n        _maxval = maxval;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    bool MyInt::_is_inrange(int val)\r\n    {\r\n        return _minval &lt;= val &amp;&amp; val &lt; _maxval;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can overload the operators to work with the values in the same way you are working with primitive datatypes. I have implemented the assignment operator as an example but you can also overload the arithmetic operators.\r\n\r\n    MyInt&amp; MyInt::operator=(int rhs)\r\n    {\r\n        if (_is_inrange(rhs))\r\n        {\r\n            _val = rhs;\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            // throw an error or do something else.\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Error: Invalid value&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n        }\r\n        return *this;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    MyInt&amp; MyInt::operator=(MyInt const&amp; rhs)\r\n    {\r\n        if (_is_inrange(rhs._val))\r\n        {\r\n            _val = rhs._val;\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            // throw an error or do something else.\r\n            cout &lt;&lt;

content: &quot;&quot;; dis.....\r\n```\r\n\r\nand change your jQuery to:\r\n```\r\n$(document).ready(function () {\r\n\r\n  // global info for menu -&gt; target elememt\r\n  var InfoTarget = { ID: null, tempo:300 }\r\n\r\n  $(&#39;a&#39;).click(function(evt){\r\n    InfoTarget.ID = $(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;) // possible target elm\r\n\r\n    // check if InfoTarget.ID exist on page\r\n    let nbElements = 0\r\n    try        { nbElements = $(InfoTarget.ID).length  }\r\n    catch(err) { nbElements = 0 }\r\n\r\n    if ( nbElements != 1 ) {\r\n      InfoTarget.ID = null  // not target element found\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      evt.preventDefault()   // disable auto scroll to target element  \r\n\r\n      $(&#39;html&#39;).animate({\r\n          scrollTop: ($(InfoTarget.ID).offset().top - $(&#39;#header&#39;).outerHeight(true))\r\n      }, InfoTarget.tempo  );\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  $(window).resize(function (){\r\n    if (InfoTarget.ID) {  // if InfoTarget.ID exist &lt;=&gt;

var InfoTarget = {ID: null, tempo: 300}  \r\n\r\nseen on: `InfoTarget.ID = $(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;) // possible target elm`\r\n\r\nthe rest is simple, you have to scroll down to the anchor.\r\nDepending on the width of the page and the previous elements, browsers continuously recalculate the position of each tag present on a page and jQuery can be retrieved this offset position by `$(element).offset().Top`\r\n\r\nas there is a menu bar on your page that masks the top of the page, you must deduct its height from the position in scroll (= $ (&#39;# header&#39;). outerHeight (true))  \r\na `scroll = 0` will force a move to the top of the page  \r\na `scroll = $(element).offset().top` places the `element` at the top of the page\r\nto which we must deduct the height of the `#header`  \r\n\r\n the complete formula is  \r\n&gt; scrollTop: ( $(InfoTarget.ID).offset().top - $(&#39;#header&#39;).outerHeight(true) )\r\n\r\nthis command is placed in a `jQuery.animate`, for a visually smoother move, and uses the `InfoTarget.tempo` value as the duration for this animation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a resize of the page, and to the extent that a link having a target has been previously clicked (therefore always active) then the same type of scroll is triggered.\r\n\r\nThe different jQuery methods used are all explained in the jQuery doc (for example: https://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/ )\r\n\r\n\r\n**New Solution -- Lundi 14 oct 2019 / 01:00  (in the night of sunday / monday)**  \r\n\r\n*this script must be placed after all the html elements of the body*\r\n```\r\n// scroll to target upon window.location.hash \r\n$(window).on(&#39;hashchange&#39;, function() {\r\n  $(&#39;.TargetMark&#39;).removeClass(&#39;TargetMark&#39;)\r\n  $(window.location.hash).addClass(&#39;TargetMark&#39;)\r\n\r\n  setTimeout( scrollTop2, 220 )  // scroll to target after browser auto scrolling conflit\r\n})\r\n\r\nfunction scrollTop2() {\r\n  if ($(&#39;.TargetMark&#39;).length===1) { // if target exist\r\n    $(&#39;html&#39;).animate({\r\n    \tscrollTop: ($(&#39;.TargetMark&#39;).offset().top - $(&#39;#header&#39;).outerHeight(true))\r\n    }, 100);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this version the target element is added a class (TargetMark) allowing to find it when window resize\r\n\r\nending part \r\n```\r\n$(document).ready(function () {\r\n  //...\r\n  // ---------------------------&gt;  no call to scrollTop();\r\n  //...\r\n});\r\n\r\n$(window).resize(function () {\r\n  //...\r\n  scrollTop2();\r\n  //...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nabout toggleMenu conflict:\r\n```\r\nfunction toggleMenu() {\r\n  $(&#39;.navbar-toggle&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function () {\r\n    if ($(&quot;#js-menu&quot;).is(&quot;.expand&quot;)) {\r\n      $(&quot;#js-menu&quot;).toggleClass(&quot;expand&quot;);\r\n      $(&quot;#submenu&quot;).removeClass(&quot;active_sub&quot;).addClass(&quot;inactive_sub&quot;);\r\n    } else {\r\n      $(&quot;#js-menu&quot;).toggleClass(&quot;expand&quot;);\r\n      $(&quot;#submenu&quot;).removeClass(&quot;inactive_sub&quot;).addClass(&quot;active_sub&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    resetTarget();\r\n    setTimeout( scrollTop2, 220 )  // scroll to target after browser auto scrolling conflit\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n I spent a lot of my time on your question, I studied differents  approaches and the different automatisms put at work by the navigators themselves and which is necessary to fight to get the result  you&#39;r looking for. I came to the conclusion that the problem first came from the architecture of your page.  \r\nThe fact that the menu (&quot;#header&quot;) covers the page (&quot;#main&quot;) is a major flaw that prevents to have an effective JS code for your question.  \r\n The call on the hash of an anchor triggers one or more scrolls of the page, the resize of the page also entails a scroll calculation because by changing size on the screen, it also changes the size of the page. page (reducing the size of the screen by half makes the page size double), it is the same by changing the size of the font, it also changes the size in page.  \r\nWhenever the page size changes, the browser must recalculate a lot of things and some of these mechanisms can trigger one or more scrolls.  \r\nWhat you are asking here is to recalculate a page positioning according to an element of which we can not be certain that it is completely established because this process is executed in parallel with other processes of the browser which can change useful values.  \r\nPlus the fact that some of the browser processes also work to scroll the page and that it can be the last done!  \r\nSo the fact that there is an overlap between the menu and the page add more complexity and makes the possibility of a solution impossible.\r\nChange your layout and 3/4 of your problem will be fixed.

I mean overriding something like &quot;OnValidationExecuted&quot; method in VM.\r\n\r\nI know this problem can be solved somehow (css, javascript, ..), but I think this is something that should be controlled simply using DotVVM.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250851/accessing-validation-details-in-dotvvm","title":"Accessing validation details in DotVVM"},{"tags":["ios","swift"],"owner":{"reputation":2044,"user_id":851097,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4852bc32c3e741316d668526cdcf171?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Louisa Scheinost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/851097/louisa-scheinost"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570297622,"creation_date":1570297622,"question_id":58250848,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250848","body_markdown":"I have a .epub file.

can be done with either ```ViewGroup```. But the problem is not the the view group - the problem is that you have a single image for the whole content - it is bad practice.\r\n\r\nThere should be at least 2 images - one for the background and the other is for the content.\r\n\r\nIt is due to fragmentation issue regarding device screens - there too many different resolution, aspect ratios and dpis to make the single image work properly on them all.\r\n\r\nI will show you an example based on your UI with a background and logo image with small images below logo. You just need to separate it into two files - background could be jpg but logo must be png with transparency. In case you will do it - here is how your layout should look like.\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;FrameLayout xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n    android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n    android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n    android:background=&quot;@color/white&quot;\r\n    android:orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;ImageView\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/background&quot;\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:scaleType=&quot;fitXY&quot;\r\n        android:src=&quot;@drawable/bg&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;ImageView\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/content&quot;\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n        android:layout_gravity=&quot;center&quot;\r\n        android:adjustViewBounds=&quot;true&quot;\r\n        android:padding=&quot;24dp&quot;\r\n        android:src=&quot;@drawable/logo&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/FrameLayout&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may want to experiment with ```android:padding``` and ```android:scaleType``` to achieve the best result.\r\n\r\nEdit\r\n-\r\nChanged ```android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;``` to ```android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;``` - it will work better this way\r\n\r\nHope it helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250847/sticking-image-to-bottom-of-view/58251712#58251712","title":"Sticking image to bottom of view?"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12151507,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e17705a984286301c43cbaeb35aa6dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Primatron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12151507/primatron"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34008,"user_id":2649012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4SzF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fant&#244;mas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649012/fant%c3%b4mas"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58251712,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570305380,"creation_date":1570297618,"last_edit_date":1570300235,"question_id":58250847,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250847","body_markdown":"I have designed a splash screen in Adobe XD as shown:\r\n[enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow when I exported the parts of the image to android studio, I was unable to make all the images stick to the bottom as in XD.

It might be a result of a bug, indicate  missing data, or represent a default value.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips:\r\n\r\n - [requireNonNull][2] is better than writting `if (x == null)` everywhere.\r\n - [Optional][3]\r\n - Failing fast is good, so do throw an exception if you encounter an unexpected null. `NullPointerException` is fine, `IllegalArgumentException` is also ok. Bike sheds should be painted black.\r\n - Don&#39;t use asserts - this is a dead language feature.\r\n - Don&#39;t mask null values (it&#39;s like ignoring errors).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a solution that solves the null problem once and for all, I would like to take this opportunity to promote [Kotlin][1] - a programming language which does a good job of clearing up this mess.

Should it go under the Edit project or as a separate plugin?\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Collections;\r\n\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    import org.eclipse.emf.common.util.URI;\r\n    //import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EObject;\r\n    import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.plugin.EcorePlugin;\r\n    import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource;\r\n    import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.ResourceSet;\r\n    import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.impl.ResourceSetImpl;\r\n    //import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.impl.ResourceFactoryImpl;\r\n    import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.impl.EcoreResourceFactoryImpl;\r\n\r\n    import asdl.asdlPackage;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class UsingEMFModel {\r\n\t/** Create Resource Manager**/\r\n\tpublic static void startResourceManager() {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t/** Register factory**/\r\n\t\tResource.Factory.Registry.INSTANCE.getExtensionToFactoryMap().put(&quot;ecore&quot;, new EcoreResourceFactoryImpl());\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t/** Register package**/\r\n\t\tasdlPackage.eINSTANCE.eClass();\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t/**Create ResourceSet**/\r\n\tpublic static ResourceSet createResourceSet() {\r\n\t\tResourceSet rs= new ResourceSetImpl();\r\n\t\trs.getResourceFactoryRegistry().getExtensionToFactoryMap().put(Resource.Factory.Registry.DEFAULT_EXTENSION, new EcoreResourceFactoryImpl());\r\n\t\trs.getURIConverter().getURIMap().putAll(EcorePlugin.computePlatformURIMap(false));\r\n\t\treturn rs;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\t// TODO Auto-generated method stub\r\n\t\t\t/**Initiate Resource Manager**/\r\n\t\t\tUsingEMFModel.startResourceManager();\r\n\t\t\tResourceSet rs=UsingEMFModel.createResourceSet();\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t/**Get URI for model**/\r\n\t\t\tURI fileURI= URI.createPlatformPluginURI(&quot;platform:/resource/TestFullIntegration/DepartureIntegration/model/landingIntegration.ecore&quot;, false);\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t/**Load resource for the file**/\r\n\t\t\tResource resource=rs.getResource(fileURI,true);\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\tresource.save(System.out, Collections.EMPTY_MAP);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tcatch(IOException e) {}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250803/how-to-create-standalone-model-from-edit-project-in-emf","title":"How to create standalone model from .edit project in EMF?"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","spring-data-jpa","spring-data-rest"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6746956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zf26D.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JPB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6746956/jpb"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570351301,"post_id":58250994,"comment_id":102880417,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250801/how-can-i-produce-a-json-object-instead-of-json-array-as-result-to-my-api-querie/58250994#comment102880417_58250994"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":900,"user_id":903885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85b179c50dd6f600048cc8fc47403b03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hasan Can Saral","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/903885/hasan-can-saral"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570298805,"creation_date":1570298805,"answer_id":58250994,"question_id":58250801,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58250994","body_markdown":"Create a class as follows:\r\n\r\n    public class LocationWrapper {\r\n        private List&lt;Location&gt;
