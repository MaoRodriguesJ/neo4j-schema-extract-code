At least for me, I put a `Console.WriteLine(&quot;foo&quot;)` after the method that should fatal, and it printed &quot;foo&quot;. It&#39;s more of like a logging tool I guess, like the ones that take multiple listeners per logger. If I want a fatal assert, I suppose I can sneak a `System.Environment.Exit(1)` in the single custom listener\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423272/system-diagnostics-debug-assert-in-console-app-filenames-and-line-numbers-in-st","title":"System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert in console app. Filenames and line numbers in stacktrace dump looke like &lt;hex&gt;:0"},{"tags":["reactjs","npm","package.json","nodemon"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3783,"user_id":6525724,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZEkk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6525724/nick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571272571,"post_id":58423267,"comment_id":103188822,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423267/starting-react-and-nodemon-backend-in-one-npm-script#comment103188822_58423267"},{"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":7663853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--7XagYZaYog/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA0E/uap2IihBtwQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dale Spiteri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7663853/dale-spiteri"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3783,"user_id":6525724,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZEkk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6525724/nick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571276848,"post_id":58423267,"comment_id":103189631,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423267/starting-react-and-nodemon-backend-in-one-npm-script#comment103189631_58423267"}],"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":7663853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--7XagYZaYog/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA0E/uap2IihBtwQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dale Spiteri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7663853/dale-spiteri"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571271929,"creation_date":1571271929,"question_id":58423267,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423267","body_markdown":"I have a React app that depends on two backend NodeJS files that I run in my development environment using Nodemon.\r\n\r\nI typically have to start up XAMPP, run each Node backend file, and start my React dev server.

this task took me longer than expected to tackle and finally I come up with a solution with the help of a couple **helper columns** (not sure if it is an option?).\r\n\r\nSo suppose your have the following **named ranges**:\r\n\r\n - **TblA_Date** being all the dates in your `Table A` (This one is optional as I did not use it in my solution...);\r\n - **TblB_Date** being all the dates in your `Table B`.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I *&quot;expanded&quot;* your `Table B` to a list structure laying out all the dates:\r\n\r\n[![Expand Table B][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe formula for the first helper column in Cell `J2` of my example is:\r\n\r\n    =SUM($I$2:I2)\r\n\r\n&gt;which is to find the running total of the counts in `Table B`.\r\n\r\nThe formula for the second helper column in Cell `M2` is:\r\n\r\n    =INDEX(TblB_Date,MATCH(1,--(ROW(A1)&lt;=$J$2:$J$8),0))\r\n\r\n&gt;which is &quot;laying&quot; out all the dates from `Table B` using row position as a reference and comparing it with the running total of counts and returning the corresponding date. Given that it is an **array formula** you **MUST** press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; upon finishing the formula in the formula bar otherwise it will not function correctly. Then you can simply drag the formula down to apply across.\r\n\r\n&gt;Please note I have given the second helper column `M2:M18` (excluding `M19` which is an error) a name **TblB_Date_Expanded**.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to find the position of the desired date in **TblB_Date_Expanded** based on your conditions which are \r\n\r\n 1. *&quot;for every date in table A, the result date is either same date or the next higher date&quot;* **AND** \r\n 2. *the date from `Table B` can only be used no more than its corresponding count*.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Index Column][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe formula in cell `E2` is:\r\n\r\n    =MAX(MATCH(AGGREGATE(15,6,TblB_Date_Expanded/(A2&lt;=TblB_Date_Expanded),1),TblB_Date_Expanded,0),E1+1)\r\n\r\nwhere `A2` is the first date in `Table A` as you will see in my next screenshot.\r\n\r\n&gt;The logic is to use **AGGREGATE** function to return the closest starting date in `TblB_Date_Expanded` base on the given date in `Table A`, then use **MATCH** function to return the row position, and lastly use **MAX** function to increase the position by `1` if the same position has been used already (in the row above).\r\n\r\nWith known row position, we can easily return the corresponding date from `TblB_Date_Expanded` using the following formula:\r\n\r\n    =INDEX(TblB_Date_Expanded,E2)\r\n\r\n[![Result][3]][3]\r\n\r\n&gt;**Thoughts**, the difficult part that I cannot overcome is the use of &quot;circular reference&quot; or &quot;self-reference&quot; in the helper columns. In other words, I am not sure how to use a single formula to return an array of values whose calculation is depending on its precedent value. I hope someone may come up a more elegant way of solving this question :)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

I have no idea how to write this lab.\r\n\r\n&gt; In many computer games, we have a world filled with items that the\r\n&gt; game characters can pick up and use. Some items can be food, some\r\n&gt; items can be weapons, and so on. There can be hundreds of different\r\n&gt; items, and we want to avoid having to write giant if statements\r\n&gt; listing all the possible items.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; First, get the Person.java file with this lab. You can see that\r\n&gt; currently a person has strength, intelligence, and energy.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Now, let&#39;s create items that the person can pickup and carry. For now,\r\n&gt; we want the following six items:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; * Apple\r\n&gt; * Sword\r\n&gt; * Hammer\r\n&gt; * Steak\r\n&gt; * Bread\r\n&gt; * Statue\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; We want each item to have a weight and a name associated with it. We\r\n&gt; want a person to be able to pick up an item as long as it is not too\r\n&gt; heavy. To help us, let&#39;s create an abstract class that collects all of\r\n&gt; these properties into a single place.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I will start out by showing you one way to do that. Here is such an\r\n&gt; abstract class. Add this class to your code. Notice that it states\r\n&gt; that all items have weights and names. It also defines a toString\r\n&gt; method for the item. Initially the toString just uses the name of the\r\n&gt; item. The reason these are separate methods is so that later on we can\r\n&gt; have toString methods that can adjust to game situations.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     public abstract class GameItem {\r\n&gt;       private double weight;\r\n&gt;       private String name;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       public GameItem(String name, double weight) {\r\n&gt;         this.name = name;\r\n&gt;         this.weight = weight;\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       public double getWeight() {\r\n&gt;         return weight;\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       public String getName() {\r\n&gt;         return name;\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       @Override\r\n&gt;       public String toString() {\r\n&gt;         return getName();\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Now that we have this class, defining each of the items is easy. Here is the class for Apples. An apple does not weigh very much so I give it a very light weight.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     public class Apple extends GameItem {\r\n&gt;       public Apple() {\r\n&gt;         super(&quot;Apple&quot;, 0.25);\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Create a class for each of the six objects. Then add two new methods to Person:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; public boolean pickup(GameItem o)\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; If the item weighs less than the\r\n&gt; strength of the person, return true and set a field indicating that\r\n&gt; the person is carrying this object.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; GameItem drop()\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Change the field so that the person is no longer\r\n&gt; carrying an object and return the object that was dropped. Return null\r\n&gt; if the person was not carrying anything. To make things easy, right\r\n&gt; now we will assume a person can carry only one item at a time. Compile\r\n&gt; and test your code. Make sure some items (like the statue) are too\r\n&gt; heavy to pickup.     \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     /** A person in a game */\r\n&gt;      public class Person {\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;       // the strength of the person\r\n&gt;      private int strength;\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;     // the energy level of the person, it starts at a default value\r\n&gt;     private int energy = 10;\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;     // the intelligence of the person\r\n&gt;     private int intelligence;\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;     /** Create a person with the given strength and intelligence */\r\n&gt;     public Person(int strength, int intelligence) {\r\n&gt;       this.strength = strength;\r\n&gt;       this.intelligence = intelligence;\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Returns the strength of the person */\r\n&gt;      public int getStrength() {\r\n&gt;        return strength;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Changes the strength of the person */\r\n&gt;      public void setStrength(int strength) {\r\n&gt;        this.strength = strength;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Returns the energy of the person */\r\n&gt;      public int getEnergy() {\r\n&gt;        return energy;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Increases or decreases the energy of the person by amount */\r\n&gt;      public void adjustEnergy(int amount) {\r\n&gt;        this.energy = this.energy + amount;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Returns the intelligence of the person */\r\n&gt;      public int getIntelligence() {\r\n&gt;        return intelligence;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Changes the intelligence of the person */\r\n&gt;      public void setIntelligence(int intelligence) {\r\n&gt;        this.intelligence = intelligence;\r\n&gt;      }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423237/how-to-create-six-objects-and-two-methods","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"How to create six objects and two methods?"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","express"],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":9183058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2430669ba6fdd88b4ec134b23ce2bef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Buckyx55","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9183058/buckyx55"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571271626,"creation_date":1571271626,"question_id":58423235,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423235","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to safeguard my application as best I can, and I&#39;ve been told by others that I should store images on a separate cloud server (like GCP&#39;s Bucket), but I&#39;m not sure what else I need to do regarding document uploads.

set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how I intend to use it:\r\n\r\n    async Task DoWorkAsync(Out&lt;int&gt; arg)\r\n    {\r\n        arg.Value = 13;\r\n        await Task.Delay(500); // Placeholder for a really useful async operation\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `Value` will always be assigned before the first `await` inside the asynchronous method. In other words the assignment will happen in the synchronous part of the method. So the caller can retrieve the value immediately after creating the `Task`, and use it before the awaiting of the `Task`:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = DoWorkAsync(arg);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;13&#39; in the console :-)\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nUntil this point everything works perfectly. The problem appears when it becomes mandatory for the `DoWorkAsync` method to run in a thread-pool thread. Initially I tried the simplest approach with [`Task.Run`][1]:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = Task.Run(() =&gt; DoAsync(arg));\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;0&#39; in the console :-(\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nThis didn&#39;t work. Another try:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = Task.Run(async () =&gt; await DoWorkAsync(arg));\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;0&#39; in the console :-(\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nDidn&#39;t work either. After much thought I realized that the current thread cannot retrieve the `arg.Value` until the thread-pool thread has processed the synchronous part of the method, so the current thread must wait. Then, after retrieving the `arg.Value`, the current thread must wait one more time for the asynchronous part of the method. This led me to a solution of the problem:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; DoWorkAsync(arg),\r\n        CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach,\r\n        TaskScheduler.Default);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;13&#39; in the console :-/\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nThis worked, but I dislike the use of [`Task.Factory.StartNew`][2]. This is an old-school method, with a bad reputation of [being dangerous][3]. So my question is: Is it possible to solve this problem, without using the `Task.Factory.StartNew` method?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.run\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskfactory.startnew\r\n  [3]: https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/08/startnew-is-dangerous.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423221/how-to-retrieve-the-out-parameter-of-an-asynchronous-method-that-runs-on-another","title":"How to retrieve the out parameter of an asynchronous method that runs on another thread"},{"tags":["python","tkinter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571274018,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103189100,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103189100_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571277850,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103189839,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103189839_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571278862,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190046_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571279509,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190163,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190163_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571280770,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190383,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190383_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571281700,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190558_58423220"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571271515,"creation_date":1571271515,"question_id":58423220,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423220","body_markdown":"I&#39;m not having much luck researching this particular task. I&#39;d like to update the foreground color of a text based on whether a number is negative or positive. If the number is negative, it displays in red text. If it&#39;s positive, it displays in green.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m checking for whether it&#39;s negative or not by comparing two variables. If **total** is greater than or equal to **minimum** then it is a positive number and vice versa. It&#39;s probably confusing but if you have a **total** of 30 but the **minimum** is 35, then **myvar** is -5. \r\n\r\nPutting if statements above the label will obviously only work the first time (when you start the program)\r\n\r\n```\r\nif total.get() &gt;= minimum.get():\r\n    Label(root, textvariable=myvar, fg=&quot;green&quot;)\r\nif total.get() &lt; minimum.get(): # or an else statement here\r\n    Label(root, textvariable=myvar, fg=&quot;red&quot;)\r\n```\r\nI&#39;ve also tried defining the label and running a function to configure the foreground color but I don&#39;t think I have the syntax quite right or I&#39;m skipping too many steps for this approach. I honestly don&#39;t feel I need something elaborate as I just want to update one thing.\r\n```\r\ntest_label.configure(foreground=&quot;green&quot;) #or test_label.config(fg=&quot;green&quot;)?\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now I&#39;m wondering if I can use a variable (similar to updating textvariable within a label) but I haven&#39;t been successful.\r\n```\r\nmy_fg = tk.StringVar()\r\nmy_fg.set(&quot;green&quot;) #otherwise the game won&#39;t open\r\n\r\nLabel(root, textvariable=myvar, fg=my_fg.get())\r\n\r\ndef change_fg():\r\n    if total.get() &gt;= minimum.get():\r\n        my_fg.set(&quot;green&quot;)\r\n    else:\r\n        my_fg.set(&quot;red&quot;)\r\n```\r\nThis last example doesn&#39;t return any errors but it doesn&#39;t work either. Does someone know the correct syntax/approach to this? Especially a straight-forward/simple way if possible.\r\n\r\nAnd just in case this information helps or matters, I use buttons to increase and decrease both the total and minimum variables and the change_fg() function in this example would actually just be part of the functions I already have for those buttons.

What is causing this behavior?\r\n\r\nEdit: here is an example readout, with the JSON object on the first line. \r\n\r\n```\r\n{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;testApp&quot;,&quot;hostname&quot;:&quot;chris-VirtualBox&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1872,&quot;level&quot;:50,&quot;err&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Dumb is not defined&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ReferenceError&quot;,&quot;stack&quot;:&quot;ReferenceError: Dumb is not defined\\n    at Promise.resolve.then.catch.then (/home/chris/bunyantest.js:27:14)\\n    at &lt;anonymous&gt;\\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:695:11)\\n    at startup (bootstrap_node.js:188:16)\\n    at bootstrap_node.js:609:3&quot;},&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;If this error happened... out-of-scope reference failed.&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2019-10-16T23:30:13.636Z&quot;,&quot;v&quot;:0}\r\n[2019-10-16T23:30:13.634Z]  INFO: testApp/1872 on chris-VirtualBox: Began Dumb object creation.\r\n[2019-10-16T23:30:13.636Z]  INFO: testApp/1872 on chris-VirtualBox: Tried to reference out-of-scope Dumb object.\r\n[2019-10-16T23:30:13.636Z] ERROR: testApp/1872 on chris-VirtualBox: If this error happened... out-of-scope reference failed.\r\n    ReferenceError: Dumb is not defined\r\n        at Promise.resolve.then.catch.then (/home/chris/bunyantest.js:27:14)\r\n        at &lt;anonymous&gt;\r\n        at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\r\n        at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:695:11)\r\n        at startup (bootstrap_node.js:188:16)\r\n        at bootstrap_node.js:609:3\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423183/correcting-bunyan-double-logging-of-error","title":"Correcting Bunyan double-logging of error"},{"tags":["harp.gl"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22303,"user_id":924299,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a142d1ec6b8444c9baf3ec6176e1cf61?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"showdev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/924299/showdev"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571276070,"post_id":58423180,"comment_id":103189477,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423180/how-to-draw-underground-layer-in-harp-gl-and-set-camera-to-it#comment103189477_58423180"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3586475,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab06caa6f5cc7d99634b4666da7d771a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3586475","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3586475/user3586475"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571271139,"creation_date":1571271139,"question_id":58423180,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423180","body_markdown":"How can we draw underground feature like pipeline and subway?

have a site where I need to update my UserProfileInfo model, which is how I am extending the User model.\r\nHowever, whenever I save the User model, the UserProfileInfo does not, meaning in the admin, the User model has the `first_name` and `last_name` variables filled out, however the `UserProfileInfo` does not.\r\n\r\nHere is some code.\r\n\r\n**MODELS.PY**\r\n```python\r\nclass UserProfileInfo(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE,max_length=30)\r\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n    description = models.TextField(max_length=150)\r\n    website = models.URLField(max_length=200,blank=True,null=True)\r\n    image = ProcessedImageField(upload_to=&#39;profile_pics&#39;,\r\n                                           processors=[ResizeToFill(150, 150)],\r\n

models.DateTimeField(blank=True,null=True,default=timezone.now)\r\n    verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n    moderator = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n    \r\n    tags = TaggableManager()\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return f&#39;{self.user.username} Profile&#39;\r\n\r\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\r\n\r\n@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\r\ndef create_or_update_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\r\n    if created:\r\n        UserProfileInfo.objects.create(user=instance)\r\n    else:\r\n        instance.userprofileinfo.save()\r\n```\r\nIn the receiver, I want to update both, but it is not.\r\n\r\n**FORMS.PY**\r\n```python\r\nclass UserProfileInfoForms(UserCreationForm):\r\n    email = forms.EmailField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta():\r\n        model = User\r\n        fields = [&#39;username&#39;,&#39;first_name&#39;,&#39;last_name&#39;,&#39;email&#39;]\r\n\r\nclass UserUpdateForm(forms.ModelForm):\r\n    email = forms.EmailField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        model = User\r\n        fields = [&#39;username&#39;,&#39;email&#39;]\r\n\r\nclass ProfileUpdateForm(forms.ModelForm):\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        model = UserProfileInfo\r\n        fields = [&#39;image&#39;,&#39;description&#39;,&#39;tags&#39;,&#39;website&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally here is the view\r\n\r\n**VIEWS.PY**\r\n```\r\n@login_required\r\ndef profile_update(request):\r\n    if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;:\r\n        u_form = UserUpdateForm(request.POST, instance=request.user)\r\n        p_form = ProfileUpdateForm(request.POST,\r\n                                   request.FILES,\r\n                                   instance=request.user.userprofileinfo)\r\n        if u_form.is_valid() and p_form.is_valid():\r\n            u_form.save()\r\n            p_form.save()\r\n            messages.success(request, f&#39;Your account has been updated!&#39;)\r\n            return redirect(&#39;mainapp:profile&#39;)\r\n\r\n    else:\r\n        u_form = UserUpdateForm(instance=request.user)\r\n        p_form = ProfileUpdateForm(instance=request.user.userprofileinfo)\r\n\r\n    context = {\r\n        &#39;u_form&#39;: u_form,\r\n        &#39;p_form&#39;: p_form\r\n    }\r\n    return render(request,&#39;mainapp/profile_update.html&#39;,context)\r\n```\r\nSo here, I&#39;m saving both the UserUpdateForm and ProfileUpdateForm\r\n\r\nAnd finally here are my signals\r\n\r\n**SIGNALS.PY**\r\n```python\r\n@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\r\ndef create_or_update_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\r\n    if created:\r\n        UserProfileInfo.objects.create(user=instance)\r\n    else:\r\n        instance.userprofileinfo.save()\r\n\r\n@receiver(post_save,sender=User)\r\ndef save_profile(sender,instance,**kwargs):\r\n    instance.userprofileinfo.save()\r\n```\r\nI have also included my `signals.py` in the apps.py file, so it is working. \r\n\r\nSo how can I make it so that the UserProfileInfo model is updated when the User model is updated? I am having trouble figuring this out, so any help would is appreciated","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423174/how-can-i-update-my-userprofile-model-when-the-user-model-is-updated-django","title":"How can I update my UserProfile model when the User model is updated Django"},{"tags":["node.js","file-upload","google-cloud-functions","youtube-dl"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":739,"user_id":11504909,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9mpmpGo21jU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reLuZGObxDJCoZRoX5Q6qzu_2ecxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chris32","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11504909/chris32"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298346,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103196027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103196027_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":561,"user_id":7725879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IWw6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sllopis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7725879/sllopis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298370,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103196041,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103196041_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":739,"user_id":11504909,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9mpmpGo21jU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reLuZGObxDJCoZRoX5Q6qzu_2ecxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chris32","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11504909/chris32"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298876,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103196301,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103196301_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":10178534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-StFnSraYnaU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cdotcvxTTwI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lydia halls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10178534/lydia-halls"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571356423,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103223598,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103223598_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":10178534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-StFnSraYnaU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cdotcvxTTwI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lydia halls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10178534/lydia-halls"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571358643,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103224124,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103224124_58423173"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":10178534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-StFnSraYnaU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cdotcvxTTwI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lydia halls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10178534/lydia-halls"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571355788,"post_id":58427805,"comment_id":103223455,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage/58427805#comment103223455_58427805"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":739,"user_id":11504909,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9mpmpGo21jU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reLuZGObxDJCoZRoX5Q6qzu_2ecxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chris32","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11504909/chris32"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571299706,"creation_date":1571299706,"answer_id":58427805,"question_id":58423173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58427805","body_markdown":"Upload from Youtube-dl it&#39;s not possible.

looking through the current answers and comments I think I understand what you are looking for.\r\n###Answer:\r\n*You can do this in Google Apps Script by creating a function that is bound to your Google Form which collects the latest response and does the data processing, and making it run on Form submission.*\r\n\r\n###Steps to take:\r\nFirstly, on your Form, you will need to create a bound script. From the menu in the top right of the Form edit page, click `⋮ &gt; Script editor`, which will open a new script page. \r\n\r\nFrom there you can make a script which will automatically do this for you, and make an Installable Trigger which runs when you need.\r\n\r\n###Code:\r\nAfter opening the Script Editor, you will see a ready-to-edit function that looks like this:\r\n```lang-js\r\nfunction myFunction() {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nReplace the entire script with the following code:\r\n```lang-js\r\nfunction onSubmit(e) {\r\n  var responses = FormApp.getActiveForm().getResponses();\r\n  var response = responses[responses.length - 1].getItemResponses();\r\n  var connectedSheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(&#39;&lt;your-sheet-id&gt;&#39;).getSheets();\r\n  var sheet2 = connectedSheet[1];  \r\n  var result2Column = sheet2.getRange(&#39;A1:A&#39;).getValues();\r\n  \r\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; result2Column.length; i++) {\r\n    if (response[1] == result2Column[0]) {\r\n      sheet2.getRange(&#39;B&#39; + (i +1)).setValue(response[0]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMake sure to replace `&lt;your-sheet-id&gt;` with the unique ID of your Google Sheeet - you can find this in the URL of the sheet between the `d/` and `/edit` like so:\r\n```\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/&lt;your-sheet-id&gt;/edit\r\n```\r\nRun the script by pressing the play button (►) and authorise the application to run.\r\n\r\nThen go to `Edit -&gt; Current Project&#39;s Triggers` and set up a new installable trigger with the following settings:\r\n\r\n - Choose which function to run: `onSubmit`\r\n - Choose which deployment should run: `Head`\r\n - Select event source: `From form`\r\n - Select event type `On form submit`\r\n\r\n###Explanation:\r\nThis script will run each time a new form submission is made automatically - it will take the ID from the form response and search Sheet2 for it. If it&#39;s found, then the response given for result will be put in Sheet2 also, next to the corresponding ID.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you!\r\n\r\n###References:\r\n - [Google Apps Script Installable Triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423161/fill-cell-based-on-another-sheets-value/58428671#58428671","title":"Fill cell based on another sheets value"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10993013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23fd2fa061ea83bced827a743b521b01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Luiz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10993013/luiz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25645,"user_id":5632629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pfxka.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"player0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5632629/player0"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58428671,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571302590,"creation_date":1571270939,"last_edit_date":1571275644,"question_id":58423161,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423161","body_markdown":"I have a spreadsheet on Google sheets with 2 sheets, `Sheet1` and `Sheet2`.

Specifically, the discussion was in context to a numeric up/down user control built from scratch. It consists of a Label for a title, a TextBox for the value, a Label for the units and 2 buttons for the up/down action. The ultimate goal is to bind to the properties exposed by this user control from screen view models.\r\n\r\nThe TextBox xaml declaration for the user control is as follows:\r\n\r\n    &lt;TextBox x:Name=&quot;Textbox&quot; Text=&quot;{Binding TextboxValue, FallbackValue=0}&quot; Width=&quot;100&quot; Height=&quot;40&quot; TextAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; FontSize=&quot;28&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;  BorderBrush=&quot;Black&quot; BorderThickness=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nThe TextBoxes Text property is bound to the code-behind for the user controls view. Snippets of the relevant parts of the code-behind are shown below.\r\n\r\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty TextboxValueProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(&quot;TextboxValue&quot;,\r\n             typeof(double), typeof(IncrementDecrementTextbox), new PropertyMetadata(12.0d, new PropertyChangedCallback(OnTextboxValueChanged)));\r\n\r\n    public IncrementDecrementTextbox()\r\n    {\r\n        InitializeComponent();\r\n        this.DataContext = this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public double TextboxValue\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            return (double)GetValue(TextboxValueProperty);\r\n        }\r\n        set\r\n        {\r\n            SetValue(TextboxValueProperty, value);\r\n            NotifyTextboxValueUpdated();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void OnTextboxValueChanged(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        IncrementDecrementTextbox control = d as IncrementDecrementTextbox;\r\n        control.OnTextboxValueChanged(e);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void OnTextboxValueChanged(DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        TextboxValue = Convert.ToDouble(e.NewValue);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public event EventHandler TextboxValueUpdated;\r\n    \r\n    private void NotifyTextboxValueUpdated()\r\n    {\r\n        TextboxValueUpdated?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this user control is confusing to me. I don&#39;t understand why data binding is being used between the view &amp; it&#39;s code-behind part. I would think that since the code-behind and the corresonding xaml view are essentially one in the same, that one would want to access elements declared in xaml directly from the code behind by setting the x:Name property of the element.

Skip to &quot;Update 2&quot; for most relevant question details.\r\n\r\nHave dag file that imports a python list of dicts from another python file in another location and creates a dag based on the list&#39;s dict values and airflow is having weird problem where it appear to see something different that when I run the dag file manually. Some snippet like...\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nenviron[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;] = &quot;/path/to/some/project/files&quot;\r\n# import certain project files\r\nsys.path.append(environ[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;])\r\nimport tables as tt\r\n\r\ntables = tt.tables\r\n\r\nfor table in tables:\r\n    print table\r\n    assert isinstance(table, dict)\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 1&gt;\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 2&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running the py file manually from the `~/airflow/dag/` dir, there are no errors thrown and the for loop prints the dicts, but airflow apparently sees things differently in the webserver and when running `airflow list_dags`. Running `airflow list_dags` I get the error\r\n```bash\r\n    assert isinstance(table, dict)\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\nand don&#39;t know how to test what is causing this, since again when running the py file manually from the dag location, there is no problem and the print statement shows dicts and the webserver UI shows no further error message.\r\n\r\nAnyone know what could be going on here? Maybe something about how the imports are working?\r\n\r\n\\* **Update 1**:\r\n\r\nSeeing more weirdness in that when calling functions from the imported python module, everything runs fine when running the dag file manually, but `airflow list_dags` says...\r\n\r\n&gt; AttributeError: &#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;my_func&#39;\r\n\r\nmaking me even further suspect some import weirdness, even though this is the exact same process I am using in another dag file (ie. setting some `environ` values and appending to `sys.path`) to import modules for that dag and have no problems there.\r\n\r\n\\* **Update 2**:\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be (after printing various `sys.path`, `environ`, and `module.__all__` info at the erroring assert) that **a similarly-named module that is getting imported is from the another project** I did this same exact procedure for. Ie. have another file that does...\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nenviron[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;] = &quot;/path/to/some/project/files&quot;\r\n# import certain project files\r\nsys.path.append(environ[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;])\r\nimport tables as tt\r\n\r\ntables = tt.tables\r\n\r\nfor table in tables:\r\n    print table\r\n    assert isinstance(table, dict)\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 1&gt;\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 2&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nand this project home is getting used instead to download a similarly named module that also has a obj named what I was expecting (even when I insert the projects folder at front of `sys.path`). Other than making [packaged dags][1] is there a way to keep airflow from combining all of the `environ` and `sys.path` values of different dags (since I use $PROJECT_HOME in various bash and python task scripts)?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html?highlight=zip#packaged-dags","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423137/use-separate-environ-and-sys-path-between-dags","title":"Use separate environ and sys.path between dags"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas-groupby"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":502,"user_id":5828160,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f1bce66871c9b17ac7d152e59e8f3a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rajith Thennakoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5828160/rajith-thennakoon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":502,"user_id":5828160,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f1bce66871c9b17ac7d152e59e8f3a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rajith Thennakoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5828160/rajith-thennakoon"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571273243,"last_edit_date":1571273243,"creation_date":1571272848,"answer_id":58423372,"question_id":58423136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58423372","body_markdown":"I think,what you need is `groupby` `u_id` and keep the `min` year\r\n\r\n    df[&quot;year&quot;] = pd.to_numeric(df[&quot;year&quot;])\r\n    newdf = df.loc[df.groupby([&#39;u_id&#39;])[&#39;year&#39;].idxmin()].reset_index(drop=True)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423136/pandas-how-do-you-grouby-multiple-columns-and-get-the-lowest-value/58423372#58423372","title":"Pandas - How do you grouby multiple columns and get the lowest value?"}],"owner":{"reputation":830,"user_id":4150078,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VvMca.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sharp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4150078/sharp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58423372,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571273243,"creation_date":1571270676,"question_id":58423136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423136","body_markdown":"I have data frame with  75+ number of columns.

The data stream is supposed to be generated on the host systems and will be provided to the guest system in a form of generic video input device.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is a way to delay the guest execution until the next chunk of data is ready to be read from the video device and then resume the guest execution until its next read request. It seems to be possible because Qemu supports execution pause/resume, but if I do this will it impose any performance penalties? Like every pause/resume takes 10ms, so doing 100 of pause/resume calls in a second delays the guest execution by extra second?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423122/generate-real-time-data-stream-on-a-guest-system-that-takes-longer-than-real-tim","title":"Generate real-time data stream on a guest system that takes longer than real-time on the host system"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571270993,"post_id":58423120,"comment_id":103188512,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423120/swapping-two-nested-dicts#comment103188512_58423120"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5032382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d877fe36b819ad04f31c342b874939e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"noob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5032382/noob"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571354016,"post_id":58423120,"comment_id":103223129,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423120/swapping-two-nested-dicts#comment103223129_58423120"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5032382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d877fe36b819ad04f31c342b874939e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"noob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5032382/noob"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5032382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d877fe36b819ad04f31c342b874939e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"noob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5032382/noob"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571271460,"creation_date":1571270497,"last_edit_date":1571271460,"question_id":58423120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423120","body_markdown":"I am trying to swap nodes between two binary trees, which are represented as nested dicts. I have tried to accomplish this by using a function that takes in a dict and list of keys, performs a deep get on it, and returns the nested dict. e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef deep_get(dictionary, keys, default=None):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot; By Yuda Prawira\r\n    Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25833613/python-safe-method-to-get-value-of-nested-dictionary&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    return reduce(lambda d, key: d.get(key, default) if isinstance(d, dict) else default, keys.split(&quot;.&quot;), dictionary)\r\n```\r\nHowever whenever I assign it to a variable and try to do a basic swap, the original dict is unchanged:\r\n\r\n```python\r\na = deep_get(tree1, &quot;left.right.left&quot;)\r\nb = deep_get(tree2, &quot;left.right&quot;)\r\nc = a.copy()\r\na.clear()\r\na.update(b)\r\nb.clear()\r\nb.update(c)\r\n```\r\nIs there a simpler way of accomplishing this, or will I have to create a tree class that wraps around the dict?\r\n\r\nsample input:\r\n```python\r\ntree1 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 5, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 1}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;cos&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 3}}\r\ntree2 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 2}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;tan&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 4}}\r\n```\r\nFirst, I choose randomly a node from tree1 and tree2 to swap. Suppose I want to swap the first level left branch of tree1 with the second level right branch of tree2. Then the trees after swap should be like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntree1 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 4}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;cos&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 3}}\r\ntree2 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 2}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;tan&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 5, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 1}}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423120/swapping-two-nested-dicts","title":"Swapping two nested dicts"},{"tags":["asynchronous","async-await","fetch","insertadjacenthtml"],"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":11996130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/659ec7986db1b12de34416282ac2cc62?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11996130/bob"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571270473,"creation_date":1571270473,"question_id":58423118,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423118","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a link to my JS fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/apasric4/u4y6t9jw/2/\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my JS; \r\n\r\n    const url=&#39;https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10&#39;;\r\n    const button=document.querySelector(&#39;button&#39;);\r\n    const output=document.querySelector(&#39;.output&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    async function search(url) {\r\n      const response=await fetch(url);\r\n      const myJSON= await response.json();\r\n      const {results}=myJSON;\r\n      const html=results.map(person=&gt; \r\n        `&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;img src=${person.picture.medium}&gt;\r\n          &lt;span&gt;${person.name.first}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n        `\r\n      );\r\n      return html;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    button.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, ()=&gt; {\r\n      search(url).then(html=&gt; output.insertAdjacentHTML(&#39;afterbegin&#39;, html));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nIf you click the search button, you can see that each appended HTML element is getting smaller and smaller.

In Django Admin either disable the other field when one is selected or at least provide a meaningful error message if both or none are set and the admin tries to save it?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423084/only-allow-filling-one-field-or-the-other-in-django-model-and-admin","title":"Only allow filling one field or the other in Django model and admin"},{"tags":["angular","ngx-bootstrap"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12229489,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a52ffabf1432a36a9510043670354edc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Armandoth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12229489/armandoth"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571270189,"creation_date":1571270189,"question_id":58423082,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423082","body_markdown":"[Screenshot][1]\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not being able to center the image on my carousel, using Angular 8 and ngx-bootstrap.

At least for me, I put a `Console.WriteLine(&quot;foo&quot;)` after the method that should fatal, and it printed &quot;foo&quot;.

This gets a bit annoying and I&#39;m trying to improve my setup. \r\n\r\nI tried adding a new script to my `package.json` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;proj-start&quot;: &quot;nodemon backend/proj-api.js; nodemon backend/proj-scrape.js; react-scripts start&quot;\r\n```\r\nWhen I run this though, there are a few issues:\r\n\r\na) it doesn&#39;t actually run the exact command I&#39;ve scripted. It runs this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[nodemon] starting `react-scripts start backend/proj-api.js; nodemon backend/proj-scrape.js; react-scripts start`\r\n```\r\nSo it seems to add an additional `react-scripts start` at the beginning for some reason.\r\n\r\nb) It doesn&#39;t run the API. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s due to the added `react-scripts start` that&#39;s breaking my first scripted command.\r\n\r\nc) Every time I save one of my backend files, it restarts the entire script rather than just the specific node application like Nodemon typically does.\r\n\r\nIs what I&#39;m attempting to accomplish not actually possible, or am I approaching it incorrectly?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423267/starting-react-and-nodemon-backend-in-one-npm-script","title":"Starting React and Nodemon backend in one NPM

this task took me longer than expected to tackle and finally I come up with a solution with the help of a couple **helper columns** (not sure if it is an option?).\r\n\r\nSo suppose your have the following **named ranges**:\r\n\r\n - **TblA_Date** being all the dates in your `Table A` (This one is optional as I did not use it in my solution...);\r\n - **TblB_Date** being all the dates in your `Table B`.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I *&quot;expanded&quot;* your `Table B` to a list structure laying out all the dates:\r\n\r\n[![Expand Table B][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe formula for the first helper column in Cell `J2` of my example is:\r\n\r\n    =SUM($I$2:I2)\r\n\r\n&gt;which is to find the running total of the counts in `Table B`.\r\n\r\nThe formula for the second helper column in Cell `M2` is:\r\n\r\n    =INDEX(TblB_Date,MATCH(1,--(ROW(A1)&lt;=$J$2:$J$8),0))\r\n\r\n&gt;which is &quot;laying&quot; out all the dates from `Table B` using row position as a reference and comparing it with the running total of counts and returning the corresponding date. Given that it is an **array formula** you **MUST** press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; upon finishing the formula in the formula bar otherwise it will not function correctly. Then you can simply drag the formula down to apply across.\r\n\r\n&gt;Please note I have given the second helper column `M2:M18` (excluding `M19` which is an error) a name **TblB_Date_Expanded**.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to find the position of the desired date in **TblB_Date_Expanded** based on your conditions which are \r\n\r\n 1. *&quot;for every date in table A, the result date is either same date or the next higher date&quot;* **AND** \r\n 2. *the date from `Table B` can only be used no more than its corresponding count*.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Index Column][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe formula in cell `E2` is:\r\n\r\n    =MAX(MATCH(AGGREGATE(15,6,TblB_Date_Expanded/(A2&lt;=TblB_Date_Expanded),1),TblB_Date_Expanded,0),E1+1)\r\n\r\nwhere `A2` is the first date in `Table A` as you will see in my next screenshot.\r\n\r\n&gt;The logic is to use **AGGREGATE** function to return the closest starting date in `TblB_Date_Expanded` base on the given date in `Table A`, then use **MATCH** function to return the row position, and lastly use **MAX** function to increase the position by `1` if the same position has been used already (in the row above).\r\n\r\nWith known row position, we can easily return the corresponding date from `TblB_Date_Expanded` using the following formula:\r\n\r\n    =INDEX(TblB_Date_Expanded,E2)\r\n\r\n[![Result][3]][3]\r\n\r\n&gt;**Thoughts**, the difficult part that I cannot overcome is the use of &quot;circular reference&quot; or &quot;self-reference&quot; in the helper columns. In other words, I am not sure how to use a single formula to return an array of values whose calculation is depending on its precedent value. I hope someone may come up a more elegant way of solving this question :)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

I have no idea how to write this lab.\r\n\r\n&gt; In many computer games, we have a world filled with items that the\r\n&gt; game characters can pick up and use. Some items can be food, some\r\n&gt; items can be weapons, and so on. There can be hundreds of different\r\n&gt; items, and we want to avoid having to write giant if statements\r\n&gt; listing all the possible items.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; First, get the Person.java file with this lab. You can see that\r\n&gt; currently a person has strength, intelligence, and energy.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Now, let&#39;s create items that the person can pickup and carry. For now,\r\n&gt; we want the following six items:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; * Apple\r\n&gt; * Sword\r\n&gt; * Hammer\r\n&gt; * Steak\r\n&gt; * Bread\r\n&gt; * Statue\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; We want each item to have a weight and a name associated with it. We\r\n&gt; want a person to be able to pick up an item as long as it is not too\r\n&gt; heavy. To help us, let&#39;s create an abstract class that collects all of\r\n&gt; these properties into a single place.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I will start out by showing you one way to do that. Here is such an\r\n&gt; abstract class. Add this class to your code. Notice that it states\r\n&gt; that all items have weights and names. It also defines a toString\r\n&gt; method for the item. Initially the toString just uses the name of the\r\n&gt; item. The reason these are separate methods is so that later on we can\r\n&gt; have toString methods that can adjust to game situations.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     public abstract class GameItem {\r\n&gt;       private double weight;\r\n&gt;       private String name;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       public GameItem(String name, double weight) {\r\n&gt;         this.name = name;\r\n&gt;         this.weight = weight;\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       public double getWeight() {\r\n&gt;         return weight;\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       public String getName() {\r\n&gt;         return name;\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;       @Override\r\n&gt;       public String toString() {\r\n&gt;         return getName();\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Now that we have this class, defining each of the items is easy. Here is the class for Apples. An apple does not weigh very much so I give it a very light weight.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     public class Apple extends GameItem {\r\n&gt;       public Apple() {\r\n&gt;         super(&quot;Apple&quot;, 0.25);\r\n&gt;       }\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Create a class for each of the six objects. Then add two new methods to Person:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; public boolean pickup(GameItem o)\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; If the item weighs less than the\r\n&gt; strength of the person, return true and set a field indicating that\r\n&gt; the person is carrying this object.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; GameItem drop()\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Change the field so that the person is no longer\r\n&gt; carrying an object and return the object that was dropped. Return null\r\n&gt; if the person was not carrying anything. To make things easy, right\r\n&gt; now we will assume a person can carry only one item at a time. Compile\r\n&gt; and test your code. Make sure some items (like the statue) are too\r\n&gt; heavy to pickup.     \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     /** A person in a game */\r\n&gt;      public class Person {\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;       // the strength of the person\r\n&gt;      private int strength;\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;     // the energy level of the person, it starts at a default value\r\n&gt;     private int energy = 10;\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;     // the intelligence of the person\r\n&gt;     private int intelligence;\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;     /** Create a person with the given strength and intelligence */\r\n&gt;     public Person(int strength, int intelligence) {\r\n&gt;       this.strength = strength;\r\n&gt;       this.intelligence = intelligence;\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Returns the strength of the person */\r\n&gt;      public int getStrength() {\r\n&gt;        return strength;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Changes the strength of the person */\r\n&gt;      public void setStrength(int strength) {\r\n&gt;        this.strength = strength;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Returns the energy of the person */\r\n&gt;      public int getEnergy() {\r\n&gt;        return energy;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Increases or decreases the energy of the person by amount */\r\n&gt;      public void adjustEnergy(int amount) {\r\n&gt;        this.energy = this.energy + amount;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Returns the intelligence of the person */\r\n&gt;      public int getIntelligence() {\r\n&gt;        return intelligence;\r\n&gt;      }\r\n&gt;   \r\n&gt;      /** Changes the intelligence of the person */\r\n&gt;      public void setIntelligence(int intelligence) {\r\n&gt;        this.intelligence = intelligence;\r\n&gt;      }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423237/how-to-create-six-objects-and-two-methods","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"How to create six objects and two methods?"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","express"],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":9183058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2430669ba6fdd88b4ec134b23ce2bef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Buckyx55","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9183058/buckyx55"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571271626,"creation_date":1571271626,"question_id":58423235,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423235","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to safeguard my application as best I can, and I&#39;ve been told by others that I should store images on a separate cloud server (like GCP&#39;s Bucket), but I&#39;m not sure what else I need to do regarding document uploads.

set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how I intend to use it:\r\n\r\n    async Task DoWorkAsync(Out&lt;int&gt; arg)\r\n    {\r\n        arg.Value = 13;\r\n        await Task.Delay(500); // Placeholder for a really useful async operation\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `Value` will always be assigned before the first `await` inside the asynchronous method. In other words the assignment will happen in the synchronous part of the method. So the caller can retrieve the value immediately after creating the `Task`, and use it before the awaiting of the `Task`:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = DoWorkAsync(arg);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;13&#39; in the console :-)\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nUntil this point everything works perfectly. The problem appears when it becomes mandatory for the `DoWorkAsync` method to run in a thread-pool thread. Initially I tried the simplest approach with [`Task.Run`][1]:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = Task.Run(() =&gt; DoAsync(arg));\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;0&#39; in the console :-(\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nThis didn&#39;t work. Another try:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = Task.Run(async () =&gt; await DoWorkAsync(arg));\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;0&#39; in the console :-(\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nDidn&#39;t work either. After much thought I realized that the current thread cannot retrieve the `arg.Value` until the thread-pool thread has processed the synchronous part of the method, so the current thread must wait. Then, after retrieving the `arg.Value`, the current thread must wait one more time for the asynchronous part of the method. This led me to a solution of the problem:\r\n\r\n    var arg = new Out&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    var task = await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; DoWorkAsync(arg),\r\n        CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach,\r\n        TaskScheduler.Default);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(arg.Value); // Prints &#39;13&#39; in the console :-/\r\n    await task;\r\n\r\nThis worked, but I dislike the use of [`Task.Factory.StartNew`][2]. This is an old-school method, with a bad reputation of [being dangerous][3]. So my question is: Is it possible to solve this problem, without using the `Task.Factory.StartNew` method?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.run\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskfactory.startnew\r\n  [3]: https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/08/startnew-is-dangerous.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423221/how-to-retrieve-the-out-parameter-of-an-asynchronous-method-that-runs-on-another","title":"How to retrieve the out parameter of an asynchronous method that runs on another thread"},{"tags":["python","tkinter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571274018,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103189100,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103189100_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571277850,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103189839,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103189839_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571278862,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190046_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571279509,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190163,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190163_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571280770,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190383,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190383_58423220"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8227,"user_id":1709364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40e026958109464eb03fd70b67fab155?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jasonharper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709364/jasonharper"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571281700,"post_id":58423220,"comment_id":103190558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423220/update-label-foreground-color-with-a-variable-in-real-time#comment103190558_58423220"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9211606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1940926449568663/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211606/ali"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571271515,"creation_date":1571271515,"question_id":58423220,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423220","body_markdown":"I&#39;m not having much luck researching this particular task. I&#39;d like to update the foreground color of a text based on whether a number is negative or positive. If the number is negative, it displays in red text. If it&#39;s positive, it displays in green.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m checking for whether it&#39;s negative or not by comparing two variables. If **total** is greater than or equal to **minimum** then it is a positive number and vice versa. It&#39;s probably confusing but if you have a **total** of 30 but the **minimum** is 35, then **myvar** is -5. \r\n\r\nPutting if statements above the label will obviously only work the first time (when you start the program)\r\n\r\n```\r\nif total.get() &gt;= minimum.get():\r\n    Label(root, textvariable=myvar, fg=&quot;green&quot;)\r\nif total.get() &lt; minimum.get(): # or an else statement here\r\n    Label(root, textvariable=myvar, fg=&quot;red&quot;)\r\n```\r\nI&#39;ve also tried defining the label and running a function to configure the foreground color but I don&#39;t think I have the syntax quite right or I&#39;m skipping too many steps for this approach. I honestly don&#39;t feel I need something elaborate as I just want to update one thing.\r\n```\r\ntest_label.configure(foreground=&quot;green&quot;) #or test_label.config(fg=&quot;green&quot;)?\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now I&#39;m wondering if I can use a variable (similar to updating textvariable within a label) but I haven&#39;t been successful.\r\n```\r\nmy_fg = tk.StringVar()\r\nmy_fg.set(&quot;green&quot;) #otherwise the game won&#39;t open\r\n\r\nLabel(root, textvariable=myvar, fg=my_fg.get())\r\n\r\ndef change_fg():\r\n    if total.get() &gt;= minimum.get():\r\n        my_fg.set(&quot;green&quot;)\r\n    else:\r\n        my_fg.set(&quot;red&quot;)\r\n```\r\nThis last example doesn&#39;t return any errors but it doesn&#39;t work either. Does someone know the correct syntax/approach to this? Especially a straight-forward/simple way if possible.\r\n\r\nAnd just in case this information helps or matters, I use buttons to increase and decrease both the total and minimum variables and the change_fg() function in this example would actually just be part of the functions I already have for those buttons.

What is causing this behavior?\r\n\r\nEdit: here is an example readout, with the JSON object on the first line. \r\n\r\n```\r\n{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;testApp&quot;,&quot;hostname&quot;:&quot;chris-VirtualBox&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1872,&quot;level&quot;:50,&quot;err&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Dumb is not defined&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ReferenceError&quot;,&quot;stack&quot;:&quot;ReferenceError: Dumb is not defined\\n    at Promise.resolve.then.catch.then (/home/chris/bunyantest.js:27:14)\\n    at &lt;anonymous&gt;\\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:695:11)\\n    at startup (bootstrap_node.js:188:16)\\n    at bootstrap_node.js:609:3&quot;},&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;If this error happened... out-of-scope reference failed.&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2019-10-16T23:30:13.636Z&quot;,&quot;v&quot;:0}\r\n[2019-10-16T23:30:13.634Z]  INFO: testApp/1872 on chris-VirtualBox: Began Dumb object creation.\r\n[2019-10-16T23:30:13.636Z]  INFO: testApp/1872 on chris-VirtualBox: Tried to reference out-of-scope Dumb object.\r\n[2019-10-16T23:30:13.636Z] ERROR: testApp/1872 on chris-VirtualBox: If this error happened... out-of-scope reference failed.\r\n    ReferenceError: Dumb is not defined\r\n        at Promise.resolve.then.catch.then (/home/chris/bunyantest.js:27:14)\r\n        at &lt;anonymous&gt;\r\n        at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\r\n        at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:695:11)\r\n        at startup (bootstrap_node.js:188:16)\r\n        at bootstrap_node.js:609:3\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423183/correcting-bunyan-double-logging-of-error","title":"Correcting Bunyan double-logging of error"},{"tags":["harp.gl"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22303,"user_id":924299,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a142d1ec6b8444c9baf3ec6176e1cf61?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"showdev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/924299/showdev"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571276070,"post_id":58423180,"comment_id":103189477,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423180/how-to-draw-underground-layer-in-harp-gl-and-set-camera-to-it#comment103189477_58423180"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3586475,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab06caa6f5cc7d99634b4666da7d771a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3586475","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3586475/user3586475"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571271139,"creation_date":1571271139,"question_id":58423180,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423180","body_markdown":"How can we draw underground feature like pipeline and subway?

have a site where I need to update my UserProfileInfo model, which is how I am extending the User model.\r\nHowever, whenever I save the User model, the UserProfileInfo does not, meaning in the admin, the User model has the `first_name` and `last_name` variables filled out, however the `UserProfileInfo` does not.\r\n\r\nHere is some code.\r\n\r\n**MODELS.PY**\r\n```python\r\nclass UserProfileInfo(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE,max_length=30)\r\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n    description = models.TextField(max_length=150)\r\n    website = models.URLField(max_length=200,blank=True,null=True)\r\n    image = ProcessedImageField(upload_to=&#39;profile_pics&#39;,\r\n                                           processors=[ResizeToFill(150, 150)],\r\n

models.DateTimeField(blank=True,null=True,default=timezone.now)\r\n    verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n    moderator = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n    \r\n    tags = TaggableManager()\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return f&#39;{self.user.username} Profile&#39;\r\n\r\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\r\n\r\n@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\r\ndef create_or_update_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\r\n    if created:\r\n        UserProfileInfo.objects.create(user=instance)\r\n    else:\r\n        instance.userprofileinfo.save()\r\n```\r\nIn the receiver, I want to update both, but it is not.\r\n\r\n**FORMS.PY**\r\n```python\r\nclass UserProfileInfoForms(UserCreationForm):\r\n    email = forms.EmailField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta():\r\n        model = User\r\n        fields = [&#39;username&#39;,&#39;first_name&#39;,&#39;last_name&#39;,&#39;email&#39;]\r\n\r\nclass UserUpdateForm(forms.ModelForm):\r\n    email = forms.EmailField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        model = User\r\n        fields = [&#39;username&#39;,&#39;email&#39;]\r\n\r\nclass ProfileUpdateForm(forms.ModelForm):\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        model = UserProfileInfo\r\n        fields = [&#39;image&#39;,&#39;description&#39;,&#39;tags&#39;,&#39;website&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally here is the view\r\n\r\n**VIEWS.PY**\r\n```\r\n@login_required\r\ndef profile_update(request):\r\n    if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;:\r\n        u_form = UserUpdateForm(request.POST, instance=request.user)\r\n        p_form = ProfileUpdateForm(request.POST,\r\n                                   request.FILES,\r\n                                   instance=request.user.userprofileinfo)\r\n        if u_form.is_valid() and p_form.is_valid():\r\n            u_form.save()\r\n            p_form.save()\r\n            messages.success(request, f&#39;Your account has been updated!&#39;)\r\n            return redirect(&#39;mainapp:profile&#39;)\r\n\r\n    else:\r\n        u_form = UserUpdateForm(instance=request.user)\r\n        p_form = ProfileUpdateForm(instance=request.user.userprofileinfo)\r\n\r\n    context = {\r\n        &#39;u_form&#39;: u_form,\r\n        &#39;p_form&#39;: p_form\r\n    }\r\n    return render(request,&#39;mainapp/profile_update.html&#39;,context)\r\n```\r\nSo here, I&#39;m saving both the UserUpdateForm and ProfileUpdateForm\r\n\r\nAnd finally here are my signals\r\n\r\n**SIGNALS.PY**\r\n```python\r\n@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\r\ndef create_or_update_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\r\n    if created:\r\n        UserProfileInfo.objects.create(user=instance)\r\n    else:\r\n        instance.userprofileinfo.save()\r\n\r\n@receiver(post_save,sender=User)\r\ndef save_profile(sender,instance,**kwargs):\r\n    instance.userprofileinfo.save()\r\n```\r\nI have also included my `signals.py` in the apps.py file, so it is working. \r\n\r\nSo how can I make it so that the UserProfileInfo model is updated when the User model is updated? I am having trouble figuring this out, so any help would is appreciated","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423174/how-can-i-update-my-userprofile-model-when-the-user-model-is-updated-django","title":"How can I update my UserProfile model when the User model is updated Django"},{"tags":["node.js","file-upload","google-cloud-functions","youtube-dl"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":739,"user_id":11504909,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9mpmpGo21jU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reLuZGObxDJCoZRoX5Q6qzu_2ecxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chris32","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11504909/chris32"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298346,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103196027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103196027_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":561,"user_id":7725879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IWw6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sllopis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7725879/sllopis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298370,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103196041,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103196041_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":739,"user_id":11504909,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9mpmpGo21jU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reLuZGObxDJCoZRoX5Q6qzu_2ecxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chris32","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11504909/chris32"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298876,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103196301,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103196301_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":10178534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-StFnSraYnaU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cdotcvxTTwI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lydia halls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10178534/lydia-halls"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571356423,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103223598,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103223598_58423173"},{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":10178534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-StFnSraYnaU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cdotcvxTTwI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lydia halls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10178534/lydia-halls"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571358643,"post_id":58423173,"comment_id":103224124,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage#comment103224124_58423173"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":10178534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-StFnSraYnaU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cdotcvxTTwI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Lydia halls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10178534/lydia-halls"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571355788,"post_id":58427805,"comment_id":103223455,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423173/upload-youtube-dl-transcript-into-google-cloud-storage/58427805#comment103223455_58427805"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":739,"user_id":11504909,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9mpmpGo21jU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reLuZGObxDJCoZRoX5Q6qzu_2ecxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chris32","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11504909/chris32"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571299706,"creation_date":1571299706,"answer_id":58427805,"question_id":58423173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58427805","body_markdown":"Upload from Youtube-dl it&#39;s not possible.

looking through the current answers and comments I think I understand what you are looking for.\r\n###Answer:\r\n*You can do this in Google Apps Script by creating a function that is bound to your Google Form which collects the latest response and does the data processing, and making it run on Form submission.*\r\n\r\n###Steps to take:\r\nFirstly, on your Form, you will need to create a bound script. From the menu in the top right of the Form edit page, click `⋮ &gt; Script editor`, which will open a new script page. \r\n\r\nFrom there you can make a script which will automatically do this for you, and make an Installable Trigger which runs when you need.\r\n\r\n###Code:\r\nAfter opening the Script Editor, you will see a ready-to-edit function that looks like this:\r\n```lang-js\r\nfunction myFunction() {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nReplace the entire script with the following code:\r\n```lang-js\r\nfunction onSubmit(e) {\r\n  var responses = FormApp.getActiveForm().getResponses();\r\n  var response = responses[responses.length - 1].getItemResponses();\r\n  var connectedSheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(&#39;&lt;your-sheet-id&gt;&#39;).getSheets();\r\n  var sheet2 = connectedSheet[1];  \r\n  var result2Column = sheet2.getRange(&#39;A1:A&#39;).getValues();\r\n  \r\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; result2Column.length; i++) {\r\n    if (response[1] == result2Column[0]) {\r\n      sheet2.getRange(&#39;B&#39; + (i +1)).setValue(response[0]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMake sure to replace `&lt;your-sheet-id&gt;` with the unique ID of your Google Sheeet - you can find this in the URL of the sheet between the `d/` and `/edit` like so:\r\n```\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/&lt;your-sheet-id&gt;/edit\r\n```\r\nRun the script by pressing the play button (►) and authorise the application to run.\r\n\r\nThen go to `Edit -&gt; Current Project&#39;s Triggers` and set up a new installable trigger with the following settings:\r\n\r\n - Choose which function to run: `onSubmit`\r\n - Choose which deployment should run: `Head`\r\n - Select event source: `From form`\r\n - Select event type `On form submit`\r\n\r\n###Explanation:\r\nThis script will run each time a new form submission is made automatically - it will take the ID from the form response and search Sheet2 for it. If it&#39;s found, then the response given for result will be put in Sheet2 also, next to the corresponding ID.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you!\r\n\r\n###References:\r\n - [Google Apps Script Installable Triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423161/fill-cell-based-on-another-sheets-value/58428671#58428671","title":"Fill cell based on another sheets value"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10993013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23fd2fa061ea83bced827a743b521b01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Luiz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10993013/luiz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25645,"user_id":5632629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pfxka.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"player0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5632629/player0"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58428671,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571302590,"creation_date":1571270939,"last_edit_date":1571275644,"question_id":58423161,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423161","body_markdown":"I have a spreadsheet on Google sheets with 2 sheets, `Sheet1` and `Sheet2`.

Specifically, the discussion was in context to a numeric up/down user control built from scratch. It consists of a Label for a title, a TextBox for the value, a Label for the units and 2 buttons for the up/down action. The ultimate goal is to bind to the properties exposed by this user control from screen view models.\r\n\r\nThe TextBox xaml declaration for the user control is as follows:\r\n\r\n    &lt;TextBox x:Name=&quot;Textbox&quot; Text=&quot;{Binding TextboxValue, FallbackValue=0}&quot; Width=&quot;100&quot; Height=&quot;40&quot; TextAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; FontSize=&quot;28&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;  BorderBrush=&quot;Black&quot; BorderThickness=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nThe TextBoxes Text property is bound to the code-behind for the user controls view. Snippets of the relevant parts of the code-behind are shown below.\r\n\r\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty TextboxValueProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(&quot;TextboxValue&quot;,\r\n             typeof(double), typeof(IncrementDecrementTextbox), new PropertyMetadata(12.0d, new PropertyChangedCallback(OnTextboxValueChanged)));\r\n\r\n    public IncrementDecrementTextbox()\r\n    {\r\n        InitializeComponent();\r\n        this.DataContext = this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public double TextboxValue\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            return (double)GetValue(TextboxValueProperty);\r\n        }\r\n        set\r\n        {\r\n            SetValue(TextboxValueProperty, value);\r\n            NotifyTextboxValueUpdated();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void OnTextboxValueChanged(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        IncrementDecrementTextbox control = d as IncrementDecrementTextbox;\r\n        control.OnTextboxValueChanged(e);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void OnTextboxValueChanged(DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        TextboxValue = Convert.ToDouble(e.NewValue);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public event EventHandler TextboxValueUpdated;\r\n    \r\n    private void NotifyTextboxValueUpdated()\r\n    {\r\n        TextboxValueUpdated?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this user control is confusing to me. I don&#39;t understand why data binding is being used between the view &amp; it&#39;s code-behind part. I would think that since the code-behind and the corresonding xaml view are essentially one in the same, that one would want to access elements declared in xaml directly from the code behind by setting the x:Name property of the element.

Skip to &quot;Update 2&quot; for most relevant question details.\r\n\r\nHave dag file that imports a python list of dicts from another python file in another location and creates a dag based on the list&#39;s dict values and airflow is having weird problem where it appear to see something different that when I run the dag file manually. Some snippet like...\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nenviron[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;] = &quot;/path/to/some/project/files&quot;\r\n# import certain project files\r\nsys.path.append(environ[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;])\r\nimport tables as tt\r\n\r\ntables = tt.tables\r\n\r\nfor table in tables:\r\n    print table\r\n    assert isinstance(table, dict)\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 1&gt;\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 2&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running the py file manually from the `~/airflow/dag/` dir, there are no errors thrown and the for loop prints the dicts, but airflow apparently sees things differently in the webserver and when running `airflow list_dags`. Running `airflow list_dags` I get the error\r\n```bash\r\n    assert isinstance(table, dict)\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\nand don&#39;t know how to test what is causing this, since again when running the py file manually from the dag location, there is no problem and the print statement shows dicts and the webserver UI shows no further error message.\r\n\r\nAnyone know what could be going on here? Maybe something about how the imports are working?\r\n\r\n\\* **Update 1**:\r\n\r\nSeeing more weirdness in that when calling functions from the imported python module, everything runs fine when running the dag file manually, but `airflow list_dags` says...\r\n\r\n&gt; AttributeError: &#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;my_func&#39;\r\n\r\nmaking me even further suspect some import weirdness, even though this is the exact same process I am using in another dag file (ie. setting some `environ` values and appending to `sys.path`) to import modules for that dag and have no problems there.\r\n\r\n\\* **Update 2**:\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be (after printing various `sys.path`, `environ`, and `module.__all__` info at the erroring assert) that **a similarly-named module that is getting imported is from the another project** I did this same exact procedure for. Ie. have another file that does...\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nenviron[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;] = &quot;/path/to/some/project/files&quot;\r\n# import certain project files\r\nsys.path.append(environ[&quot;PROJECT_HOME&quot;])\r\nimport tables as tt\r\n\r\ntables = tt.tables\r\n\r\nfor table in tables:\r\n    print table\r\n    assert isinstance(table, dict)\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 1&gt;\r\n    &lt;create some dag task 2&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nand this project home is getting used instead to download a similarly named module that also has a obj named what I was expecting (even when I insert the projects folder at front of `sys.path`). Other than making [packaged dags][1] is there a way to keep airflow from combining all of the `environ` and `sys.path` values of different dags (since I use $PROJECT_HOME in various bash and python task scripts)?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html?highlight=zip#packaged-dags","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423137/use-separate-environ-and-sys-path-between-dags","title":"Use separate environ and sys.path between dags"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas-groupby"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":502,"user_id":5828160,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f1bce66871c9b17ac7d152e59e8f3a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rajith Thennakoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5828160/rajith-thennakoon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":502,"user_id":5828160,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f1bce66871c9b17ac7d152e59e8f3a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rajith Thennakoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5828160/rajith-thennakoon"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571273243,"last_edit_date":1571273243,"creation_date":1571272848,"answer_id":58423372,"question_id":58423136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58423372","body_markdown":"I think,what you need is `groupby` `u_id` and keep the `min` year\r\n\r\n    df[&quot;year&quot;] = pd.to_numeric(df[&quot;year&quot;])\r\n    newdf = df.loc[df.groupby([&#39;u_id&#39;])[&#39;year&#39;].idxmin()].reset_index(drop=True)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423136/pandas-how-do-you-grouby-multiple-columns-and-get-the-lowest-value/58423372#58423372","title":"Pandas - How do you grouby multiple columns and get the lowest value?"}],"owner":{"reputation":830,"user_id":4150078,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VvMca.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sharp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4150078/sharp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58423372,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571273243,"creation_date":1571270676,"question_id":58423136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423136","body_markdown":"I have data frame with  75+ number of columns.

The data stream is supposed to be generated on the host systems and will be provided to the guest system in a form of generic video input device.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is a way to delay the guest execution until the next chunk of data is ready to be read from the video device and then resume the guest execution until its next read request. It seems to be possible because Qemu supports execution pause/resume, but if I do this will it impose any performance penalties? Like every pause/resume takes 10ms, so doing 100 of pause/resume calls in a second delays the guest execution by extra second?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423122/generate-real-time-data-stream-on-a-guest-system-that-takes-longer-than-real-tim","title":"Generate real-time data stream on a guest system that takes longer than real-time on the host system"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571270993,"post_id":58423120,"comment_id":103188512,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423120/swapping-two-nested-dicts#comment103188512_58423120"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5032382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d877fe36b819ad04f31c342b874939e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"noob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5032382/noob"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571354016,"post_id":58423120,"comment_id":103223129,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423120/swapping-two-nested-dicts#comment103223129_58423120"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5032382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d877fe36b819ad04f31c342b874939e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"noob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5032382/noob"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5032382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d877fe36b819ad04f31c342b874939e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"noob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5032382/noob"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571271460,"creation_date":1571270497,"last_edit_date":1571271460,"question_id":58423120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423120","body_markdown":"I am trying to swap nodes between two binary trees, which are represented as nested dicts. I have tried to accomplish this by using a function that takes in a dict and list of keys, performs a deep get on it, and returns the nested dict. e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef deep_get(dictionary, keys, default=None):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot; By Yuda Prawira\r\n    Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25833613/python-safe-method-to-get-value-of-nested-dictionary&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    return reduce(lambda d, key: d.get(key, default) if isinstance(d, dict) else default, keys.split(&quot;.&quot;), dictionary)\r\n```\r\nHowever whenever I assign it to a variable and try to do a basic swap, the original dict is unchanged:\r\n\r\n```python\r\na = deep_get(tree1, &quot;left.right.left&quot;)\r\nb = deep_get(tree2, &quot;left.right&quot;)\r\nc = a.copy()\r\na.clear()\r\na.update(b)\r\nb.clear()\r\nb.update(c)\r\n```\r\nIs there a simpler way of accomplishing this, or will I have to create a tree class that wraps around the dict?\r\n\r\nsample input:\r\n```python\r\ntree1 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 5, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 1}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;cos&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 3}}\r\ntree2 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 2}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;tan&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 4}}\r\n```\r\nFirst, I choose randomly a node from tree1 and tree2 to swap. Suppose I want to swap the first level left branch of tree1 with the second level right branch of tree2. Then the trees after swap should be like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntree1 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 4}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;cos&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 3}}\r\ntree2 = {&#39;left&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 1, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 2}, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;tan&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: {&#39;left&#39;: 5, &#39;op&#39;: &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;right&#39;: 1}}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58423120/swapping-two-nested-dicts","title":"Swapping two nested dicts"},{"tags":["asynchronous","async-await","fetch","insertadjacenthtml"],"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":11996130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/659ec7986db1b12de34416282ac2cc62?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11996130/bob"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571270473,"creation_date":1571270473,"question_id":58423118,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58423118","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a link to my JS fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/apasric4/u4y6t9jw/2/\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my JS; \r\n\r\n    const url=&#39;https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10&#39;;\r\n    const button=document.querySelector(&#39;button&#39;);\r\n    const output=document.querySelector(&#39;.output&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    async function search(url) {\r\n      const response=await fetch(url);\r\n      const myJSON= await response.json();\r\n      const {results}=myJSON;\r\n      const html=results.map(person=&gt; \r\n        `&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;img src=${person.picture.medium}&gt;\r\n          &lt;span&gt;${person.name.first}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n        `\r\n      );\r\n      return html;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    button.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, ()=&gt; {\r\n      search(url).then(html=&gt; output.insertAdjacentHTML(&#39;afterbegin&#39;, html));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nIf you click the search button, you can see that each appended HTML element is getting smaller and smaller.
