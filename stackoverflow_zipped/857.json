Going in nuget manager, Consolidate tab, it is not possible to align\r\n&gt; the versions between projects because &quot;locked by project&quot; (see below).\r\n\r\nSee [Consolidate tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#consolidate-tab), this option can&#39;t work when one project in your solution don&#39;t support being updated.\r\n\r\nFor those `.net core` and `asp.net core` projects,by default they use the version 2.2.0, and it&#39;s not supported to consolidate them by `manage packages for solution` or update it by `manage packages for project`, we have to update those projects one-by-one following the steps:\r\n\r\n1.Right-click the project=&gt;Edit `xxx.csproj`\r\n\r\n2.If there exists statement like `&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.NETCore.App&quot; /&gt;`, explicitly add the version 2.2.0 to it: `&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.NETCore.App&quot; Version=&quot;2.2.0&quot; /&gt;`. If there not exists such statement, add it manually.\r\n\r\n3.Then now right-click the project=&gt;Manage nuget packages, you can choose the 2.2.7 version to update.\r\n\r\nNote: It requires us to install the corresponding sdk and runtime in machine. And according to [Martin](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44031957/10910450)&#39;s answer, in most cases you never need to update the blocked projects,please check if you have specific reason to update or consolidate it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338593/net-core-2-2-0-vs-2-2-7-cannot-consolidate-because-versions-locked-by-project/58369931#58369931","title":".net core 2.2.0 vs 2.2.7 cannot consolidate, because versions locked by project"}],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":3578210,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9290f3724da0a3a1eb1086ad33a82165?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LorenzoGi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3578210/lorenzogi"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58369931,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571025475,"creation_date":1570787260,"question_id":58338593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58338593","body_markdown":"I have a Visual Studio solution relying on .net core 2.2.

I&#39;ll try to answer it by making some assumptions.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m assuming you&#39;re authenticating your application and then making a REST call afterward. First (as already mentioned in the answers), you have a STATELESS session policy. It means the session won&#39;t be available for the subsequent Http requests.\r\n\r\nYou can handle it by:\r\n\r\n 1. Implementing a token-based (transparent/opaque) authentication.\r\n 2. Implementing a basic-authentication.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, every request to your REST APIs requires an Authorization Header (or a Cookie, depends on the approach).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338570/how-to-authorize-rest-api-call-after-the-successful-authentication-in-springboot/58340725#58340725","title":"How to Authorize Rest API call after the successful authentication in Springboot and Spring Security"}],"owner":{"reputation":313,"user_id":1831032,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/157ebf77309901e5d6064a731ae02fd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sree","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1831032/sree"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570794746,"creation_date":1570787201,"question_id":58338570,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58338570","body_markdown":"I have a Restful APIs developed using Springboot.

Resolve `std::string` to something else than `::std::string` - is it possible?&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt;...as an alternative ive considering if `std::string` can be replaced in the following way...\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, **it is not possible outside of your anonymous namespace scope** because you have no way to resolve the ambiguity (not to my knowledge).\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, since you are inside the scope of the anonymous namespace, it will be fine:\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nnamespace\r\n{\r\n    namespace std\r\n    {\r\n        struct string : public ::std::string\r\n        {\r\n            \r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n    std::string hello; // Fine\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::string hello2; // Cannot be something else that ambiguous\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut even worse, the problem is not about `std::string` itself but about the `std` namespace.\r\n\r\nIndeed, outside of the scope of your anonymous namespace, every call of `std` becomes ambiguous too.&lt;br/&gt;This is the error pointed by the compiler. There are two `std` namespaces accessible as is from the global scope.\r\n\r\nSo the following example becomes broken:\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n\r\nnamespace\r\n{\r\n    namespace std\r\n    {\r\n        struct string : public ::std::string\r\n        {\r\n\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n    std::string hello; // Fine\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::vector&lt;int&gt; a; // FAIL: reference to &#39;std&#39; is ambiguous\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo fix this ambiguity over accessing the original `std` namespace, you&#39;ll need to write it as follows:\r\n```\r\n::std::vector&lt;int&gt; a; // Fully qualified name: Only way to refer to the `::std` namespace\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, it still does not solve the issue and even worse, it adds a huge inconvenience.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTherefore the morality is:\r\n\r\n- Do not hide an already existing type but create a distinct one instead. \r\n- In the same way, do not hide a namespace (by defining the same namespace into an anonymous one --&gt; evil).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_(I&#39;m open to any improvement proposal of this answer)_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338549/resolve-stdstring-to-something-else-than-stdstring-is-it-possible/58339887#58339887","title":"Resolve std::string to something else than ::std::string - is it possible?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":2261538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e60dd44745bd1518ee933e081119de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"darune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2261538/darune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571037395,"post_id":58341895,"comment_id":103092934,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338549/resolve-stdstring-to-something-else-than-stdstring-is-it-possible/58341895#comment103092934_58341895"},{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":2261538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e60dd44745bd1518ee933e081119de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"darune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2261538/darune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571037444,"post_id":58341895,"comment_id":103092951,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338549/resolve-stdstring-to-something-else-than-stdstring-is-it-possible/58341895#comment103092951_58341895"},{"owner":{"reputation":293,"user_id":1531591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e54ad4ac7448a9bfe46e13ddbaad82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nico238","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531591/nico238"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":2261538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e60dd44745bd1518ee933e081119de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"darune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2261538/darune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571039191,"post_id":58341895,"comment_id":103093793,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338549/resolve-stdstring-to-something-else-than-stdstring-is-it-possible/58341895#comment103093793_58341895"},{"owner":{"reputation":293,"user_id":1531591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e54ad4ac7448a9bfe46e13ddbaad82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nico238","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531591/nico238"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":2261538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e60dd44745bd1518ee933e081119de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"darune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2261538/darune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571039542,"post_id":58341895,"comment_id":103093970,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338549/resolve-stdstring-to-something-else-than-stdstring-is-it-possible/58341895#comment103093970_58341895"},{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":2261538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e60dd44745bd1518ee933e081119de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"darune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2261538/darune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571041732,"post_id":58341895,"comment_id":103095055,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338549/resolve-stdstring-to-something-else-than-stdstring-is-it-possible/58341895#comment103095055_58341895"},{"owner":{"reputation":293,"user_id":1531591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e54ad4ac7448a9bfe46e13ddbaad82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nico238","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531591/nico238"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":2261538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e60dd44745bd1518ee933e081119de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"darune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2261538/darune"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571043227,"post_id":58341895,"comment_id":103095731,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338549/resolve-stdstring-to-something-else-than-stdstring-is-it-possible/58341895#comment103095731_58341895"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":293,"user_id":1531591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e54ad4ac7448a9bfe46e13ddbaad82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nico238","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531591/nico238"},"comment_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570799109,"creation_date":1570799109,"answer_id":58341895,"question_id":58338549,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58341895","body_markdown":"Could you use this kind of solution : Rather than working on std::string, you work on the function that will cause the problem\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nvoid test(const std::string&amp;

I have tested all the routes already and they all work.\r\n\r\nNow I would like to send requests to this API on my Android application. For that I use a class `RequestManager` that extends `AsyncTask` to manage each request (I can show you the code if you ask).\r\nI have added `&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot; /&gt;` and `&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE&quot; /&gt;` in the Manifest.\r\n\r\nWhen I execute a request throught the `RequestManager` using the IP address of my PC, it pauses for some time then throws a `SocketTimeoutException` with the following error: `failed to connect to /XX.XX.XX.XX (port XXXX) from /XX.XX.XX.XX (port XXXX)`. Note that making the same request from Postman works without issue.\r\n\r\nSo I tried multiple things like adding a file `network_security_config.xml` to permit the traffic with the IP address of my PC, I deactivated my firewall, I added several inbound and outbound rules on my firewall to give permissions to Android Studio, the IP address, the used port etc.. but nothing seems to fix the issue..\r\n\r\nHas anyone experienced the same or can anyone help me fix this ?

saw this problem on a closed hiring contest on hackerearth, the problems goes on like this: Given a zero matrix of n x m dimensions.

In the end after k operations we have to tell the number of ways we can get x odd elements in the matrix.\r\n\r\nI tried a BFS approach in which I made all the combinations and perform the operations, instead of keeping original number i keep track of whether the element is odd or even (reduces it down to bool) and then finally after k operations i cound number of odd elements by odd_element_row * even_element_in_column, it gives me correct answer however the value of k in the problem is very high (1 &lt;= k &lt;= 10^12) values of n &amp; m are (1 &lt;= n,m &lt;= 1000)\r\n\r\nThis is my code:\r\n```c++\r\n#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n#define int long long\r\n\r\nunordered_map&lt;int, bool&gt; rows[10000000], columns[10000000];\r\nsigned main()\r\n{\r\n\tint t;\r\n\tcin &gt;&gt; t;\r\n\twhile (t--)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tint n, m, _k, _x;\r\n\t\tcin &gt;&gt; n &gt;&gt; m &gt;&gt; _k &gt;&gt; _x;\r\n\r\n        if (_k == 0)\r\n        {\r\n            if (_x == 0) cout &lt;&lt; 1 &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n            else cout &lt;&lt; 0 &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (_x &gt; n*m) cout &lt;&lt; 0 &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            queue&lt;int&gt; qu;\r\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) rows[0][i] = false;\r\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; ++i) columns[0][i] = false;\r\n            qu.push(0);\r\n            while (_k--)\r\n            {\r\n                int size = qu.size();\r\n                while (size--)\r\n                {\r\n                    int i = qu.front();\r\n                    qu.pop();\r\n                    for (int j = 0; j &lt; n*m; ++j)\r\n                    {\r\n                        rows[n*m*i + j + 1] = rows[i];\r\n                        columns[n*m*i + j + 1] = columns[i];\r\n\r\n                        int x = j / m, y = j % m;\r\n                        rows[n*m*i + j + 1][y] = !rows[n*m*i + j + 1][y];\r\n                        columns[n*m*i + j + 1][x] = !columns[n*m*i + j + 1][x];\r\n                        qu.push(n*m*i + j + 1);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            int count = 0;\r\n            while (!qu.empty())\r\n            {\r\n                int i = qu.front();\r\n                qu.pop();\r\n                int e1 = 0, o1 = 0;\r\n                for (auto x : rows[i])\r\n                {\r\n                    if (!x.second) e1++;\r\n                    else o1++;\r\n                }\r\n                int e2 = 0, o2 = 0;\r\n                for (auto x : columns[i])\r\n                {\r\n                    if (!x.second) e2++;\r\n                    else o2++;\r\n                }\r\n                int val = (o1 * e2 + o2 * e1);\r\n                if (val == _x) count++;\r\n            }\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338465/ways-to-perform-an-operation-on-zero-matrix-such-that-resulting-matrix-have-exac","title":"Ways to perform an operation on zero matrix such that resulting matrix have exact specified odd elements"},{"tags":["pycharm","display","monitor","shutdown"],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":6056445,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e63676bc1b55ce95d65c02a89d43c4f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6056445","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6056445/user6056445"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570786765,"creation_date":1570786765,"question_id":58338461,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58338461","body_markdown":"My problem is to configure the Pycharm editor.

Create a empty file named &quot;ConfirmPasswordController.php&quot; in the folder App/Http/Controllers/Auth\r\n 2. Go to https://github.com/laravel/laravel/tree/master/app/Http/Controllers/Auth en open the file named &quot;ConfirmPasswordController.php&quot;\r\n 3.

For example,\r\n\r\n    x1 + x2 + x3 + ... +x1599 &lt; 30, xi is binary.\r\n\r\n1. Map these equations into a Boolean circuit.\r\n2. Apply Tseitin&#39;s transformation to the circuit and convert it into DIMACS format. \r\n\r\nBut is there any way to read the results? I do think it is possible to read the results if all the variables are defined by ourself, so figuring out how to convert a linear constraint to SAT problem is necessary.\r\n\r\nIf there are 3 or 4 variables, i.e. x1+x2+x3 &lt;3, we can use truth table to solve this conversion. Also, a direct way is that chose 29 (any number smaller than 30) variables from 1600 variables to be 1, the others to be 0. But there are too many possibilities which makes this problem hard to solve.\r\n\r\nI have used STP, but it can only give 1 answer. As the increasing number of variables and clauses, it costs a long time for STP to run.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to use SAT to solve the cnf given by STP, it can give out answers in a minutes. But the results cannot be read.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I found some paper, \r\n1. Encoding Linear Constraints with Implication Chains to CNF,\r\n2. SAT-Based Techniques for Integer Linear Constraints.

If the shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env python`, that puts the version used under the control of the individual *caller*, whose `PATH` may not provide the right version.\r\n\r\n`#!/usr/bin/python` is a little better, as it puts the decision in the hands of the script itself. However, the script author doesn&#39;t necessarily know where the correction version of Python is on *your* system, so it still may not work.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to specify the correct location on *your* system when you *install* the module or script. The Python installer (`pip`, etc) will, at that time, *rewrite* any shebang containing the word `python` (`#!python` being the minimal such shebang) to the path specified by the installer.\r\n\r\nNow when you run the script, it will point to the correct path that you have already provided, without being subject to runtime PATH lookup that could choose the wrong version.\r\n\r\nNote that `#!python` is not meant to be used as-is, though for various reasons it *might* work for you. It&#39;s is a means towards making sure the script gets a fixed, absolute path to the correct interpreter. `#!/usr/bin/python` is *also* subject to install-time replacement, so may serve as a usable default.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338429/what-is-the-advantage-of-usr-bin-env-python-in-the-shebang-rather-than-just/58340440#58340440","title":"What is the advantage of &quot;#!/usr/bin/env python&quot; in the shebang rather than just calling the &quot;#!python&quot; interpreter?"}],"owner":{"reputation":608,"user_id":8919133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cn93c.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Blasco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8919133/blasco"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58339505,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570811931,"creation_date":1570786661,"question_id":58338429,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58338429","body_markdown":"I understand the difference between starting a python script like:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I understood, just executes python as we would do in our shell, so it looks in `$PATH`.

&quot;return null&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a way to accomplish the behavior I want?\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338411/how-to-fall-back-to-log4j2-xml-when-custom-configurationfile-is-missing","title":"How to fall back to log4j2.xml when custom configurationFile is missing"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html","css"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":486,"user_id":4060521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7fd274f41713166dd9c7efa064c6983?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user38208","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4060521/user38208"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570791710,"post_id":58338683,"comment_id":103035088,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338410/executing-a-hover-function-based-on-the-class-of-the-body-in-jquery/58338683#comment103035088_58338683"},{"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":12141758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad445bcef4d69a1450e2bbfdfc4b04d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gmaslic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12141758/gmaslic"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":486,"user_id":4060521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7fd274f41713166dd9c7efa064c6983?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user38208","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4060521/user38208"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570795565,"post_id":58338683,"comment_id":103037014,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338410/executing-a-hover-function-based-on-the-class-of-the-body-in-jquery/58338683#comment103037014_58338683"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":12141758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad445bcef4d69a1450e2bbfdfc4b04d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gmaslic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12141758/gmaslic"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570787544,"creation_date":1570787544,"answer_id":58338683,"question_id":58338410,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58338683","body_markdown":"You can use more complex selectors\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;body:not(.user-is-touching) .c-u&#39;)\r\n\r\nOr you could add &quot;IF&quot;

have an Android `GLSurfaceView` with some custom drawing that I want to overlay on top of Google Maps. I believe that for this I need to emulate latitude longitudes in my OpenGL coordinate system.
