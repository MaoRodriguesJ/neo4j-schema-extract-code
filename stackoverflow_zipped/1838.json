have found it convenient to implement validation directly in the risen exception classes like:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; class IsNoneError(ValueError):\r\n    ...     @classmethod\r\n    ...     def validate(cls, value):\r\n    ...         if value is None:\r\n    ...             raise cls\r\n    ... \r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; IsNoneError.validate(1)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; IsNoneError.validate(None)\r\n

__main__.IsNoneError\r\n\r\nThe pattern I am asking about is **embedding of the validation routine in the exception class which is being raised if the validation fails**. As I try to use single responsibility principle in my code, I need to have a separate exception for every failure, which then may be translated to a message in arbitrary natural language by a separate module.\r\nFollowing the pattern allows me to have all my validation code in one place.\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing new under the sun I guess someone had already invented this exception-validator class pattern. What is its name then, which I may use talking to other pythonists to be understood?\r\n\r\nAlso, what are possible drawbacks of this design pattern?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104322/what-is-the-name-of-the-design-pattern-used-by-this-validation-code","title":"What is the name of the design pattern used by this validation code?"},{"tags":["npm","npm-install"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12120509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WW0BKPXz3LY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rflVBm0TkwYIaqvwbjzbJfK-mu1PA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Erick Oliver Quispe Moya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12120509/erick-oliver-quispe-moya"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569435166,"creation_date":1569435166,"question_id":58104321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58104321","body_markdown":"no se puede almacenar mis datos de google cloud en datastore, para ejecutar npm me parece error de &quot;no repository field&quot;\r\n\r\nse probo instalando GIT porque anteriormente no se podia instalar con el CMD de windows\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\USUARIO&gt;npm install\r\nnpm WARN particle-google-cloud-datastore-tutorial@0.0.1 No repository field.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104321/npm-warn-particle-google-cloud-datastore-tutorial0-0-1-no-repository-field","title":"npm WARN particle-google-cloud-datastore-tutorial@0.0.1 No repository field"},{"tags":["c++","recursion","linked-list","overloading","friend"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1649,"user_id":5440453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3500f6dc5327b259bb48da3399268b0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Algirdas Preidžius","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5440453/algirdas-preid%c5%beius"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569435301,"post_id":58104318,"comment_id":102599732,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104318/overload-to-compare-two-linked-list-recursively#comment102599732_58104318"},{"owner":{"reputation":18285,"user_id":7359094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxJgU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fran&#231;ois Andrieux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7359094/fran%c3%a7ois-andrieux"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569435328,"post_id":58104318,"comment_id":102599745,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104318/overload-to-compare-two-linked-list-recursively#comment102599745_58104318"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569436587,"last_edit_date":1569436587,"creation_date":1569435894,"answer_id":58104481,"question_id":58104318,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58104481","body_markdown":"The structure Node is a private data member, It may not be used in the friend declaration\r\n\r\n    friend bool operator == (const LList&amp;

is to define horizontal pod autoscaler for your deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with custom metrics support, on some other application-provided metrics). Note that Horizontal Pod Autoscaling does not apply to objects that can’t be scaled, for example, DaemonSets.\r\n\r\nThe Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The resource determines the behavior of the controller. The controller periodically adjusts the number of replicas in a replication controller or deployment to match the observed average CPU utilization to the target specified by user.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration file should looks like this:\r\n\r\n    apiVersion: autoscaling/v1\r\n    kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\r\n    metadata:\r\n     name: hpa-images-service\r\n    spec:\r\n     scaleTargetRef:\r\n       apiVersion: apps/v1beta1\r\n       kind: Deployment\r\n       name: example-deployment\r\n     minReplicas: 2\r\n     maxReplicas: 100\r\n     targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 75\r\n\r\n\r\nscaleRef should refer toyour deployment definition and minReplicas you can set as 0, value of targetCPUUtilization you can set according to your preferences..

It times out no matter how long or short the timeout is.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems the server executable, `IEDriverServer.exe`, doesn&#39;t close either and is left hanging open after the crash.\r\n\r\n**I suspect** that somehow Selenium is losing track of IE or something, since it seems to completely lose the browser itself. Not sure though. **I have tried** changing the `PageLoadStrategy` within `InternetExplorerOptions` for the driver, but that didn&#39;t help any. I **have also tried** using the 64bit NuGet package for the IE server driver, but that didn&#39;t change anything.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!

have been working on a dynamic Forms framework, that is designed to be extensible. Elements (such as TextElement - which extends ValueElement) make up the form. They are converted into Angular controls (i.e. FormControl) by &quot;Constructors&quot; and are organised within the form layout by &quot;Orchestrators&quot;. The files for the above three items are stored in a &quot;forms&quot; Angular library (ng g lib).\r\n\r\nThe visual representations/components of the above are created by &quot;Renderers&quot;, and the renderers/associated components are stored in a separate library (based on style - e.g. bootstrap-form-renderers).\r\n\r\nElementHandlers (constructors/orchestrators/renderers) specify their handled Element via a Typescript decorator.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {FormElement} from &#39;../../elements/model/form-element&#39;;\r\nimport {Type} from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;reflect-metadata&#39;;\r\n\r\nexport function ElementHandler&lt;TFormElement extends FormElement&gt;(elementType: Type&lt;TFormElement&gt;): ClassDecorator {\r\n  console.log(&#39;Handling for &#39; + elementType);\r\n  return target =&gt; {\r\n    Reflect.defineMetadata(&#39;elementType&#39;, elementType.name, target.prototype);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ne.g:\r\n```\r\n@ElementHandler(TextElement)\r\nexport class TextElementOrchestrator extends FormElementOrchestrator&lt;TextElement&gt; {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these libraries are imported in the Angular app project.\r\n\r\nWhen using &quot;ng build&quot; (no --prod), the code works well. Each form element is created appropriately - e.g. a text input element is represented by an input box, a tags element is represented by a Material design chips component.\r\n\r\nThe console code is as shown:\r\n```\r\nTextElement extends forms_core__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__[&quot;ValueElement&quot;] {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} id\r\n     * @param {?} title\r\n     * @param {?} value\r\n     */\r\n    constructor(id, title, value) {\r\n        super(id, title);\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    friendlyValue() {\r\n        return this.value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when &quot;--prod&quot; is used, everything appears as if a &quot;TextElement&quot;, and only an input box is shown.\r\n\r\nThe console reads as follows:\r\n```\r\nclass extends ValueElement{constructor(id,title,value){super(id,title),this.value=[],this.value=value}friendlyValue(){const selectedPredicate=option=&gt;option.selected;return this.options.singleMode?this.value.find(selectedPredicate).value:this.value.filter(selectedPredicate).map(option=&gt;option.value)}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have my suspicions that either:\r\n1. The decorators are getting stripped in the libraries/Angular app build process, as when attempting to log the &quot;elementType&quot; metadata in the --prod build, it shows as &quot;undefined&quot;\r\n2. The classes are somehow not getting included in the build, hence why the above console readout does not show the class details.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can look into this/change this, whilst still keeping the build optimization in-situ?\r\n\r\nAny other things I can look at?\r\n\r\nI&#39;d appreciate any advice!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104236/production-build-prod-removing-decorators-classes","title":"Production build (--prod) removing decorators/classes"},{"tags":["jquery","node.js","web-scraping"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":933,"user_id":9357872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72ae075f639ca9e1d235ed30685d18e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Evik Ghazarian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9357872/evik-ghazarian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569440006,"post_id":58104235,"comment_id":102601654,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104235/getting-the-links-from-webpage#comment102601654_58104235"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2337,"user_id":1946016,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0c5d167d76c943145ee2d9af55a1b99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"karthikdivi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946016/karthikdivi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569435126,"creation_date":1569435126,"answer_id":58104312,"question_id":58104235,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58104312","body_markdown":"Read `href` attribute value to get the link\r\n\r\n    inksList.push(bodyHtml.find(&#39;a&#39;).attr(&#39;href&#39;));\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104235/getting-the-links-from-webpage/58104312#58104312","title":"getting the links from webpage"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":38735,"user_id":966023,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/917fcb4327159076f752c0c3c3fddfbb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pguardiario","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/966023/pguardiario"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569470454,"creation_date":1569470454,"answer_id":58109384,"question_id":58104235,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58109384","body_markdown":"It should look more like this:\r\n\r\n    let linksList = $(&#39;.cb-content a&#39;).map((i, a) =&gt;

I need to find three **different** indices p, q, r such that the triplet (a[p],a[q],a[r]) satisfies the equation a[p]+a[q]+a[r]=0. Also, the sorted list can contain the same number more than once. The algorithm that is required needs to be **quadratic.** \r\n\r\nI have found a solution (I&#39;m definitely not saying that it is the most efficient one), but I&#39;m quite sure that it&#39;s not quadratic (2 for-loops and a while-loop). Here is my code:\r\n\r\n\r\n    public ThreeSumIndices searchTriplet(List&lt;Integer&gt; list) {\r\n        for(int i=0; i&lt;list.size()-1; i++){\r\n            int w = -list.get(i);\r\n            for(int j=i+1; j&lt;list.size(); j++){\r\n                int k = 1;\r\n                while(j+k&lt;list.size() &amp;&amp; list.get(j)+list.get(j+k)!=w){\r\n                    k++;\r\n                }\r\n                if(j+k==list.size()){\r\n                    k = 1;\r\n                } else if(list.get(j)+list.get(j+k)==w){\r\n                    return new ThreeSumIndices(i,j,j+k);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return null; //no indices found.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*ThreeSumIndices is a seperate class.

The distributions look like [this][2] and you can download the data from [here][3]\r\n\r\nFrom the docs I tried using the &#39;trimmed&#39; parameter :\r\n\r\n```levene(list(group),list(group2),&#39;trimmed&#39;)[1]```\r\n\r\nWhen not adding &#39;trimmed&#39; it works but I am not confident in the results:\r\n\r\n```levene(list(group),list(group2))[1]```\r\n\r\n\r\nI get the following error Messages\r\n\r\n    &gt; Traceback (most recent call last):   File &quot;C:\\Program\r\n    &gt; Files\\JetBrains\\PyCharm Community Edition\r\n    &gt; 2019.2.1\\helpers\\pydev\\pydevd.py&quot;, line 2060, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    &gt;     main()   File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\PyCharm Community Edition 2019.2.1\\helpers\\pydev\\pydevd.py&quot;, line 2054, in main\r\n    &gt;     globals = debugger.run(setup[&#39;file&#39;], None, None, is_module)   File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\PyCharm Community Edition\r\n    &gt; 2019.2.1\\helpers\\pydev\\pydevd.py&quot;, line 1405, in run\r\n    &gt;     return self._exec(is_module, entry_point_fn, module_name, file, globals, locals)   File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\PyCharm Community\r\n    &gt; Edition 2019.2.1\\helpers\\pydev\\pydevd.py&quot;, line 1412, in _exec\r\n    &gt;     pydev_imports.execfile(file, globals, locals)  # execute the script   File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\PyCharm Community Edition\r\n    &gt; 2019.2.1\\helpers\\pydev\\_pydev_imps\\_pydev_execfile.py&quot;, line 18, in execfile\r\n    &gt;     exec(compile(contents+&quot;\\n&quot;, file, &#39;exec&#39;), glob, loc)   File &quot;D:/1.

To read directly from the source file into a date value using an INFORMAT that is appropriate for the value.  Note that you cannot combine an informat with the column range in the input statement. Instead you can use @ to position at the first column of the date string and then use formatted input.

are you deploying a Spring boot app in your local tomcat? By default Springboot comes with embedded Tomcat server in it, so if you just build and run the jar, a tomcat will be started with the service itself.You can also , configure the server type(tomcat or jetty) and other server properties in the application.yml file. More details here - https://www.springboottutorial.com/spring-boot-with-embedded-servers-tomcat-jetty \r\nComing to the second part, of the question,about how to make sure , that if one service crashes, a new instance should be started automatically, for this you might be needing to do some reading on container managers like dockerswarm or kubernetes, which support auto-scaling, and can take care of restarting services (pods) as and when required,they can even scale up, meaning increase the number of instances of a service if existing containers reach a resource usage threshold and then load balancing requests to that service through some discovery and registry client.I think this would be helpful to you -

am using GCC 7.4.0 and at some point it started giving me the following warning:\r\n\r\n&gt; offset outside bounds of constant string\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the code is now templated and inlined and the compiler can now make some additional compile time checks. The code looks more or less like this:\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename StringType = std::string&gt;\r\n    class StringWrapper {\r\n    public:\r\n        explicit StringWrapper(const typename StringType::value_type* string_buffer);\r\n    \r\n    private:\r\n        static bool check(const typename StringType::value_type* string_buffer);\r\n    \r\n    private:\r\n        StringType m_text;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename StringType&gt;\r\n    StringWrapper&lt;StringType&gt;::StringWrapper(\r\n        const typename StringType::value_type* string_buffer)\r\n        : m_text(check(string_buffer) ? string_buffer + 3U\r\n                                      : StringType{}) // the warning is at this line\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename StringType&gt;\r\n    bool StringWrapper&lt;StringType&gt;::check(const typename StringType::value_type* string_buffer)\r\n    {\r\n        if (string_buffer == nullptr) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return std::none_of(string_buffer, string_buffer + 3U,\r\n            [](const typename StringType::value_type&amp; string_element) {\r\n                return string_element == &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n            });\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        StringWrapper&lt;&gt; a(&quot;na&quot;);\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe compiler seems not to be able to understand at compile time that the function `check()` as already validated the offset to be applicable without any risk. The reason why the compiler basically ignores the call to `check()` is that the function unfortunately cannot be made `constexpr`, and therefore it cannot be evaluated at compile time.\r\n\r\nHow can I disable only this specific warning and only for this specific portion of code?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3378560/how-to-disable-gcc-warnings-for-a-few-lines-of-code but I do not know what `-Wname_of_warning` should be used.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104146/how-to-disable-warning-offset-outside-bounds-of-constant-string","title":"How to disable warning: offset outside bounds of constant string"},{"tags":["jenkins","jenkins-jira-trigger"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1736,"user_id":2464295,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e610a58b5e6c136fa2b2f509969b15c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceilfors","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2464295/ceilfors"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569443191,"post_id":58104144,"comment_id":102602970,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104144/jenkins-jira-trigger-is-not-triggering-anymore#comment102602970_58104144"}],"owner":{"reputation":1172,"user_id":2258038,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkEQe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"albertski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2258038/albertski"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569434419,"creation_date":1569434419,"question_id":58104144,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58104144","body_markdown":"For some reason, my Jira Triggers stopped working.

However, an OS vendor will generally avoid updating anything they ship as part of the OS as much as possible, since they generally guarantee backwards-compatibility, and the easiest way to guarantee backwards-compatibility for third-party code that you have no control over, is to just not change it.\r\n\r\nFor example, macOS 10.14.6, which is the current release of macOS and was released 4 weeks ago, ships with Ruby 2.3.7, which was released 18 months ago.\r\n\r\nThe last release of Ruby 2.3 was Ruby 2.3.8, and the Ruby developers stopped providing security patches to Ruby 2.3 6 months ago. (Note that Apple *does* still provide security patches for Ruby 2.3 as part of macOS, though.)\r\n\r\nSo, yes, it does get upgraded automatically, with e.g. security fixes, but if you want a different version than the one shipped with the OS, you have to install it yourself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58104136/do-you-need-to-update-ruby-manually-on-a-mac/58105158#58105158","title":"Do you need to update Ruby manually on a Mac?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":166592,"user_id":87189,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98e7d6edce863e7a1bf8199b082eb25e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tadman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/87189/tadman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569440944,"creation_date":1569440944,"answer_id":58105622,"question_id":58104136,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58105622","body_markdown":"Short answer: *No.*\r\n\r\nLong answer:\r\n\r\nIf you just want a taste of Ruby, then no, you really don&#39;t need to do anything.\r\n\r\nIf you want to *use* Ruby to do something non-trivial, like beyond a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; application, then yes you should update.\r\n\r\nThe best approach is to use a Ruby version manager like [RVM](https://rvm.io) or [`rbenv`](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) where you can get the latest version of Ruby, specific historical versions if necessary for testing, as well as alternate implementations like [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org) and [Rubinius](https://rubinius.com).\r\n\r\nThese version managers make it possible to have *multiple versions of Ruby installed simultaneously* and you can switch between at any time.
