To my eyes setting lifetimes here (`pub fn get&lt;&#39;a&gt;(&amp;&#39;a self) -&gt; &amp;&#39;a Child {`) should reassure the compiler the ref will live long enough... but, nah.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime annotations you&#39;ve provided there are exactly what the Rust compiler would infer if you elided them, so this wouldn&#39;t make any difference.\r\n\r\nAs written, your `set_child_ref` method has elided the lifetimes, which means the inferred lifetimes are like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl&lt;&#39;a&gt; Parent&lt;&#39;a&gt; {\r\n    pub fn set_child_ref&lt;&#39;b&gt;(&amp;&#39;b mut self) {\r\n        self.child_ref.push(self.wrapper.get());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis won&#39;t work. The lifetime `&#39;b` will be determined by how the _caller_ of `set_child_ref` uses the parameter. The reference to `self` therefore could be shorter than the lifetime `&#39;a`. This would cause a problem because the reference to `ChildWrapper`, that you are storing in `child_ref`, is borrowed from that (potentially shorter-lived) reference.\r\n\r\nThe easy fix is to say that the reference to `self` must outlive `&#39;a`, which is the lifetime of the references in the `child_ref` vector:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl&lt;&#39;a&gt; Parent&lt;&#39;a&gt; {\r\n    pub fn set_child_ref(&amp;&#39;a mut self) {\r\n        self.child_ref.push(self.wrapper.get());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991717/infer-an-appropriate-lifetime-for-methods-including-interior-references/57992429#57992429","title":"Infer an appropriate lifetime for methods including interior references"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9117441,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83f41fa3ba18e116704b5b7eeebbbdda?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gpoblon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9117441/gpoblon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22329,"user_id":493729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bU0Kx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Hall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/493729/peter-hall"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57992429,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568808534,"creation_date":1568806086,"last_edit_date":1568808534,"question_id":57991717,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57991717","body_markdown":"I am learning Rust and facing a compilation issue.

I assume that you need to do these things at the same time: \r\n\r\n 1. validate 2 necessary parameters, `username` and `email`; \r\n 2. check whether no other keys are included in request body.\r\n\r\nUsing `body()` with no parameters allows you to validate the whole **body** object.\r\n \r\nHere&#39;s some info about it: [Whole body validation][1]\r\n\r\nThe code listed below is an example of API endpoint `POST /login` that does what you need. Please refer to the third validator in middlewares array (`body().custom(...)`).\r\n\r\n    const { Router } = require(&#39;express&#39;);\r\n    const router = Router();\r\n    const { body, validationResult } = require(&#39;express-validator&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    router.post(&#39;/login&#39;, [\r\n        body(&#39;username&#39;).isString().not().isEmpty(),\r\n        body(&#39;email&#39;).isEmail(),\r\n        body().custom(body =&gt; {\r\n            const keys = [&#39;username&#39;, &#39;email&#39;];\r\n            return Object.keys(body).every(key =&gt; keys.includes(key));\r\n        }).withMessage(&#39;Some extra parameters are sent&#39;)\r\n    ], (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n        const errors = validationResult(req);\r\n        if (!errors.isEmpty()) return res.status(422).send(errors.array({ onlyFirstError: true }))\r\n        next();\r\n    }, (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n        //some other stuff\r\n        res.status(200).send(&quot;OK&quot;)\r\n    });\r\n\r\nYou can also substitute the third validator with this one:\r\n\r\n    body().custom((body, { req }) =&gt; {\r\n       const keys = [&#39;username&#39;, &#39;email&#39;];\r\n       return Object.keys(req.body).every(key =&gt; keys.includes(key));\r\n    }).withMessage(&#39;Some extra parameters are sent&#39;)\r\n\r\nThe only difference is that in this case you use `req` object, which you can always get in all `custom()` validators.

[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29907170/what-is-this-field-separator-m) which explains that the `^M` is an MS-DOS phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThen [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12193252/4288043) claims the Windows terminator is `\\r\\n`, no mention being made of `^M\\n`\r\n\r\nAs backround information, will mention that each element in that list `key_value_pairs` gets further split in another loop with `.split(&quot;=&quot;, 1)`\r\n\r\nAm expecting future files to be have line termination unpredictably with or without the `^M` and trying to find a way to handle it without messy regex or string methods if they can be avoided. \r\n\r\nMaybe the best bet is just to strip every `^M` out of the file in the beginning then treat them all as Unix files. That might be a bit dangerous for some base64 binary blocks in the file however.\r\n\r\nIs there something in Python which will cleanly deal with those `^M` as the file gets opened? \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991690/handling-n-vs-m-n-newlines-with-python","title":"Handling \\n vs ^M\\n newlines with Python"},{"tags":["c#","webforms"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":1651720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEWLk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1651720/andile"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568806643,"post_id":57991688,"comment_id":102390738,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991688/how-to-create-enable-disable-textbox-inside-gridview#comment102390738_57991688"},{"owner":{"reputation":54595,"user_id":43846,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TGOxx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"stuartd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/43846/stuartd"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":55,"user_id":1651720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEWLk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1651720/andile"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568806910,"post_id":57991688,"comment_id":102390877,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991688/how-to-create-enable-disable-textbox-inside-gridview#comment102390877_57991688"},{"owner":{"reputation":356,"user_id":11802287,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e84941bc40b63ce720413ffb76390f4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KH S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11802287/kh-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568808395,"post_id":57991688,"comment_id":102391654,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991688/how-to-create-enable-disable-textbox-inside-gridview#comment102391654_57991688"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12065889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDk6RuW9JabNDY1QuJA72p_7A-8QEwpgWps43vJGqY=k-s128","display_name":"naresh bada","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12065889/naresh-bada"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568872628,"post_id":57992438,"comment_id":102413916,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991688/how-to-create-enable-disable-textbox-inside-gridview/57992438#comment102413916_57992438"},{"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":1651720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEWLk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1651720/andile"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12065889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDk6RuW9JabNDY1QuJA72p_7A-8QEwpgWps43vJGqY=k-s128","display_name":"naresh bada","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12065889/naresh-bada"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568880525,"post_id":57992438,"comment_id":102417663,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991688/how-to-create-enable-disable-textbox-inside-gridview/57992438#comment102417663_57992438"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12065889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDk6RuW9JabNDY1QuJA72p_7A-8QEwpgWps43vJGqY=k-s128","display_name":"naresh bada","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12065889/naresh-bada"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568889399,"post_id":57992438,"comment_id":102422378,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991688/how-to-create-enable-disable-textbox-inside-gridview/57992438#comment102422378_57992438"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12065889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDk6RuW9JabNDY1QuJA72p_7A-8QEwpgWps43vJGqY=k-s128","display_name":"naresh bada","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12065889/naresh-bada"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568889874,"post_id":57992438,"comment_id":102422674,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991688/how-to-create-enable-disable-textbox-inside-gridview/57992438#comment102422674_57992438"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":1651720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEWLk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andile","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1651720/andile"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568808453,"creation_date":1568808453,"answer_id":57992438,"question_id":57991688,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57992438","body_markdown":"If it is an ASP web page you could do it like this\r\n\r\n    &lt;asp:gridview id=&quot;GridView&quot;

I&#39;m using Python 3.7.1 together with Flask 1.0.2\r\n\r\nGreatly appreciate any help, thanks in advance !\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI inspected the html output from the first tutorial and now noticed that it actually got updated with the flashed message but got &quot;scrambled&quot;.\r\n\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;Flask Message flashing&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n      \r\n         \r\n            &lt;ul&gt;\r\n               \r\n               &lt;li&lt;you were=&quot;&quot; successfully=&quot;&quot; logged=&quot;&quot; in&lt;=&quot;&quot; li=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n               \r\n            &lt;/li&lt;you&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n         \r\n      \r\n\t\t\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;Flask Message Flashing Example&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n      &lt;p&gt;Do you want to &lt;a href=&quot;/login&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;b&gt;log in?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n   \r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is due to a typo in the tutorial&#39;s code:\r\n     `&lt;li&lt;{{ message }}&lt;/li&gt;`\r\nSo this answers my question\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_message_flashing.htm\r\n  [2]: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/flashing/#message-flashing-pattern","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991673/flask-message-flashing","title":"Flask Message Flashing"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","squarespace"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1932,"user_id":5338581,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sbv1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brandon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5338581/brandon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568808544,"post_id":57991671,"comment_id":102391737,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991671/jquery-hiding-menu-options-working-on-chrome-but-not-safari-or-ios#comment102391737_57991671"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12084721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-j7dE-UVeeYg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfJU6YCTmOzyfDI2j_uJo2-i5CCzg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ella Davy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084721/ella-davy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568805906,"creation_date":1568805906,"question_id":57991671,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57991671","body_markdown":"I am working on a squarespace site and using the following code to selectively show some menu items based on the user&#39;s previous selection in a previous menu.

install full screen web apps to the home screen of an iOS device and run some `javascript` each time the web app is launched.\r\nApple have made a change in iOS 13 whereby scripts are only run the first time it is launched. Each subsequent launch presents the web app from where it left off without refreshing back to the start (unless it has been removed from the app switcher).\r\n\r\n&gt; I believe this is a much requested feature from Web App developers to stop a webpage refreshing if the user switches to another app and back again\r\n\r\nTo make `javascript` run some code each time the app is brought to the foreground or launched, I thought I could simply use some notifications watching `focus`, `blur` &amp; `visibilitychange` or maybe looking at `document.activeElement`, `document.hasFocus()` or `document.hidden`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the gotcha...\r\n\r\niOS 13 has also introduced a bug that I have reported but doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s going to be fixed any time soon and is still present in 13GM &amp; 13.1 beta.\r\n\r\nBug\r\n---  \r\nIf you have more than one home screen web app, it&#39;s as if they all share the same web container. Launching a 2nd web app causes all the focus type notifications to fire on previously opened web apps as if they had become front and centre again. This means any `javascript` code is going to run as if it had been launched, even when it hasn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nQuestion\r\n--------\r\nI am trying to find a way around this bug and be notified when a web app is launched front and centre. Using `onLoad` type code will only run once whilst the web app is left in the app switcher. Watching `focus` type events will fire unnecessarily as other web apps are launched. Are there any other events or methods I can try calling, or any tricks I could try to implement?\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n====\r\n\r\nAs requested, here is example html:\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;title&gt;visibilitychange&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;

The idea behind garbage collector implementations as G1 is to minimize and even to avoid the execution of full or major garbage collections since this is an stop the world event whose complexity generates longer pauses and consumption of CPU. Even when I am using the throughput GC, I am always trying to reduce the number of full garbage collections so I would say, it is really good that your system is running without executing full GCs.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, keep in mind that if you are using a JDK lower than version 10, the execution of the Full GC with G1 is going to use just one thread as I pointed on this post.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/15967177/java-7-g1gc-strange-behaviour/49225058#49225058\r\n\r\n&gt; By the way, it seems to be the newest version of Java (10) is going to include a G1 with the capability of executing Full GCs in parallel.\r\n\r\nRegarding your second question. The memory is cleaned using the minor GC and this why you can see a reduction on the heap consumption.\r\n\r\nOn this document you can find a detailed explanation about G1.\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.sysco.no/files/guides/JVMGarbageCollectionV1.1.pdf\r\n\r\nThe Dude","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991615/major-gc-not-running-in-g1/57999806#57999806","title":"Major GC not running in G1"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":3658404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8985d710490f3d380204fafaf7fde3df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rcastellcastell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3658404/rcastellcastell"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568987082,"creation_date":1568987082,"answer_id":58029616,"question_id":57991615,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58029616","body_markdown":"I have provided the documentation where it is explained that G1 uses something called mixed collections.\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.sysco.no/files/guides/JVMGarbageCollectionV1.1.pdf\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FtrC.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991615/major-gc-not-running-in-g1/58029616#58029616","title":"Major GC not running in G1"}],"owner":{"reputation":334,"user_id":2077917,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000174125335/picture?type=large","display_name":"Winster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2077917/winster"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568987082,"creation_date":1568805730,"question_id":57991615,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57991615","body_markdown":"After analyzing the performance issues of an application, following points were noted.\r\n\r\n - JVM uses G1 GC\r\n - During peak hours JVM suspension goes beyond 20%\r\n - For Eden Space - GC count per minute is 20 and GC time per minute is 10seconds (not milliseconds)\r\n - For Old Gen space - No GC running.

I&#39;d like to display in a appropriate way for reviewing them\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say, for example, my raw data looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nID, TESTA, RESULTA, UNITA, TESTB, RESULTB, UNITB, OTHER_UNITB\r\n1,  &#39;T1&#39;,  10,      1,     &#39;T2&#39;,  2.5,          , &#39;kg&#39;,\r\n2,  &#39;T1&#39;,  15,      1,     &#39;T2&#39;,  1.5,     1,         ,\r\n3,  &#39;T1&#39;,    ,       ,     &#39;T2&#39;,  1,       1,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following just works perfectly: for each ID, I retrieve 1 line per test with the corresponding result and unit:\r\n\r\n    select  id,\r\n            property as test_code,\r\n            decode(property, &#39;T1&#39;, &#39;Test 01&#39;, &#39;T2&#39;, &#39;Test 02&#39;, &#39;Unknown test&#39;) as test_name,\r\n            result,\r\n            unit\r\n    from    my_table\r\n    unpivot include nulls\r\n            (\r\n                (result, unit)\r\n                for property in (\r\n                  (resulta, unita) as &#39;T1&#39;,\r\n                  (resultb, unitb) as &#39;T2&#39;\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n    ;\r\n\r\nHowever, things goes wrong when I try to retrieve the &#39;other unit&#39; that is specific to the test &#39;T2&#39; (keep in mind it&#39;s an example, I&#39;ve got plenty of tests, almost 20)\r\n\r\nI tried this:\r\n```\r\nselect  id,\r\n        property as test_code,\r\n        decode(property, &#39;T1&#39;, &#39;Test 01&#39;, &#39;T2&#39;, &#39;Test 02&#39;, &#39;Unknown test&#39;) as test_name,\r\n        result,\r\n        unit,\r\n        other_unit\r\nfrom    my_table\r\nunpivot include nulls\r\n        (\r\n            (result, unit, other_unit)\r\n            for property in (\r\n              (resulta, unita, null) as &#39;T1&#39;,\r\n              (resultb, unitb, other_unitb) as &#39;T2&#39;\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt fails with message &quot;Invalid identifier&quot; for the &#39;null&#39; statement I put in the unpivot.\r\n\r\nI tried also to use a constant, in such way:\r\n```\r\n....\r\nunpivot include nulls\r\n        (\r\n            (result, unit, other_unit)\r\n            for property in (\r\n              (resulta, unita, 0) as &#39;T1&#39;,\r\n              (resultb, unitb, other_unitb) as &#39;T2&#39;\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n;\r\n```\r\nAnd that fails too.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m stuck here and cannot figure out how to fix that without re-writting everything is a list of union statements - that I&#39;d like to avoid at all cost because that&#39;s pretty complex to maintain:\r\n```\r\nselect resulta as result,\r\n       unita as unit,\r\n       null as other_unit\r\nfrom   my_table\r\nunion\r\nselect resultb as result,\r\n       unitb as unit,\r\n       other_unitbas other_unit\r\nfrom   my_table\r\nunion\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also found a ugly solution:\r\n```\r\nselect  id,\r\n        property as test_code,\r\n        decode(property, &#39;T1&#39;, &#39;Test 01&#39;, &#39;T2&#39;, &#39;Test 02&#39;, &#39;Unknown test&#39;) as test_name,\r\n        result,\r\n        unit,\r\n        other_unit\r\nfrom    (\r\n            select  m.*,\r\n                    null as null_item\r\n            from    my_table m\r\n        )\r\n    \r\nunpivot include nulls\r\n        (\r\n            (result, unit, other_unit)\r\n            for property in (\r\n              (resulta, unita, null_item) as &#39;T1&#39;,\r\n              (resultb, unitb, other_unitb) as &#39;T2&#39;\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n;\r\n```\r\nBut honestly, I&#39;m ashamed to do that!\r\n\r\nThanks by advance for any support","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991570/how-to-use-unpivot-for-multiple-columns-with-constants-missing-column","title":"How to use unpivot for multiple columns with constants/missing column?"},{"tags":["c++"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4272,"user_id":1548468,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0745dce203d52699e63a575b3103ad70?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Botje","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1548468/botje"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568805900,"post_id":57991563,"comment_id":102390314,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991563/lnk1181-error-c-got-a-sample-project-but-facing-lnk1181-and-theres-nothing-i#comment102390314_57991563"},{"owner":{"reputation":135,"user_id":9088108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/540ece36b5c9fd67855b0b530d095ed8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"samini","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9088108/samini"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568805965,"post_id":57991563,"comment_id":102390356,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991563/lnk1181-error-c-got-a-sample-project-but-facing-lnk1181-and-theres-nothing-i#comment102390356_57991563"},{"owner":{"reputation":817870,"user_id":17034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cii6b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hans Passant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17034/hans-passant"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568806535,"post_id":57991563,"comment_id":102390689,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991563/lnk1181-error-c-got-a-sample-project-but-facing-lnk1181-and-theres-nothing-i#comment102390689_57991563"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11801256,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0d5dd4370f24a5b009b10ae413a184e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sonya  gold","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11801256/sonya-gold"},"last_editor":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568805909,"creation_date":1568805571,"last_edit_date":1568805909,"question_id":57991563,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57991563","body_markdown":"I got a sample project from someone.

However I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m interested in whether this can be done with Tags. Since it might allow composing tags and only running containers if absolutely necessary.

I am at my wit&#39;s end as to why this isn&#39;t working. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/expire-data/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991516/mongodb-ttl-index-does-not-expire-documents","title":"MongoDB TTL index does not expire documents"},{"tags":["java","sql","database","performance-testing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16089,"user_id":9223839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29dcd6d8b4c4a0720ee253013c91d3ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joakim Danielson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9223839/joakim-danielson"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568805752,"post_id":57991514,"comment_id":102390219,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991514/is-there-a-way-to-measure-time-taken-for-sql-query-to-execute-without-fetching-t#comment102390219_57991514"},{"owner":{"reputation":1281,"user_id":9057499,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XHF3V.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arnaud Peralta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9057499/arnaud-peralta"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568805856,"post_id":57991514,"comment_id":102390281,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991514/is-there-a-way-to-measure-time-taken-for-sql-query-to-execute-without-fetching-t#comment102390281_57991514"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11364405,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/020d4cf0f2e40aa687dfd03a6b6cbbd8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"StormBreaker1229","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11364405/stormbreaker1229"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568806079,"post_id":57991514,"comment_id":102390414,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991514/is-there-a-way-to-measure-time-taken-for-sql-query-to-execute-without-fetching-t#comment102390414_57991514"},{"owner":{"reputation":16089,"user_id":9223839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29dcd6d8b4c4a0720ee253013c91d3ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joakim Danielson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9223839/joakim-danielson"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568812250,"post_id":57991514,"comment_id":102393853,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991514/is-there-a-way-to-measure-time-taken-for-sql-query-to-execute-without-fetching-t#comment102393853_57991514"},{"owner":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571656167,"post_id":57991514,"comment_id":103300932,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57991514/is-there-a-way-to-measure-time-taken-for-sql-query-to-execute-without-fetching-t#comment103300932_57991514"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":9344494,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8016e42d5d6fd87b90a1165caa49a11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"clocksp33d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9344494/clocksp33d"},"last_editor":{"reputation":768,"user_id":3657460,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mf2O7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Igor Patsian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3657460/igor-patsian"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571646051,"last_edit_date":1571646051,"creation_date":1571644302,"answer_id":58481967,"question_id":57991514,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58481967","body_markdown":"You could possibly run a `CREATE TABLE (SELECT query)` command and measure the time.
