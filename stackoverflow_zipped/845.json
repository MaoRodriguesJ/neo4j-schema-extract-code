In GCP, resources that are _below_ the Organization (e.g. Folders, Projects) will inherit Permissions defined at the Org level, and lower-level resources cannot further restrict permissions already granted at higher levels.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n - [List of predefined Roles in GCP][2]\r\n - [Creating and Managing Projects][3]\r\n - [Using Resource Hierarchy for Access Control][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/using-iam-securely#least_privilege\r\n  [2]: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles\r\n  [3]: https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project\r\n  [4]: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/resource-hierarchy-access-control","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341564/iam-admin-google-cloud-platform/58359948#58359948","title":"IAM &amp; Admin (Google Cloud Platform)"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12201120,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBQWDuC8NcfVxGooM04p2UAMQmGDP9hN4ZQUCwxEg=k-s128","display_name":"Vishal Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12201120/vishal-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1188,"user_id":1230621,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a752347505880eb6aca2316744e7f474?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"StarShine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1230621/starshine"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570931641,"creation_date":1570797947,"last_edit_date":1570826998,"question_id":58341564,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58341564","body_markdown":"I am working on google cloud platform and i have faced the issue below.\r\n(I would also like inputs from aws and azure platforms as well.)\r\n\r\n- Created a new user in *gsuite* admin console with no roles assigned in gsuite   admin.\r\n- Added that user in gcp IAM console and gave 2 roles : compute security admin and compute network admin at organization level, meaning these permissions are inherited from organization level.\r\n\r\nShould my user be able to create projects having only compute secuirty admin and compute network admin roles ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341564/iam-admin-google-cloud-platform","title":"IAM &amp; Admin (Google Cloud Platform)"},{"tags":["networking"],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":11042535,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f8b3d2b39fa88ac81217c55b772e7ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JojoTheCodeDude","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11042535/jojothecodedude"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570797936,"creation_date":1570797936,"question_id":58341558,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58341558","body_markdown":"In my scenario i have a subnet 192.168.1.0/24 with a router(.1.1) and another 2 routers(.1.2 and .1.3). each of those routers have their own subnet, the one that has .1.2 has the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 and the other 192.168.3.0/24.

How can we make it work using NULL as well\r\n\r\nYou can use either `std::make_tuple&lt;int*&gt;(NULL)` or simply `std::tuple&lt;int*&gt;(NULL)`. But prefer using `nullptr` instead.\r\n\r\nThe problem that you face is the reason why `nullptr` was introduced to the language. Prior to its introduction, the only standard null pointer literal was 0 (also 0L etc. are valid), and that is what `NULL` expands&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that 0 is not only a pointer literal, but also in fact an integer literal. And it is the integer nature of the literal that takes precedence in template type argument deduction and `std::make_tuple(NULL)` may result in `std::tuple&lt;int&gt;` or `std::tuple&lt;long&gt;` depending on exact definition of `NULL`. And those tuples aren&#39;t implicitly convertible to `std::tuple&lt;int*&gt;`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Technically, now that `nullptr` is in the language, `NULL` could expand to that as well.

[...]\r\n\r\nYou can convert `0` (or `0l`) to any pointer type, but you can&#39;t convert `1` (or `1l`) or any other integer to any pointer type (without an explicit cast, that is).\r\n\r\nThis works fine as long as you define `NULL` as a macro for the literal (`#define NULL 0l`) and use it directly in places where this conversion is necessary. But this makes *perfect forwarding* impossible: A function (such as `std::make_tuple`) taking `T&amp;&amp;` will deduce the type as `long` when passed `NULL`, losing the special properties of the `0` literal.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, `nullptr` was created and given its own type `std::nullptr_t`, with implicit conversions like those of the `0` literal. This means that perfect forwarding of `nullptr` (but not `NULL`) preserves this &quot;specialness&quot;.\r\n\r\n**Bottom line:** Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` (or `0`) if you want to use C++11 features (in particular perfect forwarding) like `std::make_X`.\r\n\r\nThere is no &quot;making it work&quot;. In a standard-conforming compiler (see [`[support.types.nullptr]/2`](http://eel.is/c++draft/support.types#nullptr-2) and footnote) using `NULL` with `make_tuple` will result in this exact problem. Don&#39;t use `NULL` or don&#39;t use `make_tuple`, that&#39;s the only answer to your question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341501/tuple-works-with-nullptr-but-doesnt-with-null/58341659#58341659","title":"Tuple works with nullptr but doesnt with NULL"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":119164,"user_id":4342498,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3j88.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NathanOliver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4342498/nathanoliver"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570798588,"post_id":58341686,"comment_id":103038594,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341501/tuple-works-with-nullptr-but-doesnt-with-null/58341686#comment103038594_58341686"},{"owner":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":119164,"user_id":4342498,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3j88.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NathanOliver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4342498/nathanoliver"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570798745,"post_id":58341686,"comment_id":103038671,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341501/tuple-works-with-nullptr-but-doesnt-with-null/58341686#comment103038671_58341686"},{"owner":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":46173,"user_id":404970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6X94.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"molbdnilo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/404970/molbdnilo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570799052,"post_id":58341686,"comment_id":103038832,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341501/tuple-works-with-nullptr-but-doesnt-with-null/58341686#comment103038832_58341686"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":3090045,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab5db0e7b29b2afeafb8df241031c1b6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Satyanvesh D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3090045/satyanvesh-d"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570809858,"post_id":58341686,"comment_id":103044805,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341501/tuple-works-with-nullptr-but-doesnt-with-null/58341686#comment103044805_58341686"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":159365,"user_id":2877241,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d17ecdadc8917254be4fb70e86246b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad from Moscow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2877241/vlad-from-moscow"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570800431,"last_edit_date":1570800431,"creation_date":1570798366,"answer_id":58341686,"question_id":58341501,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58341686","body_markdown":"It seems that the used compiler defines the macro `NULL` as a null-pointer constant `0L`.\r\n\r\nSo in this statement\r\n\r\n    t1 = std::make_tuple(NULL);\r\n\r\nthe type of the right expression is `std::tuple&lt;long&gt;`.\r\n\r\nTry to run the following demonstrative program\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;tuple&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;type_traits&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main() \r\n    {\r\n        auto t = std::make_tuple( NULL );\r\n    \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt;

not getting items because it&#39;s a `PagedList`. You need to trigger the load in order to obtain pages.\r\n\r\nThat is why giving the PagedList to a `PagedListAdapter` via `submitList` will eventually load the data.\r\n\r\nYou also don&#39;t need to manually invoke `adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()` when you&#39;re using a `PagedListAdapter`, because the DiffUtil will handle that internally.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nHowever, you should definitely be retrieving the `DataSource.Factory` and the `LivePagedListBuilder` and the `PagedList` on the UI thread (`Dispatcher.MAIN`), because threading is handled by the Paging lib&#39;s Room integration internally. Observing (and invoking `getItem(` on an unloaded element) will trigger the load, and the load will be executed asynchronously by the `DataSource` out of the box.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe way to use Paging is like this:\r\n\r\n    class MyViewModel(\r\n        private val workPackageStorageDao: WorkPackageStorageDao\r\n    ): ViewModel() {\r\n        private val searchQuery: MutableLiveData&lt;String&gt; = MutableLiveData(&quot;&quot;)\r\n\r\n        val workPackages: LiveData&lt;PagedList&lt;WorkPackage&gt;&gt; = Transformations.switchMap(searchQuery) { searchText -&gt;\r\n            val factory = workPackageStorageDao.searchWorkPackages(searchText, SortedBy.WorkPackageNumber)\r\n            val pagedListBuilder = LivePagedListBuilder&lt;Int, WorkPackage&gt;(factory, pagingLimit)\r\n            pagedListBuilder.build()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen in Fragment:\r\n\r\n    override fun onViewCreated(view: View?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\r\n        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)\r\n\r\n        // ... setup RecyclerView, etc\r\n\r\n        viewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(MyViewModel::class.java, viewModelFactory)\r\n        viewModel.workPackages.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, Observer { pagedList -&gt;\r\n            adapter.submitList(pagedList)\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd in adapter:\r\n\r\n    class MyAdapter: PagedListAdapter&lt;WorkPackage, MyAdapter.ViewHolder&gt;(WorkPackage.ITEM_CALLBACK) {\r\n         override fun onBindViewHolder(viewHolder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {\r\n             val workPackage = getItem(position)\r\n             if(workPackage != null) {\r\n                 holder.bind(workPackage)\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLong story short, you don&#39;t need coroutines here. Use the Paging Library and LiveData, and it will load on the correct threads.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341493/observe-not-called-with-livedatapagedlist/58342477#58342477","title":"Observe not called with LiveData&lt;PagedList&gt;"}],"owner":{"reputation":4116,"user_id":1250929,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89099b220ea58bae3f99779f7a8e33c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kristy Welsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1250929/kristy-welsh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4116,"user_id":1250929,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89099b220ea58bae3f99779f7a8e33c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kristy Welsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1250929/kristy-welsh"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58342477,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570803160,"creation_date":1570797655,"last_edit_date":1570801158,"question_id":58341493,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58341493","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using the PagedList architectural components using a Room database and I am having trouble returning results to the observe method.  \r\n\r\n&gt;Here is my Dao:\r\n\r\n    @Dao\r\n    interface WorkPackageStorageDao {\r\n\r\n        @Query(&quot;SELECT * from workpackages where id = :id&quot;)\r\n        fun getById(id: String): Workpackage\r\n\r\n        @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)\r\n        fun insert(workpackage: Workpackage)\r\n\r\n        @Query(&quot;Select * from workpackages WHERE id LIKE &#39;%&#39; || :searchString || &#39;%&#39; order by :orderBy&quot;)\r\n        fun searchWorkpackages(searchString : String, orderBy : String) : DataSource.Factory&lt;Int, Workpackage&gt;\r\n\r\n        @Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM workpackages&quot;)\r\n        fun searchWorkPackgesTest() : List&lt;Workpackage&gt;\r\n\r\n        @Query(&quot;Select * from workpackages WHERE id LIKE &#39;%&#39; || :searchString || &#39;%&#39; order by :orderBy&quot;)\r\n        fun searchWorkPackgesTestQuery(searchString : String, orderBy : String) : List&lt;Workpackage&gt;\r\n\r\n        @Query(&quot;DELETE from workpackages&quot;)\r\n        fun deleteAll()\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt;My repository:\r\n\r\n    fun getAllWorkPackagesTestQuery() : List&lt;Workpackage&gt; {\r\n        return workpackagesDao.searchWorkPackgesTestQuery(&quot;&quot;,SortedBy.WorkPackageNumber.type)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fun getAllWorkPackages() : DataSource.Factory&lt;Int, Workpackage&gt; {\r\n        return getSortedAndSearchedWorkPackages(&quot;&quot;,\r\n            SortedBy.WorkPackageNumber\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fun getSortedAndSearchedWorkPackages(searchString : String, sortBy: SortedBy) : DataSource.Factory&lt;Int, Workpackage&gt; {\r\n        return workpackagesDao.searchWorkpackages(searchString,sortBy.type)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt;Here is the method in my view model:\r\n\r\n    suspend fun fetchWorkPackagesInitial(\r\n        workWeek: Configurations.AppWeek,\r\n        pagingLimit: Int\r\n    ) {\r\n\r\n        coroutineScope {\r\n            withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {\r\n                val factory: DataSource.Factory&lt;Int, Workpackage&gt; =\r\n                    workPackageRepository.getAllWorkPackages()\r\n\r\n                val pagedListBuilder =\r\n                    LivePagedListBuilder&lt;Int, Workpackage&gt;(factory, pagingLimit)\r\n                workPackagesList = pagedListBuilder.build() \r\n                val list = workPackageRepository.getAllWorkPackagesTestQuery() //27 Items returned, query is fine. \r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;Here is my fragment:\r\n\r\n        mainViewModel.week.observe(this, Observer {\r\n            it ?: return@Observer\r\n\r\n            launch { workPackagesViewModel.fetchWorkPackagesInitial(it, PAGING_LIMIT) }\r\n\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        //Observe never called.  \r\n        workPackagesViewModel.workPackagesList?.observe(this, Observer { wpList -&gt;\r\n            wpList ?: return@Observer\r\n\r\n            adapter = WorkPackagesRecyclerAdapter(this)\r\n            adapter.submitList(wpList)\r\n            binding.workPackagesRecyclerView.adapter = adapter\r\n            adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()\r\n\r\n        })\r\n\r\nAs a test to my query, I&#39;ve implemented: \r\n\r\n    val list = workPackageRepository.getAllWorkPackagesTestQuery() \r\n\r\nwhich returns 27 items, so query is fine.

May be future improvements would be done in next release of ViewPager2.\r\n\r\nAnyways, for now to fix it, set layout params as MATCH_PARENT explicity.\r\n\r\n     view.setLayoutParams(new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));\r\n\r\nThis view is the parent view holding View Pager childs.\r\n\r\nIn you case it would be androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout.\r\n\r\n     view.setLayoutParams(new ConstraintLayout.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341487/pages-must-fill-the-whole-viewpager2-use-match-parent/58404428#58404428","title":"Pages must fill the whole ViewPager2 (use match_parent)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1094,"user_id":1888738,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e25583b7d25665091958dd858b12400b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bresiu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1888738/bresiu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571678991,"creation_date":1571678991,"answer_id":58491413,"question_id":58341487,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58491413","body_markdown":"I have found out that the problem is in inflating view holder.\r\n\r\nI had the same issue and solved it changing \r\n\r\n    ViewBinding.inflate(inflater)\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n    ViewBinding.inflate(inflater, parent, false)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341487/pages-must-fill-the-whole-viewpager2-use-match-parent/58491413#58491413","title":"Pages must fill the whole ViewPager2 (use match_parent)"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11560467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-q1nwPe4JWJA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd6tp1zNb2bwnzflS9voC4IAbU6SA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mahesh Babariya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11560467/mahesh-babariya"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":92,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571678991,"creation_date":1570797648,"question_id":58341487,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58341487","body_markdown":"I have an item layout where I display an image, product name, and product image.

can use Power Query to solve the problem. **Power Query** is available in Excel 2010 Professional Plus and later versions of Excel including Excel 2013.\r\n\r\nPlease note the following solution works on the assumption that **each target string contains forward lash `/` and the target string is separated by space `&quot; &quot;` with other words in the text**.\r\n\r\nTherefore my solution will not work on the following cases:\r\n\r\n&gt;`I need to remove this www.test.com from the sentence.` My solution cannot detect the link without forward slash `/`.\r\n\r\nnor\r\n\r\n&gt;`I need to remove thishttp://www.test.com from the sentence.` My solution will remove `thishttp://www.text.com` from the sentence as there is no space between `this` and the link.\r\n\r\nnor\r\n\r\n&gt;`I/TerryW need to remove this www.test.com from the sentence.` My solution will remove `I/TerryW` from the sentence but not the link as the former contains forward slash &quot;/&quot;.\r\n\r\nIf you can tolerant the above limitations, let&#39;s begin:\r\n\r\n 1. Load your data (which is a column with thousands of rows) to the power query editor;\r\n 2. Add an **Index Column** to assign a unique number to each string;\r\n 3. Use **Replace Values** function in the `Transform` tab to replace special characters such as `Line Break` or `Carriage Return` with space `&quot; &quot;`, repeat this step as many times as needed to make sure there is a space sit between the target string and other words;\r\n 4. Use **Split Columns** function to split the column by delimiter space `&quot; &quot;` and make sure to put the results into **Rows** in the advanced option;\r\n 5. **Add a custom column** using this function `=Text.Contains([Column1],&quot;/&quot;)` where `[Column1]` is the column being splited in the last step. This function will return `TRUE` for string that contains forward slash `/`;\r\n 6. **Filter** the custom column to show `FALSE` results only;\r\n 7. Use **Group By** function to group `[Column1]` by the index column as shown below:\r\n\r\n[![Group By][1]][1]\r\n\r\n 8. Go back to last step in the power query editor, go to the formula bar, and replace this part of the formula `List.Sum([Column1])` with `Text.Combine([Column1],&quot; &quot;)`, and remove the index column;\r\n\r\nOnce done, you can **close and load** the output to a new worksheet (by default).\r\n\r\nHere is the sample data I used:\r\n\r\nString1\r\n\r\n    Caller reported trouble completing form as a requirement of their job.

For instance, you can use `Text.Replace` function in PQ Editor to replace `http` with `(space)http` to add a space in front of each target string, and you can add an extra step to evaluate the length of all strings that contain forward slash `/` and normally the http link will have a large length than a natural word so you can eliminate the case where `/` is used in between nature words. Sorry for being lazy but given that there is insufficient sample data (and I am running out of spare time), I will not elaborate all potential solutions.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

does the value the value u doesn&#39;t get returned?\r\n\r\nBecause the `return` statement just returns out of the function passed to `forEach` it does not return from the outer `filter` method. You should instead use `find` and return the result:\r\n\r\n    filterTrainStations: function() {\r\n    \r\n        // Direction where the train has to go to.\r\n        const city = this.city.mediumName; // New York\r\n    \r\n        return this.response.payload.departures.filter(function(u) {\r\n            // Only return the trains which go to the right direction. \r\n            if(u.direction === city) {\r\n                return u;\r\n            }   \r\n    \r\n            // Check if there are any trains with the desired city on their route.\r\n            return u.routeStations.find(arrayItem =&gt; arrayItem.mediumName === city);\r\n        }\r\n    )},\r\n\r\nBut this raises another issue - the lines of code are themselves inside a `filter` where you should be returning `true` or `false` depending on if you want that item included or not in the result. Without more info it is hard to reconcile the actual problem you&#39;re having. However, returning *anything* truthy will result in that `departures` item being included in the result.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would do it as [MKougiouris answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58341547/219661) suggests, as it is much clearer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341456/value-from-for-each-loop-doesnt-get-returned/58341526#58341526","title":"Value from for each loop doesn&#39;t get returned"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":100526,"user_id":219661,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74a47a4e97bae5982d32950f4af2f5d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jamiec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/219661/jamiec"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570798096,"post_id":58341547,"comment_id":103038349,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341456/value-from-for-each-loop-doesnt-get-returned/58341547#comment103038349_58341547"},{"owner":{"reputation":1727,"user_id":2425942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd77d87d3a28be0cd12a1a9de8601137?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MKougiouris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2425942/mkougiouris"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":100526,"user_id":219661,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74a47a4e97bae5982d32950f4af2f5d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jamiec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/219661/jamiec"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570798248,"post_id":58341547,"comment_id":103038422,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341456/value-from-for-each-loop-doesnt-get-returned/58341547#comment103038422_58341547"},{"owner":{"reputation":100526,"user_id":219661,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74a47a4e97bae5982d32950f4af2f5d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jamiec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/219661/jamiec"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570798317,"post_id":58341547,"comment_id":103038461,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341456/value-from-for-each-loop-doesnt-get-returned/58341547#comment103038461_58341547"},{"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":7603806,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uMsNZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Baspa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7603806/baspa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570798798,"post_id":58341547,"comment_id":103038704,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341456/value-from-for-each-loop-doesnt-get-returned/58341547#comment103038704_58341547"},{"owner":{"reputation":1727,"user_id":2425942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd77d87d3a28be0cd12a1a9de8601137?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MKougiouris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2425942/mkougiouris"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570799096,"post_id":58341547,"comment_id":103038864,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341456/value-from-for-each-loop-doesnt-get-returned/58341547#comment103038864_58341547"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1727,"user_id":2425942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd77d87d3a28be0cd12a1a9de8601137?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MKougiouris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2425942/mkougiouris"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1727,"user_id":2425942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd77d87d3a28be0cd12a1a9de8601137?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MKougiouris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2425942/mkougiouris"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570798953,"last_edit_date":1570798953,"creation_date":1570797903,"answer_id":58341547,"question_id":58341456,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58341547","body_markdown":"Your filter callback is not proper for what you want to achieve.\r\nTry this one below :\r\n\r\n\r\n    filterTrainStations: function() {\r\n    \r\n        // Direction where the train has to go to.\r\n        const city = this.city.mediumName;

working on a project that has many modules and some modules have relation with others. For example, I have a `Meeting` module. Users can request meetings and create agendas for them. On the other hand, there is a `Balloting` module. Users can create and publish ballots. While requesting a meeting at some point a balloting starts. \r\n\r\nHere is the point that I have struggle. `Meeting` and `Ballot` modules has its own controllers. Now, I have an action in `BallotController` and `MeetingController` uses that to start a balloting session. In `BallotController` the action that starts the session requests controller name and some other info like `Id` of the meeting request.

One `Bar` has many `Baz`. Their structures are as follows:\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Foo {\r\n  id: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Bar {\r\n  id: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  fooId: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Baz {\r\n  id: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  barId: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the regular thunks/actions setup for each part of the state, i.e `DELETE_FOO_REQUEST`, `DELETE_FOO_FAILURE` `DELETE_FOO_SUCCESS` and other CRUD options for each of the entities.\r\n\r\nMy delete foo thunk looks like this:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction deleteFoo(fooId) {\r\n  return async (dispatch, getState) =&gt; {\r\n    dispatch(deleteFooRequest());\r\n\r\n    await api.deleteFoo(fooId);\r\n\r\n    dispatch(deleteFooSuccess(fooId);\r\n    // omitted error handling for brevity\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe thing is: **when I delete a `Foo` on my api/backend it also deletes all related `Bar`s and `Baz`s**. Now how do I handle this while using `redux-thunk` conventions?\r\n\r\nDo I create more actions of the form `DELETE_BARS_FOR_FOO` and dispatch those in the same thunk? Or do I reuse `DELETE_BAR_SUCCESS` and use it in a loop? \r\n\r\n**Option A**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction deleteFoo(fooId) {\r\n  return async (dispatch, getState) =&gt; {\r\n    dispatch(deleteFooRequest());\r\n\r\n    await api.deleteFoo(fooId);\r\n\r\n    const barIds: string[] = selectBarsForFoo(fooId);\r\n\r\n    dispatch(deleteFooSuccess(fooId);\r\n    dispatch(deleteBarsForFoo(fooId);\r\n\r\n    for (const barId of barIds) {\r\n      dispatch(deleteBazForBar(barId));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // omitted error handling for brevity\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Option B**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction deleteFoo(fooId) {\r\n  return async (dispatch, getState) =&gt; {\r\n    dispatch(deleteFooRequest());\r\n\r\n    await api.deleteFoo(fooId);\r\n\r\n    const barIds: string[] = selectBarsForFoo(fooId);\r\n\r\n    dispatch(deleteFooSuccess(fooId);\r\n    for (const barId of barIds) {\r\n      dispatch(deleteBarSuccess(barId));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // followed by a similar loop for the bazs of each bar\r\n    // omitted error handling for brevity\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn option B case I am reusing an action meant for something else technically. In both actions I&#39;m dispatching in a loop which would impact performance as well. I am using react-redux however and can use the [`batch()`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/batch) api so no worries there.\r\n\r\nAre these my only two options while using `redux-thunk` or is there a superior/conventional way of going about this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341431/redux-removing-entities-from-related-state","title":"Redux - Removing entities from related state"},{"tags":["jpql","criteria-api"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4746104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10203222314713270/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shivang Chauhan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4746104/shivang-chauhan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570797400,"creation_date":1570797400,"question_id":58341430,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58341430","body_markdown":"    SELECT p FROM Part p WHERE EXISTS (SELECT p1  +\r\n     FROM Part p1, IAssigned ia , HMember hm , User u , Role r  +\r\n     WHERE ia.fromPart.id=p1.id  +\r\n     AND ia.toRole.id=r.id   +\r\n     AND hm.fromAssigned.id=ia.id  +\r\n     AND hm.toUser.id=u.id  +\r\n     AND u.name=:sso  +\r\n     AND p1.id=p.id  +\r\n     AND ia.stopEff is  null   +\r\n     AND hm.startEff is not null AND hm.startEff &lt;= sysdate AND ( (hm.stopEff is null ) OR (hm.stopEff is not null  +`enter code here`\r\n     and hm.stopEff &gt; sysdate))  +\r\n     )AND p.status=&#39;Active&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would be the related Criteria query for this?

Just want to elaborate the deepth of indexing cost. **Keep in mind nested field opens query facilities also**\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you use nested type and **infrequent** modification then it is awesome and creates broader scope for query but if you do **frequent** change then it will do huge cost. \r\n\r\n`nested` type mapping has more impact in terms of indexing over flat type mappings. Since **Lucene does not have any concept of nested object types, and everything is stored as flat objects**. So there is an additional operation performed at the indexing time.\r\n\r\nImagine you have a large nested document that translates to 100k internal documents and compare this to a flat data model where we have indexed the 100k parts as independent documents. If we add a single nested document at the deepest, nested level, this would add a single flat document while the nested document would end up reindexing 100k+ 1 documents. If you on the other hand change something at the root, all documents need to be updated in both cases. So you can imagine a single doc change can cost you reindexing all nested field of that document. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341418/elasticsearch-nested-vs-flat-indicies/58353677#58353677","title":"Elasticsearch : nested VS flat indicies"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11579923,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-p49AOKDSORc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc6oTO7yCuRZnbwZ6sUanacq_OsRg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bloub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11579923/bloub"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570879877,"creation_date":1570797367,"question_id":58341418,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58341418","body_markdown":"What are the pros and cons of a nested index in Elasticsearch ? \r\n\r\nI am thinking about temporal data of some users or devices so by flat I mean all data are stored at the root of the index and nested I mean data is group by device / id.

others have said, you probably require an actual list, persumably within your class, if it provides any functionality on the members above what built-in Python collections already do.

Another |\r\n |piece of text.             |`\r\n\r\nThis is the desired UI are you are trying to achieve right? So From your question, it is clear that you want two text widget one under another.\r\n\r\nso this code will work for you. replace `Row` with `Column` widget like this. If you want to continue with Row each of your text will wrap but not one text after another. here is the working code. I have putted two text to show you that how they wrap one after another. Checkout the image below to see the result\r\n\r\n    body: Center(\r\n        child: Container(\r\n          color: Colors.amberAccent,\r\n          width: 200,\r\n          height: 200,\r\n          child: Padding(\r\n            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),\r\n            child: Column(\r\n              children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                Flexible(\r\n                  fit: FlexFit.tight,\r\n                  child: Text(\r\n                    &#39;This is some text.long text more long Text, even more long text&#39;,\r\n                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20.0),\r\n                  ),\r\n                ),\r\n                Flexible(\r\n                  fit: FlexFit.tight,\r\n                  child: Text(\r\n                    &#39;Another piece of text.not so long text yet needs to be a liitle long text&#39;,\r\n                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20.0),\r\n                  ),\r\n                )\r\n              ],\r\n            ),\r\n          ),\r\n        ),\r\n      ),\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is the screenshot [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z9pKm.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58341375/how-to-wrap-a-row-of-texts/58341666#58341666","title":"How to wrap a row of texts?"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":8717097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcec81511625179bdcdb2735523f11ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user213294","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8717097/user213294"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33,"user_id":8717097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcec81511625179bdcdb2735523f11ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user213294","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8717097/user213294"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570802875,"creation_date":1570797226,"last_edit_date":1570802875,"question_id":58341375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58341375","body_markdown":"I have two Text widgets inside a Row.
