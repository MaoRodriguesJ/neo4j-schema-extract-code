The maths for a levelling system could be a simple or complicated as you like depending if you want xp scaling to make it take longer to level up per level etc. \r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58506276/xp-system-in-swift/58506504#58506504","title":"XP system in Swift"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12257840,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/216366a6cde217aefac7870f09053a2a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mosc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12257840/mosc"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571765222,"answer_count":1,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571754462,"creation_date":1571753691,"question_id":58506276,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58506276","body_markdown":"Is there a Good way to build a simple XP system with level-up function in Swift for a game? \r\n\r\nI can’t seem to find any Good info on this matter.

We utilize jooq for our DB accesses, and I&#39;ve really been liking it as a whole.\r\n\r\nMy question is in regards to the role of DTOs when using a tool like jooq that generates POJOs automatically. Let&#39;s say I have a Get Record endpoint that the frontend uses to grab multiple Records (that directly correspond to entries in the DB), and then it modifies some values on these Records, and then does a Post/Patch to the backend to update them in the DB. Should the request/response Record objects be wrapped in a DTO?\r\n\r\nI obviously see the value in keeping things as decoupled as possible, but at the same time, it feels like this would end up creating a ton of boilerplate code when multiple DBs are involved, and possibly increase the number of places that updates to code/schema would be necessary on changes. I assume this is a more subjective thing, but I was curious of others&#39; thoughts. When taken too far, I know from experience that &quot;enterprise Java&quot; can become unwieldy quickly.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I&#39;m wrong and just being lazy!

(In for instance Haskell, functions on iterators return the appropriate kind of result iterator, which does not become a &#39;bigger and bigger compound type&#39;.)\r\nRewriting this as a recursive function had similar problems because (a) I was returning &#39;some kind of Iterator&#39; whose type was (near?)-impossible to write out by hand because of the recursion, and (b) this type was different in the base case from the recursive case.\r\n\r\nI found [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50204370/1067339) about conditionally returning either one or the other iterator type, as well as using `impl Iterator` to indicate that we return some concrete type that implements the Iterator trait, but we do not care about its exact nature. \r\nA similar example to the code in the linked answer has been implemented in the code below as `maybe_flatmap`. This works.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don&#39;t want to run `flat_map` zero or one time, but rather `N` times on the incoming iterator. Therefore, I adapted the code to call itself recursively up to a depth of `N`.\r\n\r\nAttempting to do that, then makes the Rust compiler complain with an `error[E0720]: opaque type expands to a recursive type`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse either::Either; // 1.5.3\r\n\r\n/// Later we want to work with any appropriate items,\r\n/// but for simplicity&#39;s sake, just use plain integers for now.\r\ntype I = u64;\r\n\r\n/// Works, but limited to single level.\r\nfn maybe_flatmap&lt;T: Iterator&lt;Item = I&gt;&gt;(iter: T, flag: bool) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = I&gt; {\r\n    match flag {\r\n        false =&gt; Either::Left(iter),\r\n        true =&gt; Either::Right(iter.flat_map(move |x| vec![x, x * 2].into_iter())),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/// Does not work: opaque type expands to a recursive type!\r\nfn rec_flatmap&lt;T: Iterator&lt;Item = I&gt;&gt;(iter: T, depth: usize) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = I&gt; {\r\n    match depth {\r\n        0 =&gt; Either::Left(iter),\r\n        _ =&gt; {\r\n            let iter2 = iter.flat_map(move |x| vec![x, x * 2]).into_iter();\r\n            Either::Right(rec_flatmap(iter2, depth - 1))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let xs = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\r\n    let xs2 = xs.into_iter();\r\n    let xs3 = maybe_flatmap(xs2, true);\r\n    let xs4: Vec&lt;_&gt; = xs3.collect();\r\n    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, xs4);\r\n\r\n    let ys = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\r\n    let ys2 = ys.into_iter();\r\n    let ys3 = rec_flatmap(ys2, 5);\r\n    let ys4: Vec&lt;_&gt; = ys3.collect();\r\n    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, ys4);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=release&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=de3f050add5fd958c3916e0426b8381d)\r\n\r\n```none\r\nerror[E0720]: opaque type expands to a recursive type\r\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:16:65\r\n   |\r\n16 | fn rec_flatmap&lt;T: Iterator&lt;Item = I&gt;&gt;(iter: T, depth: usize) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = I&gt; {\r\n   |                                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expands to a recursive type\r\n   |\r\n   = note: expanded type is `either::Either&lt;T, impl std::iter::Iterator&gt;`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am stuck. \r\n\r\nSince regardless of how often you `flat_map`, the final answer is going to be an (iterator over) a vector of integers, it seems like there ought to be a way of writing this function using only a single concrete return type. \r\n\r\nIs this possible? Is there a way out of this situation _without resorting to  runtime polymorphism_?\r\n\r\nI believe/hope that a solution without dynamic polymorphism (trait objects or the like) is possible because regardless of how often you call `flat_map` the end result should have (at least morally) have the same type. I hope there is a way to shoehorn the (non-matching) nested `FlatMap` struct in a matching single static type somehow.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58506199/how-to-perform-a-flat-map-or-similar-operation-on-an-iterator-n-times-withou","title":"How to perform a `flat_map` (or similar operation) on an iterator N times without runtime polymorphism?"},{"tags":["windows","windows-10","access","rdp","gpo"],"owner":{"reputation":514,"user_id":1275179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ad04ec7cf99317cb1e7cc25e0687099?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rusty009","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1275179/rusty009"},"last_editor":{"reputation":514,"user_id":1275179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ad04ec7cf99317cb1e7cc25e0687099?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rusty009","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1275179/rusty009"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571754857,"creation_date":1571753375,"last_edit_date":1571754857,"question_id":58506194,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58506194","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve just been troubleshooting why I can RDP from one non-domain machine to a domain machine, but not from another non-domain machine to the same domain machine.

*Either*: Remove the following entries from your `$env:PATH` variable.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nC:\\Users\\caio1\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\\LocalState\\rootfs\\home\\caiodomingos\\.nvm\\versions\\node\\v10.16.3\\bin\r\nC:\\Users\\caio1\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\\LocalState\\rootfs\\home\\caiodomingos\\.nvm\\versions\\node\\v10.16.3\\lib\r\n```\r\n\r\n* *Or*: Invoke `npm` as `npm.cmd` and `node` as `node.exe`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYour symptom implies the following:\r\n\r\n* There is a directory in your `$env:PATH `variable that contains a file named _just_ `npm` - *without a filename extension*...\r\n\r\n* *and* that directory doesn&#39;t *also* contain files with the same but an _executable filename extension_, such as `.cmd` or `.exe`...\r\n\r\n* *and* that directory is listed _first_ in `$env:PATH`, before any other directories that `npm` files _with_ executable extensions, such as `npm.cmd`, ... \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a normal NodeJS installation on Windows (installed in `$env:ProgramFiles\\NodeJs` by default), the installation folder contains a `npm.cmd` batch file for invoking npm, alongside a Unix shell script in the same folder named just `npm` - *without a filename extension*.\r\n\r\n`npm.cmd` takes precedence over the extension-less `npm`, so invoking just `npm` works as expected.\r\n\r\n`C:\\Users\\caio1\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\\LocalState\\rootfs\\home\\caiodomingos\\.nvm\\versions\\node\\v10.16.3\\bin` is a directory containing a *Linux* installation of NodeJs.\r\n\r\nIn a Linux installation, there is obviously no need for a _batch file_, so only an extension-less `npm` Unix shell script is present.\r\n\r\nSince this directory comes _before_ your regular NodeJS installation directory (`D:\\Program Files\\nodejs`) in your `$env:PATH` value, PowerShell attempts to invoke the extension-less Unix shell script when you submit `npm`, which - predictably - fails.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, because the `npm` file has no *executable* file name extension, PowerShell invokes it as a _document_ rather than as an executable, and fails to do so because no application is registered with the Windows (graphical) shell (File Explorer) for opening documents that have no filename extension.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58506104/cannot-invoke-npm-in-powershell-even-though-it-is-in-the-systems-path/58507384#58507384","title":"Cannot invoke npm in PowerShell,

configuring video conference and chat system including different services as synapse Matrix homeserver, Riot web client, Jitsi Meet components (web, XMPP prosody server, jicofo, jvb), etc. Riot is linked with self-hosted integrations manager so it can embed a Jitsi widget by specifying valid conference ID -- it can be obtained during conf&#39; creation at Jitsi web interface. All of described services are launched in docker containers via docker-compose. I faced a pair of unclear points which stops my current work. \r\n\r\n**For first**, I can&#39;t find any way to manually remove created video conference. Appropriate web interface just shows me the following list of already created conf&#39;s and provides a possibility for adding another one, but there is no option to remove existing elements. Does Jitsi support such feature at all? Moreover, I can&#39;t even locate conference info inside any of containers or on host machine itself. `docker-compose down` **do not** flush the conference data.\r\n\r\n**Secondly**, a possible solution to previous problem may be setting up a conference reservation system, which can potentially create a new one when moderators add video widget in Riot client and delete a conference when there are no participants for long time, greater than specified timeout. Unfortunately, google does not help a lot with reservation configuring. All that I have found is the [document](https://github.com/jitsi/jicofo/blob/master/doc/reservation.md) that guides me to set the following\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.jitsi.impl.reservation.rest.BASE_URL=http://reservation.example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the jicofo component config file. However, the location is supposed to be valid only for Debian jitsi installation, which is not appropriate for my docker environment. \r\n\r\nHas anyone faced similar problems?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58506101/jitsi-videoconferencing-managing-reservation-system","title":"Jitsi videoconferencing managing &amp; reservation

See FCM [documentation][1].\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can send a push notification through firebase by using firebase HTTP protocol instead of the firebase console. In this way, you can programmatically send a push notification by making a REST call.\r\nThere are 2 firebase HTTP protocols that you may use to achieve this:\r\n\r\n 1. [Legacy protocol][2]:\r\nThis is the older firebase HTTP protocol. This is easier to set up and you can find a lot of material online explaining how to use this like medium [article][3].\r\n 2. [New protocol][4](HTTP V1):\r\nThis is the newer HTTP protocol. This is a little more difficult as authentication is done by oAuth token. However, this is more secure and extensible. Also, it seems like firebase might eventually deprecate the legacy API.\r\n\r\nHence, in your app, once the in charge of suppliers assigns the duties, you can call the firebase APIs to send out push notifications to all the assigned suppliers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging\r\n  [2]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref\r\n  [3]: https://medium.com/android-school/test-fcm-notification-with-postman-f91ba08aacc3\r\n  [4]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58506067/sending-notification-from-one-app-client-to-another/58525594#58525594","title":"Sending notification from one app client to another"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12065046,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a186af07e92a143c3b8a18d8e2977a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DBHari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12065046/dbhari"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34008,"user_id":2649012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4SzF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fant&#244;mas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649012/fant%c3%b4mas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571842261,"creation_date":1571752955,"last_edit_date":1571828244,"question_id":58506067,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58506067","body_markdown":"I am developing an android app, which deals with allocating orders to multiple suppliers.

It makes no sense to pass it to a method if it does not do anything with it.\r\n\r\n&gt; The way how I have handled CancellationToken is correct or Do I need to modify anything?\r\n\r\nHard to tell, we need to know what your code does.\r\n\r\nIf the service is going to shut down it will use the CancellationToken to cancel any pending work. If you have any async calls that accept a CancellationToken you should pass it to that method so it can exit when cancellation is requested.\r\n\r\nIf you have some other methods like `Method1()` and it does some long running work you can still exit when cancellation is requested by either using `CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested` or `CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested`. The latter will throw an `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation is requested.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can do this:\r\n\r\n\tpublic void Method1(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// some work\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tif(cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)\r\n\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\r\n\t\t// some more work\r\n\t\r\n\t\tif (cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)\r\n\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\r\n\t\t// some more work\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nIt is up to you to decide whether the method has some logical points to check for cancellation or that the method is so fast it won&#39;t make much difference.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is not specific to service fabric, you can find more docs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-cancellation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58506052/cancellation-token-usage-in-service-fabric/58510037#58510037","title":"Cancellation Token usage in Service fabric"}],"owner":{"reputation":612,"user_id":5906715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5281f5730d63ac84d702d5584077edf3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Balanjaneyulu K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5906715/balanjaneyulu-k"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571767612,"creation_date":1571752893,"question_id":58506052,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58506052","body_markdown":"I have created a Service Fabric Application.

So I had used CancellationToken in my project.\r\n\r\n#Here is my code#\r\n\r\n    RunAsync (System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken);\r\n    {\r\n     LoadData(CancellationToken);\r\n    }\r\n    Async Task LoadData(CancellationToken)\r\n    {\r\n     Method1(CancellationToken) -- Aync call\r\n     Method2() -- Normal call\r\n     Method3() -- Normal call\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I have Method1, which is an asynchronous call and it runs as a separate thread so the same token is being passed to this method as the main thread will not aware of the child thread.\r\nHowever, Method2 and Method3 are just functional calls so the CancellationToken is not passed because there are running in the context of the main thread.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of questions on CancellationToken usage in Service Fabric.\r\n1. Do we need to pass the CancellationToken for all methods that are being called from the Long-running method( Async/ Sync)?\r\n2. The way how I have handled CancellationToken is correct or Do I need to modify
