How should I handle the requirements of a default value, which is represented via `props`, and the automatic update necessitating `onChange` handler?\r\n\r\nIf I use `value` to set the text of the

Now that testing data is available, it is clear that the changes below have no effect on run-time. The described techniques are only effective when the inner loop is very efficient (on the order of 5-10 dict lookups), making it more efficient still by removing some of the said lookups. Here the `r[i]` item lookup dwarfs anything else by *orders of magnitude*, so the optimizations are simply irrelevant.\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nYour outer loop takes 5000 iterations, and your inner loop 20000 iterations. This means that you are executing 100 million iterations in 23 minutes, i.e. that each iteration takes 13.8 μs. That is not fast, even in Python.\r\n\r\nI would try to cut down the run-time by stripping any unnecessary work from the inner loop. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* convert `for n in range(len(res))` followed by `res[n]` to `for r in res`. I don&#39;t know how efficient item lookup is in pandas, but it&#39;s better to do it in the outer than in the inner loop.\r\n* move the `score` attribute lookup to the outer loop.\r\n* get rid of `defaultdict` and pre-create the lists and use an ordinary dict.\r\n* avoid dict stores at all and work on the lists directly, pre-creating them in a sequence. Only create a dictionary at the end.\r\n* cache the lookup of the `append` list method, and prepare in advance the `(append, i)` pairs that the inner loop needs.\r\n\r\nHere is code that implements the above suggestions:\r\n\r\n    # pre-create the lists\r\n    lsts = [[] for _ in range(len(indices_ordered))]\r\n    # prepare the pairs (appendfn, i)\r\n    fast_append = [(l.append, i)\r\n                   for (l, i) in zip(lsts, indices_ordered)]\r\n\r\n    for r in res:\r\n        # pre-fetch res[n].score\r\n        r_score = r.score\r\n        for append, i in fast_append:\r\n            append(r_score[i])\r\n\r\n    # finally, create the dict out of the lists\r\n    dct = {i: lst for (i, lst) in zip(indices_ordered, lsts)}\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57980058/is-there-a-way-to-run-this-python-snippet-faster/57980441#57980441","title":"Is there a way to run this Python snippet

I simply followed a tutorial with changed parameters, and I utilized scipy.integrate to simulate my MPC. It works on one of my computer but not on my NVIDIA Jetson TX2. And got the &quot;Exec format error&quot; when running m.solve(disp=False).\r\n\r\nBoth computer have both python2 and python3. Since I am also running ROS, I would like to use python2 to run the script. Initially I thought it might be the using python2 to interpret is causing the problem, so i wrote another script utilizing subprocess to interpret my mpc and simulator as python3. However, this problem persist. The problem seems to be within gekko package. I am sure it is an environment error, since the script did run fine on my personal computer. Currently I am running Ubuntu 16.04.\r\n\r\n    def example_MPC(t_init, x, u_init):\r\n        m = GEKKO(remote=False)\r\n        dt = 0.5\r\n        m.time = np.linspace(t_init,10+t_init,21)\r\n        #...\r\n        m.solve(disp=False)       # &lt;-- The error appears on this line\r\n        #...\r\n        return p.value[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the error message from the terminal:\r\n\r\n      Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;ode_solver.py&quot;, line 53, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n        simulation()\r\n      File &quot;ode_solver.py&quot;, line 34, in simulation\r\n        u[i] = example_MPC(t[i-1], v0, u[i-1])\r\n      File &quot;.../src/MPC_test.py&quot;, line 34, in example_MPC\r\n        m.solve(disp=False)\r\n      File &quot;/home/nvidia/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/gekko/gekko.py&quot;, line 1880, in solve\r\n        env = {&quot;PATH&quot; : self._path }, universal_newlines=True)\r\n      File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.5/subprocess.py&quot;, line 947, in __init__\r\n        restore_signals, start_new_session)\r\n      File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.5/subprocess.py&quot;, line 1551, in _execute_child\r\n        raise child_exception_type(errno_num, err_msg)\r\n      OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nI found the apm folder location.

However, MPC is not able to run in real time, which is definitely a problem for me. \r\n\r\nI am now trying to solve this problem on a local desktop. Is the server argument just the local ip address? I set:\r\n\r\n    m = GEKKO(remote=True, server=&quot;192.168.1.136&quot;)\r\n\r\nIt returns:\r\n\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n    File &quot;.../src/ode_solver.py&quot;, line 53, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n        simulation()\r\n      File &quot;.../src/ode_solver.py&quot;, line 34, in simulation\r\n        u[i] = example_MPC(t[i-1], v0, u[i-1])\r\n      File &quot;.../src/MPC_test.py&quot;, line 34, in example_MPC\r\n        m.solve(disp=False)\r\n      File &quot;.../.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gekko/gekko.py&quot;, line 1992, in solve\r\n        raise ImportError(&#39;Results files not found.

If you are not familiar with state management in nowadays SPAs, you basically have global container - state. You can change it only via functions called mutations (synchronous). However, you cannot call them directly from your component. That&#39;s what functions called actions (asynchronous) are for. The whole flow is: actions =&gt; mutations =&gt; state. Once you have saved your desired data in state, you can access it in any of your vue component via functions called getters.\r\n\r\nAnother option, in case you just need the data visible in your parent only, is to simply emit the data from FacebookComp.vue and listen for event in View.vue. Note that to make this work, FacebookComp.vue has to be a child of View.vue.

Here are timing results for the original Julia version on the same system:\r\n\r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.222335 seconds (654.98 k allocations: 38.342 MiB)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.019425 seconds (100.00 k allocations: 10.681 MiB, 37.52% gc time)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.010103 seconds (100.00 k allocations: 10.681 MiB)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.012553 seconds (100.00 k allocations: 10.681 MiB)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.011470 seconds (100.00 k allocations: 10.681 MiB)\r\n\r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.025003 seconds (100.00 k allocations: 10.681 MiB, 52.82% gc time)\r\n\r\nThe first run includes JIT compilation and takes ~0.2s whereas after that each run takes 10-20ms. That breaks down into ~10ms of actual compute time and ~10s of garbage collection time triggered every four calls or so. That means that Julia is about 10-20x faster than Python, excluding JIT compilation time, which is not bad for a straight port.\r\n\r\nWhy not count JIT time when benchmarking? Because you don&#39;t actually care about how long it takes to run fast programs like benchmarks. You&#39;re timing small benchmark problems to extrapolate how long it it will take to run larger problems where speed really matters. JIT compilation time is proportional to the amount of *code* you&#39;re compiling not to problem size. So when solving larger problems that you actually care about, the JIT compilation will still only take 0.2s, which is a negligible fraction of execution time for large problems.\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s see about making the Julia code even faster. This is actually very simple: use a tuple instead of a row vector for your state. So initialize the state as `state = (0, 0, 0, 0)` and then update the state similarly:\r\n\r\n    new_state = (x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot)\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it, otherwise the code is identical. For this version the timings are:\r\n\r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.132459 seconds (479.53 k allocations: 24.020 MiB)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.008218 seconds (4 allocations: 160 bytes)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.007230 seconds (4 allocations: 160 bytes)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.005379 seconds (4 allocations: 160 bytes)\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt; @time run_sim()\r\n      0.008773 seconds (4 allocations: 160 bytes)\r\n\r\nThe first run still includes JIT time. Subsequent runs are now 5-10ms, which is about 25-40x faster than the Python version. Note that there are almost no allocations—small, fixed numbers of allocations are just for return values and won&#39;t trigger GC if this is called from other code in a loop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979983/cart-pole-python-performance-comparison/57980824#57980824","title":"Cart-Pole Python Performance Comparison"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21870,"user_id":659248,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/21aeae1f260365557523718bc19640f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"StefanKarpinski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/659248/stefankarpinski"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568749846,"post_id":57981006,"comment_id":102371483,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979983/cart-pole-python-performance-comparison/57981006#comment102371483_57981006"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":211,"user_id":10992667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMP9j.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakob Nissen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10992667/jakob-nissen"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568749120,"creation_date":1568749120,"answer_id":57981006,"question_id":57979983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57981006","body_markdown":"Okay, so I&#39;ve just run your Python and Julia code, and I get different results: 1.41 s for 10m iterations for Julia, 25.5 seconds for 10m iterations for Python.

I&#39;m using the new RUN `mount=type-cache...` option to allow caching the the bunder results for subsequent builds. However, nothing appears to be cached, ever. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m using docker 19.03.01 for both docker client and server. I have enabled buildkit on builds vie envar `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` Note that ssh mounts seem to be working, but not cache mounts. I have these lines in my Dockerfile to run bundler\r\n\r\n    # syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental\r\n    FROM ruby:2.4.6\r\n    ENV BUNDLE_PATH=/bundler\r\n    RUN gem install bundle\r\n    RUN mkdir /app &amp;&amp; mkdir /bundler\r\n    ADD . /app\r\n    WORKDIR /app\r\n    ENV BUNDLE_PATH=/bundler\r\n    RUN mount=type=cache,target=/bundler ls -la /bundler/cache; bundle install\r\n\r\nThe project directory can contain nothing but a Gemfile (called `Gemfile`) with the following contents:\r\n\r\n    source &quot;https://rubygems.org&quot;\r\n    gem &quot;humanize&quot;\r\n    gem &quot;i18n&quot;\r\n    gem &quot;rake&quot; \r\n\r\nI am running the build as follows:\r\n\r\n    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . --progress=plain\r\n\r\nOn the first run, the attempt to list `/bundler/cache` fails as expected, and bundler runs. Running the container verifies that everything is installed under /bundler as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the gemfile is changed, running docker build again, results in the exact same output -- the `ls` command fails, and bundler rebuilds the entire gemfile. I would expect the ls command to show me the contents of `/bundler` from the last run, and I would expect the `bundler install` command to only build changed gems.\r\n\r\nI can see that a cache is getting created somewhere, as `docker builder prune` does actually prune things after the command is run. But any cache does not seem to be used on subsequent builds.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is the run stage on the first build with the rake gem removed:\r\n\r\n    #12 [6/6] RUN mount=type=cache,target=/bundler ls -la /bundler/cache; \r\n    bundle...\r\n    #12 1.154 ls: cannot access &#39;/bundler/cache&#39;: No such file or directory\r\n    #12 3.059 Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...\r\n    #12 3.292 Resolving dependencies...\r\n    #12 3.305 Using bundler 1.17.3\r\n    #12 3.306 Fetching concurrent-ruby 1.1.5\r\n    #12 3.377 Installing concurrent-ruby 1.1.5\r\n    #12 3.483 Fetching humanize 2.1.2\r\n    #12 3.568 Installing humanize 2.1.2\r\n    #12 3.606 Fetching i18n 1.6.0\r\n    #12 3.654 Installing i18n 1.6.0\r\n    #12 3.691 Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 4 gems now installed.\r\n\r\nThis is as expected. Then when I add the rake gem into the Gemfile, and rebuild:\r\n\r\n    #12 [6/6] RUN mount=type=cache,target=/bundler ls -la /bundler/cache; \r\n    bundle...\r\n    #12 1.186 ls: cannot access &#39;/bundler/cache&#39;: No such file or directory\r\n    #12 3.355 Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...\r\n    #12 3.562 Resolving dependencies...\r\n    #12 3.579 Fetching rake 12.3.3\r\n    #12 3.658 Installing rake 12.3.3\r\n    #12 3.718 Using bundler 1.17.3\r\n    #12 3.719 Fetching concurrent-ruby 1.1.5\r\n    #12 3.875 Installing concurrent-ruby 1.1.5\r\n    #12 4.029 Fetching humanize 2.1.2\r\n    #12 4.068 Installing humanize 2.1.2\r\n    #12 4.103 Fetching i18n 1.6.0\r\n    #12 4.142 Installing i18n 1.6.0\r\n    #12 4.184 Bundle complete! 3 Gemfile dependencies, 5 gems now installed.\r\n    #12 4.184 Bundled gems are installed into `/bundler`\r\n    #12 4.184 Post-install message from i18n:\r\n\r\nOn this second run I would have expected to see the `ls -la /bundler/cache` to succeed and show me the gems installed on the last run. I would also expect bundler to not fetch and rebuild the gems that were just built.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that this bunder install just becomes a first stage in the Dockerfile, with the final stage just copying over the contents of the first stages&#39;s `/bundler` directory.  \r\n\r\nI feel like I may be misunderstanding exactly how RUN cache mounts work, but I am mystified as to why this simple example does not seem to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979965/docker-buildkit-run-mount-type-cache-unexpected-behavior-caching-ruby-bundle-i","title":"Docker buildkit `RUN mount=type=cache` unexpected behavior caching ruby bundle install results"},{"tags":["c#","pointers","variables","initialization","language-lawyer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":151,"user_id":7468876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c02ccabca07d38b3d9b66cb0e7c20eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Egbert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7468876/egbert"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568746416,"post_id":57979956,"comment_id":102370067,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979956/is-it-true-that-if-the-address-of-an-uninitialized-variable-is-taken-it-is-init#comment102370067_57979956"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12008,"user_id":2846483,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2Bfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dymanoid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2846483/dymanoid"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568751917,"creation_date":1568751917,"answer_id":57981603,"question_id":57979956,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57981603","body_markdown":"In the unsafe code, things may become strange.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let&#39;s look at the [Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/variables) section of the C# language specification.\r\n\r\n&gt; A variable must be **definitely assigned** &lt;...&gt; before its value can be obtained.\r\n\r\n&gt; &lt;...&gt; variables are either **initially assigned** or **initially unassigned**. &lt;...&gt; An initially unassigned variable has no initial value. For an initially unassigned variable to be considered definitely assigned at a certain location, an assignment to the variable must occur in every possible execution path leading to that location.\r\n\r\nThat is true for the &quot;safe&quot; C# code.\r\n\r\nIn the unsafe code specification, there is an [address-of operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/unsafe-code#the-address-of-operator) description, which tells us:\r\n\r\n&gt; The `&amp;` operator does not require its argument to be definitely assigned, but following an `&amp;` operation, the variable to which the operator is applied is considered definitely assigned in the execution path in which the operation occurs. It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that correct initialization of the variable actually does take place in this situation.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly your case. You apply the address-of operator to an *initially unassigned* variable, and after that it is considered by the compiler as a *definitely assigned* variable - so you can use it even in the &quot;safe&quot; context.\r\n\r\nThe specification tells us that the programmer is responsible for the initialization of the variable. If no initialization occurs, the specification does not guarantee what value will be stored in the actual variable.\r\n\r\nThe current C# compiler produces such IL code for this:\r\n\r\n    .locals init (\r\n        [0] int32 a\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    IL_0000: ldloca.s 0\r\n    IL_0002: conv.u\r\n    IL_0003: call void Namespace.Program::f(void*)\r\n\r\nYou see, there is a single local variable of a value type `int32`.\r\nThe current CLR (.NET Framework) auto-initializes all local variables with zeroes - that&#39;s why the initial value of your variable will be 0 even though it is not initialized in code.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#39;t rely on this fact - AFAIK it&#39;s not guaranteed and might change in other implementations.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979956/is-it-true-that-if-the-address-of-an-uninitialized-variable-is-taken-it-is-init/57981603#57981603","title":"Is it true that if the address of an uninitialized variable is taken, it is initialized to default value?"}],"owner":{"reputation":183,"user_id":10995500,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a593e2114d55aac27cccc1a9d3ff1b41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10995500/nano"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57981603,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568751917,"creation_date":1568744387,"question_id":57979956,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979956","body_markdown":"I have this code:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    \r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        unsafe static void f(void* v)\r\n        {}\r\n        static void Main()\r\n        {\r\n            int a;\r\n            unsafe\r\n            {\r\n                f(&amp;a);\r\n            }\r\n            Console.Write(a);\r\n            Console.ReadKey();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe code has no errors or exceptions.

Choose the newly regenerated POT file.\r\n\r\nNotice that by default, outdated translations are kept in the PO file as backup. In Poedit, you can purge them (see *Catalog → Purge deleted translations*).

I took the most simple and basic approach of joining table on table with list of dates but it seems that the view is still fairly slow. Addition of indexes on the table didn&#39;t help much, even though the table itself have just 15K rows or so. I was wondering if someone could advice on what would be the right approach to speed it up?\r\n\r\nThere are several considerations:\r\n\r\n1. I need to calculate cumulative sum up to a date for specific `ProjectID` and `ContractorID`. So for same date I may have a lot of ProjectIDs and ContractorIds combinations, but combination of Date, ProjectID and ContractorID is always unique\r\n\r\n2. There is a master table with dates, projectids (but no contractorids) and I need a cumulative sum for each date, projectid in this master dates table\r\n\r\n3. I need to calculate a cumulative sum of several columns at the same time, not just of one\r\n\r\nTo walk you through the situation slightly more, the tables I have are:\r\n\r\n- `dbo.Project_Reporting_Schedule` which holds a master list of projectid, dates. For each of this combinations I need to calculate a cumulative sum based on another table. Please note it has no contractorid!\r\n\r\n- `Project_value_delivery` is a table where I have actual value columns to perform a cumulative sum calculation. It has its own set of dates which may or may not match dates in `Project_Reporting_Schedule`, hence we can&#39;t just join the table on itself. Please also note it has contractorid!\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently I have the following select which is rather self-explanatory and just joins table with values on table with master date list and does the summation. Select works fine, but even with just 15K records it takes almost 5 seconds to run which is fairly slow.\r\n\r\n    select \r\n        pv2.ProjectID,\r\n        pv2.ContractorID,\r\n        pv1.Date, \r\n        sum(pv2.ValuePlanned) as PlannedCumulative, \r\n        sum(pv2.ValueActual) as ActualCumulative,\r\n        sum(pv2.MobilizationPlanned) as MobilizationPlanned,\r\n        sum(pv2.MobilizationActual) as MobilizationActual,\r\n        sum(pv2.EngineeringPlanned) as EngineeringPlanned,\r\n        sum(pv2.EngineeringActual) as EngineeringActual,\r\n        sum(pv2.ProcurementPlanned) as ProcurementPlanned,\r\n        sum(pv2.ProcurementActual) as ProcurementActual,\r\n        sum(pv2.ConstructionPlanned) as ConstructionPlanned,\r\n        sum(pv2.ConstructionActual) as ConstructionActual,\r\n        sum(pv2.CommisioningTestingPlanned) as CommisioningTestingPlanned,\r\n        sum(pv2.CommisioningTestingActual) as CommisioningTestingActual\r\n    from \r\n        dbo.Project_Reporting_Schedule as pv1\r\n    join \r\n        dbo.Project_value_delivery as pv2 on pv1.Date &gt;= pv2.Date and pv1.ProjectID = pv2.ProjectID\r\n    group by \r\n        pv2.ProjectID, pv2.ContractorID, pv1.Date\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nFor further clarifications, I put execution plan here: \r\nhttps://www.brentozar.com/pastetheplan/?id=H12t-O1PS\r\n\r\n\r\nIndexes created are same and on both tables I have them for Projectid, Date combination as well as standalone indexes on ProjectID and Date columns.\r\n\r\nAll indexes are Unique Nonclustered where applicable or just Nonclustered where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe can see it does &#39;non-clustered index seek&#39; which costs most of the execution.

Are the pre-populated values possible to be formatted in any way?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WWfdw.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKo5E.png\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979937/pre-populated-values-on-chrome-autofill-are-different-sizes-before-selection","title":"Pre-populated Values on Chrome autofill are different sizes before selection"},{"tags":["database","laravel","relationship"],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":4121532,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3MfBL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yagrasdemonde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4121532/yagrasdemonde"},"last_editor":{"reputation":289,"user_id":9323177,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7XF8O.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alan Ge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9323177/alan-ge"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568757966,"creation_date":1568744287,"last_edit_date":1568757966,"question_id":57979935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979935","body_markdown":"I need help to build a good conceptual model of data for my project with relations, pivot tables …\r\n\r\nThis is my problem : \r\n\r\nIn a form, a company can make a celebration booking, but there are several constraints: according to the day of the date, a celebrant is affected to celebrate and that same celebrant can celebrate X celebrations for the half day. If half day is morning, for example, a select with hours is showed like (9:00, 9:30, 10:00, 10:30, …, 12:00) and in this select, if celebrations exist, I would remove the hours already taken.\r\n\r\nSo what is the best way to convert this to tables and relations?\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now, I had thought of this\r\n\r\n```\r\n--companies--\r\nid\r\nname\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n--celebrants--\r\nid\r\nname\r\nnumber_max_celebrations\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n--affectations--\r\nid\r\ncelebrant_id\r\n half_day_working (morning or afternoon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n--bookings--\r\nid\r\n… \r\ndesired_hour\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n--affectation_booking --\r\naffectation_id \r\nbooking_id   \r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for helping me build a good database so that development is as simple as possible.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979935/advices-to-construct-conceptual-model-of-data","title":"Advices to construct Conceptual Model of Data"},{"tags":["apache-spark","pyspark","rdd","pyspark-sql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4705,"user_id":4812170,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oHM1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"vaquar khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4812170/vaquar-khan"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568749430,"post_id":57979934,"comment_id":102371300,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979934/why-is-spark-range100-orderbyid-ascending-false-rdd-not-lazy-and-trigge#comment102371300_57979934"},{"owner":{"reputation":8263,"user_id":691867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/86cad22e6f9100c801c56c099872bbc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"colinfang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/691867/colinfang"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4705,"user_id":4812170,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oHM1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"vaquar khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4812170/vaquar-khan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568751006,"post_id":57979934,"comment_id":102371932,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979934/why-is-spark-range100-orderbyid-ascending-false-rdd-not-lazy-and-trigge#comment102371932_57979934"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":9268409,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lFO2i.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yudovin Artsiom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9268409/yudovin-artsiom"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568746407,"creation_date":1568746407,"answer_id":57980405,"question_id":57979934,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57980405","body_markdown":"Not all transformation is 100% lazy.

I&#39;m authenticating Linkedin users and calling `GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity` and `GetCredentialsForIdentity` in a Lambda, and signing in those users with `Auth.federatedSignIn()`, I am able to retrieve the current authenticated user and credentials.\r\n\r\nUsing Amplify&#39;s APIClass or AWSAppSyncClient, however, I cannot get these users to make GraphQL calls through AppSync, which is configured to authorize Cognito User Pool and AWS IAM users. The Cognito User Pool users have no problem making AppSync calls when the authentication type is changed accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have tried each of the following for the federated users:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAPI.graphql({\r\n  query: queries.getUserProfile,\r\n  variables: {\r\n    input: {\r\n      email,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  authMode: &#39;AWS_IAM&#39;\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst client =

Auth.currentCredentials(),\r\n  },\r\n  disableOffline: true,\r\n});\r\n\r\nclient.query({\r\n  query: gql(queries.getUserProfile),\r\n  variables: {\r\n    input: {\r\n      email,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  fetchPolicy: &#39;no-cache&#39;,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Identity Pool is provisioned through Serverless resources/CloudFormation templates, and I&#39;ve set the trust relationship and authenticated role like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ProjectAuthRole:\r\n    Type: AWS::IAM::Role\r\n    Properties:\r\n      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:\r\n        Version: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;\r\n

schema directive to every type and input definition, but it sounds like this shouldn&#39;t even be necessary, as the authorization should be happening AWS AppSync GraphQL API level.\r\n\r\nAny ideas

see what is actually happening:\r\nthe initial state:\r\n\r\n - first contains null, first.next is last, last contains null\r\n - push: first does not contain null any more, still points to last,with null\r\n - enque: last.item is null, so the first cae is triggered, now the list is like: banana -&gt; gorilla -&gt; null and last points to gorilla\r\n - enque again: now the else is triggered. If you have a look at the code, you\r\nwill notice that temp.next is not touched anywhere. This means that the node that was the last node before the enque,and was copied to temp still points to the null node.\r\n - this finally results in a null pointer exception.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing: something like &lt;code&gt;temp.next=last&lt;/code&gt;, after the last node is created.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens looks like this:\r\n```\r\n---&gt; last ---&gt; closing-null\r\n\r\n---&gt; temp ---&gt; closing-null\r\n\r\n---&gt; last\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIt seems you could implement this more cleanly without the null nodes closing the list.\r\n\r\nThen you could do something like this:\r\n```\r\nnode=new

Here are some pictures of the bug itself.I want to mention that this behaviour only happens when i set the `fixed=&quot;top&quot;` property for navbar.\r\n\r\n    &lt;MDBNavbar fixed=&quot;top&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; dark expand=&quot;md&quot; style={{ paddingTop: &#39;15px&#39;, paddingBottom: &#39;15px&#39; }}&gt;\r\n        &lt;MDBNavbarBrand&gt;\r\n          &lt;strong className=&quot;black-text&quot; className=&quot;customFont&quot; style={{color: &#39;black&#39;, letterSpacing: &#39;1px&#39;}}&gt;RADU STEFAN&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n        &lt;/MDBNavbarBrand&gt;\r\n        &lt;MDBHamburgerToggler color=&quot;black&quot; id=&quot;hamburger1&quot; onClick={()=&gt; this.toggleSingleCollapse(&#39;collapse1&#39;)} /&gt;\r\n        &lt;MDBCollapse id=&quot;navbarCollapse3&quot; isOpen={this.state.collapse1} navbar&gt;\r\n          &lt;MDBNavbarNav center &gt;\r\n            &lt;MDBNavItem active&gt;\r\n              &lt;MDBNavLink to=&quot;#!&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/MDBNavLink&gt;\r\n            &lt;/MDBNavItem&gt;\r\n            &lt;MDBNavItem&gt;\r\n              &lt;MDBNavLink  to=&quot;#!&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/MDBNavLink&gt;\r\n            &lt;/MDBNavItem&gt;\r\n            &lt;MDBNavItem&gt;\r\n              &lt;MDBNavLink  to=&quot;#!&quot;&gt;Pricing&lt;/MDBNavLink&gt;\r\n            &lt;/MDBNavItem&gt;\r\n            &lt;MDBNavItem&gt;\r\n              &lt;MDBDropdown&gt;\r\n                &lt;MDBDropdownToggle nav caret&gt;Hatz\r\n                  &lt;div className=&quot;d-none d-md-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;/MDBDropdownToggle&gt;\r\n                &lt;MDBDropdownMenu className=&quot;dropdown-default&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;MDBDropdownItem href=&quot;#!&quot;&gt;Action&lt;/MDBDropdownItem&gt;\r\n                  &lt;MDBDropdownItem href=&quot;#!&quot;&gt;Another Action&lt;/MDBDropdownItem&gt;\r\n                  &lt;MDBDropdownItem href=&quot;#!&quot;&gt;Something else here&lt;/MDBDropdownItem&gt;\r\n                  &lt;MDBDropdownItem href=&quot;#!&quot;&gt;Something else here&lt;/MDBDropdownItem&gt;\r\n                &lt;/MDBDropdownMenu&gt;\r\n              &lt;/MDBDropdown&gt;\r\n            &lt;/MDBNavItem&gt;\r\n          &lt;/MDBNavbarNav&gt;\r\n        &lt;/MDBCollapse&gt;\r\n      &lt;/MDBNavbar&gt;\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[![act[![\\]\\[1\\]][1]][1][Second picture]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIm26.png\r\n  [Second picture]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/oqX6N.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979897/mdbootstrap-navbar-doesnt-work-properly-on-specific-mobile-phones","title":"MDBootstrap Navbar doesn`t work properly on specific mobile phones"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","import","visual-studio-code","vscode-extensions"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":8301717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEtdb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Soumik Sur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8301717/soumik-sur"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":8301717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEtdb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Soumik Sur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8301717/soumik-sur"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568794139,"creation_date":1568744116,"last_edit_date":1568794139,"question_id":57979894,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979894","body_markdown":"I&#39;m attempting to write a VS Code extension for React.

The fact that .a static libraries are left behind hinted that some settings in the `binding.gyp`, `config.gpy` and/or makefiles are wrong, as Native Node Modules are normally dynamic libraries with an .node extension. One conditional line in the `binding.gyp` file under `vscode-sqlite3` seems to the the culprit:\r\n&lt;code&gt;\r\n...\r\n[&quot;target_arch==&#39;arm&#39;&quot;, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;static_library&quot;}]\r\n...\r\n&lt;/code&gt;\r\n\r\nDisable that line (by removing it or changing &#39;arm&#39; to something else) and then run: \r\n\r\n    node-gyp configure\r\n\r\nto regenerate the config.gpy file(s) under the build directory. Then build the module with:\r\n\r\n    node-gyp build\r\n\r\nA `sqlite.node` will be generated in build/Release.\r\n\r\n2. Unfortunately, the latest electron ABI version rarely matches that of the Node.js version. In my configuration, the electron ABI version is 72 (v6.0.12) but the latest stable Node version is for ABI 64. Therefore we have to do an `electron-rebuild` to update the sqlite.node to match the electron version. \r\n\r\nTo do this, you would have to first install `electron-rebuild` (yarn add electron-rebuild) then run electron-rebuild by giving supplying explicitly the version number of the electron binary that vscode downloaded:\r\n\r\n    electron-rebuild -v 6.0.12 -m /home/dev/vscode -o vscode-sqlite3\r\n\r\nOf course you would have to state the version number of your particular version of electron you are building for.\r\n(Please look up `electron-rebuild --help` for the meaning of the options. It takes a while to rebuild the binary module...)\r\n\r\nThe resulting `sqlite.node` can then be moved into the build/Release/. directory under the vscode project directory. Voila, we have a working latest version VS-Code for Raspbian!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979893/how-to-tell-visual-studio-code-compiled-from-source-where-to-find-sqlite-module/58440967#58440967","title":"How to tell Visual Studio Code compiled from source where to find sqlite module?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1252,"user_id":859955,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f166f3bb0312bb8fa937f1150891178d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nwaltham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/859955/nwaltham"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58440967,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571374374,"creation_date":1568744114,"question_id":57979893,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979893","body_markdown":"I am building the Visual Studio Code from the source checked out from the git repository: \r\n \r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\nI am building using: \r\n\r\n    export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=2048 \r\n    ./scripts/npm.sh install  --arch=armhf \r\n    ./scripts/code.sh \r\n\r\nI am using node 10.16.3 on a Raspberry PI 4, using Raspbian buster\r\n\r\nThere were no errors during build. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe installation downloads a precompiled version of electron on the first run.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHowever each time I try and run code, it starts but with an error: \r\n\r\n \r\n[storage state.vscdb] open(): Unable to open DB due to Error: Cannot find module &#39;../build/Release/sqlite \r\n\r\n\r\nIf I look in node_modules/vscode-sqlite3/build/Release/ \r\n\r\nI can see: \r\n\r\nsqlite3.a \r\nsqlite.a \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me why electron/vscode cannot find this library.

Rather than deal with Failing the Script Task, I&#39;d also create an SSIS variable called `IsConnectionValid` and the result of the Script Task will be to set that to True or False depending on the state of the connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsuedologic \r\n--\r\nAssumes Read only Collection is our variable @[User::ConnectionString]\r\n\r\nAssumes Read/Write collection is our variable @[User::IsConnectionValid]\r\n\r\nAssumes I can code without opening a text editor but the logic is sound\r\n\r\n    // re-initialize our state to false\r\n    Dts.Variables[&quot;User::IsConnectionValid&quot;].Value = false;\r\n    // Access the current connection string\r\n    string cs = Dts.Variables[&quot;User::ConnectionString&quot;].Value.ToString();\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        using (System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection conn = new System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection(cs))\r\n        {\r\n            conn.Open();\r\n            // If the connection didn&#39;t blow chow, then it&#39;s good *right now*\r\n            // The server could fall over in the next instant but this is the best we can do\r\n            Dts.Variables[&quot;User::IsConnectionValid&quot;].Value = true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    catch(Exception ex)\r\n    {\r\n        // Swallow the error\r\n        ;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nNow that we have this script task running and safely evaluating our connection, then the last step is to change the Precedence Constraint between this new step 3 (script task) and the old step 3 (Execute SQL Task).  Double click the connecting line and change it from  the current default of OnSuccess to PrecedentAndConstraint (name approximate)\r\n\r\nThe constraint is simply `@[User::IsConnectionValid]` and it remains an AND conditional. This means that it will only give the Execute SQL Task the signal to fire if the variable is true and the preceding task didn&#39;t fail.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979886/continue-ssis-package-when-one-connection-string-is-not-reachable/57983878#57983878","title":"Continue SSIS package when One Connection string is not reachable"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":11025991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/471936be33c6b0309ce0e61f758744fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11025991/tony"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57983878,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568770529,"creation_date":1568744086,"question_id":57979886,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979886","body_markdown":"I have a strange situation.

am writing a script that converts CSV files to JSON to manipulate the JSON data, then convert that new JSON data back to CSV. I cannot use any external libraries because I am developing within a platform that does not allow this unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI am somewhat able to parse a CSV to JSON, and I am doing this by splitting the file up using ```split(&quot;,&quot;)```. \r\n\r\nThe issue is, that there are commas in the description header of these CSV files which causes the file to split improperly if there is more than one comma in the description header.\r\n\r\nFor ex:\r\n\r\nI have a description with text of: ```Pipette Wide Orifice Graduated, PP 10mL```\r\n\r\nI need to be able to write logic to ignore that comma in the description, so that the integrity of the description does not actually change. What currently happens is that the script will split the description at the first comma so that the description becomes ```Pipette Wide Orifice Graduated``` and then the next header will contain ``` PP 10mL``` which needs to stay part of the description.\r\n\r\nThis is my current function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction csvJson(fileContents) {\r\n                var lines = fileContents.split(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n                var result = [];\r\n                var headers = lines[0].split(&quot;,&quot;);\r\n\r\n                for(var i = 1; i &lt; lines.length; i++) {\r\n                    var obj = {};\r\n                    \r\n                    var currentLine = lines[i].split(&quot;,&quot;);\r\n\r\n                    for(var j=0; j&lt;headers.length; j++) {\r\n                        obj[headers[j]] = currentLine[j];\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    result.push(obj);\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                return JSON.stringify(result);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, I am basically trying to ensure that if there is already a comma somewhere within the CSV file contents, to not split the lines there and to only split at the end of each actual line through commas created via the logic itself.

My service-worker successfully registers but will not provide offline functionality once my app is deployed to production. In my console, I get a `bad-precaching-response`, seemingly for at least one CSS file. With local deployments, caching works.\r\n\r\nTo successfully register my service-worker, I uncommented the serviceWorker-related code in `index.html` so that I have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n        if (&#39;serviceWorker&#39; in navigator) {\r\n            window.addEventListener(&#39;load&#39;, function() {\r\n                navigator.serviceWorker.register(&#39;/service-worker.js&#39;)\r\n                    .then(function () {\r\n                        console.log(&#39;Service Worker Registered&#39;);\r\n                    });\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI generated my service worker successfully via the Workbox plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnew WorkboxPlugin.GenerateSW({\r\n            clientsClaim: true,\r\n            skipWaiting: true\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n \r\nAnd I have my `manifest.webapp` in my webapp directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;&lt;truncated&gt;&quot;,\r\n  &quot;short_name&quot;: &quot;&lt;truncated&gt;&quot;,\r\n  &quot;icons&quot;: [\r\n        &lt;truncated&gt;\r\n    ],\r\n  &quot;theme_color&quot;: &quot;#000000&quot;,\r\n  &quot;background_color&quot;: &quot;#e0e0e0&quot;,\r\n  &quot;start_url&quot;: &quot;.&quot;,\r\n  &quot;display&quot;: &quot;standalone&quot;,\r\n  &quot;orientation&quot;: &quot;portrait&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a local deployment, Workbox caches as expected. However, it fails in production.\r\n\r\nWhen I deploy via Heroku, I force `https`. After first deploying after completing the above steps, I had to update my content security policy to include `worker-src &#39;self&#39; https://storage.googleapis.com/* blob:`. While this took care of my initial security issues, I now have this error in my console with a live production deployment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) bad-precaching-response: \r\nbad-precaching-response :: [{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://&lt;truncated&gt;/swagger-ui/dist/css/typography.css?__WB_REVISION__=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e&quot;,\r\n&quot;status&quot;:404}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I follow that link, I get to a page that is returning a 404 due to a CSP violation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRefused to load the script &#39;https://linkhelp.clients.google.com/tbproxy/lh/wm?sourceid=wm&amp;url=https%3A%2F%&lt;truncated&gt;.herokuapp.com%2Fswagger-ui%2Fdist%2Fcss%2Ftypography.css%3F&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&lt;truncated&gt;.herokuapp.com&amp;error=http404&amp;js=true&#39; \r\nbecause it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \r\n&quot;script-src &#39;self&#39; &#39;unsafe-inline&#39; &#39;unsafe-eval&#39; https://storage.googleapis.com https://linkhelp.clients.google.com/* https://linkhelp.clients.google.com/tbproxy/lh/wm/fixurl.js blob:&quot;. \r\nNote that &#39;script-src-elem&#39; was not explicitly set, so &#39;script-src&#39; is used as a fallback.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that the service-worker will NOT cache anything (for good reason) if there are any &lt;`400` responses from a url, which means my service-worker isn&#39;t working at all in production. However, despite whitelisting the `linkhelp` resource, the error still occurs. I fear that I went down a wrong path with adjusting security settings and might be missing something fundamental about service-workers, which I am new to.\r\n\r\nI have consulted a number of guides I found by Googling some variation of `jhipster pwa` or the like but have ended up in the same place. These guides include:\r\n\r\n* Service-worker related tutorials at https://angular.io\r\n* https://blog.ippon.tech/build-a-pwa-in-jhipster/\r\n* https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/05/09/progressive-web-applications-with-angular-and-spring-boot\r\n* https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/pwa-angular-6/\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Expected result&lt;/b&gt;: Production deployment allows offline functionality the way local deployment does. Lighthouse audit succeeds.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Actual result&lt;/b&gt;: Prod deployment does NOT allow offline functionality.

This means if you wanted to change the watch from recursive to non-recursive or vice-versa or change the directory being watched, you would have to cancel the existing service and create a new one with the new settings.  It is probably possible to have the properties read-write, so that the existing running service could be modified to watch different directories, but getting that to work seems a little tricky to me, so I didn&#39;t try it.\r\n\r\nI was quite pleasantly surprised how well the integration of the WatchService and the JavaFX ScheduledService seems to work both in terms of how it is implemented, how it is used by the application and how it performs.  \r\n\r\n**Basic usage of a directory monitoring WatchService**\r\n\r\nAnd a sample app demonstrating its use (detects changes in the root of the user&#39;s home directory):\r\n\r\n[![watchapp image][5]][5]\r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.ListView;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    import java.nio.file.Path;\r\n    import java.nio.file.Paths;\r\n    import java.nio.file.WatchEvent;\r\n    \r\n    public class WatchDirApp extends Application {\r\n        private static final String WATCH_DIR = System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;);\r\n        private WatchDirService watchDirService;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void init() throws Exception {\r\n            watchDirService = new WatchDirService(\r\n                    Paths.get(WATCH_DIR),\r\n                    false\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\r\n            ListView&lt;String&gt; events = new ListView&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n            watchDirService.start();\r\n            watchDirService.valueProperty().addListener((observable, previousEvents, newEvents) -&gt; {\r\n                if (newEvents != null) {\r\n                    newEvents.forEach(event -&gt;\r\n                            events.getItems().add(eventToString(event))\r\n                    );\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n    \r\n            Scene scene = new Scene(new StackPane(events));\r\n            stage.setScene(scene);\r\n            stage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        private String eventToString(WatchEvent&lt;Path&gt; event) {\r\n            return event.kind() + &quot;:&quot; + event.context() + &quot;:n=&quot; + event.count();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void stop() throws Exception {\r\n            watchDirService.cancel();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Example with Event Filtering**\r\n\r\nHere is a more extensive sample of using the WatchService from JavaFX, which will watch for creation of new text files in the user&#39;s home directory (or modification of existing files) and launch a new window to display the text in the files.  \r\n\r\nThe example demonstrates filtering the events generated by the watch service so that different actions can be taken based upon the event (for example view the text file in a new window or update the contents of an existing window when the file is modified).  \r\n\r\nWhen running the example it can be noted that there is a delay of a second or two between the action which generates the event (e.g. saving a new text file) and the update to the UI (e.g. displaying the newly saved text file).  This is because the watch service doesn&#39;t notify change events in real time (at least on my machine, which runs OS X), instead it notifies of the change events with a slight delay. \r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.*;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    import java.nio.file.*;\r\n    import java.nio.file.WatchEvent;\r\n    import java.util.HashMap;\r\n    import java.util.Map;\r\n    \r\n    import static java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_CREATE;\r\n    import static java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_MODIFY;\r\n    \r\n    public class WatchedTextFileViewerApp extends Application {\r\n        private static final String TEXT_FILE_EXTENSION = &quot;.txt&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        private static final String WATCH_DIR = System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;);\r\n        private WatchDirService watchDirService;\r\n    \r\n        private Stage appStage;\r\n        private Map&lt;Path, FileViewer&gt;
