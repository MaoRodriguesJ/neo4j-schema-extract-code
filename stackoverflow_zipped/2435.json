I want the sum of X for each group to be larger than 10. To achieve this, each observation is allowed to change its ID as long as the sum of X for the original group does not go below 10.  \r\n\r\nBelow is an example of what I mean and a very manual solution:\r\n```\r\n# sample data\r\ninput &lt;-data.table(ID = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot; ,\r\n                          &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;D&quot;),\r\n                    X = c(1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 5,\r\n                          6, 10, 2, 3, 3, 4))\r\n# summarise X by ID             \r\ninput[, .(X = sum(X)), by = ID]\r\n\r\nID X\r\nA 5\r\nB 11\r\nC 18\r\nD 10\r\n\r\n# what the output should look like     \r\noutput &lt;- data.table(ID = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot; ,\r\n                            &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;D&quot;),\r\n                     X = c(1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 5,\r\n                           6, 10, 2, 3, 3, 4))\r\n    \r\noutput[, .(X = sum(X)), by  = ID]\r\n\r\nID X\r\nA 11\r\nB 11\r\nC 12\r\nD 10\r\n      \r\noutput\r\n\r\nID X\r\nA  1\r\nA  3\r\nA  1\r\nB  5\r\nB  1\r\nB  5\r\nA  6 - this observation changed ID from C to A to get group A to 11\r\nC 10\r\nC  2\r\n\r\n``` \r\nThis is obviously a very simple example as only group C has enough spare capacity to donate observations. In reality there might be cases when multiple groups are able to give away observations and when more than one observation has to be modified, however there will only ever be up to 4 groups between which movement can happen. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to automate this process in

I&#39;ve trying to do this because we are using `EventFiringWebDriver` which will throw an exception even inside a `Wait.Until` loop. Selenium can throw a exception in 2 ways:\r\n\r\n 1. An action has been performed that throws an exception, but the\r\n    exception is caught by `Wait.Until`\r\n 2. An action has been performed\r\n    that throws an exception, and the exception is outside a\r\n    `Wait.Until`\r\n\r\nSo if TestMethod fails, I would be able to take a screenshot while catching the exception. I think `TestCleanup` cannot be inherited so I am not sure if I would be able to catch the exception in the `TestCleanup`\r\n\r\nI know I could wrap up the `TestMethod` and the `TestCleanup` each one in a `try-catch` but that would be cumbersome to do in each test we have and the test we would be creating in the future.\r\n\r\nAny help is

am confused because your question subject is about consuming and your route is producing to ActiveMQ\r\n\r\nParallel consumers\r\n-\r\n\r\nIf you want to **consume in parallel** from a JMS queue, you normally configure multiple consumers. \r\n\r\nIf you want to do this **for an individual consumer**, you can append it to the endpoint URI\r\n\r\n    from(&quot;activemq:queue:myQueue?concurrentConsumers=5&quot;\r\n\r\nif you want to apply this **as default for every consumer**, you can configure it in your bean setup\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public JmsConfiguration jmsConfiguration() {\r\n        JmsConfiguration jmsConfiguration = new JmsConfiguration();\r\n        jmsConfiguration.setConnectionFactory(pooledConnectionFactory());\r\n        jmsConfiguration.setConcurrentConsumers(5);\r\n        return jmsConfiguration;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name = &quot;activemq&quot;)\r\n    public ActiveMQComponent activeMq() {\r\n        ActiveMQComponent activeMQComponent = new ActiveMQComponent();\r\n        activeMQComponent.setConfiguration(jmsConfiguration()); \r\n        return activeMQComponent;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nParallel producers\r\n-\r\n\r\nWell, your JMS producing route has a **file consumer that is per definition single threaded** to avoid processing the same file with multiple consumers. \r\n\r\nHowever, you can **turn your route multithreaded** after file consumption with the [Threads DSL of Camel][1]\r\n\r\n    from(&quot;file://E:/Camel&quot;)\r\n        .threads(5) // continue asynchronous from here with 5 threads\r\n        .bean(ThreadService)        \r\n        .to(&quot;activemq:MessageQueue&quot;);\r\n\r\nLike this your &quot;long running task&quot; in `ThreadService` should no more block other files because the **route continues asynchronous with 5 threads** from the `threads` statement. The file consumer stays single threaded. \r\n\r\nBut be aware! **The `threads` statement breaks the current transaction**. The file consumer hands the message over to a new thread. If an error occurs later, the file consumer does not see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/async.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957559/consuming-messages-in-parallel-from-activemq/57970250#57970250","title":"Consuming messages in parallel from ActiveMQ"}],"owner":{"reputation":274,"user_id":1184480,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da8aac89c27ccabc1d9562f442d674a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vikram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1184480/vikram"},"last_editor":{"reputation":274,"user_id":1184480,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da8aac89c27ccabc1d9562f442d674a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vikram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1184480/vikram"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568831454,"creation_date":1568639299,"last_edit_date":1568831454,"question_id":57957559,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957559","body_markdown":"Whenever I am posting a message to the queue the first time the message gets picked up without any issue, but when I drop the second file the message is in the &quot;pending&quot; state the thread sleeping time (2 minutes).

don&#39;t want to give you the answer as it is something you should solve yourself but I will give a few pointers.\r\n\r\n 1. Your use of a while loop here is incorrect, do you really need a while loop? \r\n 2. `if(totalPrice &lt;= 225) break;`\r\n\r\nPerhaps look into the break statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met, that why you can ensure there are 6 items or less and it is not over 225. \r\n\r\nYou also need to handle an entry of 0 as it is a penny minimum and you cannot allow them to exceed 225.  \r\n\r\n    priceItem = input.nextDouble();\r\n    while(priceItem &lt; 0.01 || priceItem &gt; 225){\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Item Price cannot be 0 or greater than 225, please...&quot;);\r\n    priceItem = input.nextDouble();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou also can&#39;t allow a value that exceeds the remaining balance, I will let you try and figure out how to do that yourself.

I know I need another method to do a calculation but i&#39;m not sure what to put in it. This is what I have so far:\r\n\r\nI know I will need a for loop for the counter for the items, but I&#39;m really stuck. I posted the actual assignment to give background.\r\n\r\n&gt; For your birthday, your rich aunt &amp; uncle give you a $225 gift card to\r\n&gt; the local mall. They will go shopping with you and will help carry out\r\n&gt; your items. The most that each of you can carry is one item in each\r\n&gt; hand. Thus, you may purchase a maximum of six items. You will have a\r\n&gt; tracker device that computes the number of items you purchase as well\r\n&gt; as the amount of money you have spent. After you choose each item, the\r\n&gt; tracker prompts you for the price, and then displays the amount of\r\n&gt; money you have spent. Then it displays the number of items you may\r\n&gt; still choose and the balance on the gift card. The program will not\r\n&gt; terminate until you reach 6 items or $225, whichever comes first. The\r\n&gt; tracker then will list the total spent &amp; the number of items as well\r\n&gt; as the balance on the gift card. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; **Required:** \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; - validate that negative\r\n&gt; prices are not entered and that you can’t spend more than the balance\r\n&gt; on the gift card. Give the user as many opportunities as needed to\r\n&gt; enter a price above 0 or below 225. User should be able to purchase\r\n&gt; items costing between one penny and $225, inclusive.\r\n&gt; - all dollar\r\n&gt; amounts should be formatted for currency using the NumberFormat class.\r\n&gt; - Include at least 1 method in your program. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; *Be sure to create test cases for all options:*\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; - spend the entire dollar amount on fewer than 6 items \r\n&gt; - purchase 6 items totaling less than the entire dollar amount\r\n&gt; - spend the entire dollar amount on exactly 6 items\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\tScanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\tdouble priceItem = 0, totalPrice = 225, currentPrice = 0;\r\n\tint numItem;\r\n\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Happy birthday from Auntie and Uncle! \\nYou may purchase up to&quot;\r\n\t\t\t+ &quot; 6 items with this gift card of $225.&quot;);\r\n\r\n\tfor (numItem = 1; numItem &lt;= 6; numItem++) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter the price for item #&quot; + numItem + &quot;: &quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\tpriceItem = input.nextDouble();\r\n\r\n\t\twhile (numItem &lt;= 6 &amp;&amp; totalPrice &lt;= 225) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\ttotalPrice = currentPrice - priceItem;\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;You may buy this item.

Balance on gift card is &quot; + currentPrice);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever I have tried to make a while loop, it is an infinite loop and again I&#39;m not sure which calculation to put in to get it to break.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957549/birthday-money-calculator","title":"Birthday money calculator"},{"tags":["flutter","dart"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1602,"user_id":10539074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b093509a5caad789d24881a94e395b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eugene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539074/eugene"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568640483,"post_id":57957547,"comment_id":102327630,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957547/using-jumpto-and-sticky-headers-package-causes-ui-issue#comment102327630_57957547"},{"owner":{"reputation":2054,"user_id":3923929,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uiLVo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Durdu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923929/durdu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1602,"user_id":10539074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b093509a5caad789d24881a94e395b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eugene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539074/eugene"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568643251,"post_id":57957547,"comment_id":102329270,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957547/using-jumpto-and-sticky-headers-package-causes-ui-issue#comment102329270_57957547"}],"owner":{"reputation":2054,"user_id":3923929,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uiLVo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Durdu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923929/durdu"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568639252,"creation_date":1568639252,"question_id":57957547,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957547","body_markdown":"I created a new flutter project and added the [sticky_headers][1] package.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I implemented a list builder that has a ScrollController. \r\nI call setState 3 times at a 5 seconds interval and modify a global offset variable which will be used on the build method to jump the list to a new offset (using SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that after I call the jumpto method, the headers are messed up ( if I manual scroll the headers will come back to a normal position).\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n![ezgif com-video-to-gif (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1089865/64960204-838b8480-d89b-11e9-8187-e8412966c063.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The code:**\r\n```\r\nimport &#39;package:flutter/material.dart&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;package:flutter/scheduler.dart&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;package:sticky_headers/sticky_headers.dart&#39;;\r\n\r\ndouble offset = 0;\r\n\r\nvoid main() =&gt;

Every Kubernetes object has a resourceVersion field representing the version of that resource as stored in the underlying database. When retrieving a collection of resources (either namespace or cluster scoped), the response from the server will contain a resourceVersion value that can be used to initiate a watch against the server. The server will return all changes (creates, deletes, and updates) that occur after the supplied resourceVersion. This allows a client to fetch the current state and then watch for changes without missing any updates.

don&#39;t normally answer these sorts of questions because there are a number of similar questions with the same answer.  But I could not find one that could be considered to be a duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe short answer is to add the Services directory to the list of excluded directories:\r\n```\r\n#app/config/services.yml\r\n    AppBundle\\:\r\n        resource: &#39;../../src/AppBundle/*&#39;\r\n        exclude: &#39;../../src/AppBundle/{Entity,Repository,Tests,Services}&#39;\r\n```\r\nDoing so prevents autowire from trying to create a service with an id of AppBundle\\Services\\EmailNotificationService and then failing because $emailUser is a string.\r\n\r\nThe Symfony container has moved away from explicitly naming services with things like app.email. Instead, the class name (AppBundle\\Services\\EmailNotificationService) is preferred. So autowire finds all classes under src, looks in container to see if a service has been defined with the same class name and, if none is found, creates a new service. Autowire does not link app.email with your email class. Unless you are supporting a legacy project then it might be best to do away with app.* service names. \r\n\r\nAnd, as a bonus, by going with class names you can eliminate all the service configuration except for a bind under the _default section. But it looks like you do have a legacy project in which case you should probably turn off autowire under _default just to preserve your own sanity.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957510/symfony-3-4-inject-service-inside-another-fail/57960669#57960669","title":"Symfony 3.4 inject service inside another fail"}],"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":5896263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db05bd944f585f31566d1548c2ce2214?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J_J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5896263/j-j"},"last_editor":{"reputation":84,"user_id":5896263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db05bd944f585f31566d1548c2ce2214?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J_J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5896263/j-j"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57960669,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568650019,"creation_date":1568639098,"last_edit_date":1568643680,"question_id":57957510,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957510","body_markdown":"I am doing a service in Symfony and I need to inject my mail service.

From the spring documentation boc `The auto-configured RestTemplateBuilder will ensure that sensible HttpMessageConverters are applied to RestTemplate instances`  :\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {\r\n    \treturn builder.setReadTimeout(httpClientReadTimeout).build();\r\n    }\r\nor\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public MyController(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {\r\n        this.restTemplate = = builder.build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut usually you need one or more additional rest customized rest templates. Therefore you create another one with custom configuration, for example to add some headers or ObjectMapper configuration:\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    RestTemplate myCustormRestTemplate() {\r\n        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();\r\n        restTemplate.getInterceptors().add(new MyClientHttpRequestInterceptor());\r\n        retun restTemplate;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlso you can customize the default rest template by **RestTemplateCustomizer**:\r\n\r\n    public class MyRestTemplateCustomizer implements RestTemplateCustomizer {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void customize(RestTemplate restTemplate) {\r\n            restTemplate.getInterceptors().add(new MyClientHttpRequestInterceptor());\r\n        }\r\n

Moreover, you query all the temp data to sink then into the final table, and that can have cost if you have lot of data.\r\n* if you perform a WRITE_TRUNCATE (as in your code example), you can perform a smarter things.\r\n    \r\n    * Delete the previous existing table\r\n    * Load the file in a table with a table name like this `nature_bi_&lt;insertDate&gt;_&lt;executionId&gt;`\r\n    * When you query, inject the table name into your query result (*here I simple add the table name, but with [UDF](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions) or [native BigQuery function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions), you can extract date and executionId*)\r\n```\r\nSELECT *,(SELECT table_id\r\n      FROM `&lt;project&gt;.&lt;dataset&gt;.__TABLES_SUMMARY__`\r\n      WHERE table_id LIKE &#39;nature_bi%&#39;) FROM `&lt;project&gt;.&lt;dataset&gt;.nature_bi*` LIMIT 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll solutions are valid, depends of your contrains and file size\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957488/how-to-add-new-column-with-metadata-value-to-csv-when-loading-it-to-bigquery/57960411#57960411","title":"How to add new column with metadata value to csv when loading it to bigquery"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":11102106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-97Mfgk6NxFI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/TE8pIIN1_w4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Be2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11102106/be2"},"last_editor":{"reputation":29,"user_id":11102106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-97Mfgk6NxFI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/TE8pIIN1_w4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Be2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11102106/be2"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57960411,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568700286,"creation_date":1568639029,"last_edit_date":1568700286,"question_id":57957488,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957488","body_markdown":"I have a daily csv file coming into my bucket on google storage and I built a function that load this csv and append it into a table in BigQuery when it comes in.

lets say I have two functions where the Child is counting `1:5` and printing `i`every time . After each print it checks if `i&gt;2`, if it is- it stops. Then there is a parent function which counts  `10:11` , prints `k` and then runs the Child function like so:\r\n\r\n    #Child function:\r\n\r\n    Child &lt;- function(){\r\n      for (i in 1:5){\r\n       print(i)\r\n       if (i&gt;2){\r\n        stop()\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #Parent function\r\n    for (k in 10:11){\r\n     print(k)\r\n     Child()\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nRight now if I run this, when the Child inevitably stops when i=3, the Parent will also stop. I need to find a way to only stop the child Function, and let the parent continue running. So that instead of this:\r\n\r\n    [1] 10\r\n    [1] 1\r\n    [1] 2\r\n    [1] 3\r\n    Error in Child() : \r\nI can get something like this:\r\n\r\n    [1] 10\r\n    [1] 1\r\n    [1] 2\r\n    [1] 3\r\n    [1] 11\r\n    [1] 1\r\n    [1] 2\r\n    [1] 3\r\n\r\nIf there are error messages after each stop is triggered i wouldn&#39;t mind

what happens when you build a visual is that a DAX query is created to return a resultset that is then plotted. You can see an excerpt of the query below. There is more after this, but we have everything we need to understand the behavior you&#39;re seeing.\r\n\r\n```dax\r\n\r\nDEFINE\r\n  // This is a table-valued variable, which holds all dates which will be in context.\r\n  // This is based on your visual filter.\r\n  VAR __DS0FilterTable = \r\n    FILTER(\r\n      KEEPFILTERS(VALUES(&#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey])),\r\n      &#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey] &gt;= (DATE(2019, 1, 3) + TIME(0, 0, 1))\r\n    )\r\n\r\n  // This is a table-valued variable which holds the 1-row, 1-column table based on\r\n  // &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] holding the value FALSE. This is from your slicer\r\n  VAR __DS0FilterTable2 = \r\n    TREATAS({FALSE,\r\n      BLANK()}, &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday])\r\n\r\n  // This builds up your resultset\r\n  VAR __DS0Core = \r\n    // SUMMARIZECOLUMNS lists your grouping columns, applies filters, and projects\r\n    // measures onto your resultset\r\n    SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(\r\n      // This rollup defines the grouping columns, whose values are shown on your visual.\r\n      // The rollup defines which columns get subtotals, which means we calculate an\r\n      // additional row in the resultset with filter context cleared from the column\r\n      // which is rolling up. In this case, we&#39;ll have a row with no Year context,\r\n      // but with Week context, a row with no Week context, but with Year context, and\r\n      // a row with no context on either.\r\n      ROLLUPADDISSUBTOTAL(&#39;Calendar&#39;[Year], &quot;IsGrandTotalRowTotal&quot;, &#39;Calendar&#39;[Week], &quot;IsDM1Total&quot;),\r\n\r\n      // I&#39;m separating out the filter args here. These are evaluated in a logical\r\n      // AND. The first includes all dates that pass your filter on the visual.\r\n      // The second includes only &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday]=FALSE. The logical AND of these\r\n      // includes:\r\n      //   {2019-01-04, 2019-01-05, 2020-01-02, 2020-01-03, 2020-01-04, 2020-01-05}\r\n      // Note that we&#39;re missing 2020-01-01, which passes the date test, but is a holiday.\r\n      // This is the context for evaluating our measures.\r\n      __DS0FilterTable,\r\n      __DS0FilterTable2,\r\n      // end of filter args\r\n\r\n      &quot;Sales_Amount&quot;, &#39;FactSales&#39;[Sales Amount],\r\n      &quot;All_Sales&quot;, &#39;FactSales&#39;[All Sales],\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo based on how that is being evaluated, by the time it gets around to your measure, the filter context for dates is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;whatever is on your visual at that level&gt;\r\n\r\nINTERSECT\r\n\r\n{2019-01-04, 2019-01-05, 2020-01-02, 2020-01-03, 2020-01-04, 2020-01-05}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the filter context in which we evaluate:\r\n\r\n```dax\r\nAllSales =\r\nCALCULATE (\r\n  SUM ( FactSales[Sales] );\r\n  ALL ( &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] );\r\n  ALL ( &#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey] )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo without your `ALL ( &#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey] )` the filter context for your sum does not include `2020-01-01`. Unfortunately, your filter for `&#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey] &gt; 2019-01-03` also gets cleared by this `ALL`, which explains your grand total issue. The grand total is no Year context (based on the rollup in `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS`), no Week context (based on the same), and then based on your measure no Holiday context and no DateKey context.\r\n\r\nThe reason it works for your column chart is that there is no grand total to show.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, a solution that will likely be unsatisfying, because it will seem so very similar, is to define a new column, YearWeek and filter on that, instead of filtering on &#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey]. \r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n```dax\r\n//column\r\n&#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek] = &#39;Calendar&#39;[Year] * 100 + &#39;Calendar&#39;[Week]\r\n\r\n//measure:\r\nAll Sales =\r\nCALCULATE (\r\n  SUM ( &#39;FactSales&#39;[Sales] );\r\n  ALL ( &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can define a filter on &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek] &gt; 201901. This is logically equivalent, but not DAX equivalent. Your query looks like this now:\r\n\r\n```dax\r\nDEFINE\r\n  // This is now on &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek], instead of &#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey]\r\n  VAR __DS0FilterTable = \r\n    FILTER(\r\n      KEEPFILTERS(VALUES(&#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek])),\r\n      &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek] &gt; 201901\r\n    )\r\n\r\n  // same as before\r\n  VAR __DS0FilterTable2 = \r\n    TREATAS({FALSE,\r\n      BLANK()}, &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday])\r\n\r\n  // Textually same as before, but different context\r\n  VAR __DS0Core = \r\n    SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(\r\n      ROLLUPADDISSUBTOTAL(&#39;Calendar&#39;[Year], &quot;IsGrandTotalRowTotal&quot;, &#39;Calendar&#39;[Week], &quot;IsDM1Total&quot;),\r\n\r\n      // Here are the filters again:\r\n      // Our intersection of &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday]=FALSE and &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek]&gt;201901.\r\n      // The &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek] filter is: {201902, 202001, 202002}\r\n      // so now our filter context doesn&#39;t explicitly exclude the date 2020-01-01, which\r\n      // was the problem above.\r\n      __DS0FilterTable,\r\n      __DS0FilterTable2,\r\n      // end of filters\r\n\r\n      &quot;Sales_Amount&quot;, &#39;FactSales&#39;[Sales Amount],\r\n      &quot;All_Sales&quot;, &#39;FactSales&#39;[All Sales]\r\n    )\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the filter context above, the measure works just fine.\r\n\r\nSo, what&#39;s the difference between the following two scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. Filter on &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] and &#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey]\r\n2. Filter on &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] and &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek]\r\n\r\nThey&#39;re both sets of filters on the same table. The difference is that &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] and &#39;Calendar&#39;[DateKey] are at the same grain. The intersection of them explicitly excludes a date you want. And so you needed an extra `ALL` to override that. `ALL` is too broad, though, which messed with your grand totals.\r\n\r\n&#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] and &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek] are at different grains. If you had a full week of days in a single YearWeek that were all &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday]=TRUE, then you&#39;d run into the same problem as above, because your filter on &#39;Calendar&#39;[Holiday] would inadvertently remove an entire &#39;Calendar&#39;[YearWeek] that you want to include.\r\n\r\nThe critical point in all of this is that DAX filter contexts are **just lists of literal values in columns**. The emphasis is important. I was scratching my head a lot in answering this question, but breaking it down to the literal tables of values got me back on track.\r\n\r\nThis was a really good question, and thanks for asking it. It made me drill into some nuance of DAX I haven&#39;t had to think much about lately. And your intuition is spot on on how things should behave.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957447/powerbi-dax-creating-measure-which-accepts-partial-visual-filters-from-same-tab/57961059#57961059","title":"PowerBI DAX: Creating Measure which accepts partial visual filters from same table"}],"owner":{"reputation":1528,"user_id":905423,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f8eb9ebebfdeaa52ea02e27e299bf4d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CodeMonkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/905423/codemonkey"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1528,"user_id":905423,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f8eb9ebebfdeaa52ea02e27e299bf4d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CodeMonkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/905423/codemonkey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":92,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57961059,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568651659,"creation_date":1568638835,"last_edit_date":1568646590,"question_id":57957447,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957447","body_markdown":"I have a Fact table and a Calendar table. The calendar table has a column boolean column denoting if a day is a holiday.\r\n\r\n[![Relationship][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI wan&#39;t to create a measure: AllSales which ignores any filters on Holiday but respects filters on all other Calendar columns.

Individual weeks are OK as those are ok, but notice the years that sum to the wrong total. The Bar chat displays correctly but the totals in the matrix table are wrong. The total of AllSales should be 700 due to the visual level filter `Calendar[DateKey]` that removes the week one of 2019, yet it is still counted in the total.\r\n\r\n[![Wrong Result][2]][2]\r\n\r\nSo to sum up:\r\n\r\n - Visual level filter on `Calendar[DateKey] &gt; &quot;2019 year 01 week`\r\n - Visual level filter on `Calendar[Holiday] = False`\r\n - Measure AllSales should respect DateKey filter\r\n - Measure AllSales should ignore all Holiday filters\r\n - Visuals are sorted by column `Calendar[Year], Calendar[Week]`\r\n\r\nIf i remove the `ALL(Calendar[DateKey])` its like my `ALL(Calendar[Holiday])` filter is just ignored and `AllSales` becomes equivalent to `Sales` which is the raw data column.\r\n\r\nIf you wan&#39;t to play with the data here are the two M queries to create Calendar and FactSales tables.

Please advise if anyone else had same issue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957444/squirrel-sql-client-3-7-1-unable-to-connect-to-sql-server-2016-ssl-error","title":"SQuirrel_SQL_Client_3.7.1 unable to connect to SQL server 2016 SSL error"},{"tags":["sql","amazon-athena"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":558,"user_id":5818081,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/551Kk.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Perazim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5818081/perazim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568639792,"post_id":57957443,"comment_id":102327210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957443/how-to-replace-missing-rows-with-the-latest-value-from-previous-days-in-sql#comment102327210_57957443"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9544849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WcKECO1yHvo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsk/xDNqf77OY5Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nuno Ferreira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9544849/nuno-ferreira"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":558,"user_id":5818081,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/551Kk.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Perazim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5818081/perazim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568711633,"post_id":57957443,"comment_id":102352202,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957443/how-to-replace-missing-rows-with-the-latest-value-from-previous-days-in-sql#comment102352202_57957443"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9544849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WcKECO1yHvo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsk/xDNqf77OY5Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nuno Ferreira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9544849/nuno-ferreira"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568711770,"post_id":57960126,"comment_id":102352282,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957443/how-to-replace-missing-rows-with-the-latest-value-from-previous-days-in-sql/57960126#comment102352282_57960126"},{"owner":{"reputation":116592,"user_id":1109,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/quAxR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1109/theo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9544849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WcKECO1yHvo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsk/xDNqf77OY5Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nuno Ferreira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9544849/nuno-ferreira"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568749615,"post_id":57960126,"comment_id":102371380,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957443/how-to-replace-missing-rows-with-the-latest-value-from-previous-days-in-sql/57960126#comment102371380_57960126"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":116592,"user_id":1109,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/quAxR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1109/theo"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568647895,"creation_date":1568647895,"answer_id":57960126,"question_id":57957443,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960126","body_markdown":"I think the key to this is the [`MAX_BY`](https://prestodb.github.io/docs/0.172/functions/aggregate.html#max_by) aggregate function.

other answers will solve this problem recursively as you have asked for, it is worth mentioning that this problem is not too difficult or ugly to solve using iteration. If you want to use large values of `n`, your code is likely to fail with either a RuntimeError `maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison`, or a stack overflow (heh). You can solve that by implementing it iteratively, like this for example:\r\n\r\n    def list_h_results(n):\r\n        h_results = []\r\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n            h_results.append(2 * h_results[-1] + 1)\r\n        return h_results\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not saying do this for your exercise necessarily, but it&#39;s a consideration worth making in the future if implementing this kind of function in real code. Usually recursion is chosen for these types of problems because it is elegant and easier to understand, but I think in this case the iterative solution is just as easy to understand and avoids the potential problems associated with deep recursion.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957419/generate-list-of-elements-by-recursion/57958048#57958048","title":"Generate list of elements by recursion"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":79868,"user_id":633183,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RHeN9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Thank you","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/633183/thank-you"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568642970,"creation_date":1568642970,"answer_id":57958657,"question_id":57957419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57958657","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s another way that doesn&#39;t require lookups like `temp[-1]` as the computation is running \r\n\r\n    def main(n, a=1):\r\n      if n&lt;=1:\r\n        return [a]\r\n      else:\r\n        return [a, *main(n-1, 2*a+1)]\r\n    \r\n    print(main(10))\r\n    # [ 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 511, 1023 ]\r\n    \r\n    print(main(1))\r\n    # [1]","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957419/generate-list-of-elements-by-recursion/57958657#57958657","title":"Generate list of elements by recursion"}],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":7387488,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10210077619809114/picture?type=large","display_name":"sn3jd3r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7387488/sn3jd3r"},"last_editor":{"reputation":157,"user_id":7387488,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10210077619809114/picture?type=large","display_name":"sn3jd3r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7387488/sn3jd3r"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":130,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57957817,"answer_count":5,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569812676,"creation_date":1568638723,"last_edit_date":1568672279,"question_id":57957419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957419","body_markdown":"I have the following recurrence relation H(n) = 2*H(n-1) + 1, H(1) = 1. \r\nIf i were to make a recursive function in python how might this look?\r\nI have attempted with the following, but it does not seem to work\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef rec_func(N, n=0, H=[])\r\n    if n == 1:\r\n        return [1] + H\r\n    else:\r\n\r\n        return rec_fun(N-1, n+1, H)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI might be totally off, but any hint would be appreciated.

am wrapping up this assignment in my CS class where we are translating the C-code for the Sieve of Eratosthenes-algorithm, to 32-bit assembly code with AT&amp;T syntax. Now, the output is not correct, and I just cannot wrap my head around how to fix it. When I use gdb to debug the assembly code, I notice that the variable **N** is never assigned to **%edx**, which I find very odd. Am I subtracting the wrong number of bytes when assigning the variables to the registers? **%ebp** is located 4 bytes under the return address which is the again 4 bytes below the variables and so on. I believe that my math on this is correct, but that the error lays somewhere else in the code.\r\n\r\nHere is some images from GDB, showing the content of the array in C and assembly. Here, **arr_c** has the right elements, while **arr_asm** don&#39;t. But it is kinda close (It only matters that the zeroes is at the right indexes):\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nand here, you can see the value of **%edx**:\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nCan someone explain to me what is happening?

The variable N is never set to the right value, and even though that might not be an issue here, I believe that I have some other errors in the code that is beyond my understanding of assembly as I am completely new to it. As I can see, the code seems fine... But it is clearly not (images of the output is attached).\r\n\r\n**EDIT 1**\r\nOkay, so I&#39;ve given the argument N to the assembly function, but I still get the same result. Can someone verify if I am using the right offset when setting the values of N and the array in assembly?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how the C code looks now, while the assembly code is the same:\r\n```\r\nextern int asm_function(int *arr, int N);\r\n\r\n\r\nvoid c_function(int *arr, int N) \r\n{\r\n\t// Initialize array with 1&#39;s from arr[0] -&gt; arr[N-1]\r\n\tfor(int i = 2; i &lt; N; i++)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tarr[i] = 1;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// SIEVE\r\n\tfor(int i = 2; i &lt; N; i++)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// Set every index that is not a prime number equal to 0 in the array\r\n\t\tfor(int j = i; i*j&lt; N; j++)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tarr[i*j] = 0;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// print the prime numbers\r\n\tfor(int i = 2; i &lt; N; i++)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif(arr[i] != 0)\r\n\t\t\tprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, i);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() \r\n{\r\n\tint N = 20;\r\n\r\n\tint arr_c[N];\r\n\tint arr_asm[N];\r\n\r\n\tint *ptr;\r\n\tptr = asm_function(arr_asm, N);\r\n\t\r\n\t// Return from C function\r\n\tprintf(&quot;\\n\\nC function:\\n\\n&quot;);\r\n\tc_function(arr_c, N);\r\n\r\n\t// Return from Assembly function\r\n\tprintf(&quot;\\n\\nAssembly function:\\n\\n&quot;);\r\n\tfor(int i = 2; i &lt; N; i++)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif(*ptr != 0)\r\n\t\t\tprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, i);\r\n\t\tptr++;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**EDIT 2**\r\n\r\nOkay, so now it seems like the offsets for my constants in asm is right, but the output I am getting is wrong. Here it is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC function:\r\n\r\n2\r\n3\r\n5\r\n7\r\n11\r\n13\r\n17\r\n19\r\n\r\nAssembly function:\r\n\r\n2\r\n4\r\n10\r\n11\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n```\r\nThe output from C and asm should be identical, so something must be wrong with my assembly code. Any suggestions? Can it be that I must increment **%eax** on a other line than on line 77 (in sieve_inner_loop_condition)? I realize now that I could&#39;ve written the loops a bit simpler without this many jumps\r\n\r\n**EDIT 3**\r\nOk, even more jumps now (fixed some of the counter-registers being reset in some of the loops), but I see no reason why the arr_asm now becomes {2, 6, 11, 18, 19}... When debugging with GDB, it seems like none of the conditional jumps are done...? When im stepping after any **jl &lt; address &gt;**-condition, it seems like the flags are never set, and it goes straight to the jmp statement. Can someone explain this? Doesn&#39;t **stepping** in GDB go to the next instruction stored in **EIP**? Some clarification on this would be much appreciated! I feel like I&#39;m lost here as the right flags should be set...\r\n\r\n**EDIT 4**\r\nAfter a lot of debugging and help from @Jester down in the comments, the code now finally works. Thank you, I never realized how powerful this forum could be until now recently - and I will never post any code as images from now on ;)\r\n\r\n**Working assembly-implementation of the algorithm &quot;Sieve of Eratosthenes&quot; with AT&amp;T syntax:**\r\n```\r\n.section .text\r\n\r\n# Constants - offsets in bytes for the stack base pointer\r\narr = 8\r\nN   = 12\r\n\r\n.global asm_function\r\n\r\nasm_function:\r\n\r\n\t# Prologue, create stack frame\r\n\tpushl %ebp\r\n\tmovl %esp, %ebp\r\n\r\n\t# Save some registers\r\n\tpushl %esi\r\n\tpushl %edi\r\n\tpushl %edx\r\n\r\n\t# Registers dedicated for counting\r\n\tpushl %eax\r\n\tpushl %ebx\r\n\tpushl %ecx\r\n\r\n\tmovl $2, %eax\t\t\t\t\t\t# %eax = 2 (loop-counter, int i = 2)\r\n\r\n\t# Place array and N in registers\r\n\tmovl N(%ebp), %edx\t\t\t\t\t# %edx = N\r\n\tmovl arr(%ebp), %edi\t\t\t\t# %edi = arr\r\n\r\n\t# Condition of first loop\r\n\tcondition:\r\n\t\tcmpl %edx, %eax\t\t\t\t\t# compare i with N\r\n\t\tjb populateArray\t\t        # if i is less than N, populate array\r\n\t\tjmp sieve_init\t\t\t\t\t# if not, array is fully populated, start Sieve init\r\n\r\n\t# Initialize array with 1&#39;s from arr[0] -&gt; arr[N-1]\r\n\tpopulateArray:\r\n\t\tmovl %eax, %esi\t\t\t\t     \r\n\t\tmovl $1, (%edi, %esi, 4)\t\t# a[i] = 1\r\n\t\tincl %eax\t\t\t\t\t\t# i++\r\n\t\tjmp condition\t\t\t\t\t# Check if condition is still valid, loop\r\n\r\n\t# Initialize counters\r\n\tsieve_init:\r\n\t\tmovl $2, %eax\t\t\t\t\t# %eax (i) = 2\r\n\t\tmovl %eax, %ebx\t\t\t\t\t# %eax (i) = %ebx (j)\r\n\t\tjmp sieve_outer_loop_condition\r\n\r\n\t# OUTER FOR-LOOP SIEVE\r\n\tsieve_outer_loop_condition:\r\n\t\tcmpl %edx, %eax\t\t\t\t\t# compare i with N\r\n\t\tjb sieve_inner_loop_init\t\t# if i is less than N, enter inner loop initalization\r\n\t\tjmp exit\t\t\t\t\t    # when every number is checked, exit loop and return the array\r\n\r\n\tsieve_inner_loop_init:\r\n\t\tmovl %eax, %ebx\t\t\t\t\t# %eax (i) = %ebx (j)\r\n\t\tjmp sieve_inner_loop_condition\r\n\r\n\t# INNER FOR-LOOP SIEVE\r\n\tsieve_inner_loop_condition:\r\n\t\tmovl %eax, %ecx\t\t\t\t\t# %ecx = %eax (i)\r\n\t\timul %ebx, %ecx\t\t\t\t\t# %ecx = %eax (i) * %ebx (j)\r\n\t\tcmpl %edx, %ecx\t\t\t\t\t# compare %ecx (i*j) with N\r\n\t\tjb sieve_inner_loop_statements  # if i*j &lt; N, enter loop-statements\r\n\t\tincl %eax\t\t\t\t\t\t# if not, increment %eax (i)\r\n\t\tjmp sieve_outer_loop_condition\t# check outer-loop condition again, loop\r\n\r\n\tsieve_inner_loop_statements:\r\n\t\tmovl %ecx, %esi \t\t\t\t# %esi = %ecx (i*j)\t\t\r\n\t\tmovl $0, (%edi, %esi, 4)\t\t# arr[i*j] = 0, allocating 4 bytes for integer value 0\r\n\t\tincl %ebx\t\t\t\t\t\t# increment %ebx (j)\r\n\t\tjmp sieve_inner_loop_condition\t# check innver-loop condition again, loop\r\n\r\n\texit:\r\n\t\tmovl %edi, %eax\t\t\t\t\t# return array\r\n\r\n\t# Epilogue, clean up the stack\r\n\tpopl %ecx\r\n\tpopl %ebx\r\n\tpopl %edx\r\n\r\n\tpopl %edi\r\n\tpopl %esi\r\n\tmovl %ebp, %esp\r\n\tpopl %ebp\r\n\tret\r\n``` \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/okQ5l.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzzt9.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957402/sieve-of-eratosthenes-in-x86-assembly-i-cannot-figure-out-whats-wrong-with-the","title":"Sieve of Eratosthenes in x86 assembly.

Consider a simplified version of the construct you&#39;ve used:\r\n\r\n    fabric.Canvas.prototype.add = (function A(argA) {\r\n      return function B(argsB){\r\n        //..\r\n      }\r\n    })(fabric.Canvas.prototype.add)\r\n\r\nHere you&#39;re invoking `function A`, passing `fabric.Canvas.prototype.add` as an argument. This creates a closure, preserving the original `fabric.Canvas.prototype.add` in `function A`&#39;s scope. Then, you&#39;re assigning whatever `function A` returns to the `fabric.Canvas.prototype.add`. In effect, this translates to\r\n\r\n    fabric.Canvas.prototype.add = function B(argsB){ /*... */}\r\n\r\nonly now `function B` has access to the original `fabric.Canvas.prototype.add`.\r\n\r\nReturning to your snippet, notice how you&#39;re expecting `object, callback` as arguments of `function A` and no arguments in `function B` - this does nothing useful (see above). Moreover, when you&#39;re calling `this.add()` - this is the place where you&#39;re supposed to call the _original_ `add()` not the _new one_. Otherwise, you&#39;re getting an infinite recursion.\r\n\r\n---\r\nHaving said that, here&#39;s the right way to do this:\r\n\r\n    fabric.Canvas.prototype.add = (function(originalFn) {\r\n      return function(...args) {\r\n        originalFn.call(this, ...args)\r\n        args[0].animate(&#39;top&#39;, &#39;100&#39;, {\r\n            onChange: this.renderAll.bind(this),\r\n            duration: 1000,\r\n            easing: fabric.util.ease.easeOutElastic,\r\n            onComplete: function () {\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        return this\r\n      };\r\n    })(fabric.Canvas.prototype.add);\r\n\r\nNote the usage of rest parameters `...args`, since `add()` is supposed to handle multiple objects as the arguments. I&#39;m calling `animate()` on the first passed object, so you might want to change that.\r\n\r\nAlso, don&#39;t forget that the original `add()` is supposed to return the instance of `fabric.Canvas` for the chaining to work, hence `return this` at the end.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957387/how-to-override-canvas-add-method-in-fabric-js/57992419#57992419","title":"how to override canvas.add() method in fabric js"}],"owner":{"reputation":343,"user_id":7511904,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1D8qQowguuo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/JMtrRJGUWiY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mayur kukadiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7511904/mayur-kukadiya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2124,"user_id":5045563,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b9dccd10e57c08cb05ec5b39fa80f6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"shkaper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5045563/shkaper"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57992419,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568808386,"creation_date":1568638615,"last_edit_date":1568801697,"question_id":57957387,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957387","body_markdown":"I am working in one image editor in which I want to add image into canvas with animation. \r\nI try to override canvas.add() method but unable to play animation.\r\n\r\nI am using fabric js version 1.7.22.\r\nWhen i try to googling.

Sometimes, the text for each line can be too long, so it wraps naturally. I want to prevent that. However, it is a requirement, that the full text must be displayed. I also don&#39;t want to break the tile layout by enlarging single tiles.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my idea was to use a CSS `transform: scaleX(?)` to squeeze the text in case. But I don&#39;t have a reference to the actual width of the text. Also, the with of the tiles is based on relative units, so I can&#39;t use any fixed pixel values.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my current css declatation:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;style&gt;\r\n        .flex-container .btn-lg {\r\n            width: 20vmin;\r\n            height: 20vmin;\r\n            margin: 8px;\r\n            font-size: 3.5vmin;\r\n            word-wrap: break-word;\r\n            white-space: normal;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        .btn-tile &gt; * {\r\n            display: flex;\r\n            justify-content: center;\r\n        }\r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div data-bind=&quot;foreach: $data.entries&quot; class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-secondary btn-lg btn-tile storageType-3&quot; data-bind=&quot;click: e, class: &#39;storageType-&#39; + d.type&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-ramp-loading&quot; data-bind=&quot;class: d.icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n            &lt;span data-bind=&quot;text: d.desc1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n            &lt;span data-bind=&quot;text: d.desc2&quot; style=&quot; /* Experimental */\r\n                transform: scaleX(.8);\r\n                white-space: nowrap;\r\n            &quot;&gt;This text is way too long&lt;/span&gt;\r\n        &lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nIf the texts `desc1` or `desc2` are too long, a scaleX should be applied, so that they fit inside the fixed size button.\r\n\r\nIs this even possible with pure CSS, or do I need to iterate over the tiles with Javascript, read the actual widths and calculate the scaling factor like that?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using knockout binding, by the way.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nI did some experimenting, but I still can&#39;t calculate the correct scaling factor. The correct factor should be somewhere around .3 for a longer text.

And when the operating system does it, it may split your data in the middle of a UTF-8 encoding sequence. In other words, consider this block of code:\r\n\r\n    foo = &#39;\\xce\\xdd\\xff&#39;       # three non-ascii characters\r\n    print(len(foo))            # =&gt; 3\r\n    bar = foo.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\r\n    print(bar)                 # =&gt; b&#39;\\xc3\\x8e\\xc3\\x9d\\xc3\\xbf&#39;\r\n    bar[:3].decode()           # =&gt;\r\n    UnicodeDecodeError: &#39;utf-8&#39; codec can&#39;t decode byte 0xc3 in position 2: unexpected end of data\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s going on: Those characters above 0x7f get encoded as two UTF8 bytes. But you cannot decode a character if the two-byte sequence gets truncated in the middle.\r\n\r\nSo, to easily fix your problem, receive all the data first (as a byte string), then decode the entire byte string as a unit.\r\n\r\nThis brings up another related issue: you needn&#39;t create your own data chunks. TCP will do that for you. And as you&#39;ve seen, TCP won&#39;t *preserve* your message boundaries anyway. So your best option is to properly &quot;frame&quot; your data. \r\n\r\nThat is, take some part of your string (or all of your string if it isn&#39;t hundreds of megabytes), and encode it in UTF-8. Take the length of the resulting byte buffer. Send, as binary data, a fixed-length size field (use the `struct` module to create that) containing that length. On the receiving side, first receive the fixed-length size field. This lets you know how many bytes of string data you actually need to receive. Receive all of those bytes, then decode the entire buffer at once.\r\n\r\nIn other words, ignoring error handling, sending side:\r\n\r\n    import struct\r\n    import socket\r\n    ...\r\n    str_to_send = &quot;blah blah\\xce&quot;\r\n    bytes_to_send = str_to_send.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\r\n    len_bytes = len(bytes_to_send)\r\n    sock.send(struct.pack(&quot;!I&quot;, len_bytes)         # Send 4-byte size header\r\n    sock.send(bytes_to_send)                       # Let TCP handle chunking bytes\r\n\r\nReceiving side:\r\n\r\n    len_bytes = sock.recv(4)                       # Receive 4-byte size header\r\n    len_bytes = struct.unpack(&quot;!I&quot;)[0]             # Convert to number (unpack returns a list)\r\n    \r\n    bytes_sent = b&#39;&#39;\r\n    while len(bytes_sent) &lt; len_bytes:\r\n        buf = sock.recv(1024)          # Note, may not always receive 1024 (but typically will)\r\n        if not buf:\r\n            print(&quot;Unexpected EOF!&quot;)\r\n            sys.exit(1)\r\n        bytes_sent += buf\r\n    str_sent = bytes_sent.decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\r\n\r\nFinal word: `socket.send` does *not* guarantee to send the entire buffer (although it typically does). And `socket.recv` does not guarantee to receive as many bytes as you specified in the argument. So, robust TCP sending/receiving code needs to accommodate those caveats.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957363/packet-is-sent-completely-somtimes-and-somtimes-is-not-sent-completely/57959689#57959689","title":"packet is sent completely somtimes and somtimes is not sent completely"}],"owner":{"reputation":1746,"user_id":1058591,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRYp4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PersianGulf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1058591/persiangulf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1746,"user_id":1058591,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRYp4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PersianGulf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1058591/persiangulf"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57959689,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568646450,"creation_date":1568638521,"last_edit_date":1568639921,"question_id":57957363,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957363","body_markdown":"@Grismar recommended me to create new topic for the following problem:\r\n\r\nI wrote a server and client with `socket` module.For multi connection I used [selectors module][1] instead of `thread` or `fork()`.\r\n\r\nScenario: I have to generate a massive string and send to client.Of course according to a string is generated by client.

I don&#39;t have problem for send query to server. \r\n\r\nBecause I have massive string, I decided to split my string to chunks, such as :\r\n\r\n    if sys.getsizeof(search_result_string) &gt; 1024:

Maybe it is a small thing im overseeing but the problem has been me for quiet a while now and I need it fixed. \r\n\r\n    import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Alert } from &#39;react-native&#39;;\r\n    import{ createAppContainer, createSwitchNavigator } from &#39;react-navigation&#39;;\r\n    import { createStackNavigator } from &#39;react-navigation-stack&#39;;\r\n    import LoginScreen from &#39;./Components/LoginScreen&#39;;\r\n    import firebase from &#39;./firebase&#39;;\r\n\r\n    class App extends Component{\r\n\r\n     checkedIfLoggedIn = () =&gt; {\r\n      firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user =&gt; {\r\n       if (user) {\r\n         this.props.navigation.navigate(AppStackNavigator);\r\n       } else {\r\n         this.props.navigation.navigate(&#39;LoginScreen&#39;);\r\n       }\r\n      })\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     componentDidMount(){\r\n       this.checkedIfLoggedIn();\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     render() {\r\n       return &lt; AppContainer /&gt;;\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    export default App","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957341/react-native-undefined-is-not-an-objectevaluating-this-props-navigation-navig","title":"React native: undefined is not an object(evaluating &#39;this.props.navigation.navigate&#39;)"},{"tags":["java","android","kotlin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33152,"user_id":1843331,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77726658fa83c059e6e95ba36cbcc981?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tim Castelijns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1843331/tim-castelijns"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568638531,"post_id":57957340,"comment_id":102326435,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957340/why-do-we-call-kotlin-class-as-java-class#comment102326435_57957340"},{"owner":{"reputation":16947,"user_id":506796,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e648659dd573c1161a370efa0f5e10d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tenfour04","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/506796/tenfour04"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568638716,"post_id":57957340,"comment_id":102326540,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57957340/why-do-we-call-kotlin-class-as-java-class#comment102326540_57957340"}],"owner":{"reputation":65,"user_id":9375612,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74c3ca3921153d06cdbcfe29702809b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Divelix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9375612/divelix"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568638609,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568638421,"creation_date":1568638421,"question_id":57957340,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57957340","body_markdown":"The question is about this bulky expression `ClassName::class.java` that is being used when we want to use name of a class as a parameter of some method:\r\n\r\n```Kotlin \r\nstartActivity(Intent(this, TorchActivity::class.java))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Java it would be just `ClassName.class` that is pretty and intuitive:\r\n\r\n```Java \r\nstartActivity(new Intent(this, TorchActivity.class))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in Kotlin code I have to write `ClassName::class.java` even when `ClassName` is a Kotlin class.
