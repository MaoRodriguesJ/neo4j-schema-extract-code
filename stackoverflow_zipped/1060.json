Usually when implementing a dependency property, you want something to happen when it receives a new value. The most basic way to do this is with a value changed callback. For example:\r\n\r\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty BlubbiProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(\r\n        nameof(Blubbi), typeof(object), typeof(MyControl),\r\n        new PropertyMetadata(default(object), (d, e) =&gt; ((MyControl)d).OnBlubbiChanged(e.oldValue, e,newValue)));\r\n\r\n    private void OnBlubbiChanged(object oldValue, object newValue)\r\n    {\r\n        // Do something here\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can do more advanced things in response to new incoming values  also, but usually don&#39;t need to. If you want to read more, here is an [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-callbacks-and-validation).\r\n\r\nNow all of that is fine for any `DependencyObject`, but if you are an element that extends from `FrameworkElement`, which most elements do, then you can use [FrameworkPropertyMetadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.frameworkpropertymetadata) in place of `PropertyMetadata` which provides some additional convenience features in the form of [FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.frameworkpropertymetadataoptions).\r\n\r\nSo let&#39;s say you use this property in your element&#39;s `OnRender` override, then you can ensure render gets automatically invalidated whenever the property value changes so that `OnRender` will be called again.\r\n\r\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty BlubbiProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(\r\n        nameof(Blubbi), typeof(object), typeof(MyControl),\r\n        new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(default(object), FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.AffectsRender));\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if your element is a `Control` that uses a XAML-defined template to represent itself, then you can keep your dependency property as it is and use it in your control template via a `TemplateBinding`.\r\n\r\n    &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=&quot;{x:Type myNamespace:MyControl}&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{TemplateBinding Blubbi}&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo when you say your property never gets updated, I have to ask how do you know that? The code you provided is incomplete, but it does not appear you are actually doing anything with the property that would make it obvious that it changed.\r\n\r\nAs an additional note, because this often surprises people, the property you have defined to wrap your dependency property will never be invoked via a binding. Bindings use the dependency object system to directly update the dependency property. Although a wrapper property is required in order to be able to set the property from XAML, it is not actually invoked when dealing with a dependency property. In other words, a breakpoint in your wrapper property&#39;s setter will never hit. So, never put any important logic in the wrapper property.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290331/binding-to-treeview-selecteditem-works-as-itemssource-but-not-for-custom-depende/58294725#58294725","title":"Binding to TreeView SelectedItem works as ItemsSource but not for custom DependencyProperty"}],"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":6556162,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce419eda38422db8aa80df537f676bf2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"japhwil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6556162/japhwil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570573082,"creation_date":1570551605,"question_id":58290331,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58290331","body_markdown":"I have a TreeView with an ICollection&lt;...&gt; for its ItemsSource.

The processing involves creating a uuid based on logic addressing various checks on input fields. Once a uuid is created, it&#39;s added to xref tables (in Phoenix) to xref with values from certain fields. Further records that match certain fields are meant to be assigned an existing uuid when they have matching fields in the xref table. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that the parallel processing seems to assign multiple uuids when it shouldn&#39;t. If a record comes in that&#39;s given a new uuid, but another record that should then match this uuid comes in within milliseconds, it will be processed too quickly and given a new uuid rather than matching the one that was just created. \r\nPresumably this is because the records are being processed in parallel form in the cluster, so they are not truly being processed in sequence. The large quantity of data being processed means that parallel processing is a necessity.\r\n\r\nSimplified example:\r\n\r\nEach record has &quot;columns&quot; Timestamp, A, B, and C. We assign value to a column uuid based on the content of these columns.\r\n\r\nRecords come in a sequence such as (values of columns A and C are mostly irrelevant in this example. Also, timestamp here is meant to represent when record is consumed, whereas in reality it shows time of creation upstream and isn&#39;t relevant to processing):\r\n```\r\n1. 2019-10-08 10:00:00:00 A1 B1 --\r\n2. 2019-10-08 10:00:00:01 A2 B1 C1\r\n3. 2019-10-08 10:00:20:00 -- B1 C1\r\n```\r\nLet&#39;s say the logic for assigning uuid is based on B in this case (although in reality this varies some), and a new uuid is created for this new B value in record 1. This uuid and matching B value (plus values for A and C for further, more complex checks) are upserted to a xref table row.\r\nThe second record checks the xref table by B1, but because it&#39;s being processed in parallel before the first record wrote to the xref, it again creates a new uuid, and upserts this to xref.\r\nNow we have resulting rows in Hive table:\r\n```\r\nA1 B1 -- uuid1\r\nA2 B1 C1 uuid2\r\n```\r\nwhen they should have the same uuid1.\r\nAdditionally, the xref table shows A2 B1 C1 uuid2 since the second record overwrote upon upsert as B1 is primary key. \r\nThis is not the main problem but it means that further records, such as 3, that are matched to xref because they did come after enough time are given the second uuid and uuid1 will never be assigned again, leaving the first row orphaned.\r\n\r\nThis is a difficult problem to sum up or search for, especially as I&#39;m quite new to all concepts and technologies involved. I greatly appreciate any help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290323/spark-streaming-from-kafka-processing-is-inaccurate-when-dependent-on-records-c","title":"Spark Streaming from Kafka, processing is inaccurate when dependent on records consumed within milliseconds"},{"tags":["node.js","vue.js","v-for","v-model"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9926982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hThPQFWvW64/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2M39oUr3VN9Cnef5hb22LQcdIXdw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9926982/brian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570552838,"post_id":58290534,"comment_id":102945569,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290320/vue-js-using-v-model-to-get-information-from-v-for/58290534#comment102945569_58290534"},{"owner":{"reputation":634475,"user_id":5445,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/932fb89b9d4049cec5cba357bf0ae388?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CMS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5445/cms"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9926982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hThPQFWvW64/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2M39oUr3VN9Cnef5hb22LQcdIXdw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9926982/brian"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570553291,"post_id":58290534,"comment_id":102945796,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290320/vue-js-using-v-model-to-get-information-from-v-for/58290534#comment102945796_58290534"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":634475,"user_id":5445,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/932fb89b9d4049cec5cba357bf0ae388?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CMS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5445/cms"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570552490,"creation_date":1570552490,"answer_id":58290534,"question_id":58290320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58290534","body_markdown":"You just need to set the `value` attribute of the `option` element to be the `_id` of each object:\r\n\r\n      &lt;select v-model=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;option v-for=&quot;device in devices&quot; :value=&quot;device._id&quot;&gt;{{ device.name }}&lt;/option&gt;\r\n      &lt;/select&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nBy assigning the value attribute, it will make the select element to have this value as the selected one.\r\n\r\nSee an example:\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    new Vue({\r\n      el: &#39;#app&#39;,\r\n      template: `&lt;div&gt;\r\n      Selected: {{ selected }}\r\n       &lt;select v-model=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;option v-for=&quot;device in devices&quot; :value=&quot;device._id&quot;&gt;{{ device.name }}&lt;/option&gt;\r\n        &lt;/select&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;`,\r\n      data() {\r\n        return {\r\n          selected: 1,\r\n          devices: [\r\n            { _id: 1, name: &#39;Device 1&#39; },\r\n            { _id: 2, name: &#39;Device 2&#39; },\r\n            { _id: 3, name: &#39;Device 3&#39; },\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.5.17/vue.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290320/vue-js-using-v-model-to-get-information-from-v-for/58290534#58290534","title":"Vue.js, using v-model to get information from v-for"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9926982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hThPQFWvW64/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2M39oUr3VN9Cnef5hb22LQcdIXdw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9926982/brian"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58290534,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570552729,"creation_date":1570551560,"question_id":58290320,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58290320","body_markdown":"I have a dropdown box in a modal, that is populated with device objects.

@ok=&quot;buttonOK(selected)&quot; @cancel=&quot;buttonCancel&quot; :title=&quot;app.name&quot; transition=&quot;zoom&quot; :okText=&quot;&#39;Add Device&#39;&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;block&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;p class=&quot;subtitle is-5&quot;&gt;Choose a device to add to the app:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;select v-model=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;option v-for=&quot;device in devices&quot;&gt;{{ device.name }}&lt;/option&gt;\r\n      &lt;/select&gt;\r\n      &lt;span&gt;Device: {{ selected }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/card-modal&gt;\r\n&lt;/template&gt;\r\n```\r\nWhat is the best way for me to save the entire device object (or just the device._id) instead of just the device name, which is being selected by the user? \r\n   ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290320/vue-js-using-v-model-to-get-information-from-v-for","title":"Vue.js, using v-model to get information from v-for"},{"tags":["python","pandas"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12182889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66d850e4b4ac30576a3af35220fa3cba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jmark7453","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182889/jmark7453"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570553819,"post_id":58290366,"comment_id":102946044,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290318/create-new-python-dataframe-column-based-on-conditions-of-multiple-other-columns/58290366#comment102946044_58290366"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5586,"user_id":11884237,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANKZR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ansev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11884237/ansev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5586,"user_id":11884237,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANKZR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ansev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11884237/ansev"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570552646,"last_edit_date":1570552646,"creation_date":1570551736,"answer_id":58290366,"question_id":58290318,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58290366","body_markdown":"Use [Series.str.contains][1] with `case=False` to **not case-sensitive**:\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;Column_C&#39;]= np.where((df[&#39;Column_A&#39;]&gt;0) | (df[&#39;Column_B&#39;].str.contains(&#39;apple&#39;, case=False)) ,&#39;Yes&#39;,&#39;No&#39;)\r\n    print(df)\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n    \r\n\r\n       Column_A            Column_B Column_C\r\n    0        23        Orange_Juice      Yes\r\n    1         2     Banana_Smoothie      Yes\r\n    2         8     Pineapple_Juice      Yes\r\n    3         0  Pineapple_Smoothie      Yes\r\n    4         0         Apple_Juice      Yes\r\n    5         0            Lemonade       No\r\n    6        34       Coconut_Water      Yes\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.contains.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290318/create-new-python-dataframe-column-based-on-conditions-of-multiple-other-columns/58290366#58290366","title":"Create new Python DataFrame column based on conditions of multiple other columns"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3236,"user_id":9302488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/097c89e042db32a2510ab6bd328d3b02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Massifox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9302488/massifox"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570553252,"creation_date":1570553252,"answer_id":58290718,"question_id":58290318,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58290718","body_markdown":"Try this code, using [pandas.Dataframe.apply][1] function:\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;Column_C&#39;] = df.apply(lambda row: &#39;Yes&#39;

think they deleted my comment under your other screenshot, so here is the procedure. \r\n\r\nYou look like you are using Pycharm. In the very bottom left, there should be a button which says “Terminal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on it. \r\n\r\nNow go to your file tree (the list of files typically on the left side of Pycharm), and locate the directory where manage.py is. \r\n\r\nNow, check that the path of that directory matches the path in your terminal. \r\n\r\nIf it does, skip the next step. \r\n\r\nIf it doesn’t, you need to navigate your Terminal to that directory. The most probable thing you will need to enter into your terminal is \r\n\r\n`cd YourProjectName`\r\n\r\nOnce you are in the correct directory, enter into your terminal:\r\n\r\n\r\n`python manage.py makemigrations`\r\n\r\nIf that works fine without errors, do:\r\n\r\n`python manage.py migrate`\r\n\r\nThat should resolve your issue.

Right now, we use 2 different url paths ```/path/usertypea/list``` vs ```/path/usertypeb/list```.  We would like to make them use the same path if possible, for example ```/path/list```, and have an environment variable be the condition to know where to route the traffic.  The parameters for each user type aren&#39;t exactly the same, there are some differences in how the data is organized.  We&#39;re using Jersey.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a few things like Singleton classes: https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/user-guide.html#d0e2650 /

code:\r\n```\r\n@Path(&quot;/list&quot;)\r\npublic class GlobalSegmentServiceRouter {\r\n\t@GET\r\n\t@Produces(&quot;application/json&quot;)\r\n\tpublic Class&lt;?&gt; findAll() {\r\n\t\tboolean

class files for the following:\r\n```\r\n@Singleton\r\npublic class UserTypeAService {\r\n\tpublic List&lt;String&gt; findAll(/*Parameters for A*/) {\r\n\t\t// Do work here for User Type A\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n@Singleton\r\npublic class UserTypeBService {\r\n\tpublic List&lt;String&gt; findAll(/*Parameters for B*/) {\r\n\t\t// Do work here for User Type B\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen I try and hit the endpoint, this is the response I get:\r\n```\r\n&quot;com.test.services.UserTypeAService&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how to accomplish

am trying to scrape football data from Soccerway.com and have found that the URLs follow the format of https://us.soccerway.com/matches/Year/Month/Day/Country/League/HomeTeam/AwayTeam/GameID/ \r\n\r\nThrough looking at leagues, I found that only changing the GameID would result in getting a different game for example &quot;https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2019/10/06/england/premier-league/arsenal-fc/afc-bournemouth/3029143/&quot; would give the game between Arsenal and Bournemouth and typing in &quot;https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2019/10/06/england/premier-league/arsenal-fc/afc-bournemouth/3029144/&quot; would give the next game in the list between Brighton and Tottenham.\r\n\r\nI have been able to collect a comprehensive list of IDs that I would like to pull data from however I am having issues where using the same format URL &quot;https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2019/10/06/england/premier-league/arsenal-fc/afc-bournemouth/GameID/&quot; would give a different page compared to using the actual Game URL\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n**https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2019/10/06/england/premier-league/newcastle-united-football-club/manchester-united-fc/3029148/** Is the game between Newcastle and Manchester United and gives the results of the game But using a pre-generated URL **https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2018/08/10/england/premier-league/manchester-united-fc/leicester-city-fc/3029148/** gives the page as if the game is to be played.\r\n\r\nMy issue is that I am otheriwse unable to collect URLs for games since the format would need me to know all the information about the game before scraping, which I need to do to collect the information\r\n\r\nFull code is available here -

I would prefer not to change `DataProcessor` for my test.\r\n\r\nNormally, the callback is accessible because `IDataSupplier` has access to the `std::function` object that wraps the private method. Because I have a mocked version of `IDataSupplier`, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m able to capture the callback that was given to it (and again, it feels wrong to have to rely on this; what if gmock stops allowing me to get the provided `std::function`?)\r\n\r\nSo my questions boil down to these two:\r\n\r\n1.

If that is the case, you should try and model your project in IntelliJ as you want it, and once you have found a way to do it, then figure out how to use customize the Idea plugin to do it for you.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am pretty sure you can&#39;t have multiple modules in IntelliJ share the same &quot;content root&quot;.

probably know this, but a greyscale image is just a 2D array of numbers, usually in the range [0, 1] or [0, 255]. So you can check if an image is grayscale by checking the number of dimensions: if it has 2, then it&#39;s greyscale; if it has 3, then it&#39;s colour. (If the last dimension has a depth of 4, then it has R, G, B channels, plus opacity information.)\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that you are applying a colourmap and saving the resulting pseudocolour image with 4 channels (RGBA). I think you have a few options:\r\n\r\n- Modify the neural network code to just use one channel of the data you give it. Since you applied a greyscale colourmap, the RGB channels will all be the same.\r\n- Modify the neural network code to accept NumPy arrays instead of images, and use `np.save()` to save the image arrays.\r\n- Save the PNGs in a way that lets you save greyscale images. I recommend `PIL`, used via [`pillow`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\r\n\r\nAssuming `train_images[i]` is a 2D array with values in [0, 1], you could do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    from PIL import Image\r\n\r\n    # Make it unsigned integers:\r\n    data = (train_image[i] * 255).astype(np.uint8)\r\n\r\n    # Make an Image object and save it:\r\n    Image.fromarray(data).save(&#39;test.png&#39;)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290171/how-to-save-a-picture-in-true-grayscale/58290462#58290462","title":"How to save a picture in true grayscale?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12045965,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c8cc25a3b989d23c585403f5b19e9c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"number73","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12045965/number73"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570553530,"creation_date":1570550911,"question_id":58290171,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58290171","body_markdown":"I want to save pictures from MNIST dataset in real grayscale.

Why would I get the error about body attribute missing in multipart?\r\n2. Why would I get invalid arg type?\r\n3.

working on implementing the repository pattern in ASP.NET CORE. Basically, I want to implement an IRepository interface like so, it will have more methods but this is the gist of it. It&#39;s pretty standard.\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic interface IRepository\r\n{\r\n   T GetById&lt;T&gt;(int id) where T : BaseEntity;\r\n   T Add&lt;T&gt;(T entity) where T : BaseEntity;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `BaseEntity` class\r\n``` c#\r\npublic abstract class BaseEntity\r\n{\r\n   public int Id { get; set; }\r\n   public List&lt;BaseDomainEvent&gt; Events = new List&lt;BaseDomainEvent&gt;();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is where I hit my problem, I have one many-to-many table designed to represent the parts currently assigned to a discrepancy, `DiscrepancyPart`, that is generated by Entity Core.   \r\n**The main problem, though, is it doesn&#39;t have an Id property**.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n`DiscrepancyPart` and how it&#39;s generated\r\n``` c#\r\npublic class DiscrepancyPart\r\n{\r\n   public int DiscrepancyId { get; set; }\r\n   public int PartId { get; set; }\r\n   public int Qty { get; set; }\r\n   // Discrepancy\r\n   public Discrepancy Discrepancy { get; set; }\r\n   // Part\r\n   public Part Part { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n{\r\n   // Many-to-many relationship between Discrepancy and Part\r\n   modelBuilder.Entity&lt;DiscrepancyPart&gt;()\r\n      .HasKey(bc =&gt; new { bc.DiscrepancyId, bc.PartId });\r\n   modelBuilder.Entity&lt;DiscrepancyPart&gt;()\r\n      .HasOne(bc =&gt; bc.Discrepancy)\r\n      .WithMany(b =&gt; b.DiscrepancyParts)\r\n      .HasForeignKey(bc =&gt; bc.DiscrepancyId);\r\n   modelBuilder.Entity&lt;DiscrepancyPart&gt;()\r\n      .HasOne(bc =&gt; bc.Part)\r\n      .WithMany(c =&gt; c.DiscrepancyParts)\r\n      .HasForeignKey(bc =&gt; bc.PartId);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI hope the problem is fairly straightforward, I don&#39;t know how to incorporate this entity using the base entity class, each idea I get just sounds like a massive anti-pattern.

You will see a definite hint to an unsupported `[END]` flag in your http servers error log file in that case. You can either try to upgrade or use the older `[L]` flag, it probably will work the same in this situation, though that depends a bit on your setup. \r\n\r\nThis implementation will work likewise in the http servers host configuration or inside a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; file). Obviously the rewriting module needs to be loaded inside the http server and enabled in the http host. In case you use a dynamic configuration file you need to take care that it&#39;s interpretation is enabled at all in the host configuration and that it is located in the host&#39;s `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder. \r\n\r\nAnd a general remark: you should always prefer to place such rules in the http servers host configuration instead of using dynamic configuration files (&quot;.htaccess&quot;). Those dynamic configuration files add complexity, are often a cause of unexpected behavior, hard to debug and they really slow down the http server. They are only provided as a last option for situations where you do not have access to the real http servers host configuration (read: really cheap service providers) or for applications insisting on writing their own rules (which is an obvious security nightmare).

Based on it, I removed all /tmp/ files and used the &quot;df&quot; command to check and free up space in my Linux server.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I have found the following mounted in my /home/ directory with all the space used. \r\n\r\n    /dev/mapper/rootVG-homeLV                                            999320      930508           0 100% /home\r\n\r\nWhat does this indicate and would this affect the code execution in a subdirectory on /home/? (I&#39;m running this under the directory /home/pocuser/Python Tool)\r\n\r\nAny guidance to get this openpyxl program running would be great.

0 And Link)\r\n\r\nNote that the conditional branches are effectively branching on the sign bit of the register.\r\n\r\n`bal` is an alias for `bgezal $zero, target`, useful for doing a PC-relative function call.  (MIPS branches use a fully relative encoding for branch displacement, MIPS jumps use a region-absolute encoding that replaces the low 28 bits of PC+4.  This matters for position-independent code).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNone of this is particularly relevant to your case; your `foo` needs to save/restore `$ra` on entry/before `jr $ra` because you need to call `bar` with a `jal` or `bal`.  Using a linking branch as the loop branch wouldn&#39;t affect anything (except to make your code even less efficient, and make performance worse on real CPUs that do return-address prediction with a special predictor that assumes `jal` and `jr $ra` are paired properly).\r\n\r\nUsing `bal` / `jal` doesn&#39;t automatically make the thing you jump to ever return; that only happens if the target ever uses `jr $ra` (potentially after copying `$ra` somewhere else then restoring it).\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/digital/MIPSir.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290144/how-do-i-transfer-control-after-a-loop-in-assembly/58293351#58293351","title":"How do I transfer control after a loop in assembly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":10461807,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Nd0wFq3dh7U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACo/qZBRQvP2qY4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nourhan Berjawi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10461807/nourhan-berjawi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13131,"user_id":6243352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/715f60f9edc65642a6805752cfeebb27?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ggorlen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6243352/ggorlen"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58290886,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570565104,"creation_date":1570550840,"last_edit_date":1570551029,"question_id":58290144,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58290144","body_markdown":"I would like to translate the C code below into assembly language.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not see that I need to use the stack in this example.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I&#39;d like to know whether or not &quot;beq&quot;

From third point stated above looks like React just update the DOM for only the part that has been changed but other system(primarily jquery or native js) will recreate the complete DOM. Is that correct?**\r\n\r\n**jQuery**\r\n\r\n---------\r\nNo, jQuery doesn&#39;t recreate the DOM. Instead it navigates the DOM tree with selectors provided to make the appropriate changes. This makes jQuery very similar to React, but its performance issues come with the way the code was designed and it&#39;s heavy usage of the [facade design pattern][1]. This is normal for any larger library that needs to support multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.\r\n\r\n**Angular 1**\r\n\r\n---------\r\nA framework that used to repaint the entire DOM was Angular 1. The client would make some changes, and rerender whenever `$scope.apply` or `$scope.digest` was called. This, combined with a huge number of listeners on large pages for two way data-binding was one of the big reasons why Angular had to undergo significant changes to stay competitive. Angular 8 is probably equivalent to React, but one has seen more adoption then the other.\r\n\r\n**React**\r\n\r\n---------\r\nReact only updates the DOM that was changed. This is part of its &quot;secret sauce&quot;. Along with its component centric architecture and early adoption of one way data-binding, it&#39;s seen a lot of success. Arguably React is starting to get more bloated since there&#39;s such wide adoption. This is normal for any project that gets mainstream usage. It&#39;s only a matter of time until people view React as a ton of performance problems and we&#39;ll create a new framework.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\n\r\n---------\r\nThere are even faster frameworks than React, such as [Elm lang][2]. Nothing ever beats pure Javascript (e.g. `document.querySelector()`) since at their core, all frameworks use it. At that point you start hitting other trade offs such as lack of external libraries you can depend on, or difficulty in maintaining large front end codebases.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n**Is the third point true only for dom changes or even when state of any UI component changes like filling the text box/drop down etc ?**\r\n\r\nFor jQuery or pure JS the third point is not true. There&#39;s a custom `on-click` handler of some sort that will run a function that makes a small change.\r\n\r\nFor something like Angular, that could be true if there are changes to `scope` that trigger a repaint. The same applies for React. If your `submit` button is supposed to redirect you to a completely different page, it will basically be repainting the DOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/facade-design-pattern-introduction/\r\n  [2]: https://elm-lang.org","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290139/reactjs-virtual-dom-in-memory-and-applying-incremental-changes/58293318#58293318","title":"ReactJS virtual DOM in memory and applying incremental changes"}],"owner":{"reputation":3769,"user_id":3222249,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05af886cde4772ffc679ca0a6ff5d898?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"emilly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3222249/emilly"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2327,"user_id":4842949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0agpj31wtZ8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/mSolbNN-zIY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joseph Cho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4842949/joseph-cho"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570565608,"creation_date":1570550818,"last_edit_date":1570565608,"question_id":58290139,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58290139","body_markdown":"Came across below [statement][1] in one or other form on google\r\n\t\r\n\r\n&gt; Each time the underlying data changes in a React app, a new Virtual\r\n&gt; DOM representation of the user interface is created.This is where\r\n&gt; things get interesting. Updating the browser’s DOM is a three-step\r\n&gt; process in React.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. Whenever anything may have changed, the entire UI will be re-rendered\r\n&gt; in a Virtual DOM representation. \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;2.

If there is an unambiguous lowest common ancestor, then it&#39;s a subclass of every element of `all_common_ancestors` (including itself), so we&#39;ll set `candidate` to the lowest common ancestor when we reach it and then never change `candidate` again. If there is no unambiguous lowest common ancestor, then whatever `candidate` ends up as at the end of the loop, it won&#39;t pass the verification check.\r\n\r\nThe trickier part is dealing with `__subclasscheck__`/`__subclasshook__` overrides. I *think* this implementation should be robust enough to handle *most* common ABC cases, but the entire concept of a lowest common ancestor gets weird when arbitrary `__subclasscheck__` implementations make the graph defined by `issubclass` not even a DAG.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58290137/how-to-find-most-recent-common-ancestor-base-type-of-several-types-in-python/58290798#58290798","title":"How to find most recent common ancestor (base type) of several types in python?"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":1424589,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12710bce2e3768d999d7ee3247252b8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1424589","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1424589/user1424589"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":82,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570602352,"creation_date":1570550816,"question_id":58290137,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58290137","body_markdown":"I need to find the last common ancestor of a group of classes so I can return that type.\r\n\r\nContext, I&#39;m doing some rather complex meta-programing involving overloading numpy functionality.

there a way to incorporate **`Python` functions from an external module/library** in a function you&#39;re writing/defining, **without importing them globally or beyond of the function scope**?
