with a conflict, open in text editor and fix it; then &lt;br/&gt; \r\n```\r\ngit add &quot;file-with-conflict&quot; \r\ngit commit -a -m &quot;&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n4) Finally `git push`\r\n\r\nToday when I tried the same steps to merge the master in to my feature branch I am getting issues &lt;br/&gt; \r\n1) After `git checkout master` I am getting following message \r\n&gt;Switched to branch

No?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287969/example-of-misuse-of-stdmemory-orderrelaxed-in-c-standard-algorithms-para","title":"Example of misuse of std::memory_order::relaxed in C++ Standard [algorithms.parallel.exec/5 in n4713]"},{"tags":["rest","powershell","api-design","octopus-deploy"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12182747,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sUxyf6gA3wo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf9Q5lXei2OruBSKHiSvDAK3f59Ng/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sean Graham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12182747/sean-graham"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570543375,"creation_date":1570543375,"question_id":58287968,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287968","body_markdown":"Unable to create multiple machines at the same time in script\r\n\r\nI have been trying to clone an environment in Octopus mainly for me to practice interacting with API&#39;s.

The `thenApply()` part is invoked only, when the code inside `supplyAsync` finishes execution, which most probably happens after you have already returned the `response`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to wait for all `CompletableFutures` to finish execution before returning the `response`, then you should use the `CompletableFuture.join()` method.\r\n\r\nFirst try to refactor your code, to get rid of `thenApply()` part, so that your ~CompletableFutures` result in the *partial responses*.\r\n\r\nThen assign all `CompletableFutures` to some variables (`myFirstFuture`, `mySecondFuture` etc in my example).\r\n\r\nAfter that using a `Stream` apply a `join()` method on all the `CompletableFutures` and apply your `putInResponse` method for each of the results.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; getAllValuesInParallel2(RequestObj requestObj) {\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; response = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(6);\r\n    CompletableFuture&lt;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&gt; myFuture1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt; {\r\n        List&lt;Template&gt; keys = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        keys.add(&quot;mani&quot;);\r\n        return aClient.transform(keys, requestObj);\r\n    }, executor);\r\n\r\n    CompletableFuture&lt;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&gt; myFuture2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt; {\r\n        List&lt;Template&gt; keys = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        keys.add(&quot;gani&quot;);\r\n        return bClient.transform(keys, requestObj);\r\n    }, executor);\r\n\r\n    CompletableFuture&lt;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&gt; myFuture3 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt; {\r\n        List&lt;Template&gt; keys = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        keys.add(&quot;priya&quot;);\r\n        return cClient.transform(keys, requestObj);\r\n    }, executor);\r\n\r\n    CompletableFuture&lt;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&gt; myFuture4 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt; {\r\n        List&lt;Template&gt; keys = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        keys.add(&quot;ravi&quot;);\r\n        return dClient.transform(keys, requestObj);\r\n    }, executor);\r\n\r\n    Stream.of(myFuture1, myFuture2, myFuture3, myFuture4)\r\n        .map(CompletableFuture::join)\r\n        .filter(Objects::nonNull)\r\n        .forEachOrdered(s -&gt; putIntoResponse(response, s));\r\n\r\n\r\n    return response;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287953/not-able-to-get-the-result-of-completable-future-into-the-response-object/58288204#58288204","title":"Not able to get the result of completable future into the response object"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":6132595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2KlJ4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"amazing_milkha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6132595/amazing-milkha"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5,"user_id":6132595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2KlJ4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"amazing_milkha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6132595/amazing-milkha"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58288204,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570545702,"creation_date":1570543336,"last_edit_date":1570544611,"question_id":58287953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287953","body_markdown":"I am calling four APIs using the CompletableFuture interface of java.util.concurrent with Java8.

to the person configured in its constructor.\r\n\r\nNow, the `koinComponent` function:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun &lt;T&gt; koinComponent(block: Koin.() -&gt; T) {\r\n    GlobalContext.get().koin.block()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour function:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun sayHello() = koinComponent {\r\n    val helloService: HelloServiceImpl by inject()\r\n\r\n    helloService.sayHello()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the usage:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun main() {\r\n    startKoin {\r\n        modules(listOf(\r\n            module {\r\n                single { HelloServiceImpl(&quot;majkrzak&quot;) }\r\n            }\r\n        ))\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    sayHello()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput: `Hello, majkrzak!`\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s all very simple: in order to be able to use the [`inject` delegate](https://insert-koin.io/docs/2.0/documentation/reference/index.html#_retrieving_definitions_with_get_inject), you need a Koin context. Actually, the way `KoinComponent` works is by using the `GlobalContext`:\r\n\r\n```koin\r\ninterface KoinComponent {\r\n    fun getKoin(): Koin = GlobalContext.get().koin\r\n}\r\n\r\ninline fun &lt;reified T&gt; KoinComponent.inject(\r\n        qualifier: Qualifier? = null,\r\n        noinline parameters: ParametersDefinition? = null\r\n): Lazy&lt;T&gt; =\r\n        getKoin().inject(qualifier, parameters)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, why not do the same? We declare the `koinComponent` function so that it&#39;s `block` argument is called with a `Koin` receiver and use that global koin instance implicitly.\r\n\r\nWe can make it more reusable by using default values:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun &lt;T&gt; koinComponent(koin: Koin = GlobalContext.get().koin, block: Koin.() -&gt; T) {\r\n    koin.block()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I have a question to you: why do you need that?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287945/create-function-inheriting-koin-component/58288884#58288884","title":"Create function inheriting koin component"}],"owner":{"reputation":140,"user_id":11684473,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f75d9637ee85de92c304840bea0b9b4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"majkrzak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11684473/majkrzak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58288884,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570547852,"creation_date":1570543317,"question_id":58287945,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287945","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to simplify:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n// Tag class with KoinComponent\r\nclass HelloApp : KoinComponent {\r\n\r\n    // lazy inject dependency\r\n    val helloService: HelloServiceImpl by inject()\r\n\r\n    fun sayHello(){\r\n        helloService.sayHello()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto something like \r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun sayHello() = koinComponent {\r\n    val helloService: HelloServiceImpl by inject()\r\n    helloService.sayHello()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it even possible that way, or I&#39;m doomed with making a class with `invoke` operator?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287945/create-function-inheriting-koin-component","title":"Create function inheriting koin component"},{"tags":["java","lombok"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7703,"user_id":1786065,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/udTpS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rogue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1786065/rogue"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570544061,"post_id":58287942,"comment_id":102941085,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287942/avoid-instantiate-generics-without-defining-the-class#comment102941085_58287942"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1336,"user_id":10533011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13cf679869635f63c1d842fa24604a02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Donat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10533011/donat"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570544007,"creation_date":1570544007,"answer_id":58288162,"question_id":58287942,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58288162","body_markdown":"You cannot prohibit this syntactical variant.

My plan was to replace it on phones running iOS 13 and above, and still use the old library on iOS versions below 13. However I can&#39;t get the app to even start in iOS 12.4 without crashing. I&#39;ve removed everything else and only att these simple lines\r\n```\r\nif #available(iOS 13.0, *) {\r\n    let nonce = try? AES.GCM.Nonce(data: iv)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `#available` I thought was used to make sure that is was skipped if the condition wasn&#39;t fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe stranger part is that the app crashes without me ever calling the meshing containing these lines, just having them somewhere in the app causes it to crash.\r\n\r\nI have also imported CryptoKit at the top (with and without `if canImport(CryptoKit)`) and I have added `@available(iOS 13.0, *)` to the class.\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me the correct way to &quot;exclude&quot; the code, or whatever the correct way is, for lower iOS-versions. I guess it must be possible to use iOS 13-specific functionality while still maintaining backwards-compability through &quot;old&quot; methods?\r\n\r\nAlso, I&#39;m using Xcode 11, but I guess that may be obvious.\r\n\r\nAnd the error I&#39;m getting is:\r\n```\r\ndyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/CryptoKit.framework/CryptoKit\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: Now I&#39;ve also tried putting this around the entire class (including the import)\r\n```\r\n#if canImport(CryptoKit)\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd also, I&#39;ve notices that this line can exist without crashing the app:\r\n```\r\nlet key = SymmetricKey(data: Data())\r\n```\r\nAnd symmetric key is also part of CryptoKit\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: I&#39;ve figured out that weak linking would solve the problem. I tried using one of the other new (iOS 13) frameworks, CryptoTokenKit, and had the same problem. But here I could add the framework and set the linking to optional, which solved the problem. However when adding frameworks to the app CryptoKit is not available for some reason.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287922/cryptokit-craches-app-on-phones-with-ios-version-below-13","title":"CryptoKit craches app on phones with iOS version below 13"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":174348,"user_id":616443,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/907798bf02efdaf6f9d07d3c0552868f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"j08691","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/616443/j08691"},"edited":false,"score":6,"creation_date":1570543331,"post_id":58287920,"comment_id":102940635,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287920/cant-retrieve-data-from-api#comment102940635_58287920"},{"owner":{"reputation":5740,"user_id":7194268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/def585555f060fee8dcc065f270e403b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mbojko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7194268/mbojko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570543579,"post_id":58287920,"comment_id":102940789,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287920/cant-retrieve-data-from-api#comment102940789_58287920"},{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570543738,"post_id":58287920,"comment_id":102940886,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287920/cant-retrieve-data-from-api#comment102940886_58287920"},{"owner":{"reputation":34067,"user_id":1377002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oDeF7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1377002/andy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570543801,"post_id":58287920,"comment_id":102940925,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287920/cant-retrieve-data-from-api#comment102940925_58287920"},{"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":11131552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90985557c23cd316a4b878e037d35ed6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rahni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11131552/rahni"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570543804,"post_id":58287920,"comment_id":102940928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287920/cant-retrieve-data-from-api#comment102940928_58287920"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":11131552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90985557c23cd316a4b878e037d35ed6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rahni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11131552/rahni"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570544080,"post_id":58288149,"comment_id":102941093,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287920/cant-retrieve-data-from-api/58288149#comment102941093_58288149"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570544488,"last_edit_date":1570544488,"creation_date":1570543957,"answer_id":58288149,"question_id":58287920,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58288149","body_markdown":"This works better\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    fetch(&#39;https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/science.json?api-key=yourApiKey&#39;)\r\n      .then((resp) =&gt;

See the [style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Avoid-v-if-with-v-for-essential) for further information.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; **When used together with v-if, v-for has a higher priority than v-if**. See the [list rendering guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#v-for-with-v-if) for details.\r\n\r\nSo, you cannot use the `comment` from the `v-for` statement, it&#39;s not available when `v-if` is being evaluated. Therefore it&#39;s undefined and cannot have a `user` property, which explains the error message.\r\n\r\nSee the proposed solutions linked to from the official docs and the quote above. You could for example have a computed property that pre-filters `comments.data` for only those commetns that have `user` set.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomputed: {\r\n  commentsWithUser: function() {\r\n    return this.comments.filter(c =&gt; { return c.user });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then use `v-for=&quot;comment in commentsWithUser&quot;` instead.\r\n\r\n*Additional note:* You should also supply a `:key` value when using `v-for`. It has to be something unique for each rendered element, so if your comments have an ID, let&#39;s say in `comments.data[...].id`, then `:key=&quot;comment.id&quot; v-for=&quot;comment in comments.data&quot;` would make sense.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287917/laravel-vue-js-error-in-render-typeerror-cannot-read-property-user-of-nul/58288226#58288226","title":"laravel Vue.js : Error in render: &quot;TypeError: Cannot read property &#39;user&#39; of null&quot;"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":98,"user_id":11527337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10212174263505448/picture?type=large","display_name":"Yohei Umezu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11527337/yohei-umezu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570556765,"creation_date":1570556765,"answer_id":58291546,"question_id":58287917,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58291546","body_markdown":"Thank you guys, I could solve this by changing to v-for=&quot;comment in comments.data.data&quot; :key=&quot;comment.id&quot;.

To do this, open `Power Query Editor` by clicking `Edit Queries` and in `Manage Parameters` define two new text parameters, lets name them `ServerName` and `DatabaseName`:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nSet their current values to point to one of your data sources, e.g. `SQLSERVER2016` and `AdventureWorks2016`. Then right click your query in the report and open `Advanced Editor`. Find the server name and database name in the M code:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nand replace them with the parameters defined above, so the M code will look like this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\nNow you can close and apply changes and your report should work as before. But now when you want to change the data source, do it using `Edit Parameters`:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\nand change the server and/or database name to point to the other data source, that you want to use for your report:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][7]][7]\r\n\r\nAfter changing parameter values, Power BI Desktop will ask you to apply the changes and reload the data from the new data source. To change the parameter values (i.e. the data source) of a report published in Power BI Service, go to dataset&#39;s settings and enter new server and/or database name:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][8]][8]\r\n\r\nAfter changing the data source, refresh your dataset to get the data from the new data source. With Power BI Pro account you can do this 8 times per 24 hours, while if the dataset is in a dedicated capacity, this limit is raised to 48 times per 24 hours.\r\n\r\nTo do this programatically, use [`Update Parameters`][9] / [`Update Parameters In Group`][10] and [`Refresh Dataset`][11] / [`Refresh Dataset In Group`][12] REST API calls. For example, you can do this with PowerShell like this:\r\n\r\n\tImport-Module MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt\r\n\tImport-Module MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt.Profile\r\n\r\n\t$password = &quot;xxxxx&quot; | ConvertTo-SecureString -asPlainText -Force\r\n\t$username = &quot;xxxxx@yyyyy.com&quot; \r\n\t$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username, $password)\r\n\r\n\tConnect-PowerBIServiceAccount -Credential $credential\r\n\r\n\tInvoke-PowerBIRestMethod -Url &#39;groups/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/datasets/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/UpdateParameters&#39; -Method Post -Body &#39;{\r\n\t  &quot;updateDetails&quot;: [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;ServerName&quot;,\r\n\t\t  &quot;newValue&quot;: &quot;SQLSERVER2019&quot;\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;DatabaseName&quot;,\r\n\t\t  &quot;newValue&quot;: &quot;AdventureWorks2019&quot;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t  ]\r\n\t}&#39;\r\n\tInvoke-PowerBIRestMethod -Url &#39;groups/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/datasets/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/refreshes&#39; -Method Post\r\n\r\n\tDisconnect-PowerBIServiceAccount\r\n\r\nUPDATE: For Live connection to SSAS, parameters cannot be used.

Otherwise it gets messy once you come across function overloads that expect `char` objects to actually be characters (e.g., formatted stream IO):\r\n\r\n    int hello = 52;\r\n\r\nIf you really need to save some memory, you can use `unsigned char` directly:\r\n\r\n    unsigned char hello = 52;\r\n\r\nIf, for whatever reasons, you want to limit the lifetime of the object to a smaller scope, you can just introduce another level of nesting:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        unsigned char hello = 52;\r\n    } // no need to delete here, because the object is destroyed automatically\r\n\r\nNote that you actually use _more_ memory, when you declare a pointer (that is likely to be 64-bits wide nowadays) and dynamically allocate memory to hold a byte elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to extend your object&#39;s lifetime beyond the current scope, you could use a smart pointer instead, to prevent issues like leaking memory or double free.\r\n\r\n    std::unique_ptr&lt;char&gt; hello = std::make_unique&lt;char&gt;(52);\r\n\r\nBut do note that this is usually a hassle and most often not necessary at all, especially for objects this small. Just declare a local variable, copy it around as needed, and be done with it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBesides that, you need to [dereference the pointer][1] to access the object the pointer points to:\r\n\r\n    unsigned char * p = new unsigned char;\r\n    *p = 52;\r\n    delete p;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/4955198/1025391","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287863/assigning-a-unsigned-char-a-number/58288103#58288103","title":"Assigning a unsigned char* a number"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9556236,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-09932bJaYBM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/PxsIZLpnBuY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arvid Rehnberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9556236/arvid-rehnberg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264257,"user_id":68587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d9fd158e03cbde94f7e0b33b78222af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Kugelman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/68587/john-kugelman"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570544652,"creation_date":1570543003,"last_edit_date":1570543157,"question_id":58287863,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287863","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using an unsigned char* to store information that is going to be max around 200,\r\nI am using a char pointer because a want to remove later like\r\n```\r\nunsigned char* hello = new unsigned char;\r\ndelete hello;\r\n```\r\nbut when I try to assign it a value like `hello = 54` it gives the error\r\n```a value of type &quot;int&quot; cannot be assigned to an entity of type &quot;unsigned char*&quot;```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287863/assigning-a-unsigned-char-a-number","title":"Assigning a unsigned char* a number"},{"tags":["junit5"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6169997,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f2c530f5f57e666b7d26850632ef71b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kenneth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6169997/kenneth"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570590661,"creation_date":1570590661,"answer_id":58296541,"question_id":58287856,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58296541","body_markdown":"Found a solution:\r\n    \r\n    public class FibonacciTest {\r\n        public static Stream&lt;Arguments&gt; data() {\r\n            return Stream.of(\r\n                Arguments.arguments( 0, 0 ), \r\n                Arguments.arguments( 1, 1 ), \r\n                Arguments.arguments( 2, 1 ), \r\n                Arguments.arguments( 3, 2 ), \r\n                Arguments.arguments( 4, 3 ), \r\n                Arguments.arguments( 5, 5 ), \r\n                Arguments.arguments( 6, 8 )\r\n             );\r\n         }\r\n        \r\n         @ParameterizedTest\r\n         @MethodSource(&quot;data&quot;)\r\n         public void test(int fInput, int fExpected) {\r\n             assertEquals(fExpected, Fibonacci.compute(fInput));\r\n         }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287856/how-to-migrate-junit-4-parameterized-test-to-junit-5-parameterizedtest/58296541#58296541","title":"How to migrate JUnit 4 Parameterized test to JUnit 5 ParameterizedTest?"}],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6169997,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f2c530f5f57e666b7d26850632ef71b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kenneth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6169997/kenneth"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58296541,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570590661,"creation_date":1570542972,"question_id":58287856,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287856","body_markdown":"I have a JUnit 4 test like following, I&#39;m trying to upgrade JUnit to JUnit 5.

The key here is Bounded Context (BC) segregation. Every BC have its own School with just the properties that matters for this BC. The properties that matters in every BC depends on domain actions and the info you need to acomplish the actions. This rule also apply to VO&#39;s and Aggregates.\r\n\r\ni.e.:\r\n\r\nYou define 3 Product entities. One in the Warehouse BC, one in the Marketing BC and one in the Store BC. As Warehouse BC just has domain actions related to inventory, provisioning, transport, etc; the Product entity for Warehouse does not need the Customer Price property.\r\n\r\nAnd not only several same thing (Entity, VO or AG) in different BCs. You can also have same domain concepts (school, classroom, etc) that takes different roles in \r\nevery BC in which are involved. A school can be a entity in one BC, a aggregate root in another BC and a VO in a third BC. And each one has its own implementation with its own constraits, methods, properties, etc.\r\n\r\nThe best way to design with DDD is to think about domain actions. All your domian design has to gravitate around domain actions and the info it needs to acomplish these actions.\r\n\r\nAlso take note that if you do not have a process workflow with a clear intend in your system (i.e. just updating NumberOfStudents to fix a mistake and no collateral effects exist) you do not need DDD, you just need CRUD and it is not wrong to have DDD in some part of the system and CRUD in another part.\r\n\r\nThis answer can also help in your design: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55890854/aggregate-or-entity-without-business-attributes/55901200#55901200","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287836/ddd-with-entities-that-contain-too-much-information/58298116#58298116","title":"DDD with entities that contain too much information"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":4169438,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IenD2K4WIvA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI0/HRsd59QvR2M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Panos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4169438/panos"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25,"user_id":4169438,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IenD2K4WIvA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI0/HRsd59QvR2M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Panos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4169438/panos"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570616280,"creation_date":1570542918,"last_edit_date":1570543312,"question_id":58287836,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287836","body_markdown":"I decided to put into practice what I recently learned about DDD, but I got confused about what to do in my scenario. I am very new to this school of thought so pardon my ignorance\r\n\r\nConsider the following : \r\n\r\n - A `School` has 30 properties, including time series of teachers that worked there and when, and time series of principals. It also has a time series of `Classroom`\r\n - A `Classroom` has another 20 properties. Also, time series of the color of the classroom throughout the years, arrangement style of seats etc. It also has a `StudentAttendance` Record History (Time series of 30 years)\r\n - A `StudentAttendance` record has a `Year` and a `NumberOfStudents` (ValueObject)\r\n\r\nHow do you define this model? &lt;br/&gt; \r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nMy initial thought was that the School is the AR, as classrooms cannot exist without the school and a StudentAttendance cannot exist without a Classroom.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\nMy question is, in order to change a random `StudentAttendance` Record&#39;s `NumberOfStudents` (let&#39;s say that SchoolId 10, Classroom 1 in 1993 had 25 students instead of 30) , do I need to create a **valid** `School` first? This would mean that I need to get huge amounts of information to populate all of the other properties that are not necessary for my action. \r\nI basically just need the schoolId, the classroomId, the year and the new number.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the old CRUD world, I would just define a method &lt;br/&gt;\r\n`UpdateStudentAttenance(int schoolId, int classroomId, int year, int newNumberOfStudents)`\r\n\r\n*Note: According to DDD, I have created the classes with constructors that populate all of the properties, to create and keep them in a valid state (e.g. a `School` **must** have a `Name`, `Area`, `ConstructionYear` etc) so I cannot just call `new School(id: 5)`*","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287836/ddd-with-entities-that-contain-too-much-information","title":"DDD with entities that contain too much

I found only one related [issue](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/1294) raised and there are no comments explaining such error code origin.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287821/getextendedtcptable-iphlpapi-dll-returns-undocumented-error-code-1073741823","title":"GetExtendedTcpTable (iphlpapi.dll) returns undocumented error code -1073741823"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-mvc","telerik-mvc","kendo-ui-mvc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1771,"user_id":2889347,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34cf851589fc9581cd227093a3ba07f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Federico Navarrete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2889347/federico-navarrete"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570543787,"post_id":58287818,"comment_id":102940917,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287818/why-is-it-impossible-to-format-kendo-ui-datepicker-outputs-correctly#comment102940917_58287818"},{"owner":{"reputation":4097,"user_id":475766,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9eMHc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ortund","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/475766/ortund"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1771,"user_id":2889347,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34cf851589fc9581cd227093a3ba07f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Federico Navarrete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2889347/federico-navarrete"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570544342,"post_id":58287818,"comment_id":102941226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287818/why-is-it-impossible-to-format-kendo-ui-datepicker-outputs-correctly#comment102941226_58287818"}],"owner":{"reputation":4097,"user_id":475766,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9eMHc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ortund","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/475766/ortund"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4097,"user_id":475766,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9eMHc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ortund","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/475766/ortund"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570544313,"creation_date":1570542841,"last_edit_date":1570544313,"question_id":58287818,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287818","body_markdown":"    &lt;form class=&quot;SecForms&quot; action=&quot;@Url.Content(&quot;~/Credit/GenerateStatement&quot;)&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;credit_form&quot;&gt;\r\n        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()\r\n\r\n        @Html.ValidationSummary(true)\r\n        @Html.HiddenFor(o =&gt; o.PracticeId)\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;setup-content&quot; id=&quot;purchasing&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;label class=&quot;control-label col-sm-5&quot;&gt;Start Date&lt;/label&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-7 input-group&quot;&gt;\r\n                            @Html.Kendo().DatePickerFor(m =&gt; m.StartDate)\r\n                                .Format(&quot;dd-MM-yyyy&quot;).Culture(&quot;en-GB&quot;)\r\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        \r\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;label class=&quot;control-label col-sm-5&quot;&gt;End Date&lt;/label&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-7 input-group&quot;&gt;\r\n                            @Html.Kendo().DatePickerFor(m =&gt; m.EndDate)\r\n                                .Format(&quot;dd-MM-yyyy&quot;).Culture(&quot;en-GB&quot;)\r\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;BDuttonBar&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;BButtRightOptom&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-success lyprocess&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; onclick=&quot;document.getElementById(&#39;spinny&#39;).style.display = &#39;block&#39;;&quot;&gt;Generate&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n                    &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-circle-o-notch&quot; fa-spin loadingSpinner&quot; id=&quot;spinny&quot; style=&quot;font-size:24px;float:right;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\nDespite having explicitly set the format on the DatePickers, it still tries to output with dates formatted as `2019-30-09` (for September 30th).

How do I get this ridiculous Telerik nonsense to actually work as specified?\r\n\r\nWhen I check the information for `Kendo.Mvc.dll` it shows Version is 2019.1.115.440 (part of Kendo Web Extensions for ASP.NET MVC in Telerik&#39;s 2019 R1 suite)\r\n\r\n  [1]:https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/datepicker/globalization","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287818/why-is-it-impossible-to-format-kendo-ui-datepicker-outputs-correctly","title":"Why is it impossible to format Kendo UI datepicker outputs correctly?"},{"tags":["android","kotlin","android-recyclerview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":10110451,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f14b68ab6a8c213249fce76d572c69cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Avilash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10110451/avilash"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570544758,"post_id":58287817,"comment_id":102941468,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287817/my-recyclerview-position-always-give-me-1#comment102941468_58287817"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16947,"user_id":506796,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e648659dd573c1161a370efa0f5e10d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tenfour04","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/506796/tenfour04"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570544521,"creation_date":1570544521,"answer_id":58288301,"question_id":58287817,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58288301","body_markdown":"`viewHolder.adapterPosition`is the position on the screen in pixels, not the position in the data list.

This will sync s2 with s1.\r\n\r\n````\r\n\t\t$(&#39;#s1&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, function (e) {\r\n\t\t\t  var selectedValues = $(this).val();  //Get the selected Values\r\n\t\t\t  $(&#39;#s2&#39;).val(selectedValues);        //Update S2 with selected values.\r\n\t\t});\r\n````\r\n\r\nYou need to have similar callback method to sync s1 with s2 as well.\r\n\r\nThis would update the values in both the select boxes. However, as you would notice this would not get reflected in the UI. To get the selected values reflected in the UI you would need to manually trigger the change method like below:\r\n\r\n````\r\n\t\t$(&#39;#s1&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, function (e) {\r\n\t\t\t  var selectedValues = $(this).val();  //Get the selected Values\r\n\t\t\t  $(&#39;#s2&#39;).val(selectedValues);        //Update S2 with selected values.\r\n              $(&#39;#s2&#39;).trigger(&#39;change&#39;);          //Trigger the change event to reflect values.\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\t$(&#39;#s2&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, function (e) {\r\n\t\t\t  var selectedValues = $(this).val();  //Get the selected Values\r\n\t\t\t  $(&#39;#s1&#39;).val(selectedValues);        //Update S1 with selected values.\r\n              $(&#39;#s1&#39;).trigger(&#39;change&#39;);          //Trigger the change event to reflect values.\r\n\t\t});\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets tricky. Within the change event of s1 you are manually triggering the change event of s2 and within the change event of s2 you are again triggering the change event of s1. This results in a never ending loop. To fix this we can use another variable `triggerManual`. Below is the whole code\r\n\r\n````\r\n\t\t$(&quot;#s1&quot;).select2();\r\n\t\t$(&quot;#s2&quot;).select2();\r\n\t\tvar triggerManual = false; //use this variable to avoid never ending loop.\r\n\t\t$(&#39;#s1&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, function (e) {\r\n\t\t\t  if( triggerManual ) {\r\n\t\t\t  \treturn;\r\n\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t  var selectedValues = $(this).val();\r\n\t\t\t  $(&#39;#s2&#39;).val(selectedValues);\r\n\t\t\t  changeSelValues();\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\t$(&#39;#s2&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, function (e) {\r\n\t\t\t  if( triggerManual ) {\r\n\t\t\t  \treturn;\r\n\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t  var selectedValues = $(this).val();\r\n\t\t\t  $(&#39;#s1&#39;).val(selectedValues);\r\n\t\t\t  changeSelValues();\r\n\t\t});\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tfunction changeSelValues() {\r\n\t\t\ttriggerManual = true; //set the global variable as true.\r\n\t\t\t$(&#39;#s1&#39;).trigger(&#39;change&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t$(&#39;#s2&#39;).trigger(&#39;change&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\ttriggerManual = false; //set it again to false\r\n\t\t}\t\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe value gets updated when you select or deselect any value in s1 and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nYou can check the demo at [JSFiddle][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jsfiddle.net/qh71m25y/1/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287813/synchronize-2-select2-elements/58288424#58288424","title":"Synchronize 2 Select2 elements"}],"owner":{"reputation":897,"user_id":1297780,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jX2B.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ferenjito","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1297780/ferenjito"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58288424,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570544900,"creation_date":1570542829,"question_id":58287813,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287813","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n     $(&quot;#s1&quot;).select2(options1);\r\n     $(&quot;#s2&quot;).select2(options2);\r\n    \r\n     $(&quot;#s1&quot;).on(&quot;select2:selecting&quot;, function(e) {\r\n       // doSomethingThatSynchronizesS1withS2();\r\n     });\r\n\r\nI have two select2 elements, that I want to keep synchronized.

Create a `launch.json` file like below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      // NOTE: replace &#39;my_container_name&#39; with the name of the container you want to connect to\r\n      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,\r\n      &quot;adapter&quot;: &quot;docker.exe&quot;,\r\n      &quot;adapterArgs&quot;: &quot;exec -i my_container_name /remote_debugger/vsdbg --interpreter=vscode&quot;,\r\n      &quot;configurations&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;.NET Core Docker Attach&quot;,\r\n          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;coreclr&quot;,\r\n          &quot;request&quot;: &quot;attach&quot;,\r\n          // replace with the process id you want to attach to. You can find this by running &#39;pidof&#39; in the container\r\n          // ex: `docker exec -it my_container_name pidof dotnet`\r\n          &quot;processId&quot;: 93\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n2. Use this command to call your `launch.json` file:\r\n\r\n    `DebugAdapterHost.Launch /LaunchJson:&quot;&lt;path-to-the-launch.json-file-you-saved&gt;&quot; /EngineGuid:541B8A8A-6081-4506-9F0A-1CE771DEBC04`\r\n\r\n3. Get the command window from the DTE (quick and dirty code sample):\r\n```\r\nDTE dte = (DTE)Package.GetGlobalService(typeof(SDTE));\r\nWindow window = dte.Windows.Item(EnvDTE.Constants.vsWindowKindCommandWindow);\r\nwindow.Activate();\r\n\r\nCommandWindow commandWindow = window.Object as CommandWindow;\r\n\r\nstring command = &quot;DebugAdapterHost.Launch &quot; + \r\n                 &quot;/LaunchJson:\\&quot;path/to/launch.json\\&quot; &quot; + \r\n                 &quot;/EngineGuid:541B8A8A-6081-4506-9F0A-1CE771DEBC04&quot;;\r\n\r\ncommandWindow.SendInput(command, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/microsoft/MIEngine/wiki/Offroad-Debugging-of-.NET-Core-on-Linux---OSX-from-Visual-Studio#attaching\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/microsoft/VSDebugAdapterHost\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/envdte.commandwindow?view=visualstudiosdk-2017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58287810/programatically-attach-a-debugger-to-a-process-running-inside-a-docker-container/58330049#58330049","title":"Programatically attach a debugger to a process running inside a Docker Container"}],"owner":{"reputation":29785,"user_id":15393,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c31c0dfc2a92d09b3e93d50e6ce5a489?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RB.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15393/rb"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570781757,"creation_date":1570542813,"question_id":58287810,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58287810","body_markdown":"Question\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow do I *programmatically* attach to a .NET Core process running inside a Docker container on my local machine?\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I have an integration test which runs a set of Docker containers. I want to attach a debugger to a process inside one of those containers. I know the container, and the process, so all I am looking for is a mechanism to actually attach the debugger programmatically so that when I debug my integration test, I can debug straight into my application.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n-----\r\nIn Visual Studio 2019 it is possible to attach a debugger to a process running inside a Docker container.\r\n\r\nWhen you start your container mount an additional volume containing `vsdbg` (for example, `%USERPROFILE%\\vsdbg\\vs2017u5`) as `/remote_debugger`.\r\n\r\n    docker run -v &quot;$($env:USERPROFILE)\\vsdbg\\vs2017u5:/remote_debugger:rw&quot;\r\n\r\nYou can then attach a debugger using `Debug -&gt;

trying to populate an `array` with data using this code:\r\n\r\n    tmp = [[[InternalContactsHandler sharedBuffer] contacts] sortedArrayUsingSelector:NSSelectorFromString(@&quot;nameOfContactCompare:&quot;)];\r\n\r\nTo check whether it has been populated, I set a `count` on it:\r\n\r\n    NSLog(@&quot;my code: &#128018;%lu&quot;, (unsigned long)tmp.count);\r\n\r\nIt returns 0 though. But if I enter another `view`, then go back to the original view, the `NSLog` shows a count of 49, indicating that it has been populated. \r\n\r\nI thought it was an issue with `synchronization`, so I added a `block` which I assume is similar to `swifts` `completion-handler`. Like this:\r\n\r\n    - (void)myFunc:(void(^)(void))callback {\r\n        tmp = [[[InternalContactsHandler sharedBuffer] contacts] sortedArrayUsingSelector:NSSelectorFromString(@&quot;nameOfContactCompare:&quot;)];\r\n        callback();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd in `viewDidLoad`:\r\n\r\n    [self myFunc:^ {\r\n        NSLog(@&quot;my code: &#128018;%lu&quot;, (unsigned long)tmp.count);\r\n    }];\r\n\r\nBut still, the very same problem persists. I should mention that the code is used elsewhere in the project to great success, the array being instantly populated. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n***UPDATE***\r\nI went into `tmp = [[[InternalContactsHandler sharedBuffer] contacts]` in debug mode in both old working code and new non-working code.
