are two problems here:\r\n\r\n1. There&#39;s no rule to say which order the arguments in a function call (such as when calling `printf`) are evaluated.  It could be left-to-right, right-to-left, or some other order.\r\n2. In an expression like this, where you both modify `k` (`k = 50`) *and* use its value (`k == 35`, `k &gt; 40`), there&#39;s no rule to say whether the old or the new value is used.  (And this uncertainty persists regardless of the order of evaluation.)\r\n\r\nBecause of the second problem, this expression (this `printf` call) is *undefined*.  It can do anything, even something wildly inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re calling `printf` (or any function) on arguments which have &quot;side effects&quot; like this (that is, where an argument is something like `k = 50`, which not only provides a value to pass to the function, but also makes some other change as well, in this case updating `k`&#39;s value), you need to break things up so that the behavior becomes predictable.  In the case of printing several values, it&#39;s easy -- just use several, separate `printf` calls:\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;%d &quot;, k == 35);\r\n    printf(&quot;%d &quot;, k = 50);\r\n    printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, k &gt; 40);\r\n\r\nNow the behavior is well-defined, and will probably be what you expected.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479145/how-the-printf-function-works-in-c-programming/58479378#58479378","title":"How the printf function works in C programming?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12236245,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b0c2e4d2703216c8d8479108bf904cf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jagadish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12236245/jagadish"},"last_editor":{"reputation":906,"user_id":6363697,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NySXK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"saurabh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6363697/saurabh"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58479196,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571628757,"creation_date":1571625753,"last_edit_date":1571628757,"question_id":58479145,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58479145","body_markdown":"I wrote this C program.\r\n\r\n    #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n      int k=35;\r\n      printf(&quot;\\n%d %d %d&quot;,k==35,k=50,k&gt;40);\r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand got this output.\r\n\r\n&gt; 0 50 0\r\n\r\nNow,  I am thinking about how the printf function worked and why the output is 0 50 0.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479145/how-the-printf-function-works-in-c-programming","title":"How the printf function works in C programming?"},{"tags":["selenium","webdriver"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":293,"user_id":7964299,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mmYcg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naveen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7964299/naveen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571726132,"post_id":58479143,"comment_id":103325654,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479143/how-to-switch-handle-to-popped-window-that-has-confirm-window#comment103325654_58479143"},{"owner":{"reputation":198,"user_id":11185760,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sWaxX-kj2-I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfhwjiEWJxPbA-MUh21g6mk5anRgQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11185760/yun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571742198,"post_id":58479143,"comment_id":103334113,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479143/how-to-switch-handle-to-popped-window-that-has-confirm-window#comment103334113_58479143"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12247051,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AmtZgfBZvX0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3ret_lQ7Y4kTR4ZjPXXxuwpI7FP7ww/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jigul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12247051/jigul"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1862,"user_id":8752062,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7bd7130a2d4925c477eea540adac4ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"frianH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8752062/frianh"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571645161,"creation_date":1571625749,"last_edit_date":1571645161,"question_id":58479143,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58479143","body_markdown":"See my problem.\r\n\r\n 1. root.html click link\r\n 2. popup.html is opened and confirm window is opened at the same time\r\n 3.

Just make sure you don&#39;t defined a solid state of pressing or not pressing, check individual keys and update accordingly before you render.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479110/make-a-key-released-in-python-with-no-library/58524424#58524424","title":"Make a &quot;Key Released&quot; In Python With No Library?"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8121334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7add014216eb59772e3314457360215?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Elamar Kaodsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8121334/elamar-kaodsh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8121334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7add014216eb59772e3314457360215?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Elamar Kaodsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8121334/elamar-kaodsh"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58524424,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571838637,"creation_date":1571625269,"last_edit_date":1571836279,"question_id":58479110,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58479110","body_markdown":"I have been trying to use some &quot;key released&quot; functions from libraries like [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) and so, but I ran in to the problem that if I try using them together with a library called [pyglet](http://pyglet.org/), that is a library for window-based apps, it won&#39;t let me and the program would crash.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is any way detect key releases without libraries.                \r\n\r\nP.S: I&#39;ve tried using the `on_key_release` function from pyglet but it was buggy for me and even though I wrote something for it to upon key release it usually didn&#39;t do it.

You may to pass the string to test in as a parameter and then look at the length. Like this:\r\n   ```\r\n   public String test(String password) \r\n   { int length = password.length;\r\n  \r\n     if (length &lt; 8) \r\n       etc...\r\n   ```\r\n - What is digit? Is it intended to be a method or a variable? I don&#39;t know if you meant to post pseudo code, but it&#39;s not valid syntax like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that you can read through it. In the first `if` statement you&#39;re testing if length is less than 8 and returning `&quot;weak pass&quot;` if it is. When you get to the second `if` you already know that length is &gt;= 8 so you don&#39;t have to test anymore. You could, if you want to make it extra clear to another developer what you&#39;re testing for, but it&#39;s not needed and may add clutter that confuses you.\r\n\r\nSo you wrote the expression `((length &lt;=8) || (length &lt;=8 &amp;&amp; digit) || (digit &lt;=8 &amp;&amp; other))` there. You can remove the `&lt;`&#39;s because those are never true. If it&#39;s less than 8, you already returned something in your first if. So now you have `(length==8 || (length ==8 &amp;&amp; digit) || (digit &lt;=8 &amp;&amp; other))`\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if you really meant `digit &lt;=8` there or `length &lt;=8`. I presume `length &lt;= 8`, so then it&#39;s `(length==8 || (length == 8 &amp;&amp; digit) || (length == 8 &amp;&amp; other))`\r\n\r\nIf the first part of this condition `length==8` is true the result is true. That&#39;s how boolean inclusive OR works. So that means the second and third conditions are not needed anymore, because they will only get evaluated if `length != 8`, in which case neither one of `(length == 8 &amp;&amp; digit)` or `(length == 8 &amp;&amp; other)` is true.\r\n\r\nThe last `if` statement  `(length &lt;= 8 &amp;&amp; digit &amp;&amp; other)` requires that `length &lt;= 8`. However, if it is you already returned a value in the first or second if statement so the test in the last `if` will never be true. You can leave it out.\r\n\r\nIn summary, what you have is this: \r\n    ```\r\n    if (length &lt; 8)\r\n       return weak pass;\r\n    if (length == 8)\r\n       return medium pass\r\n    return null;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nI think you may want to read up on boolean logic. You may find that `or` and `and` don&#39;t mean what you think they do. In common language they are often used interchangeably, but in boolean logic they have very precise meaning.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479085/how-to-return-something-when-all-3-conditions-must-be-met-in-an-if-statement/58479334#58479334","title":"How to return something when ALL 3 conditions MUST be met in an if statement"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11351211,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d15c1798d242828c41a776ae446f1dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sinnnad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11351211/sinnnad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11351211,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d15c1798d242828c41a776ae446f1dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sinnnad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11351211/sinnnad"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571627485,"creation_date":1571624816,"last_edit_date":1571625476,"question_id":58479085,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58479085","body_markdown":"&gt; A weak password is defined as a password with less than eight characters.

really should just call fgets and then do `line[12] = &#39;\\0&#39;`, but that doesn&#39;t cleanly deal with input that has long lines.  One option is to simply abort if fgets ever returns a partial line (eg, if `strchr(line, &#39;\\n&#39;)` returns NULL). \r\n If you want to handle long lines, you can just discard data with getchar until you see a newline.  Assuming that you don&#39;t want to consider the newline to be one of the 12 characters, you could do something like:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int\r\n    main(void)\r\n    {\r\n            char line[13];\r\n            while( fgets(line, 13, stdin) ) {\r\n                    char *c = strchr(line, &#39;\\n&#39;);\r\n                    int ch;\r\n                    if( c == NULL ) while( (ch = getchar()) != EOF ) {\r\n                            if( ch == &#39;\\n&#39;

The error point to my second line of the for loop.\r\n\r\n     &lt;asp:CheckBoxList ID=&quot;CheckBoxList3&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; RepeatDirection=&quot;Horizontal&quot; Width=&quot;900px&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;asp:ListItem&gt;Chicken&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;\r\n                &lt;asp:ListItem&gt;Tomato&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;\r\n                &lt;asp:ListItem&gt;Garlic&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;\r\n            &lt;/asp:CheckBoxList&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479062/need-help-for-insert-data-from-multiple-check-box-list-into-database","title":"Need help for insert data from multiple check-box-list into database"},{"tags":["java","casting","char","int"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11354,"user_id":3824919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HpYR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824919/tom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571624665,"post_id":58479060,"comment_id":103290344,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479060/issue-understand-some-int-char-cast-conversion#comment103290344_58479060"},{"owner":{"reputation":61035,"user_id":1081110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fp4Pm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dawood ibn Kareem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1081110/dawood-ibn-kareem"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571624706,"post_id":58479060,"comment_id":103290352,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479060/issue-understand-some-int-char-cast-conversion#comment103290352_58479060"},{"owner":{"reputation":11354,"user_id":3824919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HpYR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824919/tom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571624821,"post_id":58479060,"comment_id":103290381,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479060/issue-understand-some-int-char-cast-conversion#comment103290381_58479060"},{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12145352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10a91199ff39b849800551fa910a0141?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaelPJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145352/maelpj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571625115,"post_id":58479060,"comment_id":103290436,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479060/issue-understand-some-int-char-cast-conversion#comment103290436_58479060"},{"owner":{"reputation":11354,"user_id":3824919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HpYR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824919/tom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571625256,"post_id":58479060,"comment_id":103290464,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479060/issue-understand-some-int-char-cast-conversion#comment103290464_58479060"},{"owner":{"reputation":91904,"user_id":5221149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4qlq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221149/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571625283,"post_id":58479060,"comment_id":103290466,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479060/issue-understand-some-int-char-cast-conversion#comment103290466_58479060"},{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12145352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10a91199ff39b849800551fa910a0141?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaelPJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145352/maelpj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571625292,"post_id":58479060,"comment_id":103290469,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479060/issue-understand-some-int-char-cast-conversion#comment103290469_58479060"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12145352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10a91199ff39b849800551fa910a0141?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaelPJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145352/maelpj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":3750257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KF8gx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pppery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3750257/pppery"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571625393,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571627096,"creation_date":1571624464,"last_edit_date":1571627096,"question_id":58479060,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58479060","body_markdown":"For:\r\n\r\n    char c = &#39;e&#39;;

would like to detect if native emoji is supported.   \r\nOnly if it does not, I will then load emoji font to save bandwidth and also make the application look more native. \r\n\r\nHowever, as I search through the Internet, I only found someone using `userAgent` to check if emoji is supported or not.   \r\nFor example, the below code is from https://github.com/github/g-emoji-element/blob/master/emoji-detection.js, \r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function isEmojiSupported(): boolean {\r\n  const onWindows7 = /\\bWindows NT 6.1\\b/.test(navigator.userAgent)\r\n  const onWindows8 = /\\bWindows NT 6.2\\b/.test(navigator.userAgent)\r\n  const onWindows81 = /\\bWindows NT 6.3\\b/.test(navigator.userAgent)\r\n  const

onFreeBSD)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough the regular expression may not be perfect, as Firefox in Windows 7 does support Emoji as from http://caniemoji.com/. \r\n\r\nHowever, as different browser or libraries may have different set of emoji, some emoji may render perfectly in one browser, and some just not render very well. \r\n\r\nSo is there a better method other than using `userAgent` to check if Emoji is supported? \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479029/javascript-detect-if-native-emoji-is-supported","title":"Javascript detect if native emoji is

Updating of fields is a *potential* security risk - there are some field types that can access external content. Therefore, dynamic content generated outside the Word UI needs user confirmation to update.\r\n\r\nI know of only three ways to prevent displaying the prompt\r\n\r\n1. Calculate the values and insert the field result during document generation. The fields will still be updatable, in the normal manner, but won&#39;t require updating when the document is opened the first time. (Leave out the code in the second part of the question.)\r\n\r\n2.

I have one example that uses the out parameter in the IDL interface:\r\nClient.java\r\n\r\n\tPersonHolder person = new PersonHolder(p);//where p is a person with 2 values assigned &quot;name&quot; and &quot;email&quot;(this Person object was created in the client and was defined as a struct in the IDL)\r\n\t    o.getPerson(person);\r\nThe getPerson was defined in the IDL as \r\n\r\n             void getPerson(out Person p);\r\nThe server calls  the getPerson and attempts to print out the original values first.

This allows you to clearly authenticate users. However, the drawback is that users would have to repeat the login process every time they open this web page again.

This URL needs to include information that would allow your web app to get the users current context, e.g. his Slack and User ID.\r\n\r\nNote that this URL can be obtainable and potentially misused by a user, so you would need to add measure to protect it e.g. by encrypting the IDs or by adding a secure hash or a one time token ...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478994/slack-oauth-automatically-authorize-user-if-user-had-already-authorized-app/58484354#58484354","title":"Slack Oauth: Automatically authorize user if user had already authorized app"}],"owner":{"reputation":1315,"user_id":4280615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb3e605e48f47342cc67a8ca4725e24e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nate Vaughan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4280615/nate-vaughan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1315,"user_id":4280615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb3e605e48f47342cc67a8ca4725e24e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nate Vaughan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4280615/nate-vaughan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571760984,"creation_date":1571623914,"last_edit_date":1571707553,"question_id":58478994,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478994","body_markdown":"I’m working on a Slack app that a user can install to a workspace using Slack’s Oauth flow. After installing and configuring the app, I’m using Oauth to allow the user to log in and make changes to the app configuration. \r\n\r\nThe flow for a new user uses the &quot;Add to Slack&quot; button which asks the user to agree to allow `bot` and `identity.*` scopes after which my app retrieves and stores bot and user tokens.\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;d like to allow the same user to sign in using the &quot;Sign in with Slack&quot; Oauth flow. Per [the Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/sign-in-with-slack#authorization), the &quot;Sign in with Slack&quot; flow allows just this using the same `/oauth/authorize` endpoint, but requests only one of the `identity.*` scopes (I&#39;m using `identity.basic`):\r\n```\r\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=identity.basic&amp;client_id=REDACTED&quot;&gt;Sign in with Slack&lt;/a&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user has already authorized my app for `bot` and `identity.*` scopes on the initial app install, but surprisingly he/she is re-prompted to confirm allowing my app `identity.*` scopes on each &quot;Log in with Slack&quot; action.\r\n\r\nThe slack documentation implies that subsequent login attempts will result in an automatic redirect:\r\n\r\n&gt; After a user clicks your Sign in with Slack button, their web browser should arrive on Slack&#39;s servers.\r\n\r\n&gt; Your application will wait patiently while the user handles some business or **Slack just sends them on their way back to your redirect URL.**\r\n\r\n(emphasis mine)\r\n\r\nHowever, Slack *always* requests that the user (re-)authorize my app for `identity.*` scopes. How can I log users in using Slack with a one-click flow?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478994/slack-oauth-automatically-authorize-user-if-user-had-already-authorized-app","title":"Slack Oauth: Automatically authorize user if user had already authorized app"},{"tags":["ios","swift","swiftui"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":75505,"user_id":3418066,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/De72L.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paulw11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3418066/paulw11"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571628308,"post_id":58478992,"comment_id":103290915,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478992/environmentobject-does-not-reflected-in-the-object#comment103290915_58478992"},{"owner":{"reputation":417,"user_id":10208552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FTeDHn3-m6w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAZAw/Gvz_306hLGQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sorin Lica","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10208552/sorin-lica"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571633077,"post_id":58478992,"comment_id":103291789,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478992/environmentobject-does-not-reflected-in-the-object#comment103291789_58478992"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":684,"user_id":2092507,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dac82751d4e2e97f290452e32801b564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Evgeniy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2092507/evgeniy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571633575,"creation_date":1571633575,"answer_id":58479971,"question_id":58478992,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58479971","body_markdown":"Where do you assign your environment object?\r\n\r\nTypically, you would do it like this:\r\n\r\n    MapHome().environmentObject(UserData())","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478992/environmentobject-does-not-reflected-in-the-object/58479971#58479971","title":"@EnvironmentObject does not reflected in the object"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12132829,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0c528b6693e44dc3c7ae7c411a45c0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lilfaen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12132829/lilfaen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571674366,"creation_date":1571674366,"answer_id":58490225,"question_id":58478992,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58490225","body_markdown":"You need to assign the environment object in the SceneDelegate.swift file and it will be accesible from the entire hierarchy.\r\nShould look like this: \r\n\r\n    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {\r\n        \r\n        // Use a UIHostingController as window root view controller\r\n        if let windowScene = scene as?

@SorinLica mentioned in a comment, at this time, [Nested `ObservableObjects` don&#39;t work in SwiftUI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406287/how-to-tell-swiftui-views-to-bind-to-nested-observableobjects/58406402#58406402).\r\n\r\nProbably the simplest approach is to add your `Configure` object to the environment directly (It is a class, so it will be the same instance that your `UserData` instance refers to).\r\n\r\nIn your `SceneDelegate` -\r\n\r\n    let userData = UserData()\r\n    let contentView = MapHome().environmentObject(userData).environmentObject(userData.configure)\r\n\r\nThen you can use it in your `MapHome`\r\n\r\n    struct MapHome: View\r\n    {\r\n        @EnvironmentObject var userData: UserData\r\n        @EnvironmentObject var configure: Configure\r\n    \r\n        NavigationView\r\n        {\r\n            ZStack\r\n            {\r\n                MapView(mapViewState: $configure.mapType)\r\n                        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)            \r\n            }\r\n            Button(action: {\r\n                        switch self.userData.configure.mapType\r\n                        {\r\n                            case .hybrid:\r\n                                self.userData.configure.mapType = .standard\r\n                            case .standard:\r\n                                self.userData.configure.mapType = .satellite\r\n                            case .satellite:\r\n                                self.userData.configure.mapType = .hybrid\r\n                            default:\r\n                                self.userData.configure.mapType = .standard\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n            )\r\n            {\r\n                if self.userData.configure.mapType == .hybrid\r\n                {\r\n                    Image(&quot;HybridIcon&quot;)\r\n                }\r\n                else if self.userData.configure.mapType == .standard\r\n                {\r\n                    Image(&quot;StandardIcon&quot;)\r\n                }\r\n                else if self.userData.configure.mapType == .satellite\r\n                {\r\n                    Image(&quot;SatelliteIcon&quot;)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYour `MapView` will need to `mapType` as a `@Binding` -\r\n\r\n    struct MapView: UIViewRepresentable\r\n    {\r\n        @Binding var mapType: MKMapType\r\n        \r\n        func makeUIView(context: Context) -&gt; MKMapView\r\n        {\r\n            return MKMapView(frame: .zero)\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        func updateUIView(_ view: MKMapView, context: Context)\r\n        {\r\n            //Set the map type\r\n            view.mapType = mapType\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to mirror the map type to a `@State` property in your `MapHome`\r\n\r\n\r\n    struct MapHome: View\r\n    {\r\n        @EnvironmentObject var userData: UserData\r\n        @State var mapType: MKMapType\r\n    \r\n        NavigationView\r\n        {\r\n            ZStack\r\n            {\r\n                MapView(mapViewState: $mapType)\r\n                        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)            \r\n            }\r\n            Button(action:

self.userData.configure.mapType = .standard\r\n                            case .standard:\r\n                                self.userData.configure.mapType = .satellite\r\n                            case .satellite:\r\n                                self.userData.configure.mapType = .hybrid\r\n                            default:\r\n                                self.userData.configure.mapType = .standard\r\n                        }\r\n                        self.mapType = self.userdata.configure.mapType\r\n                    }\r\n            )\r\n            {\r\n                if self.userdata.configure.mapType == .hybrid\r\n                {\r\n                    Image(&quot;HybridIcon&quot;)\r\n                }\r\n                else if

Basically the premise is to sort the array and count the switches made. The catch is no number is allowed to make more than 2 switches. BubbleSort passes the first few tests, but times out on the rest. Is there a more efficient array sorting algo that still takes into account the number of switches? I tried mergeSort and quickSort but it&#39;s hard to track the switches when dividing the array like that.\r\n\r\nProblem prompt:\r\nIt&#39;s New Year&#39;s Day and everyone&#39;s in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride!

Initial positions increment by  from  at the front of the line to  at the back.\r\n\r\nAny person in the queue can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions. If two people swap positions, they still wear the same sticker denoting their original places in line. One person can bribe at most two others.

Modifying them in any way creates a new View, just like modifying an Array creates a new Array. But SwiftUI Views are just data. They don&#39;t represent the actual thing displayed on the screen like UIViews. After re-computing the View hierarchy, SwiftUI computes the differences and applies that to its internal state, and renders any changes (which may involve animations).\r\n\r\nThis means that anything you compute in a `body` closure must be fast, because you should expect it to be evaluated many times. It should also generally be lazy if possible, to avoid recomputing it if it&#39;s not actually necessary. (Constructs like `ForEach` and `List` are lazy in this way.)\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also critical that computing a View does not generate any side-effects, and not rely on global state. You don&#39;t control when it will be evaluated, so your Views must rely only on SwiftUI data (such as the state, environment, and values passed directly to the View).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478963/when-is-a-sheet-in-swiftui-re-created/58487902#58487902","title":"When is a Sheet in SwiftUI re-created?"}],"owner":{"reputation":13939,"user_id":287403,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ae0d87c92617e21abe510cc9f41943d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bob Spryn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/287403/bob-spryn"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13939,"user_id":287403,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ae0d87c92617e21abe510cc9f41943d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bob Spryn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/287403/bob-spryn"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58487902,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571692862,"creation_date":1571623522,"last_edit_date":1571692862,"question_id":58478963,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58478963","body_markdown":"Does anyone have any idea when the closure of `.sheet` is supposed to be re-rendered?

Yet that closure is called again and my modal is re-rendered.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAdding a full sample here:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/sprynmr/66811b088ac50d9f297471d5c70d0eb3\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think my question boils down to: What about transient `@State` properties in views unrelated to the underlying data change, or driven via operators like `.sheet`. If those are going to be recreated at any time when anything in the `body` is updated than a lot of folks will probably struggle with their transient view state getting reset.\r\n\r\nConsider a timer firing that grabs updates from the server and updates a list that a `.sheet` is being displayed from. The sheet will be recreated and `@State` will be reset.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478963/when-is-a-sheet-in-swiftui-re-created","title":"When is a Sheet in SwiftUI re-created?"},{"tags":["html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":4766775,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ed7e0f20e4ee436118801bd4decb5b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JimmyN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4766775/jimmyn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571624349,"post_id":58478957,"comment_id":103290280,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58478957/background-image-not-appearing-within-div#comment103290280_58478957"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2365,"user_id":2106860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7041799649b43a9beae7aac50b2acda8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chaska","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2106860/chaska"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571624282,"creation_date":1571624282,"answer_id":58479038,"question_id":58478957,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58479038","body_markdown":"Try to specify `height` on child elements of flex.\r\n\r\nAlso you should learn how to use the console (F12) to inspect elements for debugging.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    * {\r\n      box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .row {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      border: 1px solid grey;\r\n      align-items: center;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .column {\r\n      text-align: center;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .left {\r\n    \theight: 380px;\r\n    \tbackground-size: cover;\r\n      width: 50%;\r\n      background-image: url(&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0196/2898/2334/files/MU6.jpg?2930&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .right {\r\n      width: 50%;\r\n      padding: 10px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\r\n      .left {\r\n        display: none;\r\n      }\r\n      .right {\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;column left&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;column right&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-unlock fa-2x&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2&gt; You&#39;re In &lt;/h2&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; You deserve it.
