suggest making a separate helper function that will iterate over the elements of the input list and yield each value and its complements:\r\n```\r\ndef items_and_complements(sequence):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;[A, B, C, D] -&gt; (A, [B, C, D]), (B, [A, C, D]), (C, [A, B, D]), ...&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    for i, item in enumerate(sequence):\r\n        yield item, sequence[:i] + sequence[i + 1:]\r\n```\r\nFor your input list it will work like this:\r\n```\r\nn = [&quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Dan&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Rad&quot;, &quot;Ned&quot;]\r\nfor value in items_and_complements(n):\r\n    print(value)\r\n# (&#39;Mike&#39;, [&#39;Dan&#39;, &#39;Stan&#39;, &#39;Max&#39;, &#39;Rad&#39;, &#39;Ned&#39;])\r\n# (&#39;Dan&#39;, [&#39;Mike&#39;, &#39;Stan&#39;,

&#39;Stan&#39;, &#39;Max&#39;, &#39;Rad&#39;])\r\n```\r\nThen we can use this function to construct the desired dictionary:\r\n```\r\ndef everyone_sign(names):\r\n    message = &quot;Thank You! Your Friends, &quot;\r\n    return {name: message + &#39;, &#39;.join(others) \r\n            for name, others in items_and_complements(names)}\r\n\r\nprint(everyone_sign(n))\r\n# {&#39;Mike&#39;: &#39;Thank You!

If it is doing that, then `met.clear()` is going to clear *that* list, and that is going to affect the state of the `Employee`.\r\n\r\n  - It could create and return a *shallow copy* of the list.

So therefore I have created a PHP file with a guzzle request and an endpoint. The data transferred between the two is not a big secret. Still though, I have a &quot;secret key&quot; I use for authentication between them. At the moment this works fine when sending data through guzzle with a post request and query variables:\r\n\r\n    $guzzle = new Guzzle([&#39;base_uri&#39; =&gt; &#39;https://example.com&#39;]);\r\n    $response = $guzzle-&gt;request(&#39;get&#39;, &#39;&#39;, [\r\n        &#39;query&#39; =&gt; [\r\n            &#39;key&#39; =&gt; $key\r\n        ],\r\n        &#39;http_errors&#39; =&gt; false\r\n    ]);\r\n\r\nBut when sending it like this exposes the key to &quot;the man in the middle&quot;. So my solution is to run it as post request with SSL and Bob would be your uncle. So I changed my code to:\r\n\r\n    $guzzle = new Guzzle([&#39;base_uri&#39; =&gt; &#39;https://example.com&#39;]);\r\n    $response = $guzzle-&gt;request(&#39;post&#39;, &#39;&#39;, [\r\n        &#39;form_params&#39; =&gt; [\r\n            &#39;key&#39; =&gt; $key\r\n        ],\r\n        &#39;http_errors&#39; =&gt; false\r\n    ]);\r\n\r\nBut, PHP does not recognize the $_POST variables sent like it does with the get request ($_GET). So the question is, how do I get to those variables or what should I change to hide the key through SSL.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162981/guzzle-post-request-from-and-to-php-with-variables","title":"Guzzle POST request from and to PHP with variables"},{"tags":["vue.js","get","compare","axios","id"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2282,"user_id":2914698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZnaH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"skribe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2914698/skribe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569828927,"post_id":58162975,"comment_id":102708428,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162975/can-i-get-some-information-from-local-json-in-vuejs-using-axios-if-yes-how#comment102708428_58162975"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12094942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBzeKoVBWnnm4FcBEIxy7kcnyL_xX1A1o1YmAxe=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Otabek Sadiridinov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12094942/otabek-sadiridinov"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2282,"user_id":2914698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZnaH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"skribe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2914698/skribe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569839546,"post_id":58162975,"comment_id":102713757,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162975/can-i-get-some-information-from-local-json-in-vuejs-using-axios-if-yes-how#comment102713757_58162975"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12094942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBzeKoVBWnnm4FcBEIxy7kcnyL_xX1A1o1YmAxe=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Otabek Sadiridinov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12094942/otabek-sadiridinov"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2282,"user_id":2914698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZnaH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"skribe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2914698/skribe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569839575,"post_id":58162975,"comment_id":102713772,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162975/can-i-get-some-information-from-local-json-in-vuejs-using-axios-if-yes-how#comment102713772_58162975"},{"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570003775,"post_id":58162975,"comment_id":102773339,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162975/can-i-get-some-information-from-local-json-in-vuejs-using-axios-if-yes-how#comment102773339_58162975"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2282,"user_id":2914698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZnaH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"skribe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2914698/skribe"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569839883,"creation_date":1569839883,"answer_id":58166173,"question_id":58162975,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58166173","body_markdown":"For axios to get a local file the path needs to be absolute.

think I know what you are after.  If so, I have adapted some code written for a similar problem to your requirement.\r\n\r\nOpen the first of these folders and create a macro enabled workbook within it.  The name of the workbook does not matter.\r\n\r\nWithin that workbook, create a worksheet named “Workbooks”.\r\n\r\nSwitch to the Visual Basic Editor.  I like to spread my code over several modules with a module per purpose.  You can include all the code below in a single module if you prefer providing there is only one `Option Explicit` statement.\r\n\r\nCreate a module and name it “LibExcel”.  The following code contains general routines from my library of Excel specific routines:\r\n\r\n    Option Explicit\r\n    Public Sub FindLastRowCol(ByRef Wsht As Worksheet, ByRef RowLast As Long, _\r\n                              ByRef ColLast As Long)\r\n    \r\n      &#39; Sets RowLast to the last row and ColLast to the last column with a value\r\n      &#39; in worksheet Wsht.  Cells(RowLast, ColLast) need not contain a value.\r\n      &#39; That is, the data in Wsht does not have to be rectangular.\r\n      \r\n      &#39; The motivation for coding this routine was the discovery that Find by\r\n      &#39; previous row found a cell formatted as Merge and Center but Find by\r\n      &#39; previous column did not. I had known that Find would miss merged\r\n      &#39; cells but this was new to me.\r\n    \r\n      &#39;   Dec16  Coded\r\n      &#39; 31Dec16  Corrected handling of UserRange\r\n      &#39; 15Feb17  SpecialCells was giving a higher row number than Find for\r\n      &#39;          no reason I could determine.  Added code to check for a\r\n      &#39;          value on rows and columns above those returned by Find\r\n      &#39; 25Jun17  Found column with value above that found by Find.

as created by macro Prepare][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI have four data workbooks in my folder; you have nineteen.  These workbooks are listed in the sequence created which may not be the sequence you want in the new workbook.  Amend this worksheet to look something like this:\r\n\r\n[![Worksheet &quot;Workbooks&quot; ready to control macro Merge][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe name in column A is the name to be given to the new workbook.  I have changed the sequence of names in column B to the output sequence I wish.  So the data from “Data B.xlsx” will come first then the data from “Data D.xlsx” and so on.  If the sequence of the data does not matter, leave column B alone.\r\n\r\nOnce worksheet “Workbooks” is as you wish, run macro “Merge”.  As the macro run, the following appears in the Immediate Window to provide a crude progress indicator:\r\n\r\n    Data B.xlsx  1  2  3\r\n    Data D.xlsx  1  2  3\r\n    Data A.xlsx  1  2  3\r\n    Data C.xlsx  1  2  3\r\n\r\nI only have three worksheets per workbook.  The macro handles as many worksheets names “Sheets1” to “SheetsN” as it finds.  So for you, the list of sheet numbers will reach 16.  You will have 19 workbook names.  On my laptop, each source worksheet took a fraction of a second so the entire merge process took very little time.\r\n\r\nOnce you have checked the new data workbook, move the macro workbook to the next folder and run Prepare and Merge again.  Repeat for each folder.\r\n\r\nThe comments within the macros tell you what each block of code is doing but not what each statement is doing.  Come back with questions if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lga8d.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/F2Juy.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162957/append-individual-and-multiple-sheets-spread-over-multiple-excel-worksheets-in/58171640#58171640","title":"Append individual (and multiple) sheets spread over multiple excel worksheets in a folder"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11696009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2322204054537187/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rahul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11696009/rahul"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":6,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58171640,"answer_count":1,"score":-6,"last_activity_date":1570008637,"creation_date":1569827040,"question_id":58162957,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162957","body_markdown":"I have a folder containing 19 Excel worksheets with each worksheet containing 16 sheets inside it.

(In other words, sheet 1 from file two (say, B) will be appended at the end of sheet 1 from file one (say, A) and sheet 1 from file three (say, C) will be appended at the end of the above two files containing sheet 1 from files A and B, respectively and so on untill every file is added). \r\n\r\nI have tried VBA codes to extract each sheets and then rename each of them, convert them to CSV and then combine them.

trying to configure VS code tasks for standard Angular CLI commands like `ng build`, `ng serve`, `ng test`. The purporse is to get a list of the problems, which I can easily traverse, when I run a CLI command. Currently I run these commands directly from the VS Code terminal, but sometimes it&#39;s difficult to navigate to an error because not all source links in the terminal are clickable. The VS Code problem list would be more convinient anyway. I wonder there still isn&#39;t a standard matcher, inspite the Angular is so popular, or I miss one?\r\n\r\nI tried to create a custom matcher, but it looks harder than I expected. Angular CLI outputs typescript errors as well as html &amp; scss errors, so the task should contain multiple matchers. I cannot use standard `$tsc` matcher, because the Angular CLI output slightly differs from the TS compiler output - the first error starts with `ERROR in ` and this error isn&#39;t recognized by the `$tsc` matcher.\r\n\r\nHere is `ng test` task for example, but it doesn&#39;t work as expected:\r\n\r\n 1. When I navigate to the first error by pressing `F8`, the problem list is cleared sometimes. I guess the matcher conflicts with the tsserver that detects error on a file open.\r\n 2.

Otherwise, Faraday will automatically push the default adapter at the end of the stack causing your request to be executed twice.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass OfficialAdapter &lt; Faraday::Adapter\r\n  ...\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass MyAdapter\r\n  ...\r\nend\r\n\r\n# This will raise an exception\r\nconn = Faraday.new(...) do |f|\r\n  f.use OfficialAdapter\r\nend\r\n\r\n# This will cause Faraday inserting the default adapter at the end of the stack\r\nconn = Faraday.new(...) do |f|\r\n  f.use MyAdapter\r\nend\r\n\r\n# You MUST use `adapter` method\r\nconn = Faraday.new(...) do |f|\r\n  f.adapter AnyAdapter\r\nend\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58162859/upgrading-faraday-gem-runtimeerror-adapter-should-be-set-using-the-adapter-m/58164772#58164772","title":"Upgrading Faraday gem: RuntimeError: Adapter should be set using the `adapter` method, not `use`"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":3839978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J9Xfj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Skidder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3839978/skidder"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":136,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58164772,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569834768,"creation_date":1569826535,"question_id":58162859,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58162859","body_markdown":"I&#39;m relatively new to RoR, and now I want to upgrade faraday from 0.15.4 to 0.16.2 and I think I need to change the way I insert Faraday into the middleware stack.

Here&#39;s what i did to fix the issue:\r\nI overrode the addGestureRecognizer on the subclass of PDFView, i then spin through and find the one that is a tap gesture 1 touch (this is provided by apple to handle the links clicking) and create my new tapgesture that i want to show/hide a menu (or your custom actions).  I add it to the PDFView and require the built in one by apple to Fail (line 15).\r\n\r\nI then allow the shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGesture which lets both tap gestures to call correclty.  if you tap a link, my new one doesn&#39;t get called, but if you don&#39;t tap a link then it works perfectly and shows/hides my menu.
