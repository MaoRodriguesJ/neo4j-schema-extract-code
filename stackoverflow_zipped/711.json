Let&#39;s say that the system is in 2D, and the equation of motion of each particle is described by a second-order ODE of its position with respect to time. Then four variables are needed for each particle, two for positions and two for velocities. Then 4n variables are needed to be declared. Is there a way to generalize, such that one does not need to list all 4n equations one by one?\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/ode_example.html#Example-2:-Solving-Systems-of-Equations-1\r\n\r\nI try to modify the Lorenz equation in the link above a little bit to n particles (which is a very very rough attempt since I actually have no idea how to do it) by trying to extend `u` and `du` to 2D arrays.\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing DifferentialEquations\r\nusing Plots\r\nn = 4\r\nfunction lorenz(du,u,p,t,i)\r\n    du[i,1] = 10.0*(u[i,2]-u[i,1])*sum(u[1:n,1])\r\n    du[i,2] = (u[i,1]*(28.0-u[i,3]) - u[i,2])*sum(u[1:n,1])\r\n    du[i,3] = (u[i,1]*u[i,2] - (8/3)*u[i,3])*sum(u[1:n,1])\r\nend\r\n\r\nu0 = hcat([1.0;0.0;0.0], [0.0;1.0;0.0], [0.0;0.0;1.0])\r\ntspan = (0.0,100.0)\r\nprob = ODEProblem(lorenz,u0,tspan)\r\nsol = solve(prob)\r\n```\r\nThis, without surprise, does not work, but I hope that you get the idea what I am trying to do.

I checked inside the doc and it explicitly says this is the preferred way to specify an entrypoint ad set default arguments. My only doubt is this sentence in the [reference][1]: \r\n\r\n&gt; The following instructions can be affected by the SHELL instruction\r\n&gt; when the *shell* form of them is used in a Dockerfile: RUN, CMD and\r\n&gt; ENTRYPOINT.\r\n\r\nSo is it caused by `SHELL` statement? Because I used the *exec* form. I will not question the implementation choice, I just do not understand why the *exec* form is the preferred one and the `SHELL` statement does only affect those in *shell* form. But I am probably missing something.\r\n\r\nAnyway, how can I write this Dockerfile so that the `CMD` arguments can be overridden?\r\n\r\nThe only idea I came up with was using a different entrypoint:\r\n\r\n    [&quot;Write-Output&quot;, &quot;&#39;Jenkins agent started&#39;&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&#39;java&#39;&quot;, &quot;-jar&quot;, &quot;&#39;C:\\agent.jar&#39;&quot;]\r\n\r\nAnd deleting the second `SHELL` statement. But again the json is not parsed correctly, like in the previous case (but now using `powershell -command`).\r\n\r\nDocker version: \r\n\r\n    Client: Docker Engine - Community\r\n     Version:

However contrarily to what I was expecting, the Stack level too deep error occurs for even smaller data size.\r\n\r\ndata_controller.rb\r\n```\r\n  def load_data data_path, width\r\n    authorize!                                                                                                                                                               \r\n\r\n    encrypted = NativeDataProtector.encrypt(data_path, get_key(), get_iv())\r\n    return [ encrypted, &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; ]\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nnative_encryptor.cpp\r\n```\r\nVALUE encrypt_n(VALUE _self, VALUE data_path, VALUE key, VALUE salt){\r\n  DataProtector protector;\r\n  string *b64 = protector.encrypt(StringValueCStr(data_path),\t\\\r\n\t\t\t\t StringValueCStr(key),\t \\\r\n\t\t\t\t StringValueCStr(salt));\r\n\r\n    VALUE ret = rb_str_new(b64-&gt;c_str(), b64-&gt;length());\r\n    delete(b64);\r\n  return ret;\r\n}\r\n\r\nextern &quot;C&quot; void Init_data_protector() {\r\n  VALUE mod = rb_define_module(&quot;NativeDataProtector&quot;);\r\n  rb_define_module_function(mod, &quot;encrypt&quot;, (VALUE(*)(ANYARGS))encrypt_n, 3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nencrypt.h\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;ruby.h&gt;\r\n#include &quot;extconf.h&quot;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n#include &lt;list&gt;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;openssl/conf.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;openssl/err.h&gt;\r\n\r\nclass DataProtector {\r\n\r\n private :\r\n  int pad_cleartext(vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; *cleartext);\r\n  vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; *read_data(string path);\r\n  int aes_encrypt(vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; *plaintext, string key,\r\n\t\t  string iv, unsigned char *ciphertext);\r\n  string to_b64(unsigned char* in);\r\n  void handleErrors(void);\r\n\r\n public :\r\n  string *encrypt(string data_path, string key, string salt);\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\nencrypt.cpp\r\n```\r\nstring *DataProtector::encrypt(string data_path, string key, string salt) {\r\n  vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; *cleartext = readData(data_path);\r\n  int length = pad_cleartext(cleartext);\r\n\r\n  unsigned char* output = new unsigned char[length + 16];\r\n  \r\n  int ciphertext_len;\r\n\r\n  // encrypt\r\n  string *encrypted = new string(&quot;&quot;);\r\n  ciphertext_len = aes_encrypt(&amp;((*cleartext), key, iv, output);\r\n  (*encrypted) += to_b64(output);\r\n\r\n  delete(cleartext);\r\n  delete(output);\r\n\r\n  return encrypted;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint DataProtector::aes_encrypt(vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; *plaintext, string key,\r\n  string iv, unsigned char *ciphertext)\r\n{\r\n  EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx;\r\n\r\n  int len;\r\n\r\n  int ciphertext_len;\r\n\r\n  /* Create and initialise the context */\r\n  if(!(ctx = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new())) handleErrors();\r\n\r\n  /* Initialise the encryption operation.

This is an independent element and the `onclick` attribute does not apply to it.\r\n\r\nThe best way to solve this is to explicitly set the `pointer-events` to `none` for the icon SVG:\r\n\r\n    .dropbtn &gt; svg {\r\n      pointer-events: none\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `pointer-events` property dictates how the UI should respond to events on the object.  By setting it to `none`, we are saying that this object does not process events and they are therefore passed to the object underneath the SVG.\r\n\r\nThe working snippet showing this can be seen

else will be broken in the future.\r\n\r\nSo the recommended solution is to download the installer again and create an offline installer for the next time this happens, you can do that by running the online installer with the following parameters: `vs_community.exe --layout c:\\vslayout --lang en-US` (replace `vs_community.exe` with the actual name of the online installer file, or rename it), for more options, that might require a smaller download (example if you only need native and don&#39;t need .net) check the documentation [here][1] for the full set of options you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

To answer the questions in your issue:\r\n\r\nCopying the content of `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio` folder is not a recommended way to install VS.\r\n\r\n(The complete installation will not only set the Environment variables but also set the related registry keys and values. A simple copy may break this process)\r\n\r\nSo we always suggest that users install the VS by vs-installer or offline installation package. (Same like what **Zlatomir** suggests.)\r\n\r\n&gt; To your actual requirements:\r\n\r\nIt seems you&#39;re just trying to use `VC++ compiler in QT Creator` instead of `developing QT projects in Visual Studio`. So **build tools for VS** package is enough for you. \r\n\r\nSee this [related issue](https://forum.qt.io/topic/98821/qt-creator-and-visual-c-compilers), if we download **Build Tools for VS** package with corresponding C++ workload, then we can get the compiler the QT needs. There&#39;s no need to install the VS IDE for this situation. \r\n\r\nAnd if we need C++ compiler from VS2017, download the `Build Tools for VS2017`, if we need C++ compiler from VS2015, download the `Build Tools for VS2015 Update3`. Link of old version about VS Tools see [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/).\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nFrom the the link [older downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) we can see:\r\n\r\nChoose the **download** button according to which version we need. We can find both VS2017 build tools package and VS2015&#39;s there.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9fLy9.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372928/visual-studio-copy-installation-folder-and-setup-it-up-to-be-auto-detected-by-q/58381191#58381191","title":"Visual Studio: copy installation folder and setup it up to be auto-detected by Qt Creator"}],"owner":{"reputation":2471,"user_id":3405291,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6499e84a22df10a3f4fec15a8bd0d06?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3405291","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3405291/user3405291"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2471,"user_id":3405291,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6499e84a22df10a3f4fec15a8bd0d06?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3405291","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3405291/user3405291"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58381191,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571119471,"creation_date":1571042215,"last_edit_date":1571119471,"question_id":58372928,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58372928","body_markdown":"I wiped out an old Windows 10 and replaced it with a new Windows 10 by [ISO image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). \r\n\r\n1.

[Here is a link to the documentation for getting all sObjects][1]. You will basically call the `Schema.getGlobalDescribe()` method which will return you a map of sObjectTypes with their sObject name as the key. Then you&#39;ll need to call `getDesribe()` on each sObjectType get the fields of the object from that Describe result. You&#39;ll again need to call `getDescribe()` on each sObjectField in order to have access to the columns you wanted (eg. FieldType). [Here is the documentation on that][2]  You could save each DescribeFieldResult into a list that goes into a Map of &lt;String, List&lt;DescribeFieldResult&gt;&gt; with the sObject name as the key, then you could do what you want with them... Put them in a table if you like. Keep in mind this is all going to be very expensive when it comes to CPU time. You may even run into some governor limits. \r\nHere is a little example you can run using *Execute Anonymous* in the developer console where the sObject Name and all its field names and types are printed to  the debug logs\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMap&lt;String, sObjectType&gt; objects = Schema.getGlobalDescribe();\r\nfor(String objName : objects.keySet()){\r\n    system.debug(&#39;=======&#39; + objName + &#39;=========\\n Fields: &#39;);\r\n    sObjectType o = objects.get(objName);\r\n    DescribeSobjectResult oDRes = o.getDescribe();\r\n    Map&lt;String, Schema.SObjectField&gt; fields = dResult.fields.getMap();\r\n    for(Schema.SObjectField f : fields.values()){\r\n        DescribeFieldResult fDRes = f.getDescribe();\r\n        system.debug(&#39;name: &#39; + fDRes.getName() + &#39; | type: &#39; + fDRes.getType());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dynamic_global_describe.htm\r\n  [2]: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_methods_system_fields_describe.htm#apex_methods_system_fields_describe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372921/can-i-create-a-sql-table-populated-with-salesforce-objects/58375021#58375021","title":"Can i create a sql table populated with Salesforce objects?"}],"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":11669186,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6083978d5aa1477918aeafe6416add3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11669186/mel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58375021,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571049549,"creation_date":1571042193,"question_id":58372921,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58372921","body_markdown":"does Salesforce offer a way to obtain all Objects like Account, Contact etc and populate them in a SQL table with certain columns like \r\nObjectEntity, FieldName , FieldType ?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372921/can-i-create-a-sql-table-populated-with-salesforce-objects","title":"Can i create a sql table populated with Salesforce objects?"},{"tags":["jboss","spring-data-jpa","classcastexception","spring-ws","classloading"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":580,"user_id":1454121,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u0ONy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Eduardo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1454121/eduardo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571057921,"creation_date":1571057921,"answer_id":58377386,"question_id":58372920,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58377386","body_markdown":"I discovered what the problem was.

have a large dataset (800,000+ data points) with information about loans given by 5,000+ banks.

Each bar, will be sectioned into different colors.

things to note. You do not require to goto `ms` is the user is not admin as the statement for not being admin will not be met, we will automatically faal through into the `ms` label.\r\n\r\nNotice where the problems were in your code. i.e `if %name%=admin` should be `if &quot;%_name%&quot;==&quot;admin&quot;` with double equal sign and the underscore in the name. It is also double quoted to ensure that we do a match without unwanted whitespace. Lastly `/I` option to catch ADMIN in any case.\r\n\r\nSee `if /?`, `choice /?` from command line for more help around these functions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372868/trying-to-make-a-os-in-batch/58373367#58373367","title":"trying to make a &quot;OS&quot; in batch"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12213005,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a098d36fab9f421389781a26caaeeae6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"duch3201","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12213005/duch3201"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571048196,"creation_date":1571041992,"question_id":58372868,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58372868","body_markdown":"        @echo off\r\n    :load\r\n    rem imitation of loading the os\r\n    color 70\r\n    ver\r\n    title boot\r\n    echo please wait...\r\n    ping localhost -n 3 &gt;nul\r\n    cls\r\n    systeminfo\r\n    rem in here user types name he wants to be his account name\r\n    :login\r\n    title login\r\n    cls\r\n    date\r\n    cls\r\n    echo welcome to windows 71\r\n    echo before we bigen please type your name\r\n    set /P_name=here:\r\n    if %name%=admin goto admin\r\n    if not goto ms\r\n    rem ms=menu start\r\n    :ms \r\n    echo %time%\r\n    echo hello %name% \r\n    echo type HELP for list to commands\r\n    set /P_command=here:\r\n    if %command%=help goto help\r\n    if %command%=exit goto exit\r\n    if %command%=calendar goto cal\r\n    if not goto wc\r\n    rem wc=wrong command\r\n    :admin\r\n    echo hello %name% to the admin panel\r\n    echo type HELP for list to commands\r\n    set /P_command=here:\r\n    if %command%=help goto help\r\n    if %command%=exit goto exit\r\n    if %command%=calendar goto cal\r\n\r\n\r\nso the problem is that it crashes after the :LOGIN part and i don&#39;t know what to do!\r\nso im trying to make a os in batch (something like MS-DOS)but it crashes after the &quot;login&quot; part\r\ni tried everything i could think of and it didn&#39;t work also i want to make a save file so user can set a password for thier &quot;account&quot;.

am trying to automate tableau report generation. We have the same dashboards for multiple accounts (between 10,000 - 20 million rows of data for each account - and multiple filters, which prevents us from being able to roll up the data). We have separate tables for each account. As we get more accounts, manual maintenance is getting very time consuming. Also, considering the large volume of data for some accounts, and multiple filters, a live connection to our redshift data source slows down the dashboards considerably.\r\n\r\nWe have managed to write a script that takes a template tableau file and generates dashboards for all accounts by replacing elements in the twb file. This works well for live connections. However, considering the large volume of data and multiple filters, we want to try a similar approach with extracts instead of live. We havent been able to find any obvious way to dynamically create the extracts.\r\n\r\nIs there any way of doing

I tried the online documentation for EF Core on relationships to no avail.\r\n\r\nHelp is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lda6S.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372865/having-a-hard-time-understanding-how-cascade-delete-works-and-how-to-configure-r","title":"Having a hard time understanding how cascade delete works and how to configure relationships"},{"tags":["swift"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":538,"user_id":8244247,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1346748042106382/picture?type=large","display_name":"Joseph Budin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8244247/joseph-budin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571042040,"post_id":58372864,"comment_id":103095187,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372864/thread-1-fatal-error-unexpectedly-found-nil-while-unwrapping-an-optional-value#comment103095187_58372864"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11507446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zgkFKO367F0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/qxx4ZgG0v5Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"조병현","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11507446/%ec%a1%b0%eb%b3%91%ed%98%84"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571042008,"answer_count":0,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571041969,"creation_date":1571041969,"question_id":58372864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58372864","body_markdown":"How can I solve this error? please help me\r\n\r\n    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?) {\r\n        if characteristic == rxCharacteristic {\r\n            if let ASCIIstring = NSString(data: characteristic.value!, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8.rawValue) {\r\n                \r\n                characteristicASCIIValue = ASCIIstring\r\n                \r\n                let dis = (characteristicASCIIValue as NSString).integerValue\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372864/thread-1-fatal-error-unexpectedly-found-nil-while-unwrapping-an-optional-value","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Thread 1: Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value. help me please"},{"tags":["django","bootstrap-4","tabs","modal-dialog"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11888598,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GI0iIwDJyPo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcPGJqV9Q_YW5goox0BQ31E-g0W8A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dev Dj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11888598/dev-dj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571043949,"post_id":58373356,"comment_id":103096104,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372863/how-to-run-a-function-from-a-link-within-popup-modal-bootstrap/58373356#comment103096104_58373356"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":8579914,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7HBwE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mahmut Can Tuncer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8579914/mahmut-can-tuncer"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571043726,"creation_date":1571043726,"answer_id":58373356,"question_id":58372863,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58373356","body_markdown":"Probably django does not know {% for obj in object_list %}.

trying to code a variadic `pipe` function which composes an arbitrary number of one-argument pure functions.\r\nThis typing should check that the return type of one function is the argument type of the next and so on.\r\n\r\nI would expect this to work in TypeScript 3.7 which introduces recursive types but somehow it doesn&#39;t work and gives the error:\r\n\r\n`TS2589: type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite`\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Tail&lt;T extends any[]&gt; = ((...t: T) =&gt; void) extends ((x: any, ...u: infer U) =&gt; void) ? U : never;\r\n\r\ntype Pipe&lt;FNS extends unknown[]&gt; = FNS extends [(a: infer A) =&gt; infer B, (b: infer B) =&gt; infer C] ? C :\r\n                                 FNS extends [(a: infer A) =&gt; infer B, (b: infer B) =&gt; infer C, Pipe&lt;[...Tail&lt;FNS&gt;[]]&gt;] ? C : never;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `FNS` type represents the array of pure functions and the `Tail` type should make sure that only the tail of this array is returned, but still the compiler marks this as an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nUsage example:\r\n```\r\nconst numToString = (n: number): string =&gt; n.toString();\r\nconst toUpper = (s: string): string =&gt; s.toUpperCase();\r\n\r\n// this works, Foo evaluates to string\r\ntype Foo = Pipe&lt;[typeof numToString, typeof toUpper]&gt;;\r\n\r\n// this doesn&#39;t work, Foo is not evaluated\r\ntype Foo = Pipe&lt;[typeof numToString, typeof toUpper, typeof toUpper]&gt;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is on this part:\r\n```\r\nPipe&lt;[...Tail&lt;FNS&gt;[]]&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is this infinite?

At the moment the code is using LINQ queries to get data from the database. Some of these operations are taking awfully long. I have been given a task to speed up things if possible. \r\n\r\nMy plan is to create stored procedures and use entity framework to call the stored procedures. Also, I can reuse these stored procedures multiple times in other projects. Have you guys got any suggestions on this idea?\r\n\r\nAs a test, I picked one of the Linq queries which were taking long to run and extracted the SQL which Entity Framework is using. \r\n\r\nI created a stored procedure with this Script (I hardcoded all parameter values so the SP does not take any parameters). When I try and benchmark my sp call in Visual studio 2019, surprisingly the Linq query was quicker than using the stored procedure.

The scope resolution operator can be used as a kind of annotation to indicate a suppression of virtual resolution. It actually has no effect, since in constructors (and destructors) the virtual call mechanism is disabled anyway. Since the potential for errors (execution of another method than the one expected by the user) is gone, no warning should be issued for that code. It is safe.\r\n2. Introducing a non-virtual &quot;helper&quot; method is an alternative. Then both, the constructor and the virtual method could delegate their task to the non-virtual method. This approach may appear less suspicious to those who want to stick to the rule &quot;Avoid calling virtual methods from constructors or destructors.&quot; On the other hand it seems less elegant, since it makes the introduction of boilerplate helper methods necessary.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372808/is-it-safe-to-call-a-virtual-method-in-the-constructor-when-using-a-scope-resolu/58388668#58388668","title":"Is it safe to call a virtual method in the constructor when using a scope resolution operator?"}],"owner":{"reputation":683,"user_id":2492801,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzzOZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Benjamin Bihler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2492801/benjamin-bihler"},"last_editor":{"reputation":683,"user_id":2492801,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzzOZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Benjamin Bihler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2492801/benjamin-bihler"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571121803,"creation_date":1571041716,"last_edit_date":1571042839,"question_id":58372808,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58372808","body_markdown":"I have a class hierarchy where every class has a method `compute` that will trigger some (re-) computation. This method is a virtual method (and it&#39;s pure virtual in the base class). In some cases I would like to call this method from the constructor to immediately set up my instance.\r\n\r\nOf course this can be dangerous. Eclipse CDT Code Analysis issues the error &quot;Calling a virtual method in constructor can cause crashes and unexpected behavior&quot;. I understand the error message and its reason. Please, please do **not** tell me why this should be avoided!!!\r\n\r\nTo make the error message and (more important) the potential of having an error go away, I have introduced a scope resolution operator. So the constructor now looks like that:\r\n\r\n    MyClass::MyClass()\r\n    {\r\n    \tMyClass::compute();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI would expect that to be absolutely safe. But Eclipse code analysis continues to display the error message. Why? It is not possible to call an unexpected method. And if the method was pure virtual in `MyClass`, the compiler would tell me so.\r\n\r\nIs this an Eclipse code analysis bug or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nEdit: the scope resolution operator is supposed to suppress virtual resolution. Therefore I expect it to prevent all possible errors mentioned by the warning.

you *will* have to tell the compiler that you know more about the situation than it does.\r\n\r\nOne reason would be that the `Where` method has not been annotated in a way that lets the compiler understand the guarantee for non-nullability, nor is it actually possible to annotate it. There might be a case for having additional heuristics added to the compiler to understand some basic cases, like this one, but currently we do not have it.\r\n\r\nAs such, one option would be to use the null forgiving operator, colloquially known as the &quot;dammit operator&quot;.

What is the difference between Context Parameters and Environment Entries?\r\n\r\nThis is the same answer as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13196868/servlet-spec-context-param-vs-env-entry-in-web-xml?\r\n\r\n&gt; Why would I choose to use one instead of the other?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m assuming that you mean &quot;why would I choose `&lt;Context&gt;`/`&lt;Environment&gt;` versus `&lt;context-param&gt;/&lt;env-entry&gt;`&quot; and not &quot;how do I decide if I want a context parameter or an environment entry&quot;. If your question is the latter, than your question is indeed a duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe reason you might want to use `&lt;Context&gt;`/`&lt;Environment&gt;` in `META-INF/context.xml` versus putting their analogues into `WEB-INF/web.xml` comes down to separation of duties in a deployment scenario. Generally speaking, programmers are the ones who are in charge of the contents of `WEB-INF/web.xml` and administrators or operations staff are in charge of the contents of `META-INF/context.xml`.\r\n\r\nOperators can override values specified by programmers for, say, the location of a configuration file. `WEB-INF/web.xml` might point to a configuration file in `~/configs/app.conf` while the production deployment puts that configuration file into `/etc/foo/app.conf`.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s better if operators aren&#39;t making on-the-fly changes to an application&#39;s deployment descriptor. `META-INF/context.xml` allows them to make those kinds of adjustments without changing that deployment descriptor.\r\n\r\nIf you are a one-person operation or if everyone is DevOps or whatever, then it almost doesn&#39;t matter. But Tomcat gives you the flexibility to implement whatever policy you want to enforce in your own environment.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372785/parameter-versus-environment-entries-in-a-tomcat-context/58458140#58458140","title":"&quot;&lt;Parameter&gt;&quot; versus &quot;&lt;Environment&gt;&quot; entries in a Tomcat Context"}],"owner":{"reputation":138377,"user_id":642706,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWEI3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Basil Bourque","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/642706/basil-bourque"},"last_editor":{"reputation":138377,"user_id":642706,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWEI3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Basil Bourque","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/642706/basil-bourque"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58458140,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571432437,"creation_date":1571041628,"last_edit_date":1571042054,"question_id":58372785,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58372785","body_markdown":"On [*The Context Container*](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/context.html) page of the Tomcat documentation, I see two sections:\r\n\r\n - [*Context Parameters*][1]\r\n - [*Environment Entries*][2]\r\n\r\nThe standard names for such elements is `&lt;context-param&gt;` and `&lt;env-entry&gt;`, while the Tomcat-specific names are `&lt;Parameter&gt;` and `&lt;Environment&gt;`. \r\n\r\nBoth *Context Parameters* and *Environment Entries* appear to have the same simple job of making same value available to the servlets running in that context.
