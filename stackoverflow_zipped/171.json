The definition you give has to work for absolutely any types and functions that the caller provides - this is what being (parametrically) polymorphic means.\r\n\r\nIf we now look at your three definitions in these terms, we can solve the apparent mystery:\r\n\r\nFirst:\r\n\r\n    bimap f g (SemiDrei a) = SemiDrei a\r\n\r\nthis is completely fine, as you saw. `SemiDrei a` has type `SemiDrei a b c`, where only `a` is specified. That means it can take on any type such as `SemiDrei a Int String`, or `SemiDrei [Bool] (Char, [Double])`, or whatever. `SemiDrei a` is itself polymorphic, it can be of any compatible type. This means that in particular it can act as both the `SemiDrei a b c` and the `SemiDrei a c e` in the above signature of `bimap`.\r\n\r\nContrast with your other attempts:\r\n\r\n    bimap f g = id\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that `id`, although polymorphic, is not polymorphic *enough* for this purpose. Its type is `a -&gt; a` (for any `a`), which in particular can be specialised to `SemiDrei a b c -&gt; SemiDrei a b c`. But it can&#39;t possibly be specialised to a type `SemiDrei a b d -&gt; SemiDrei a c e` as required, because `b`, `c`, `d` and `e` will in general be completely different types. Recall that the *caller* of `bimap` gets to choose what the types are - they can easily choose functions `f` and `g` where `b` and `c` are different types, for example, and then there is no way `id` can take a `SemiDrei a b d` to `SemiDrei a c e`, because they&#39;re different types.\r\n\r\nAt this stage you may object that the value `SemiDrei a` can be a value of all such types. That&#39;s perfectly true, but it&#39;s not relevant for type inference - the compiler only cares about the types, not what values may inhabit them. It has to consider that different types have completely different, non-intersecting, values. And, say, `SemiDrei a Int String` and `SemiDrei a Bool Char` are in fact different types. Again, the compiler doesn&#39;t know that the `Int` etc aren&#39;t actually used by any of the values of the type. That&#39;s indeed exactly why such &quot;phantom types&quot; (types which appear in a type definition but not in any of their data constructors) are used in practice - to allow the compiler to be able to differentiate them by type, even though the run-time representation might be completely equivalent.\r\n\r\nAs for your third attempt, `bimap f g x = x`, that&#39;s exactly the same as the previous one - it constrains `bimap f g` to have its output type the same as its input. (It&#39;s in fact totally equivalent to `bimap f g = id`.)\r\n\r\nSo the important takeaway is that, at the type-checking phase, the compiler only cares about types - and two types with different names are (and have to be) considered totally distinct, even though it may be that equivalent values can be embedded in both.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494308/type-signature-mismatch-on-bifunctor-instance-definition/58494490#58494490","title":"Type Signature Mismatch on Bifunctor instance definition"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":84219,"user_id":3234959,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93bb12ca0f93dfddb33880316f7e66c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3234959/chi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":84219,"user_id":3234959,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93bb12ca0f93dfddb33880316f7e66c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3234959/chi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571695068,"last_edit_date":1571695068,"creation_date":1571694239,"answer_id":58494517,"question_id":58494308,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58494517","body_markdown":"This shows the same issue in a simpler case:\r\n\r\n    data T a = K\r\n    \r\n    foo :: T a -&gt; T b\r\n    foo K = K  -- type checks\r\n    \r\n    bar :: T a -&gt; T b\r\n    bar x = x  -- type error\r\n\r\n    -- bar = id would also be a type error, for the same reason\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that the two `K` in `foo` values hide their type parameters. A more precise definition would be\r\n\r\n    -- pseudo code\r\n    foo (K @a) = K @b\r\n\r\nHere you can see that the implicit type argument changes. GHC automatically infers those type arguments for us when we write `K` in the definition of `foo`. \r\nSince they are implicit, they _look_ as if they are the same `K`s, but they are not to the type checker.\r\n\r\nInstead, when we use `x` in the definition of `bar`, there are no implicit type arguments to infer. We have that `x :: T a` and that&#39;s all. We can not use `x` and claim that has a different type `T b`.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that using &quot;safe coercions&quot; we can perform the intuitively correct kind-of-`id` which turns one `K` (in one type) into the other `K` of the other type:\r\n\r\n    import Data.Coerce\r\n    \r\n    baz :: T a -&gt; T b\r\n    baz = coerce\r\n\r\nWhether this is better is arguable. For simple cases, pattern matching can be easier to understand than `coerce`, since the latter can perform a vast array of (safe) coercions, possibly leaving the reader to guess about what&#39;s actually happening at the type level.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494308/type-signature-mismatch-on-bifunctor-instance-definition/58494517#58494517","title":"Type Signature Mismatch on Bifunctor instance definition"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":48992,"user_id":180286,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAXU2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fyodor Soikin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/180286/fyodor-soikin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":48992,"user_id":180286,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAXU2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fyodor Soikin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/180286/fyodor-soikin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":true,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1571695924,"last_edit_date":1571695924,"creation_date":1571694383,"answer_id":58494539,"question_id":58494308,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58494539","body_markdown":"There last argument is not, in fact, yielded unchanged: its type changes.

I need to write algorithm that will solve the problem of chocolate bar division. Chocolate contains brown and white bars and my job is to find the best way to divide them.\r\n\r\n**Input:**\r\nI get (int) n and (int) m which means rows and column and then i get something like that (b - brown , w- white):\r\n\r\n4 2\r\n\r\nb b w w\r\n\r\nw b b w\r\n\r\nRules: \r\n\r\n1.Each divided piece need to contain both white and brown bar so we cant divide bars to only white or only brown pieces\r\n\r\n2.We start from table given in Input and then we start dividing \r\n\r\n3.We stop after getting pieces that contain 1 colour ex  piece: [white, brown] , [b,w,w],[b,b,w] \r\n\r\n4.The division can by done by cutting the bigger piece horizontally or vertically.\r\n\r\n**Output**\r\n(int) R which is something called balance, when we have piece that cannot be divided ex [w,w,w,b] we need to count balance which means 3 - 1 = 2 (white bars - brown bars or brown - white)\r\nR is the total ballance from all divided parts. R should be as close to 0 as possible, ex on left is the best solution\r\n\r\n[PICTURE EXAMPLE][1]\r\n\r\nI started with scanning and writing modules and after that I don&#39;t really know what to do. \r\nI know I need to use the recursion and the exiting condition is that final piece has only one bar color ex [w,w,b], now I&#39;m looking for something that will help me find where and when i can &quot;cut&quot; the bigger piece.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nHope you can understand it and help me find any way to code and solve it :) .\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgzm0.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494299/how-do-i-solve-chocolate-division-algorithm","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"How do I solve chocolate division algorithm?"},{"tags":["r","bar-chart"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10465,"user_id":5325862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cF7Mi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"camille","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5325862/camille"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571709535,"post_id":58494298,"comment_id":103321899,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494298/barplot-of-barplots-in-r#comment103321899_58494298"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":6116114,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0fbbd68420090ebe00ec80448df9aab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lily Sharpton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6116114/lily-sharpton"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12851,"user_id":6461462,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BlsdV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"M--","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6461462/m"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571768705,"answer_count":0,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571695247,"creation_date":1571692905,"last_edit_date":1571694592,"question_id":58494298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58494298","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a barplot of barplots in R.

Now, for every 1500 in the column &quot;rating&quot;, I want to update the corresponding values in column &quot;rank&quot; with a value within the range of 1 to the length of the corresponding group which is also unqiue in the group.\r\n\r\nThis is what I&#39;ve done so far:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nnew = pd.DataFrame()\r\ngrouped = df.groupby(&#39;match_id&#39;, sort=False)\r\nfor name, dfg in grouped:\r\n    dfm = dfg.copy()\r\n    num = len(dfm.loc[dfm[&#39;rating&#39;] == 1500])\r\n    dfm.loc[dfm[&#39;rating&#39;] == 1500, &#39;rank&#39;] = np.random.choice(range(1,len(dfm)+1), num, replace=False)\r\n    new = pd.concat([new, dfm], sort = True)\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis works but has two problems. First, numbers generated this way may already exist within the group (on other rows). I want the generated random numbers to be unique, meaning the numbers do not already exist within the corresponding group. \r\n\r\nSecond, this takes way too long for my original dataset (125000 groups). So I need it to be also much more efficient and faster than loc.\r\n\r\nThis is what I expect to get as the output (note the &quot;rank&quot; column)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\tmatch_id\tname\trank\trating\r\n0\t      m1\tpeter\t   6\t1500\r\n1\t      m1\tmike\t   5\t1500\r\n2\t      m1\tjeff\t   4\t1500\r\n3\t      m1\tjohn\t   3\t1500\r\n4\t      m1\talex\t   1\t1550\r\n5\t      m1\tjoe\t       2\t1540\r\n6\t      m2\tjeff\t   1\t1640\r\n7\t      m2\tpeter\t   2\t1500\r\n8\t      m2\talex\t   4\t1390\r\n9\t      m2\tli\t       5\t1500\r\n10\t      m2\tjoe\t       3\t1450\r\n11\t      m2\ttom\t       6\t1500\r\n12\t      m3\tmike\t   1\t1720\r\n13\t      m3\tjohn\t   4\t1500\r\n14\t      m3\ttom\t       3\t1320\r\n15\t      m3\tpeter\t   2\t1500\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help is highly appreciated.

The third argument is a floating point number so it will be passed in register %xmm0.\r\n\r\nInside printf the first argument, the format string will be read from %rdi, now it will process the format string and find &quot;%f&quot;, so it will read %xmm0 because that&#39;s where the first floating point argument is supposed to reside, it finds &quot;3.14&quot; in %xmm0 and prints it correctly then it looks at the format string again and finds %d so it reads the register %esi, which\r\nwill have the second integer argument, it finds 42 there and prints it correctly.\r\n\r\nSince there are six registers for passing integers/pointers and 16 for passing floating points the following also works\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n       printf(&quot;%d %d %d %d %d %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f\\n&quot;,\r\n               1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,10.0,11.0,12.0,13.0,14.0,15.0,16.0, 40, 41, 42,\r\n               43,44);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt; Output: 40 41 42 43 44 1.000000 2.000000 3.000000 4.000000 5.000000\r\n&gt; 6.000000 7.000000 8.000000 9.000000 10.000000 11.00000000 12.000000 13.000000 14.000000 15.000000 16.000000 \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494268/printf-argument-order-being-ignored/58531158#58531158","title":"Printf argument order being ignored"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":4022934,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8QLz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GaTTaCa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4022934/gattaca"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58494332,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571865725,"creation_date":1571692720,"question_id":58494268,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58494268","body_markdown":"I am running the following code snippet:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    int main() {\r\n       printf(&quot;%f %d\\n&quot;, 42, 3.14);\r\n    }\r\nWhich, to my astonishment, displays:\r\n\r\n    3.140000 42\r\n     \r\nCompiler (gcc 8.3.0 on a Debian-based distro) does warn me about the order of the arguments:   \r\n\r\n    test.c: In function ‘main’:\r\n    test.c:3:13: warning: format ‘%f’ expects argument of type ‘double’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’ [-Wformat=]\r\n    printf(&quot;%f %d\\n&quot;, 42, 3.14);\r\n            ~^        ~~\r\n            %d\r\n    test.c:3:16: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int’, but argument 3 has type ‘double’ [-Wformat=]\r\n    printf(&quot;%f %d\\n&quot;, 42, 3.14);\r\n               ~^         ~~~~\r\n               %f\r\n\r\nCan a soul more enlightened than mine explain me this behavior?

Tables are high level data structures that emphasize retrieval over insertion and deletion. If a table is implemented with a binary search tree, a retrieval in the average case will be O(logn). However, it is possible to improve the situation if you take advantage of the locality of\r\nreference principle. Temporal locality of reference states that if an item is used, it will be used again in the near future. Spatial locality of reference states that if an item is used, items near it will be used in the near future. Thus, when an item is retrieved, you will move it to the root while maintaining the binary search tree property, making subsequent retrievals of this item O(1) if it is retrieved again in the near future. Moving the item to the root while maintaining the BST property will require rotations, discussed below. In order to make sure that the item was moved to the root, it will be convenient to add a level order traversal to the TreeIterator interface. In this type of traversal, the root item will be displayed first.\r\nLab:\r\n• TreeIterator\r\no Iterator Design Pattern\r\no Level Order Traversal • Binary Search Tree\r\no Rotate Left\r\no Rotate Right\r\n• Adaptable Binary Search Tree\r\no Temporal Locality of Reference • Tables\r\no Adapter Design Pattern\r\n\r\n• public void setLevelorder()\r\nImplement this method in BinaryTreeIterator. The trick is to make use of a local queue (local to the setLevelOrder method) that will hold TreeNodes. The queues are generics enabled, so forcing the local queue to accept only TreeNodes might be useful. There is also an instance variable queue that contains the actual items (pulled from the TreeNodes) that will be given to the user when next() is called during traversal. Start by placing the root TreeNode on the local queue (if the root is null, don&#39;t do anything). Loop until the local queue is empty. When a TreeNode is pulled from the local queue, extract and place its item on the instance variable queue. In order to get a level order traversal, the left TreeNode, if present, will need to be processed first, and then the right TreeNode, if present. Do not use recursion to complete this traversal. Note that tree traversals take a snapshot of the contents of the tree when the specific traversal is set. This prevents changes to the iterator if items are added or removed from the tree during traversal.\r\nThe Iterator design pattern uses an &quot;external&quot; iterator, requiring the user to set up the loop and to perform some operation on each item in the data structure manually. In a later lab, you will investigate the Command design pattern, an &quot;internal&quot; iterator where the user specifies what is to be done to each item, but the data structure actually handles the loop and performs the work.\r\nThe level order traversal of the above image is L, F, O, C, I, R, A, D, P, X, Q, U, Z\r\n \r\n\r\nI have completed all of BinaryTreeIterator.java except for the method setLevelOrder\r\n\r\n      public void setLevelorder()\r\n      {\r\n         if (root != null)\r\n         {\r\n            QueueInterface&lt;TreeNode&gt; q = new QueueLinked&lt;TreeNode&gt;();\r\n            //local queue\r\n\t\t    q.enqueue(root);\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t    while (!q.isEmpty())\r\n            {\r\n            \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n               }\t \r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }  \r\n\r\nI just need to complete the method setLevelOrder()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494256/i-am-stuck-on-a-method-in-a-program-for-a-binary-search-tree","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"I am stuck on a method in a program for a binary search tree"},{"tags":["python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46120,"user_id":2864740,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7a05a144f218bde07b659bc98e1ca7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2864740","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2864740/user2864740"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571692824,"post_id":58494255,"comment_id":103318374,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494255/elif-command-quit-indentationerror-unindent-does-not-match-any-outer-in#comment103318374_58494255"},{"owner":{"reputation":5178,"user_id":4669778,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Iz_f3T23jC4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADVQ/_H_y2EUoF7c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ofer Sadan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4669778/ofer-sadan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571692852,"post_id":58494255,"comment_id":103318383,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494255/elif-command-quit-indentationerror-unindent-does-not-match-any-outer-in#comment103318383_58494255"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10275947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8COFM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"elias amazirh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10275947/elias-amazirh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571727053,"creation_date":1571692657,"last_edit_date":1571727053,"question_id":58494255,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58494255","body_markdown":"        command = &quot;&quot;\r\n      while True:\r\n\t      command = input(&quot;&gt;&quot;).lower()\r\n\t  if command == &quot;start&quot;:\r\n\t\tprint(&quot;Car started...&quot;)\r\n\t  elif command == &quot;stop&quot;:\r\n\t\tprint(&quot;car stopped...&quot;)\r\n\t  elif command == &quot;help&quot;:\r\n\t    print(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    start -

Note from the **`value`** of `cat(...)` is NULL (it doesnt return the string). This requires 2 variables, lets call them `str` and `newstr`. I&#39;ll let `str` store the entire string that you want to copy, and `newstr` store the current string that is output by `cat(...)`.\r\n```R\r\ntidy_rename &lt;- function (df) {\r\n    df_name &lt;- deparse(substitute(df))\r\n    names(df) &lt;- tolower(names(df))\r\n    \r\n    str &lt;- paste(df_name, &quot; &lt;- &quot;, paste(df_name, &quot;%&gt;%\\n\\t rename(&quot;)) \r\n    cat(str)\r\n    for (i in names(df)) {\r\n        #Store variable at each iteration and expand str. Output newstr.\r\n        newstr &lt;- paste(&quot;\\t\\t&quot;, paste(paste(&quot;=&quot;, paste(paste(&#39;&quot;&#39;, i), &#39;&quot;&#39;))), &quot;,&quot;)\r\n        str &lt;- paste(str, newstr, sep = &quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n        cat(newstr, sep=&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n    newstr &lt;- &quot;)&quot;\r\n    str &lt;- paste0(str, newstr)\r\n    cat(newstr)\r\n    writeClipboard(str)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote how the output is stored in `str` at each iteration but `newstr` is output. \r\n\r\nAs a side note i suggest that OP checks out the `collapse` argument of `paste` (alternatively `paste0`). I don&#39;t have the full overview, but it seems like this could eliminate 2 - 3 calls to `paste` if the strings were collapsed within one of the function calls.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494242/r-copy-text-from-function-output-with-for-loop-to-clipboard/58498808#58498808","title":"R copy text from function output with for loop to clipboard"}],"owner":{"reputation":433,"user_id":4083743,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c347bae220de25a3513fa03b177847f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user63230","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4083743/user63230"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58498808,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571728052,"creation_date":1571692606,"question_id":58494242,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58494242","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve written a little function that helps renaming columns by looping through each variable and pasting various punctuation around it so that text is sent to the console.

I want to compare precipitation to SIF on a per pixel basis in my study area. My two datasets are of the same area but at slightly different spatial resolutions.

I searched the core concepts of the documentation and did some searches and couldn&#39;t find an answer or a reason why these env variables are set.\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494141/is-it-safe-to-utilze-airflow-task-environment-variables","title":"Is it safe to utilze Airflow TASK Environment Variables?"},{"tags":["python-3.x","numpy","matrix"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":139859,"user_id":128421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71770d043c0f7e3c7bc5f74190015c26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"the Tin Man","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/128421/the-tin-man"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571696528,"post_id":58494134,"comment_id":103319366,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494134/why-does-choosing-different-datatype-yield-different-results#comment103319366_58494134"},{"owner":{"reputation":37294,"user_id":7207392,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dadc9567dde5f02b09a29695eca1ce40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Panzer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7207392/paul-panzer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571711256,"post_id":58494134,"comment_id":103322156,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494134/why-does-choosing-different-datatype-yield-different-results#comment103322156_58494134"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12253719,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4zlGtaoA4dk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADo/PU4dTGBA_BE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"sabiju vv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12253719/sabiju-vv"},"last_editor":{"reputation":139859,"user_id":128421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71770d043c0f7e3c7bc5f74190015c26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"the Tin Man","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/128421/the-tin-man"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571696678,"creation_date":1571691935,"last_edit_date":1571696678,"question_id":58494134,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58494134","body_markdown":"While calculating entries of the matrix, different results are obtained when defined as float and numpy.complex64 respectively.

However, I am running into an issue where Git gets stuck on the fetch step (the git checkout with the credentials works fine). I have the credentials to my git account stored in Jenkin&#39;s credential manager.
