The way data factory works is by invoking pipelie activities on something called **Auto-resolve integration runtime** which is simply said a small VM which is provided by MS for you for time required to run the task. This VM is not connect to any VNet and as such can&#39;t reach your internal resources.\r\n\r\nYou would need to use **Self-hosted integration runtime**.

This will surely impact the creation of instances in normal scale-out conditions as your instance creation will be paused but you might utilize it for other activities like an upgrade, deployment, etc.\r\n\r\nYou can read about [Cooldowns and Custom Actions][4] which might also help you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroupLifecycle.html\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/c5XHi.png\r\n  [4]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html#lifecycle-hook-cooldowns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959425/prevent-aws-autoscalingroup-to-start-more-instances-than-max-size-during-update/57963274#57963274","title":"Prevent AWS Autoscalingroup to start more instances than max size during update via Cloudformation"}],"owner":{"reputation":2319,"user_id":491605,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94756649108cec79484192fccd1a89f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nathan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/491605/nathan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568662031,"creation_date":1568645588,"question_id":57959425,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57959425","body_markdown":"I have a autoscaling group defined via Cloudformation with this updated policy:\r\n\r\n    UpdatePolicy:\r\n      AutoScalingRollingUpdate:\r\n        WaitOnResourceSignals: false\r\n\r\nThe `maxSize` of the autoscaling group is set to 4.

Even if there are no methods, no constructors, and it is just a plain struct; without an object, using pointers-to-memory as if it pointed to an object is not generally legal in C++.\r\n\r\nThe abstract machine that C++ is specified in terms of has concepts that tend not to be compiled into assembly instructions.  Among them is &quot;is there an object there&quot;.  The standard is carefully written such that &quot;is there an object there&quot; doesn&#39;t require any runtime state.\r\n\r\nBut the compiler is free to track where there are objects, and presume that when you interact with memory via a pointer you are interacting with an actual instance of an actual object.\r\n\r\nThis rules out a certain thing called &quot;aliasing&quot;, where you have pointers to two kinds of objects, and you modify one, and the other one changes; aliasing (in general) isn&#39;t allowed in C++.  This permits compilers to assume that when you edit what a `double*` points to, a `int` nearby doesn&#39;t have its value changed; there is no legal way for there to be both an `int` and a `double` at the same spot, and a `double*` can only be written to if it points at a `double`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a buffer of raw bytes?  Guaranteed not to be a `mystruct`, at least until someone creates a `mystruct` there.  What more, when a `mystruct` is created, the values of its members are guaranteed to be indeterminate, and when it is destroyed, any unobserved changes to the values of its members can be presumed never read by anyone.\r\n\r\nThat permits yet more optimizations, as useless writes are discarded and reads optimized away.\r\n\r\nAll of this breaks down horribly when you violate the aliasing rules of C++.  These break downs only occur *sometimes* and in response to seemingly unrelated changes often.  Many programmers thus ignore the aliasing rules, and entire code bases are compiled with flags disabling aliasing rules.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959414/what-does-new-ptr-mystruct-do-for-a-struct-that-has-no-functions/57959914#57959914","title":"What does &quot;new (ptr) mystruct;&quot; do for a struct that has no functions?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3657,"user_id":2851929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d92854c87c75fc3923f4fc13b87a0d71?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ahmedaly50","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2851929/ahmedaly50"},"last_editor":{"reputation":133577,"user_id":2684539,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5fff6fb65e95570ad1a90fe1e3522e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jarod42","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2684539/jarod42"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":97,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568647861,"creation_date":1568645541,"last_edit_date":1568647547,"question_id":57959414,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57959414","body_markdown":"AFAIK the statement `new (p_to_obj) myclass;` is used to call constructor of a class for an already allocated memory region.\r\nNow, what does the statement `new (p_to_struct_inst) mystruct;` do for an already allocated instance of a struct that doesn&#39;t contain functions? \r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n    struct mystruct\r\n    {\r\n            int a;\r\n            int b;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class myclass\r\n    {\r\n            int member1;\r\n            int member2;\r\n            public:\r\n            myclass() { //initialize members }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main ()\r\n    {\r\n            myclass * p_to_obj;\r\n            p_to_obj = func_returns_addr_of_obj();\r\n            //do some stuff, including members manipulation\r\n            new (p_to_obj) myclass; //call constructor to initialize members (useful)\r\n    \r\n            mystruct * p_to_struct_inst;\r\n            p_to_struct_inst = func_returns_addr_of_struct();\r\n            new (p_to_struct_inst) mystruct;    //What is the use of this?    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959414/what-does-new-ptr-mystruct-do-for-a-struct-that-has-no-functions","title":"What does &quot;new (ptr) mystruct;&quot; do for a struct that has no functions?"},{"tags":["spring","spring-security","spring-security-oauth2"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10668,"user_id":254477,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026cd74d106306ae424a93438daee680?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sled","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/254477/sled"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568657762,"post_id":57961078,"comment_id":102336060,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959413/how-to-intercept-a-spring-principal/57961078#comment102336060_57961078"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3169,"user_id":2243324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9c50648beed0dbd696b590573785404?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jzheaux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2243324/jzheaux"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10668,"user_id":254477,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026cd74d106306ae424a93438daee680?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sled","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/254477/sled"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568752997,"last_edit_date":1568752997,"creation_date":1568651745,"answer_id":57961078,"question_id":57959413,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57961078","body_markdown":"Good question. Happily, this is covered in the [Spring Security reference][1].\r\n\r\nBriefly, though, you&#39;ll want to create an `OidcUserService` delegate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component\r\npublic class MyOidcUserService implements OAuth2UserService&lt;OidcUserRequest, OidcUser&gt; {\r\n\r\n    private final OidcUserService delegate = new OidcUserService();\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public OidcUser loadUser(OidcUserRequest request) {\r\n        OidcUser user = this.delegate.loadUser(request);\r\n        Collection&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; authorities = // map the authorities\r\n        return new DefaultOidcUser(authorities, user.getIdToken(), user.getUserInfo());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that Spring Security picks up this bean automatically in 5.2.0.RC1. You&#39;ll need to wire it directly onto the DSL, as the documentation outlines, in earlier versions.\r\n\r\nThe strategy for mapping the authorities would probably be something like a single `SimpleGrantedAuthority` for each permission you identify in your `perms_claims` attribute.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** After thinking about this a bit more, I realized that I&#39;d missed [a slightly simpler solution][2], which is using the [`GrantedAuthoritiesMapper`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.12.RELEASE/apidocs/org/springframework/security/core/authority/mapping/GrantedAuthoritiesMapper.html).

A good example of this is in official documentation linked above.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.ScreenToWorldPoint.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959371/how-to-get-0-0-from-the-center-of-the-game-in-unity/57959429#57959429","title":"How to get (0,0) from the center of the game in unity"}],"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":10163836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--yNCjG4y1uU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7r49uqQ64fBfDP1y_K5z5xCim1nHQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Game Keeper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10163836/game-keeper"},"last_editor":{"reputation":550,"user_id":1932353,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zGYEr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel Mar&#237;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1932353/daniel-mar%c3%adn"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568649331,"creation_date":1568645409,"last_edit_date":1568649146,"question_id":57959371,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57959371","body_markdown":"I am new to Unity and I am trying to make a swipe input for mobile using the `Input.touch[0]`.

If you just have an unsorted list of numbers with no further information, it does take more than log(N) operation to find it, but in this case, we can use things such as a pre-sorting the list, or making an index. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can search much more quickly.\r\n\r\nBut there is still a limit on how fast an algorithm can search. If the number is n digits long, you need to read n digits from the input, which is n operations. So if you have a number N, it has floor(log(N)) + 1 digits, so you need at least floor(log(N)) + 1 operations. In complexity analysis, that&#39;s part of the order O(log(N)). You might argue that an algorithm can read entire numbers at once, but that&#39;s not true for really big numbers. A 64-bit computer, for example, has to read those one base 2^64 digit at a time.\r\n\r\nIn the linked text he limits himself to base 10, but that&#39;s just to simplify his explanation. This works the same if you use base 10, base 2, or base 2^64. After all, base_A_log(x) = base_B_log(x) * log(A)/log(B), so all logarithmic functions differ only by a constant factor. And O(C*log(N)) is the same order as O(log(N)).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959367/difficulty-understanding-the-relation-between-the-representation-of-a-number-and/57960210#57960210","title":"Difficulty understanding the relation between the representation of a number and the time complexity of searching for (0, N - 1)?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":130,"user_id":10475839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93dbce7d07f6dea45e979a5393e6df0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jon Doe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10475839/jon-doe"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568648941,"creation_date":1568648941,"answer_id":57960400,"question_id":57959367,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960400","body_markdown":"As an answer to your question:\r\n&quot;Why? Any search algorithm will need to choose one digit after another in its search for the number&quot;\r\n\r\nThe search algorithm that&#39;s O(log(n)) relies on the data being sorted, such that if it checks an element and that element&#39;s greater than the requested one, it can discard everything after that because all of those must also be greater.\r\n\r\nIn computer science log is typically considered to be log base 2 unless stated otherwise, I make it unique by calling it lg(n).\r\n\r\nFor your particular example, say you&#39;re searching for &quot;2&quot;\r\nA O(log(n)) algorithm will work similar to as follows.\r\n0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 9\r\n\r\nCheck the middle element, 4. Is 4 greater than 2? Yes. Therefore, disregard everything after 4 and check the middle between 0 and 4. 2 is the middle, we found that number in 2 steps. In the worst case it takes floor(lg(n)) + 1 steps, because each time you&#39;re dividing the number of unchecked elements by 2, the + 1 comes from edge cases. Also, floor(lg(n)) + 1 references the worst case scenario, not the best case scenario. In the best case, this particular algorithm could get the answer in 1 step.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959367/difficulty-understanding-the-relation-between-the-representation-of-a-number-and/57960400#57960400","title":"Difficulty understanding the relation between the representation of a number and the time complexity of searching for (0, N - 1)?"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":7183873,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50d45ed81e8d6b32a29b9174f2e2e85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thatguyjono","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7183873/thatguyjono"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57960400,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568648941,"creation_date":1568645401,"question_id":57959367,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57959367","body_markdown":"Please refer [here][1] to the direct resource that I don&#39;t understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-O-log-n-in-algorithms-to-1st-year-undergrad-student-Can-any-one-explain-it-with-mathematical-proof-for-log-n-complexity-by-taking-a-simple-example-like-Binary-search-and-simple-to-understand/answer/Gaurav-Sen-6?share=097b7b27&amp;srid=2k4y\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s take the number X = 245436, we can represent the following as X = 2 * 10^5 + 4 * 10^4 + 5 * 10^3 + 4 * 10^2 + 3 * 10^1 + 6 * 10^0 using decimal expansion.

Why? Any search algorithm will need to choose one digit after another in its search for the number.\r\n\r\nThe minimum number of digits it needs to choose is log(N). Hence the minimum number of operations taken to search for a number in a space of size N is log(N).\r\n\r\n**What I don&#39;t understand**\r\n\r\n&gt; This implies that, when asked to search for a number on the integer\r\n&gt; line, ranging from 0 to N - 1, we need at least log(N) tries to find\r\n&gt; it.

Any search algorithm will need to choose one digit after another\r\n&gt; in its search for the number.\r\n\r\nCan someone show me an illustration of this?\r\n\r\nIf we had 10 elements in an array (n = 10)\r\n\r\n0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 9\r\n\r\nAnd I&#39;m trying to find the what index gives me the value 5? That means I need log(10) tries to find it? Firstly log of base 10? That&#39;s log 10 = 1. I don&#39;t see how that makes sense? If I use base 2 I get = 3. \r\n\r\nIt means I&#39;m taking a minimum of 3 operations to find x? Why?

I find it much easier to manipulate the fully expanded loop, and translating to comprehension is trivial if the format is right. For example, your current attempt looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult = []\r\nfor x in a:\r\n    result.append((x, &#39;#&#39; + x))\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of having pairs in the list, you are trying to do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult = []\r\nfor x in a:\r\n    result.append(x)\r\n    result.append(&#39;#&#39; + x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this form does not lend itself to a one-line comprehension, we can get a hint from rephrasing it as\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult = []\r\nfor x in a:\r\n    result.extend((x, &#39;#&#39; + x))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this does exactly what you want, and `list.extend` is equivalent to a nested loop, you have your solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult = []\r\nfor x in a:\r\n    for y in (x, &#39;#&#39; + x):\r\n        result.append(y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nConverting this loop to a comprehension is almost as trivial as removing the colons and newlines, and putting some square brackets around it. Keep in mind that nested loops go into the comprehension in exactly the order that they appear when written out:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult = [y for for x in a for y in (x, &#39;#&#39; + x)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution itself is pretty trivial, but hopefully this explanation will help you think about how to convert loops into comprehensions more independently in the \r\nfuture.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959352/create-a-new-list-by-appending-prefix-on-each-value-of-old-list-in-python-single/57959566#57959566","title":"Create a new list by appending prefix on each value of old list in python single line"}],"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":4844789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GuByk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jai K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4844789/jai-k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46433,"user_id":2988730,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOX7t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mad Physicist","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2988730/mad-physicist"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57959404,"answer_count":4,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568646253,"creation_date":1568645360,"last_edit_date":1568646253,"question_id":57959352,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57959352","body_markdown":"    a = (&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    a = [(x, &#39;#&#39;

Go to the inspect tool and click on any on the input elements in the DOM (not on the page but in the dev tools panel). Once selected, type on the console `$0.value = &quot;test&quot;; $0.blur()` and press enter. This will reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nNote: $0 refers to the element you last clicked on in the Elements panel in DevTools.

to retrieve information about a user from an AWS SQL database. Once retrieving this information, I would like to pass the user ID to an Analytics page. I&#39;m building all of this on React. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m using &lt;code&gt;redux&lt;/code&gt; to do this, but I&#39;m having an issue with setting the userID inside the login page after getting the information from AWS. Here&#39;s how I&#39;m getting the information from AWS and trying to dispatch this new userID into the redux store.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\nimport { setUserId } from &#39;../redux/methods.js&#39;\r\n\r\n      axios.get(url+this.state.email)\r\n        .then(res =&gt; {\r\n          let userid = res.data.result.ID; //The user ID is in res.data.result.ID\r\n          this.props.dispatch(setUserId(userid));\r\n        })\r\n\r\nexport default connect()(Login)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not change the userID inside the redux store. So when I&#39;m accessing the value inside the analytics page, I&#39;m still getting the default state. \r\n\r\nHere is my &lt;code&gt;redux&lt;/code&gt; code\r\n\r\nThe reducer\r\n```\r\nconst userIdDefaultState = {\r\n  id: 0\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default (state = userIdDefaultState, action) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n  switch (action.type){\r\n\r\n    case &#39;SET_USER_ID&#39;:\r\n    return action.id;\r\n\r\n    default:\r\n      return state;\r\n\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet User ID Method\r\n```\r\nexport const setUserId = (id = &#39;&#39;) =&gt; ({\r\n  type: &#39;SET_USER_ID&#39;,\r\n  id\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how I&#39;m getting the data from the redux store inside the analytics page\r\n```\r\nlet userID = this.props.id;\r\n```\r\nThis is rendering the default information I&#39;m providing inside the store, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the setUserId method that&#39;s not working. \r\n\r\nInside index.js, I tried this and it dispatches the information to the store correctly so I&#39;m not sure why it isn&#39;t working inside of login. \r\n\r\n```\r\nstore.dispatch(setUserId({ id: 2}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny tips would be very much appreciated.

Electron itself uses a socket to communicate between the NodeJS process and the UI window. Sockets are incredibly fast, so you won&#39;t have to worry about the performance of the data transfer itself.\r\n\r\nPython has a built-in [library for sockets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) and for NodeJS, you have the [node-ipc library](http://riaevangelist.github.io/node-ipc/) (which is the one used by Electron for its internal socket). \r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll have then to define your data protocol. For example, you could send/receive JSON objects through the sockets, which is quite trivial to encode/decode both in Python and NodeJS. But if performance matters, you can do more advanced things. \r\n\r\nYou also have to think about how you manage the processes themselves. Indeed, you&#39;ll have to ensure that the Electron app will spawn the Python process when started. And make sure it kills it when quitted (for example, by sending a message through the socket!).\r\n\r\nMy answer is quite abstract, but I hope it will give you some insights to get started.

It is DtSearch_8025 build. It works fine but not as good as ElasticSearch, but it works.\r\n\r\nI am facing an issue with updating Index(For creating a new Index it works fine). We have an API(SOAP) call for updating the indices. We are sending the XML in the body of the POST request and the XML contains the Id of the files for which the index needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nThe Application and DtSearch Engine are two different processes. The application receives the requests(which are synchronous) and sends an acknowledgement if the Id in the request is present and writes that XML into a folder with Id as file Name.This folder is watched by DtSearch Engine and whenever it gets any file modified then it starts to update the index. \r\n\r\nSince my application and dtSearch engine are not dependent on each other the application writes the XML requesta and creates the files and sends the acknowledgement, if the Ids are present. But that creates a problem with the DtSearch Engine and we get the error as &quot;Access is Denied as the folder is accessed by some other process&quot;\r\n\r\nWe have tried to put a C# lock when DtSearch Engine tries to update the Index.\r\n\r\nWhen we tried to update the index through our local client this works for every file. But when we moved it to QA and request comes from different servers then it gives &quot;Access Denied issue&quot; for some requests. \r\n \r\nThis solution has improved the performance but then also we are getting for a few request &quot;Access Denied issue&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis the previous code block that updated the index \r\n```\r\npublic void Run(TaskArgs args)\r\n{\r\n   submissionArgs = (IndexUpdateSubmissionArgs)args.Submission;\r\n\r\n   ValidateArgs(submissionArgs);\r\n\r\n   IndexDataItem existingItem = _indexer.BackupIndexer.Recover(new[] { submissionArgs.Doi }).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n   ValidateUpdate(args, existingItem);\r\n\r\n   UpdateItemFields(existingItem, submissionArgs);\r\n\r\n   existingItem = ShapeFields(existingItem, args);\r\n\r\n   _indexer.Index(existingItem);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the updated block\r\n```\r\npublic void Run(TaskArgs args)\r\n{\r\n   submissionArgs = (IndexUpdateSubmissionArgs)args.Submission;\r\n\r\n   ValidateArgs(submissionArgs);\r\n\r\n   IndexDataItem existingItem = _indexer.BackupIndexer.Recover(new[] { submissionArgs.Doi }).FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n   ValidateUpdate(args, existingItem);\r\n\r\n   UpdateItemFields(existingItem, submissionArgs);\r\n\r\n   existingItem = ShapeFields(existingItem, args);\r\n\r\n   lock (_indexLock)\r\n   {\r\n       _indexer.Index(existingItem);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan anyone help with this.

Then you could deploy once for everyone.

They each have their own config .env file, using a different port, different database, and different log file. They also each have their own reverse proxy through Apache.\r\n\r\nEverything else, all the back-end source code and node_modules are the same.\r\nThis means that whenever we need to update the back-end, we have to redeploy (i.e. rsync) each instance. It works but it&#39;s not super efficient, especially as we add more and more customers.\r\n\r\nIs there a way we could maybe deploy the source code in a single template API and have each instance point to it except for the .env file? We could symlink everything to this template (except for the .env file) but there&#39;s a lot of files and this doesn&#39;t seem much better..

ALSO if you change the data property, maybe through a method or API call, then the textbox will also reflect that data change, hence the two-way data binding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959210/understanding-vue-js-v-model-two-way-binding/57959431#57959431","title":"Understanding Vue JS v-model two way binding"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":7344314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b758dd8322df54678979c104f56b420?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"henhen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7344314/henhen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568649267,"post_id":57960328,"comment_id":102332649,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959210/understanding-vue-js-v-model-two-way-binding/57960328#comment102332649_57960328"},{"owner":{"reputation":30767,"user_id":392102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0L1n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roy J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/392102/roy-j"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":181,"user_id":7344314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b758dd8322df54678979c104f56b420?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"henhen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7344314/henhen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568650058,"post_id":57960328,"comment_id":102333010,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959210/understanding-vue-js-v-model-two-way-binding/57960328#comment102333010_57960328"},{"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":7344314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b758dd8322df54678979c104f56b420?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"henhen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7344314/henhen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568651251,"post_id":57960328,"comment_id":102333496,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959210/understanding-vue-js-v-model-two-way-binding/57960328#comment102333496_57960328"},{"owner":{"reputation":30767,"user_id":392102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0L1n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roy J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/392102/roy-j"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":181,"user_id":7344314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b758dd8322df54678979c104f56b420?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"henhen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7344314/henhen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568662392,"post_id":57960328,"comment_id":102337770,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959210/understanding-vue-js-v-model-two-way-binding/57960328#comment102337770_57960328"},{"owner":{"reputation":30767,"user_id":392102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0L1n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roy J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/392102/roy-j"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":181,"user_id":7344314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b758dd8322df54678979c104f56b420?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"henhen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7344314/henhen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568662987,"post_id":57960328,"comment_id":102337976,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959210/understanding-vue-js-v-model-two-way-binding/57960328#comment102337976_57960328"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":30767,"user_id":392102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0L1n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roy J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/392102/roy-j"},"last_editor":{"reputation":30767,"user_id":392102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0L1n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roy J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/392102/roy-j"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568662906,"last_edit_date":1568662906,"creation_date":1568648650,"answer_id":57960328,"question_id":57959210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960328","body_markdown":"In the example code you give, you have a component whose template includes a `v-model` on a native input:\r\n\r\n    template: `&lt;input v-model=&quot;myObj&quot; &gt;`\r\n\r\nThat means that the `input` is (two-way) bound to `myObj`: changes to `myObj`&#39;s values will reflect in the input, and changes to the input will update the data item.\r\n\r\nYou then have an instance of that component with a `v-model` on it. The component will receive a `value` prop, and is expected to `emit` `input` events to achieve two-way binding. [`v-model` on components is described here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Using-v-model-on-Components).\r\n\r\nYou do not have &quot;an input tied to two values&quot;, but you might have a pointless binding, since the two things you bound are (apparently) unrelated. What you _might_ want is for your component to act as a pass-through for the value, so that you can treat it almost like a native `input`. [This example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44852573/392102) does that.\r\n\r\nThe [custom input in the docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Using-v-model-on-Components) puts a `v-model` on the component and uses explicit binding for `value` and `emit input` from the native `input` element. You _can_ replace those with a `v-model` to a settable computed, as I did in the example I linked in the paragraph above. The `get` returns `value` and the `set` performs the `emit`.

I find this very confusing and I think it may be a misunderstanding of &quot;two way binding&quot;. How do you have an input tied to two values.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n//v-model in template\r\n\r\n    const myCustomInput = (&#39;my-custom-input&#39;, {\r\n      data() {\r\n        return {\r\n          myObj: &#39;hello&#39;\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      template: `&lt;input v-model=&quot;myObj&quot; &gt;`\r\n    });\r\n\r\n//v-model in component\r\n\r\n    &lt;my-custom-input v-model=&quot;someOtherObj.str&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nI have seen examples of having two v-models like this with different values both defined at the template level and component. \r\n\r\nHowever, when looking at this [SO post][1], the answer by @asemahle seems a lot more logical. Furthermore the official Vue docs does not even have 2 separate v-models on the template and the component\r\n[Vue JS component basics][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the latter examples, it seems a lot more logical as there is only one v-model defined and tied to the input component rather than two.\r\n\r\nIs the first example incorrect? And if it&#39;s not can someone explain more clearly how that works.

After re-navigating to the 4th row (i.e the swiped row, image: https://ibb.co/ZJk00h9), when navigating to the swipe action buttons themselves, it seems as if their frame isn&#39;t well defined, the screen scrolls too much to the right (in this case) beyond all the content, as demonstrated here: https://ibb.co/gyBFhJm\r\n\r\n3. When navigating back and forth between the adjacent rows to the swiped row, the swipe action buttons become inaccessible altogether.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d really appreciate any help on the subject, from people who surely know much more about it than I do.\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959201/voiceover-accessibility-not-working-with-oob-uitableview-swipe-actions","title":"VoiceOver accessibility not working with OOB UITableView swipe actions"},{"tags":["scala","function"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5892,"user_id":4111404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kzPWJe4orps/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/L-IQwWBiNJU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Luis Miguel Mej&#237;a Su&#225;rez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4111404/luis-miguel-mej%c3%ada-su%c3%a1rez"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568645291,"post_id":57959199,"comment_id":102330488,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959199/accessing-hashmap-list-element-for-a-repeated-int-parameter#comment102330488_57959199"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11280992,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZfeY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BarnabasScottimanne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11280992/barnabasscottimanne"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5892,"user_id":4111404,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kzPWJe4orps/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/L-IQwWBiNJU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Luis Miguel Mej&#237;a Su&#225;rez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4111404/luis-miguel-mej%c3%ada-su%c3%a1rez"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568645387,"post_id":57959199,"comment_id":102330553,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959199/accessing-hashmap-list-element-for-a-repeated-int-parameter#comment102330553_57959199"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11280992,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZfeY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BarnabasScottimanne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11280992/barnabasscottimanne"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568645710,"post_id":57959396,"comment_id":102330741,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959199/accessing-hashmap-list-element-for-a-repeated-int-parameter/57959396#comment102330741_57959396"},{"owner":{"reputation":2910,"user_id":497398,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":41,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1dac2c810e7a6d0787aadc020caa4d71?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mfirry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/497398/mfirry"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11280992,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZfeY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BarnabasScottimanne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11280992/barnabasscottimanne"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568723047,"post_id":57959396,"comment_id":102358020,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959199/accessing-hashmap-list-element-for-a-repeated-int-parameter/57959396#comment102358020_57959396"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2910,"user_id":497398,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":41,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1dac2c810e7a6d0787aadc020caa4d71?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mfirry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/497398/mfirry"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568645487,"creation_date":1568645487,"answer_id":57959396,"question_id":57959199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57959396","body_markdown":"So you&#39;re mixing two things that might seem similar but are not.\r\n\r\nHaving a map `String -&gt; List[Int]` obviously means that doing `gradeMap(&quot;John&quot;)` gives you back a `List[Int]` (namely `List(10, 30, 60, 78, 90, 45, 33)`).\r\n\r\nYour `Count` function instead asks for a so-called `varargs` parameter.

Thank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959199/accessing-hashmap-list-element-for-a-repeated-int-parameter","title":"Accessing HashMap List element for a Repeated Int parameter"},{"tags":["c","linear-search"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32076,"user_id":7536,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69aa4b5b81a1d2120c98ceed09446489?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"eduffy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7536/eduffy"},"edited":false,"score":6,"creation_date":1568644903,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102330263,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102330263_57959198"},{"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":5119682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ae07829babd0f769f5151cf80541bc8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Xxx Xxx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5119682/xxx-xxx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568645031,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102330331,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102330331_57959198"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568674253,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102341424,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102341424_57959198"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568674306,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102341431,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102341431_57959198"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568674513,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102341473,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102341473_57959198"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568674717,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102341526,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102341526_57959198"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568674920,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102341573,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102341573_57959198"},{"owner":{"reputation":12325,"user_id":3629249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000228362830/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3629249","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3629249/user3629249"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568675162,"post_id":57959198,"comment_id":102341617,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959198/why-the-for-loop-isnt-getting-executedlinear-search#comment102341617_57959198"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":771,"user_id":11699772,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd368b24a3051afd4ebf0196148b6e11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"XBlueCode","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11699772/xbluecode"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568644997,"creation_date":1568644997,"answer_id":57959252,"question_id":57959198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57959252","body_markdown":"You&#39;re not entering the for loop because of the condition `c &gt;

It depends on the field of view angle and the aspect ratio.  \r\nSee also [THREE.js PerspectiveCamera focalLength off by a factor of two, inconsistent with FOV](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53881693/three-js-perspectivecamera-focallength-off-by-a-factor-of-two-inconsistent-with/53887029#53887029).\r\n\r\n[![][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe relation between Z-distance and size for a filed of view `fov_y`, at perspective projection is:\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\ndepht_s = Math.tan(fov_y/2.0 * Math.PI/180.0) * 2.0;\r\n```\r\nThe projected size of the object on the viewport depends on the filed of view and the depth. This cause that a 3 dimensional object never can &quot;look&quot; the same, when filed of view changes. You can define a plane in a certain distance (depth) and find a new distance, so that the projection of the object doesn&#39;t change in size, for exactly that depth. Of course the projected size of the object &quot;before&quot; and &quot;behind&quot; this certain distance will (at least slightly) change. See also [How to switch between Perspective and Orthographic cameras keeping size of desired object](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48187416/how-to-switch-between-perspective-and-orthographic-cameras-keeping-size-of-desir/48188014#48188014) respectively [Transpose z-position from perspective to orthographic camera in three.js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46829113/transpose-z-position-from-perspective-to-orthographic-camera-in-three-js/47053505#47053505) .\r\n\r\nSee the illustration. While the top point of the cube can&#39;t be seen from the camera when the object is near to the camera, it can be seen when it is far away:\r\n\r\n[![][2]][2]\r\n[![][3]][3]\r\n\r\nThe initial filed of view is 4.0. So the ration between Z-distance and size is:\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\nlet init_depht_s    = Math.tan(4.0/2.0 * Math.PI/180.0) * 2.0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the filed of view is animated, then the current ration between Z-distance and size is:\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\nlet current_depht_s = Math.tan(progress.fov/2.0 * Math.PI/180.0) * 2.0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you&#39;ve to define a distance, which has to &quot;keep size&quot;. The initial distance to the center of the cube is 14.0, so I&#39;ll choose this for the reference distance. This distance has to be scaled by the ration `init_depht_s / current_depht_s`, then the projection of the cube (exactly at this distance) keeps its size:\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\ncamera.position.set(0, 0, 14 * init_depht_s / current_depht_s);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the example, which is based on your original code (I&#39;ve change the near plane to 0.1, else the cube would be clipped, because final distance is below 1.0):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let W = window.innerWidth, H = window.innerHeight;\r\n            \r\n    let renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true, alpha: true } );\r\n    renderer.setPixelRatio( window.devicePixelRatio );\r\n    renderer.setSize( W, H );\r\n\r\n    document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );\r\n\r\n    let camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 4, W/H, 0.1, 100 );\r\n    let scene = new THREE.Scene();\r\n\r\n    camera.position.set(0,0,14);\r\n    camera.lookAt(0,0,0);\r\n\r\n    let geo = new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\r\n    let mat = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();\r\n    let mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geo, mat);\r\n    mesh.rotation.set(0.2,0.4,-0.1);\r\n    scene.add(mesh);\r\n\r\n    renderer.render(scene, camera);\r\n\r\n    let progress = {};\r\n    progress.fov = 4;\r\n\r\n    TweenMax.to(progress, 2,{\r\n        fov:45,\r\n        onUpdate:function(){\r\n            let init_depht_s    = Math.tan(4.0/2.0 * Math.PI/180.0) * 2.0;\r\n            let current_depht_s = Math.tan(progress.fov/2.0 * Math.PI/180.0) * 2.0;\r\n\r\n            camera.position.set(0, 0, 14 * init_depht_s / current_depht_s);\r\n            camera.lookAt(0,0,0);\r\n            camera.updateProjectionMatrix();\r\n            camera.fov = progress.fov;\r\n            \r\n            renderer.render(scene, camera);\r\n            \r\n        },\r\n        repeat:-1,\r\n        ease:Power3.easeInOut\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    body{margin:0;padding:0;overflow:hidden;background: #666;}\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/2.1.3/TweenMax.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/108/three.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ic2rN.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/L0Vnw.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/A4quN.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959190/three-js-update-the-fov-value-of-a-perspective-camera-and-keep-the-same-camera-d/57977155#57977155","title":"THREE.JS update the fov value of a perspective camera and keep the same camera distance"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":5069236,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10206760906238869/picture?type=large","display_name":"Micha&#235;l Garcia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5069236/micha%c3%abl-garcia"},"last_editor":{"reputation":55577,"user_id":128511,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KwGaJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"gman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/128511/gman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57977155,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568785520,"creation_date":1568644797,"last_edit_date":1568768814,"question_id":57959190,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57959190","body_markdown":"I would like to modify the FOV value of my camera during an animation.\r\nUnfortunately as soon as I implement the FOV value, I can observe my scene becoming smaller. \r\n\r\nSo I&#39;ve been wondering, what&#39;s the mathematic link between FOV value and the distance position of a perspective camera ? \r\n\r\nThe idea is to have the same scene (same size by modifying the camera position) while the FOV value is changing.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT 1 :**\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a snippet that illustrates my issue : When I implement the FOV value of my camera (from 4 to 45), the distance between my square and my camera changes.
