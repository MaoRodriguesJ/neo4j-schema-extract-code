am trying to create a video slideshow, operated by next/prev buttons, however, only the first click event works.

I want to increase its speed by transforming it into a multithreaded routine, where each thread takes a named file and apply to it my analysis routine. I am working on an HPC server, allowing me to ask for a certain number of cores, thus at the end, I would have 1 core working on 1 file in parallel with X number of cores.  \r\n\r\nI read a few examples about multithreading and I am well aware of the problem about variables being shared between thread. My question is how does each thread handle its own &quot;thread variables&quot;? If I define a variable inside the thread function, will it be shared with other threads? Do I have to use the lock condition for this to work (if so, threading would not be useful since each thread would need to wait until the completion of all the other threads I believe) \r\n\r\nBelow is my attempt to thread my analysis routine. The analysis without the threading is working, each of the &#39;import glob_**&#39; modules is functioning I coded and that I am importing here.  \r\n\r\nThe main_task function is the thread launcher: I have X cores, I create X threads and then assign each thread to the corresponding task, and I do that until all the files (stored in a list &quot;files_to_analyse&quot;) are treated. The length_analyse is just the length of this list.\r\n\r\nThe thread_task function is the analysis routine that I tried to transform: taking a file name stored in a list (files_to_analyse) and calling the block modules I coded and transformed in global functions. In this function I create variables that will store the information of the simulation that is being treated, thus if there are some errors with these variables, it would lead to analysis errors (for example the file variable, or the Directory). \r\n\r\nMy question here is: will variables that I define within the thread_task function be shared with other threads, thus needing the threading.Lock() function to be invoked? Or can I remove the Lock condition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport math as mm\r\nimport glob\r\nimport sys\r\nimport os\r\nimport shutil\r\nimport threading\r\n\r\n\r\nimport

the end it&#39;s been a combination of issues, but I&#39;ve finally surrounded the problem to a WP plugin, that might not have PHP 7.3 (probably 7.2 neither, since I tried with it) support. The plugin folder is cystats.\r\n\r\nSo somehow at the beginning there was an incompatibility with this WP blog that had to do with mysql extension being enabled. After turning it off, it still didn&#39;t work, but it seems I didn&#39;t restart Apache, so I was seeing the old `Call to undefined function mysql_connect()` error.\r\n\r\nLater, something messed up with all WP blogs (disabling mysqli extension), and finally, after having the original WP blog broken alone, I realized the error wasn&#39;t the same. Now it was:\r\n\r\n    Got error &#39;PHP message: PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function mysql_error() in /var/www/vhosts/mywpsite.com/httpdocs/wp-content/plugins/cystats/includes/cystats.class.php:1455\r\n\r\nSo finally everything is solved, clearly WP is compatible with PHP 7.3, and `mysql` extension must be disabled to work well with it. Some plugins might not be up to date, and that&#39;s the reason why they don&#39;t work with PHP 7.3 and why they worked on PHP 5.6.\r\n\r\nSo after migrating a WP blog to a new setup, plugins can ruin the migration if you don&#39;t figure it out.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help with the comments, they were definitely helpful as well.\r\n\r\nAs I read here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44841823/wordpress-fatal-error-uncaught-error-call-to-undefined-function-mysql-connect it could have seemed that adding this line: `define(&#39;WP_USE_EXT_MYSQL&#39;, true);` would have made the plugin error go away, but the undefined mysql_connect error comes back if I set this define.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327742/wordpress-blog-with-technical-difficulties-after-migrating-to-a-php-7-3-server-a/58329063#58329063","title":"Wordpress blog with technical difficulties after migrating to a PHP 7.3 server and even disabling all plugins"}],"owner":{"reputation":1612,"user_id":973919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/872fbcf803b76777b0e48dc58957f8ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"xarlymg89","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/973919/xarlymg89"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1612,"user_id":973919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/872fbcf803b76777b0e48dc58957f8ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"xarlymg89","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/973919/xarlymg89"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570738604,"accepted_answer_id":58329063,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570739876,"creation_date":1570726584,"last_edit_date":1570738341,"question_id":58327742,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58327742","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to complete a migration to a new server that has PHP 7.3.

Since it actually works great for other WP blogs, and for Plesk too.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve read in other posts that there was a possibility that my wp-config.php file was missing this line: `define(&#39;WP_USE_EXT_MYSQL&#39;, true);` however that&#39;s not the case.\r\n\r\nAnd I&#39;ve also read somewhere else, that the new server could have missing the `nd_mysqli` PHP extension. But that&#39;s not the case either. It&#39;s enabled. And I&#39;ve desactivated the `mysqli` PHP extension. After that, I&#39;ve restarted apache2 with no luck either.\r\n\r\nSo...what am I missing? It&#39;s really curious that deactivating the plugins doesn&#39;t make the WP site work either.

support an older c++ v100 security system.  Most of the xml stored in the database in a byte array (blob data), is easy enough to decrypt with UTF-8.  However, we have a couple places where I have been unable to figure out how to decrypt the byte array to anything useful, using C# 4.7.  After some studying of the data yesterday, it was determined that the data uses some form of encoding called &#39;UCS-2 LE BOM&#39;.\r\n\r\nI almost have to assume this is some form of Unicode... but I have yet to get that binary array to decrypt to anything decipherable. \r\n\r\nIf you have any sort of example code that would me the readable string, it would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nThus far I have tried all forms of encoding offered in C#, but the results are all cryptic.\r\n\r\nThe xml stored in each record, is like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;COMMAND_BLOCK&gt; \r\n       &lt;COMMAND Workstation=&#39;{Workstation}&#39; Source=&quot;ServiceManager&quot; Target=&quot;{Unit:|SELECT DISTINCT [Name],[Address] FROM [MasterControllers] WHERE [Address] LIKE &#39;{Workstation}.R%&#39;}&quot; Command=&quot;50001&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/COMMAND_BLOCK&gt;\r\n\r\nI am currently only trying to get the stored byte array to be a string.

I&#39;ve tried the following:\r\n                    \r\n    var xml = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(_commandObjectList[i].ImageData);\r\n    var xml2 = Encoding.UTF32.GetString(_commandObjectList[i].ImageData);\r\n    var xml3 = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(_commandObjectList[i].ImageData);\r\n    var xml4 = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(_commandObjectList[i].ImageData);\r\n    var xml5 = Encoding.BigEndianUnicode.GetString(_commandObjectList[i].ImageData);\r\n    var xml6 = Encoding.Default.GetString(_commandObjectList[i].ImageData);\r\n    var xml7 = Encoding.UTF7.GetString(_commandObjectList[i].ImageData);\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Returned values][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzB7a.png\r\n\r\nRaw blob data stored in Sql Server Table:\r\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link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327724/c-xml-decryption-from-binary-array-data-stored-as-ucs-2-le-bom","title":"C# XML Decryption from binary array data stored as &#39;UCS-2 LE BOM&#39;"},{"tags":["angular","file","upload","limit","angular-file-upload"],"owner":{"reputation":197,"user_id":4691429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/453f38b92eafb8e6d83f353dd116e2f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jeremy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4691429/jeremy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570726517,"creation_date":1570726517,"question_id":58327723,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58327723","body_markdown":"Currently using [angular-file][1] library to help me upload files in my project. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing i have not been able to do so far is to set the queue limit.\r\n\r\nI want to set the queue limit to one and i havent been able to set that with the API that is provided.

This is designed to allow &#39;comments&#39; that describe the PEM data, but also works for _other_ types of PEM data or just arbitrary data not related to the PEM data at all. In particular `PEM_read_X509` will read the first block of type CERTIFICATE, X509 CERTIFICATE, or TRUSTED CERTIFICATE and ignore anything and everything else, including a private key block.\r\n\r\nSimilarly `PEM_read_[algo_or_PKCS8]PrivateKey` will read the first block of type [ENCRYPTED|RSA|DSA|EC] PRIVATE KEY and ignore everything else, but fail if you tried to read a specific algorithm and the (first) private key block found was a different type. (It also fails, of course, if a valid block is found but is encrypted by a password and you don&#39;t provide the correct password either as an argument or via a callback. And if no valid block is found.)\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if by &#39;CA cert&#39; you mean a cert _for_ a CA, or a cert _issued by_ a CA and _for_ an end-entity like your webserver or mailbox. Except for a personal/local or test CA you or a colleague or your organization set up, most ordinary users should have the certs for one or more CAs but never their privatekeys.

The best accuracy it can reach is 0.2 which is random selection from 5 categories. The model can start to learn &quot;layer1&quot; if we manually assign the weights of &quot;layer2&quot; and &quot;mid_pos&quot; layer.\r\n\r\nMy question is: 1. why this simple model fail to learn from example? 2. how to improve its learning ability?

That is where your error comes from. By adding `x` to your lambda that took care of the event by allow one positional argument. The reason your code did not work without the properly formatted lambda is due having parenthesis `cmb2.config()` and the other config. When you assign some command/function to a `bind()` you need to save a reference to the command/function rather then calling it. This is done by not using parenthesis but at the same time you cannot pass arguments. That&#39;s what the lambda allows.\r\n\r\nExample with lambda:\r\n\r\n    import tkinter as tk\r\n    from tkinter import ttk\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class Win(tk.Tk):\r\n        opt_dic1 = {&#39;Option1&#39;: [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;], &#39;Option2&#39;: [&#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;]}\r\n        opt_dic2 = {&#39;Option3&#39;: [&#39;5&#39;, &#39;6&#39;], &#39;Option4&#39;: [&#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;]}\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            super().__init__()\r\n            top = tk.Frame(self)\r\n            btm = tk.Frame(self)\r\n            cmb1 = ttk.Combobox(top, values=list(Win.opt_dic1.keys()))\r\n            cmb2 = ttk.Combobox(top)\r\n            cmb3 = ttk.Combobox(btm, values=list(Win.opt_dic2.keys()))\r\n            cmb4 = ttk.Combobox(btm)\r\n            top.pack(side=&#39;top&#39;)\r\n            btm.pack(side=&#39;bottom&#39;)\r\n            cmb1.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            cmb2.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            cmb3.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            cmb4.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            cmb1.current(0)\r\n            cmb3.current(0)\r\n            cmb1.bind(&#39;&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelected&gt;&gt;&#39;, lambda x: cmb2.config(values=Win.opt_dic1[cmb1.get()]))\r\n            cmb3.bind(&#39;&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelected&gt;&gt;&#39;, lambda x: cmb4.config(values=Win.opt_dic2[cmb3.get()]))\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n        Win().mainloop()\r\n\r\nExample without lambda:\r\n\r\n\r\n    import tkinter as tk\r\n    from tkinter import ttk\r\n\r\n\r\n    class Win(tk.Tk):\r\n        opt_dic1 = {&#39;Option1&#39;: [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;], &#39;Option2&#39;: [&#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;]}\r\n        opt_dic2 = {&#39;Option3&#39;: [&#39;5&#39;, &#39;6&#39;], &#39;Option4&#39;: [&#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;]}\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            super().__init__()\r\n            top = tk.Frame(self)\r\n            btm = tk.Frame(self)\r\n            self.cmb1 = ttk.Combobox(top, values=list(Win.opt_dic1.keys()))\r\n            self.cmb2 = ttk.Combobox(top)\r\n            self.cmb3 = ttk.Combobox(btm, values=list(Win.opt_dic2.keys()))\r\n            self.cmb4 = ttk.Combobox(btm)\r\n            top.pack(side=&#39;top&#39;)\r\n            btm.pack(side=&#39;bottom&#39;)\r\n            self.cmb1.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            self.cmb2.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            self.cmb3.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            self.cmb4.pack(side=&#39;left&#39;)\r\n            self.cmb1.current(0)\r\n            self.cmb3.current(0)\r\n            self.cmb1.bind(&#39;&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelected&gt;&gt;&#39;, self.config_cmb2)\r\n            self.cmb3.bind(&#39;&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelected&gt;&gt;&#39;, self.config_cmb4)\r\n    \r\n        def config_cmb2(self, _=None):\r\n            self.cmb2.config(values=Win.opt_dic1[self.cmb1.get()])\r\n    \r\n        def config_cmb4(self, _=None):\r\n            self.cmb4.config(values=Win.opt_dic2[self.cmb3.get()])\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n        Win().mainloop()\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327704/how-to-bind-functions-to-ttk-combobox-uniquely-for-every-change-in-value-of-comb/58328221#58328221","title":"How to bind Functions to Ttk Combobox uniquely for every change in value of Combobox"}],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":10078976,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ss6Gv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sagar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10078976/sagar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58328221,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570728451,"creation_date":1570726447,"question_id":58327704,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58327704","body_markdown":"I want to link Comboboxs in a pair uniquely, such as the values in a Combobox depends upon the current value in another Combobox.\r\nBut i fail to get it to work.

It is also plausible that occasionally a user will decide the record should not be added and thus will need to close without saving.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327697/how-do-i-add-an-auto-populated-form-record-created-from-another-record-to-a-ta","title":"How do I add an auto-populated form record (created from another record) to a table in access?"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":52335,"user_id":1570000,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9vF6V.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Cappelletti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1570000/john-cappelletti"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570726751,"post_id":58327695,"comment_id":103013867,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327695/pass-xml-variable-from-a-stored-proc-to-another-stored-proc-in-sql-server#comment103013867_58327695"},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user8863243"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":52335,"user_id":1570000,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9vF6V.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Cappelletti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1570000/john-cappelletti"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570731074,"post_id":58327695,"comment_id":103015712,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327695/pass-xml-variable-from-a-stored-proc-to-another-stored-proc-in-sql-server#comment103015712_58327695"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3114,"user_id":2961734,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79f0229603e30b04fddc833d85afc9e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Laughing Vergil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2961734/laughing-vergil"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570726797,"creation_date":1570726797,"answer_id":58327791,"question_id":58327695,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58327791","body_markdown":"The best way to do this is to use the [sp_executesql][1] stored procedure instead of using the simle `exec` command.

I have a bar chart with the hospital type, services provided, physicians and their scheduled and actual minutes. \r\n\r\nwhat I am trying to do is to get a calculated field that defines the 20% efficiency above or below the scheduled minutes so I can put that in the color session to tell that story of how many physicians are efficient, not efficient or below standard If any.\r\n\r\nIn the calculated field, I used \r\n\r\n    sum([room minutes scheduled])/sum([sum of room minutes actual])&gt;1.2 then &quot;Not efficient\r\n    Elseif sum([room minutes scheduled])/sum([sum of room minutes actual])&gt;=0.8 then &quot;Efficient&quot;\r\n    Else &quot;Below Par&quot;\r\n    End\r\n\r\nIts still doesn&#39;t give me the right colors to represent those that are efficient or not efficient. I believe I did something wrong.

Normally you would use the bind-value attribute on an input element as shown below, however, this is not recommended as you will only be able to read the value and NOT update the UI by changing the boolean value via code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; @bind-value=&quot;@item.Selected&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\nInstead, use the @bind syntax for checkboxes, which is much more robust and will work both ways (changing the bound boolean value from code &amp; interacting with the checkbox on the UI). See the syntax below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; @bind=&quot;@item.Selected&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\nThe bind attribute will automatically bind your boolean value to the &quot;checked&quot; property of the html element. \r\n\r\nAlso make sure you are binding to the &quot;Selected&quot; property rather than the &quot;Value&quot; property. \r\n\r\nUsing the built in bind will prevent the need to manually setup events as you did in your answer. You can also get rid of the if/else block and merge your code into a single code flow since you are now binding to the boolean rather than setting the checked property manually. If you still need to tap into an event to fire off some process(maybe hiding parts of UI on checking a box), I&#39;d suggest using the onclick event and manually passing in the multiselect Item for each line. Here is the final code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@foreach(var item in list)\r\n{\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; @bind=&quot;item.Selected&quot; @onclick=&quot;(()=&gt;handleClick(item))&quot; /&gt;\r\n}\r\n@foreach(var item in list.Where(x=&gt;x.Selected))\r\n{\r\n    &lt;p&gt; Item @item.Text is Selected&lt;/p&gt;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    MultiSelectList list = new MultiSelectList(new List&lt;Car&gt; { new Car { Year = 2019, Make = &quot;Honda&quot;, Model = &quot;Accord&quot; }, new Car { Make = &quot;Honda&quot;, Model = &quot;Civic&quot;, Year = 2019 } });\r\n\r\n    private void handleClick(SelectListItem item)\r\n    {        \r\n        //Do something crazy\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327640/blazor-binding-to-a-multiselectlist-ideally-with-a-checkbox/58355595#58355595","title":"Blazor: binding to a MultiSelectList (ideally with a checkbox)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1191,"user_id":584714,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ab2509d2e3e3d0c9eed5dc4f57d8b30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"DrGriff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/584714/drgriff"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58346898,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570893599,"creation_date":1570726146,"question_id":58327640,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58327640","body_markdown":"Experimenting with Blazor (Server, if that makes any difference), and I&#39;m having difficulty getting binding to a MultiSelectList to work....\r\n\r\nBit of background: I&#39;m dealing with EF Core and have a Many-to-Many relationship, let&#39;s say between people and cars.

However, I am not able to search by anything in that column.  \r\n\r\nNot the answer I am looking for:  \r\nI know if it was the other way around where the help_text was a ForeignKey on Foo I could do something like `foo__help_text`, but that is not how my models are set up (and can not change). \r\n\r\nDesired behavior:    \r\nUse the search box to search for help text (not just env and job_name).  \r\n\r\nPossible Solution (that I need help with):  \r\nI suspect that [get_search_results][2] might be what I need, but I don&#39;t understand how to implement it for my use case.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  \r\nThe closest I can get is searching for a number(aka a specific PK that I know exists) and getting that search result.

Our structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n-\tWie have 8 main modules (mod_X)\r\n-\tEvery module has 20-40 subdirs, each with 5 – 100 cpp files; separated in libs and executables.\r\n-\t&lt;code&gt;mod_INFRA/apps/myparser&lt;/code&gt; has a target that creates a code generator executable\r\n  -\tWhich depends only on &lt;code&gt;mod_INFRA/libs/A&lt;/code&gt;\r\n-\tThe code generator must be applied to certain files (*.rules) in numerous subdirs in **all** modules and subdirs, including mod_INFRA itself.\r\n-\tThe generated source code must be compiled and considered with the target in &lt;code&gt;subdir_X&lt;/code&gt;\r\n\r\n**What I’d like to achieve:**\r\n\r\n-\tIn &lt;code&gt;root/meson.build&lt;/code&gt;define a common and re-usable &lt;code&gt;custom_target&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;generator&lt;/code&gt; that I can invoke/apply in every module and subdir as needed.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\n-\tIn &lt;code&gt;root/meson.build&lt;/code&gt;, we define common variables such as compiler flags etc., and we do &lt;code&gt;subdir(‘mod_INFRA’)&lt;/code&gt; for each module.

You need to have the file with the key in the directory you are trying to use ssh with the -i option.\r\n\r\nThe more typical way to use ssh is in your home directory (You can get to it with cd ~ in most linux like systems) You create a directory called .ssh and store your keys in there and configure a file to know how to access them.\r\n\r\nAlso I believe there is now native SSH support in Windows, so you probably don&#39;t need to jump through the putty hoops anymore.\r\n\r\nIf the key file isn&#39;t on the server you will need to copy it to the Ubuntu server using scp\r\n\r\nHope this helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327597/putty-aws-no-such-file-or-directory/58327829#58327829","title":"PuTTy AWS no such file or directory"}],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":11865845,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CO7J2olZJzM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAIg8/9pROx6wG_gQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Peter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11865845/peter"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58327829,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570726962,"creation_date":1570725965,"question_id":58327597,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58327597","body_markdown":"# PuTTy AWS no such file or directory\r\n\r\n* 1 - created the ec2 instance at AWS ubuntu\r\n* 2 - downloaded the key (.pem file)\r\n* 3 - since Im using windows, I downloaded PuTTy\r\n* 4 - generate a putty file\r\n* 5 - Im logged in with Putty ```(login as: ubuntu\r\nAuthenticating with public key &quot;imported-openssh-key&quot;\r\n)```\r\n\r\n ---\r\n* 6 - Now need to run:\r\n```\r\ncd path/to/my/dev/folder/\r\nchmod 400 JupyterKey.pem\r\nssh ubuntu@11-111-111 -i JupyterKey.pem\r\n```\r\n## # Doesn&#39;t work!!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### so Im conected to putty  and now Im trying open the key(automation.pem) to conect with server AWS to start build my jupyter notebooks\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# First attempt\r\n\r\n[ec2-user@ip-111-11-11-111 ~]$ cd \\Users\\pb\\Desktop\\pYTHON\\AWS\\server\r\n\r\n-bash: cd: UserspbDesktoppYTHONAWSserver: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Second attempt\r\n\r\n[ec2-user@ip-111-11-11-111 ~]$ ssh -i &quot;imported-openssh-key&quot; ubuntu@ec2-54-67-50-191.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com\r\n\r\nWarning: Identity file imported-openssh-key not accessible: No such file or directory.\r\nThe authenticity of host &#39;ec2-ip-111-11-11-111.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com (ip-111-11-11-111)&#39; can&#39;t be established.\r\nECDSA key fingerprint is 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.\r\nECDSA key fingerprint is 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.\r\n\r\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\r\n\r\nWarning: Permanently added &#39;ec2-11-111-111.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com,11-111-1191&#39; (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\r\nPermission denied (publickey).\r\n[ec2-user@ip-172-31-28-150 ~]$\r\n\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327597/putty-aws-no-such-file-or-directory","title":"PuTTy AWS no such file or directory"},{"tags":["excel","copy","worksheet"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12196485,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBWAEbqapbsATeLDvFCd6u1VyjRoangn7797Hj_=k-s128","display_name":"V Serra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12196485/v-serra"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43070,"user_id":445425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72d4504b4e5a6e3930ebd8a4ae4935c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chris neilsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/445425/chris-neilsen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570726327,"creation_date":1570725964,"last_edit_date":1570726327,"question_id":58327596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58327596","body_markdown":"I am new to VBA.

The function `buildItem` must return a pointer of `InventoryObject` i mean: `InventoryObject*`. It is bease you are returning the pointer of the memory that was reserved at the moment of create it (`  InventoryObject *tempObject = new InventoryObject;`), like this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nInventoryObject* buildItem() {\r\n  InventoryObject *tempObject = new InventoryObject;\r\n  \r\n  //...\r\n\r\n  tempObject-&gt;storeInfo(itemNum, description, qty, price);\r\n  return *tempObject;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; keep in mind that your main array (`InventoryObject *iArray`) contains an array of pointer.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The main problem that i see. In the `main` you are using an `if` block where there is a **local variable** called *item* (`InventoryObject item`). Let me explain something: Each instance of a class, like you `InventoryObject item` will be destroyed, release its memory, if its context is over. \r\n\r\nSo, in this case, the problem is that you was casting the pointer of at the moment of returning from the function `buildItem` (`return *tempObject`) and store its value into a local variable `InventoryObject item` which shall be release when the thread leaves the `if`, the context of the local variable.\r\n\r\nChange your local variable `InventoryObject item` to handle a pointer: `InventoryObject* item`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n    if (choice == 1) {\r\n      InventoryObject* item;\r\n      item = buildItem();\r\n      iArray[size] = item;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; I recommend you to read the chapters **7. Pointers, Arrays, and References** and **17 Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move** from the book  **The C++ Programming Language** of *Bjarne Stroustrup*.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327584/need-help-solving-a-memory-leak/58328285#58328285","title":"Need Help Solving a Memory Leak"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3258,"user_id":10957435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/663773cb7f0bc33d3025eb2f9d47799c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chipster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10957435/chipster"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570731663,"creation_date":1570731663,"answer_id":58328936,"question_id":58327584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58328936","body_markdown":"&gt;I have tried rewriting it to match addresses but no luck. I think the buildItem function produces a temporary object, which is destroyed when the function ends.\r\n\r\nYour intuition is half true. There is something wrong with this function, but it has nothing to do with temporaries. It&#39;s more about you allocating an object you never destroy.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that you are trying to do something similar to [what I was trying to do in this question][1], but not quite. Even if you were doing what I was doing, it still wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for reasons that lots of people already explained better than I could.\r\n\r\nThe point is is that the base of the issue is that is if you use `new` to allocate something, you **must** use `delete` to deallocate it, which you don&#39;t do here.\r\n```\r\nInventoryObject buildItem() {\r\n  InventoryObject *tempObject = new InventoryObject;\r\n  //...\r\n  return *tempObject;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou simply return the object by value without deleting it first. You aren&#39;t even returning it by reference which would be better (yet still probably bad: again, see [my question][1]). You are allocating an object and never deleting it. That&#39;s a leak.\r\n\r\nYou have two solutions: either return the pointer directly (if you really need a pointer) like this:\r\n```\r\nInventoryObject* buildItem() {\r\n  InventoryObject *tempObject = new InventoryObject;\r\n  //...\r\n  return tempObject;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOr, you can simply just return the object by value like this:\r\n```\r\nInventoryObject buildItem() {\r\n  InventoryObject tempObject;\r\n  //...\r\n  return tempObject;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGiven the code sample you&#39;ve shown, this is my recommendation of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nNote: I should mention that if for some reason you do need to return a pointer and have some factory method pattern with some sort of polymorphism in play, you also have the option of [smart pointers][2] too. That is what I ended up doing based on other people&#39;s suggestions from the other thread. I can personally recommend it. Basically, your code code would become something like this instead:\r\n```\r\nstd::unique_ptr&lt;InventoryObject&gt; buildItem() {\r\n  std::unique_ptr&lt;InventoryObject&gt; tempObject = new InventoryObject; // C++11 way, I think\r\n                  // C++14 and above has a function called make_unique you could use instead.\r\n  //...\r\n  return tempObject;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, this is only useful if you have some sort of polymorphism going on as I did. Given the code sample you have posted so far, you really only need to return by value in your situation. I just thought I&#39;d mention this other option too, just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nP. (P.) S. This answer is only about your suspected memory leak. That said, there are other helpful answers here that you should heed. Problems described in other answers could contribute to your problem and could really trip you up down the road (actually, could still trip you up now too) if you don&#39;t fix them, so I highly recommend taking their advice too.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/56639607/10957435\r\n  [2]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58327584/need-help-solving-a-memory-leak/58328936#58328936","title":"Need Help Solving a Memory Leak"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12035404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCqIC8HElrW3W2ITVnlzc8zjYSq59JPu-anK4nY2A=k-s128","display_name":"Daniel Ramos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12035404/daniel-ramos"},"last_editor":{"reputation":572,"user_id":1616622,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AD515.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saxtheowl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1616622/saxtheowl"},"comment_count":16,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":117,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":4,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570768356,"creation_date":1570725918,"last_edit_date":1570768356,"question_id":58327584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58327584","body_markdown":"I am writing an inventory management system using dynamic arrays using objects.
