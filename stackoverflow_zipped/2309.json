I have the following array declaration:\r\n\r\n`new double[][] {new double[] {1, 2, 3}, new double[] {4,5,6}, new double[] {7,8,9}}`\r\n\r\nand I want to &quot;translate&quot; (shift) the contents of the array by a fixed amount in a given direction, leaving the existing contents in the non-overwritten cells - e.g:\r\n\r\n    1 2 3                                1 1 2\r\n    4 5 6   Shifted by +1 in x becomes:  4 4 5\r\n    7 8 9                                7 7 8\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 2 3                                1 2 3\r\n    4 5 6   Shifted by +1 in y becomes:  1 2 3\r\n    7 8 9                                4 5 6\r\n\r\nI can do these operations fairly easily using System.arraycopy:\r\n\t\r\nshift by dy:\r\n\r\n\tboolean b2t = dy&lt;0; // bottom to top movement\r\n\tdy = Math.abs(dy);\r\n\r\n\tif (b2t)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tSystem.arraycopy(a, dy, a, 0, (a.length-dy));\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tSystem.arraycopy(a, 0, a, dy, (a.length-dy));\t\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nshift by dx:\r\n\r\n    boolean l2r = dx&gt;0; // left to right movement\r\n\tdx = Math.abs(dx);\r\n\tfor (double[] i : a)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (l2r)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tSystem.arraycopy(i, 0, i, dx, (i.length-dx));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tSystem.arraycopy(i, dx, i, 0, (i.length-dx));\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\t\r\n\r\nThe interesting behaviour comes when I try to do both together (e.g. `dx = 1 and dy = 1`).\r\n\r\nIf I use the above code in the order shown (dy then dx), it seems like the copied array gets updated in the for-loop iteration for the array it was copied from.\r\n\r\ne.g for the 1..9 example, for dx = 1 and dy = 1, the changes I observe are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Orig.        dy   for:dx(1)      dx(2)      dx(3)\r\n    1 2 3      1 2 3      1 1 2      1 1 1      1 1 1\r\n    4 5 6   -&gt; 1 2 3   -&gt; 1 1 2   -&gt; 1 1 1   -&gt; 1 1 1\r\n    7 8 9      4 5 6      4 5 6      4 5 6      4 4 5\r\n\r\nAs you can see, during the `for` loop in the `dx` transform, it&#39;s treating the first and second rows like they are the same object; and so applying the transformation twice - applying it to both arrays both times.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for System.arraycopy states: \r\n&gt; If the src and dest arguments refer to the same array object, then the copying is performed as if the components at positions srcPos through srcPos+length-1 were first copied to a temporary array with length components and then the contents of the temporary array were copied into positions destPos through destPos+length-1 of the destination array.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when the `dy` transform is done, the top two rows are copied off to a separate temporary array, and then back in to the main array `a` but in the shifted position.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it is copying the `reference` to the array, rather than the array itself - is that what&#39;s happening?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I can solve the issue by swapping the code so it does the dx shifts before the dy; but it would be interesting to confirm what is going on here; because if I wanted to expand this into 3 dimensions, I wouldn&#39;t just be able to rearrange it to make it work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990232/how-does-system-arraycopy-copy-arrays-of-arrays","title":"How does System.ArrayCopy copy arrays of

You mentioned non-latin characters, but didn&#39;t specify any concrete examples, where you had problems.\r\n\r\n# What is composition?\r\n\r\nUnicode aims to be able to represent any character used by humanity. However, many characters are similar, such as `u`, `&#252;`, `&#251;` and `ū`. The original idea was to just assign a code point to every possible combination. As one might imagine, this is not the most effective way to store things. Instead, the &quot;base&quot; character is used, and then a combining character is added to it.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s look at an example: `&#252;`\r\n\r\n`&#252;` can be represented as `U+00FC`, also known as `LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS`.\r\n\r\n`&#252;` can also be represented as `U+0075` (`u`), followed by `U+0308` (`◌̈`), also known as `LATIN SMALL LETTER U`, followed by `COMBINING DIARESIS`.\r\n\r\n# Why is this problematic?\r\n\r\nBecause hash functions don&#39;t know what a string is. All they care about is bytes. As such, a string has to be decoded to a string of bytes. As was shown above, there are multiple different ways to decode a string, which means that two different systems can decode the same logical string to different bytes, thus resulting in different hashes.\r\n\r\n# How can I fix this?\r\n\r\nYou have to explicitly define how the string will be decoded on both platforms, to ensure that both decode the strings in the exact same manner.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081482/swift-hmac-doesnt-match-nodejs-hmac-but-only-sometimes/58081483#58081483","title":"Swift HMAC doesn&#39;t match NodeJS HMAC, but only sometimes!"}],"migrated_from":{"other_site":{"aliases":["http://itsecurity.stackexchange.com"],"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#FFF","tag_foreground_color":"#000","link_color":"#0077CC"},"related_sites":[{"relation":"meta","api_site_parameter":"security.meta","site_url":"https://security.meta.stackexchange.com","name":"Information Security Meta Stack Exchange"},{"relation":"chat","site_url":"https://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=security.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange"}],"launch_date":1310490000,"open_beta_date":1290106800,"closed_beta_date":1289502000,"site_state":"normal","high_resolution_icon_url":"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/security/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png","twitter_account":"StackSecurity","favicon_url":"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/security/img/favicon.ico","icon_url":"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/security/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"information security professionals","site_url":"https://security.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"security","logo_url":"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/security/img/logo.png","name":"Information Security","site_type":"main_site"},"on_date":1569331884,"question_id":218211},"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10158761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a5bcf76e073ae7f73c6967504c04762?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user109321948492842303","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10158761/user109321948492842303"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569331884,"creation_date":1568801133,"question_id":58081482,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58081482","body_markdown":"I have discovered a HUGE issue in my code, and I have literally no idea what is causing this. \r\n\r\nSO, when I send requests to my server I hash a string thats in the request.

The problem is the select query may some times return NULL as a valid value and the escape sequence for loop(cursor) is when null encountered. How do I run update query for when the select query returns some value and skip when it returns null and then end the cursor when there is no more data left.\r\n\r\nThe select statement is something like this \r\n```\r\nselect phone_number from customers where last_name = &#39;SINGH&#39;;\r\n```\r\nnow there may be some customers that haven&#39;t provided their phone_numbers\r\n\r\nand the update

For now, the remote-debugging experience in **Linux** for `.net core` is quite different from that for `C++`.

When authenticated (`/auth`), the API issues a short-lived `access token`, and a long-lived `refresh token`. The mobile clients store these tokens in their secure key store.\r\n\r\nThis API is hosted on `myapi.com`. It is containerised &amp; load-balanced at the app level in a private cloud, but accesses common data stores (both clustered and sharded).\r\n\r\nCORS is enabled, but extremely permissive due to the fact all the clients are mobile applications. This will be locked down further as the project progresses.\r\n\r\nEach request that a client makes to the API includes the `auth token`. When the auth token expires (in say, 5 minutes time), the API returns a 401 - at which point the client is expected to request a new `auth token` by sending the stored `refresh token` to a `/refresh` endpoint, which will in turn send back a new `auth token` (but only if the `refresh token` is valid - could be valid for 60 days). The API may or may not also issue a new `refresh token` at this point, and may or may not blacklist the requested refresh token - I don&#39;t think that should make much of a difference to my question, but it has been considered. These last two decisions form part of the product specification and shouldn&#39;t really affect the security of the API requests.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty standard approach and fairly secure - it is unlikely anyone will be able to get access to the `access` and `refresh` tokens as they are stored in secure, native key stores on the mobile devices, and the tokens are tamper proof as they are signed with a private JWS key - known only to the API. All tokens are authorised on a request-by-request basis based on key, issuer, audience and expiry.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to introduce web-based clients into this architecture, considering the following:\r\n\r\n* The *internal* web clients will be hosted on separate domains (or sub-domains) i.e. www.client1.com, www.client2.com or client3.myapi.com\r\n* Additional web clients may exist that are created and hosted by a third party (www.thirdpartydomain.com)\r\n* Browser-based Local Storage is not secure enough to store the long-term `refresh token` (though I am happy to use Session Storage for the Auth token)\r\n* We still need to support mobile clients. This makes HTTP Only cookies difficult (or impossible?) to use for long-term `refresh token` storage.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading, but I&#39;m yet to find a clear consensus on what is the best way to secure refresh tokens in a browser-based environment.\r\n\r\nIs the answer to provide two authentication / refresh mechanisms - one for mobile clients (that exposes both tokens via the HTTP response body) and one for browsers (that exposes the auth token via the HTTP response body, and the refresh token via an HTTP Only cookie)?\r\n\r\nIf I opt-for secure, HTTP Only cookies, would that be workable cross-domain, or using a non-browser based HTTP client?\r\n\r\nAm I missing something fundamental in the spec that will cater for both scenarios?\r\n\r\nFurther reading:\r\n\r\nhttps://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/\r\n\r\nhttps://auth0.com/blog/5-steps-to-add-modern-authentication-to-legacy-apps-using-jwts/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990111/jwt-auth-refresh-tokens-in-cross-platform-development","title":"JWT Auth &amp;

You can also add a &quot;using alias&quot; on a per-file basis for convenience, i.e.\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\nusing Mwahaha = global::Foo.Bar.Whatever;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand now you can use `Mwahaha` as an alias every time you mean `global::Foo.Bar.Whatever` *in that file*.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo; going back to my assumption that you mean &quot;in the same full namespace&quot;:\r\n\r\nConflicting full type names is a major pain, and how to fix it depends a lot on your build chain. The simplest fix here is to encourage library authors **not to do this**, perhaps using `[assembly:TypeForwardedTo(...)]` if the thing they added for compatibility is now available in an &quot;official&quot; location (i.e. if library A adds a type, then later the &quot;official&quot; version is added somewhere, library A can **delete** their version of it, and add `[assembly:TypeForwardedTo(typeof(TheType))]` where `TheType` is now from the &quot;official&quot; library, and everything *should* work correctly without even breaking callers, if the types are truly compatible; callers expecting the type in A will be redirected to the official version *automatically* without even needing to be recompiled).\r\n\r\nOtherwise...\r\n\r\nThe compiler supports this, but via something called &quot;extern aliases&quot;. When you reference any dll, by default it gets the `global` namespace alias. However, **specifically for this scenario**, you can override that and tell it which namespace to use on a per-dll basis. So you could say that everything from `a.dll` goes into `global` (i.e. the default), but everything from `b.dll` goes into the `blah` namespace alias. You then need to use [`extern alias`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/extern-alias) **in every single file** where you want to access things from `blah` (i.e. from `b.dll`). This gets annoying very quickly, but works. The short version would be:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\nextern alias blah;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then use `blah::Foo.Bar.Whatever` in every location in that file to refer to `Foo.Bar.Whatever` from `b.dll`; or combined with &quot;using alias&quot;:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\nextern alias blah;\r\nusing Mwahaha = blah::Foo.Bar.Whatever;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand now `Mwahaha` refers to `Foo.Bar.Whatever` from `b.dll` *but only in that file*.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe article above covers how to specify the per-dll aliases with `csc`, but in reality almost nobody uses `csc` directly.\r\n\r\nFor old-style csproj in Visual Studio, the alias can be specified in the properties window of the reference. For new-style csproj, you have to use an ugly hack:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n  &lt;Target Name=&quot;ChangeAliasesOfReferences&quot;\r\n    BeforeTargets=&quot;FindReferenceAssembliesForReferences;ResolveReferences&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n      &lt;ReferencePath Condition=&quot;&#39;%(FileName)&#39; == &#39;b&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- the dll --&gt;\r\n        &lt;Aliases&gt;blah&lt;/Aliases&gt;&lt;!-- the namespace aliases --&gt;\r\n      &lt;/ReferencePath&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n  &lt;/Target&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for how to do this with the unity build chain: your guess is as good as mine.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990108/the-type-actiont1-t2-t3-exists-in-2-dlls-how-do-i-specify-which-one-to-use/57990900#57990900","title":"The type &quot;Action&lt;T1,T2,T3&gt;&quot; exists in 2 DLLs, how do I specify which one to use or just avoid one?"}],"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":6770368,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DDGKG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZioCain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6770368/ziocain"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568804590,"creation_date":1568800938,"question_id":57990108,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57990108","body_markdown":"I making an app with Unity3D and using [this socket.io plugin](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/socket.io-unity/) but when I&#39;m using Unity 2019.1 I get the following errors:\r\n\r\n    /.../Unity.app/Contents/Resources/PackageManager/BuiltInPackages/com.unity.timeline/Runtime/TrackAsset.cs(17,38): error CS0433: The type &#39;Action&lt;T1, T2, T3&gt;&#39; exists in both &#39;WebSocket4Net, Version=0.14.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=eb4e154b696bf72a&#39; and &#39;mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089&#39;\r\n\r\nAnd that is because Action is defined both in WebSocket4Net, which I use, even tho I&#39;m not using that specific reference and in System, which again, I&#39;m not using.\r\n\r\nSystem.Action is being used by Unity, while the one in WebSocket4Net is used to make JSON from the library Newtonsoft.Json, which I&#39;m not using but is strictly linked to the WebSocket4Net and can&#39;t be removed.\r\n\r\nI tried specifying `System.Action` whenever Unity uses that, but that&#39;s no solution, the error is still there.\r\n\r\nTried removing WebSocket4Net and this removes that error, but create a new error:\r\n\r\n    &#39;HashSet&lt;GameObject&gt;&#39; does not contain a definition for &#39;Contains&#39; and no accessible extension method &#39;Contains&#39; accepting a first argument of type &#39;HashSet&lt;GameObject&gt;&#39; could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\r\nwhen HashSet should have this method by default.\r\n\r\nTried removing all 3 DLLs from the plugins folder in order to avoid having these issues, but then I won&#39;t have sockets, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this?

For example, to use a number, r=0 for a smooth surface, r=1 for a very rough surface and the surface is in between smooth and rough when 0 &lt; r &lt; 1.\r\n\r\nTo more explicitly illustrate this question, the attached figure below is used to show several sketches of 2D rough surfaces. The dots are the scattered points with given coordinates. Accordingly, every two adjacent dots can be connected and a normal vector of each segment can be computed (marked with arrow). I would like to design a function like \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef roughness(x, y):\r\n \r\n   ...   \r\n\r\n   return r\r\n```\r\nwhere `x` and `y` are sequences of coordinates of each scatter point. For example, in case (a), `x=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]`, `y=[0,1,0,1,0,1,0]`; in case (b), `x=[0,1,2,3,4,5]`, `y=[0,0,0,0,0,0]`. When we call the function `roughness(x, y)`, we will get r=1 (very rough) for case (a) and r=0 (smooth) for case (b). Maybe r=0.5 (medium) for case (d). The question is refined to what appropriate components do we need to put inside the function `roughness`?\r\n\r\nSome initial thoughts:\r\n\r\nRoughness of a surface is a local concept, which we only consider within a specific range of area, i.e. only with several local points around the location of interest. To use mean of local normal vectors? This may fail: (a) and (b) are with the same mean, (0,1), but (a) is rough surface and (b) is smooth surface. To use variance of local normal vectors? This may also fail: (c) and (d) are with the same variance, but (c) is rougher than (d). \r\n\r\n[![Sketches of 2D rough surfaces][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/s0o5k.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990063/quantify-roughness-of-a-2d-surface-based-on-given-scatter-points-geometrically","title":"Quantify roughness of a 2D surface based on given scatter points geometrically"},{"tags":["javascript","google-chrome-devtools","web-worker"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30279,"user_id":3959875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJdGu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wOxxOm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3959875/woxxom"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568802729,"post_id":57990060,"comment_id":102388548,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990060/chrome-dev-tools-slow-down-computation#comment102388548_57990060"},{"owner":{"reputation":1002,"user_id":3487325,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8224beed454d345a324f72504d81aa5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lukas1994","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3487325/lukas1994"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30279,"user_id":3959875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJdGu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wOxxOm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3959875/woxxom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568914835,"post_id":57990060,"comment_id":102436412,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990060/chrome-dev-tools-slow-down-computation#comment102436412_57990060"},{"owner":{"reputation":1002,"user_id":3487325,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8224beed454d345a324f72504d81aa5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lukas1994","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3487325/lukas1994"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30279,"user_id":3959875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJdGu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wOxxOm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3959875/woxxom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568915161,"post_id":57990060,"comment_id":102436540,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990060/chrome-dev-tools-slow-down-computation#comment102436540_57990060"},{"owner":{"reputation":30279,"user_id":3959875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJdGu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wOxxOm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3959875/woxxom"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568919224,"post_id":57990060,"comment_id":102438272,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990060/chrome-dev-tools-slow-down-computation#comment102438272_57990060"}],"owner":{"reputation":1002,"user_id":3487325,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8224beed454d345a324f72504d81aa5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lukas1994","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3487325/lukas1994"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568800781,"creation_date":1568800781,"question_id":57990060,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57990060","body_markdown":"I&#39;m running a Monte-Carlo simulation in the browser which takes ~1sec.

You can set variables in your `given` block and use them in interactions; I typically use commons-lang3 `RandomStringUtils`.\r\n\r\nAnd try to slim down your test case to whatever extent practical!

Listing all differences on the level of the language would be a long story and you&#39;d be wise to read and understand on [JavaScript prototype-based inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain), but the most important differences are:\r\n\r\n* `Page` is a prototype object: whenever you create an object of class `Page` with `new Page()`, the constructor function is called with `this` referring to the object being created, not `Page` itself. Any property you access on the object is searched along the so-called &quot;prototype chain&quot;, including the so-called prototype object. This prototype object can be accessed with `Page.prototype` and in fact, all methods you define in the class `Page` are also properties of this prototype object. Unlike own properties designed to refer to unique objects or primitives specific to an object, functions in JavaScript don&#39;t have to bound to an object during object or function creation and *can be shared* between objects (belonging to the same class, for instance) and are called on the actual instance, not the prototype to which they may belong. In other words, `this.nameInput` in your constructor actually adds a property named `nameInput` to the object being created with `new Page()`, not the prototype, while the constructor itself (`constructor`) and any non-static methods you might add to `Page` will be added as properties of `Page.prototype`. The constructor is accessed as `Page.prototype.constructor`, by the way, as you&#39;d naturally expect. `Page.prototype.constructor === Page` evaluates to `true`, by the way.\r\n\r\n* An expression of the form like `{ nameInput: ... }` creates an object which prototype is `Object.prototype`, in practice the most basic form of object with &quot;no prototype&quot; and thus no superclass or any traits beyond what the fundamental object prototype object could provide. Any properties any such `{ ... }` object may seem to have through its prototype chain, including methods, are properties of `Object.prototype`. This is why you can do `({}).toString()` or `({}).hasOwnProperty(&quot;foobar&quot;)` without actually having `toString` or `hasOwnProperty` properties in your object -- `toString` and `hasOwnProperty` are properties of `Object.prototype` referring to two distinct methods called `toString` and `hasOwnProperty`, respectively, and JavaScript creates a special property *on your object* called `__proto__` referring to `Object.prototype`. This is how it knows how to &quot;walk the prototype chain&quot;. The *names* of functions themselves do not matter like that, by the way -- I may add a property on an object referring to an anonymous function: `var foo = ({}); foo.bar = function() { };` and call said unnamed function with `foo.bar()`.\r\n\r\nOne mistake you appear to be making is confusing an object of a class with the class, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t compare `export default class Page { ... }` to `export const Page = { nameInput: Selector(...) }` -- the former creates a class accessible as `Page` which is used as the prototype object whenever objects of the class are created, while the latter creates an object accessible as `Page` which contains `nameInput` referring to result of evaluating expression `Selector(&quot;#developer-name&quot;)` (calling `Selector` with the sole argument `&quot;#developer-name&quot;`). _Not_ the same thing at all, not to mention that former has `Page` refer to a class (invariably a prototype in JavaScript), while latter has `Page` refer to an object that does not seem to fit the pattern of a class.\r\n\r\nThe interesting things start when you realize that since a class is an object like any other in JavaScript, any object can be used as a class if you know how prototype-based inheritance works:\r\n\r\n    new (function() { this.nameInput = Selector(&quot;#developer-name&quot;); })();\r\n\r\nWhat happens here? You create a new object with an unnamed function as the object constructor. The effect is absolutely equivalent to otherwise creating the object with `new Page` with `Page` being your original ES6 class (ECMAScript 6 is the language specification that adds `class` syntax to JavaScript).\r\n\r\nYou can also do this, again equivalent to if you defined `Page` with `class Page ...`:\r\n\r\n    function Page() {\r\n        this.nameInput = Selector(&quot;#developer-name&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var foo = new Page();\r\n\r\n`Page.prototype` will be the prototype object for `foo`, accessible as `foo.__proto__` and otherwise making it possible for you to call instance methods on `foo` like `foo.bar()`, provided you define `bar` property on at least `Page.prototype`:\r\n\r\n    function Page() {\r\n        this.nameInput = Selector(&quot;#developer-name&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Page.prototype.bar = function() {\r\n        console.log(this.nameInput);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var foo = new Page();\r\n    foo.bar();\r\n\r\nIn fact, the above is what browser would do internally if it had to interpret the following code:\r\n\r\n    class Page {\r\n        constructor() {\r\n            this.nameInput = Selector(&quot;#developer-name&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        bar() {\r\n            console.log(this.nameInput);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the scope of my answer to list differences between the two last approaches (isn&#39;t the same thing as the two approaches you proposed), but one difference is that with `class Page ...`, `Page` is not a property of `window` in some user agents while with `function Page ...` it is. It&#39;s partly historical reasons, but rest assured that so far defining constructors and prototype using either approach is pretty much the same, although I can imagine smarter JavaScript runtimes will be able to optimize the latter form better (because it&#39;s an atomic declaration, and not a sequence of expressions and statements).\r\n\r\nIf you understand prototype-based inheritance at the heart of all of this, all your questions about this will fall away by themselves as very few fundamental mechanisms of JavaScript support 99% of its idiosyncrasies. You&#39;ll also be able to optimize your object design and access patterns, knowing when to choose ES6 classes, when not to, when using object literals (`{ prop: value, ... }`) and when not to, and how to share fewer objects between properties.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990021/what-is-a-difference-between-an-object-literal-and-a-class-with-values-in-constr/57991696#57991696","title":"What is a difference between an object literal and a class with values in constructor in javascript?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10011658,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d76255232ce00c22961bfec447defaba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"K.

few more if functions or should it be done differently.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57990015/how-to-use-one-button-to-gettext-and-settext-to-3-different-edittexts-and-textvi","title":"How to use one button to getText and

You can try adding the missing plugins by adding the following package group to your image:\r\n```\r\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-base\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can replace the pipeline in `face_detect.py` with your working pipeline, but keep in mind that the script probably needs the video converted to BGR before feeding it to `appsink` for the algorithm to work. You might need to look up documentation for the `nvidconv` element to see if this is supported.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Judging by your comment, you may have been missing `gstreamer1.0-python` as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989992/how-to-use-opencv-with-camera-on-jetson-nano-with-yocto-poky/58000013#58000013","title":"How to use OpenCV with camera on Jetson Nano with Yocto/poky"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10695702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L3_2UThWOE8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-h7qQUqHr5Q9Odt46Jq-Xuxd_p9Qg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anchal Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10695702/anchal-gupta"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569927798,"creation_date":1569927798,"answer_id":58183497,"question_id":57989992,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58183497","body_markdown":"Use the following gstreamer pipeline:\r\n\r\nstream = &#39;nvarguscamerasrc ! video/x-raw(memory:NVMM), width=%d, height=%d, format=(string)NV12, framerate=(fraction)%d/1 !nvvidconv flip-method=%d ! nvvidconv ! video/x-raw, width=(int)%d, height=(int)%d, format=(string)BGRx ! videoconvert ! appsink&#39; % (1280, 720, 30,0, 640, 480)\r\n\r\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture(stream,cv2.CAP_GSTREAMER)\r\n\r\nThis will solve the problem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57989992/how-to-use-opencv-with-camera-on-jetson-nano-with-yocto-poky/58183497#58183497","title":"How to use OpenCV with camera on Jetson Nano with Yocto/poky"}],"owner":{"reputation":70,"user_id":5999131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IwNVM9damZo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/IlisFdolFq0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michael Christensen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5999131/michael-christensen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":70,"user_id":5999131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IwNVM9damZo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/IlisFdolFq0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michael Christensen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5999131/michael-christensen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58000013,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569927798,"creation_date":1568800566,"last_edit_date":1568810316,"question_id":57989992,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57989992","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve created a minimal xfce image with Yocto/poky on a Jetson Nano using warrior branches (poky warrior, meta-tegra warrior-l4t-r32.2, openembedded warrior) and CUDA 10.\r\n\r\nImage boots and runs perfectly, and the camera test:\r\n\r\n    $ gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc ! &#39;video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=3820, height=2464, framerate=21/1, format=NV12&#39; ! nvvidconv flip-method=0 ! &#39;video/x-raw,width=960, height=616&#39; ! nvvidconv ! nvegltransform ! nveglglessink -e\r\n\r\nworks like a charm.\r\n\r\nNow I would like to use OpenCV on the camera feed, but I can&#39;t get it to work.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve added these packages to ```IMAGE_INSTALL```:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    opencv \\\r\n    libopencv-core \\\r\n    libopencv-imgproc \\\r\n    opencv-samples \\\r\n    gstreamer1.0-omx-tegra \\\r\n    python3 \\\r\n    python3-modules \\\r\n    python3-dev \\\r\n    python-numpy \\\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nTo get the OpenCV installed.
