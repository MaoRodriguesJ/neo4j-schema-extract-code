I&#39;ve also tried to start two separate threads, but only a blank Pyplot shows up. I&#39;ve read that, `plt.show()`, `plt.pause()` and some others will block the program, but I also tried updating the figure with `canvas.flush_events()` method, still no luck.\r\n\r\nMy idea was, to run a while loop for the Pyplot in its own thread and put the new position values to a queue, because I know that&#39;s thread safe. Unfortunately, it is a total mess.\r\n```python\r\n# Thread for camera\r\nCamLoop = threading.Thread(name = &#39;CamLoop&#39;, target = CamMain(), daemon = True)\r\nCamLoop.start()\r\n\r\nplotter = Plotting()\r\n# Thread for plotting (only with animating array from file)\r\nPlotLoop = threading.Thread(name = &#39;PlotLoop&#39;, target = plotter.plotout(&#39;results/file.npz&#39;), daemon = True)\r\nPlotLoop.start()\r\n```\r\nAnd below the needed functions from Plotting class. This works on its own, it animates the positions from the file, but it only begins plotting after the the video capture with the `cv2.imshow()` is destroyed.

To illustrate the issue, let&#39;s look at an example:\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say I was going to give a pure random reward, out of set: [A, B, C]. It would be as simple as getting a random index and returning whatever reward from the array.\r\n\r\nIn my use case, however, the reward set is weight with a &quot;share&quot; system. So we have a situation like below:\r\n\r\n- A - Weight of 2.\r\n- B - Weight of 3.\r\n- C - Weight of 5.\r\n\r\nSo the set looks like something like this: [A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, C, C]. \r\n\r\nNow, I _could_ just build out that array and get a random result like that, but I&#39;m concerned about performance implications. These rewards are stored in a database (using Django and PSQL as the backend if that factors in), and there may be upwards of 100 potential rewards, each with a weight of 1-100 (or more). \r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m trying to figure out an efficient method to pull a random reward based on such weight. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs I&#39;m writing this, one thing the comes to mind (but I&#39;d like to hear other thoughts):\r\n\r\n- After a reward set is updated, build out the array once, and then assign each reward a percentage chance. So calculate percentage once.\r\n- In the above, we would end up with something like: [A: 0.2, B: 0.3, C: 0.5].\r\n- Then we could get a random number between 0 and 1, and pull the reward that&#39;s the closest without going over? (so a random roll of 0.45 would get B since 0.3 is closest to 0.45 without being higher than 0.45).\r\n    - I&#39;m struggling to think how one would write a performant query for this however. Maybe query all rewards with percentages below the roll (0.45 in example above) and return the one with the highest percent from those results.\r\n\r\nI think I might have just answered my own question, but would appreciate a third-party perspective.

Compiling main.c from windows Command Propt using gcc and said flags results in the same error as in Code::Blocks. Moving the order of the options/flags in different ways does not change the error. For example having the libraries last and the cflags directly after gcc or main.c does not change the output, I have seen a &quot;solutions&quot; where there has to be a specific order to compile and link everything correctly, which does not work in the windows Command prompt nor in Code::Blocks apparently. Further more adding the compiler and linker options in Build Options for the project in Code::Blocks does not change anything either. Still the same error.\r\n\r\nNOTE: When I compile the above program using msys2 console and compile it with gcc main.c -o run_me `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` I get errors about -ldwmapi but I get a run_me.exe file that works just as expected. I have pasted in some different example gtk c code into the main.c file and compiled it with the msys console and it compiles &amp; links an exe file perfectly, even manages to create gtk windows flawlessly. This is not sustainable because it is awful to code in nano inside a console that does not have auto completion.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.msys2.org/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465642/compiler-error-gtk3-undefined-reference-on-windows","title":"compiler error gtk+3 undefined reference on windows"},{"tags":["javascript","mysql","node.js","asynchronous"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":3577379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c33374b386cd729ad968ebfb7f58201?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3577379","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3577379/user3577379"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571643777,"post_id":58469150,"comment_id":103295262,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465640/nodejs-perform-operation-on-each-returned-mysql-result-object/58469150#comment103295262_58469150"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":7143156,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d05c85067c76c5f62f4c1d5b6832a28a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7143156/rami"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571531941,"creation_date":1571531941,"answer_id":58469150,"question_id":58465640,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58469150","body_markdown":"You&#39;re literally iterating through your response from MySQL, which is a list of something, then you&#39;re making the soap call on every single one of them.  \r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is this:\r\n\r\n1.

But now I will describe everything here. Actually, I want a javascript function that can find a class with a specific prefix of any element in the full document. Lets take a example of a html markup :\r\n\r\n     &lt;body class=&quot;c:bg-#008eff&quot;&gt;\r\n     &lt;h1 class=&quot;c:bg-#ff5c5c&quot;&gt;Hello, &lt;span class=&quot;c:bg-white&quot;&gt;World !&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n     \r\nIn the above example, we get a common prefix **c:bg-** in all the classes. After the prefix we find names and hex of css colors. Consider, a function **understand()** that can :\r\n\r\n (1) Find all the classes with the prefix **c:** in an html document.\r\n \r\n (2) Looks for what is after the **c:** prefix, e.g. **c:bg-** will indicate that it is css background property, while **c:text-** will indicate thats it is css color property, etc.\r\n \r\n (3) Looks for the value to set, e.g. **c:bg-#008eff** indicates that it is css background property with value #008eff etc.\r\n \r\n (4) Removes the **c:bg-**, **c:text-** , etc. prefixes from the class obtained as string, and uses the remaining portion to define style.\r\n \r\n \r\nWe have got our example :\r\n\r\n     &lt;body class=&quot;c:bg-#008eff&quot;&gt;\r\n     &lt;h1 class=&quot;c:bg-#ff5c5c&quot;&gt;Hello, &lt;span class=&quot;c:bg-white&quot;&gt;World !&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n     \r\nIn the output of the above code in browser window, we will find the body with background #008eff, h1 with background #ff5c5c and span with background white.\r\n\r\nAnother example :\r\n\r\n     &lt;body&gt;\r\n     &lt;h1 class=&quot;c:text-#ff5c5c c:pad-20px&quot;&gt;Hello, &lt;span class=&quot;c:text-#008eff c:mar-20px&quot;&gt;World !&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n   \r\nIn the output of the above code in browser window, we will find h1 with color #ff5c5c and padding 20px and span with color #008eff and margin 20px.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes very important ! If same type of code is repeated then last one overwrite the first one.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\n     &lt;h1 class=&quot;c:bg-blue c:bg-red&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt; \r\n    &lt;!-- Executes red background --&gt;\r\n \r\nI wish, I am very clear now ! So, can my dream be a truth ?

everyone please in need some help in programming my Arduino board. I only have little knowledge about C++ and programming an Arduino.  I only recently started learning this and I need to implement this in my project.\r\n\r\nI am trying to make an RFID payment system in which students and lecturers within the school campus can use the college id card in making payments. This, of course, involves making a website for registration, a database for data collection and the Arduino and RFID system for scanning and performing transactions. The hardware component also include-- 4x4 keypad, LCD, RFID reader, RFID card and GSM module for connection to the database\r\n\r\nI have been to make the websites (front and back end) and database via HTML, PHP and phpMyAdmin (MySQL) respectively. This is something I know how to do\r\n\r\nMy issue now is in the hardware section of the project. I have seen a couple of discerptions online on how to connect the component on a breadboard, now my issue is how to program microcontroller i.e. the Arduino. I need the hardware to perform this set of functions\r\n\r\n1.   First, it should display &quot;ENTER AMOUNT&quot; on LCD\r\n\r\n2.   After entering the amount press enter. it should then request to scan the RFID card\r\n\r\n3.   After scanning the card, it should then send a request for verification of the card id from database via GSM module, then also pull up the balance of the user to see If the user has sufficient balance to make the required transaction through the GSM module.\r\n\r\n4.   If the card is not on the database is should display &quot;unknown card &quot;and loop back to &quot;Enter Amount&quot;. if the user card is registered but doesn&#39;t have sufficient balance for the inputted amount, it should display &quot;insufficient balance&quot; and loop back to &quot;Enter Amount&quot;\r\n5.   If the card is registered and has sufficient balance it should then proceed to request the card password.\r\n\r\n6.   After inputting the password. If the password is correct is should display &quot;transaction successful&quot; on LCD and deduct the amount entered from the balance in the database and then update the database with the new available balance.\r\n\r\n7.   If the password is wrong it should display &quot;incorrect password&quot; and loop back to &quot;Enter Amount&quot;\r\n\r\nIf someone can help with the code for this, I will be truly grateful.  \r\n\r\nI look forward to your Responses. thanks

I want that I will have to post the texts of my textarea to an api and the api will send some scores based on my text. \r\n\r\nthe thing is that the textarea probably would send something like this which is just the text: \r\n\r\n```\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the api only accepts data like, there is a prefix part {&quot;data&quot;:&quot;snippetDescription&quot;} or else it just gives an 404 error without the prefix part\r\n```\r\n{&quot;data&quot;:&quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua&quot;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso as you can see, my textarea doesn&#39;t have the {&quot;data&quot;:&quot;&quot;} part but only the pure text part.\r\n\r\nso i tried concatenating that in the post method but it gives an error.\r\nthis is how i tried to concatenate the first part to the textarea text.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscoreanalysis = (snippetDescription) =&gt;

You could have a catch all route that has a resolver that fetches the database configuration, resets the router configuration, and re-navigates the router to the same location based on the new configuration.\r\n\r\n# Routing module routes:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  { path: &#39;**&#39;, component: DummyComponent, resolve: {routing: RoutingResolve}}\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Route resolver:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Injectable } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\nimport { Router, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, Resolve} from &#39;@angular/router&#39;;\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class RoutingResolve implements Resolve&lt;any&gt; {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private router: Router, private routes: customRoutesSvc ) {}\r\n\r\n  resolve(\r\n    route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,\r\n    state: RouterStateSnapshot\r\n  ): Observable&lt;any&gt;|any {\r\n    let config = this.routes.getRoutingStructure();\r\n    this.router.resetConfig(config);\r\n    this.router.navigate(route.url);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the config is now replaced by something else, the catchall route is gone and instead we navigate around in the Angular app freely, until a hard refresh re-initializes the app.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465528/dynamic-path-based-on-service-result/58466659#58466659","title":"Dynamic path based on service result"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":10716664,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gBuy9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alvaro Franz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10716664/alvaro-franz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58466659,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571569110,"creation_date":1571501273,"question_id":58465528,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465528","body_markdown":"I am using Angular 8 to create a WordPress theme.\r\n\r\nI want to allow the user to select a custom permalink structure from the WP Dashboard.\r\n\r\n*Note*: this is not a WP question.

For those who are not familiar with it, a permalink structure is basically a set of rules to display the WP contents with friendly urls.\r\n\r\nIf a user can choose a custom permalink structure, I must set up a dynamic routing design for the angular app to work accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo, a service (does it really need to be a service?) that may be called *customRoutesSvc* will connect to a database and get the configuration, which will be something as follows:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n     &quot;posts_permalink&quot;:&quot;\\/%postname%\\/&quot;,\r\n     &quot;tag_base&quot;:&quot;tag&quot;,\r\n     &quot;category_base&quot;:&quot;category&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSuppose the *customRoutesSvc* has those values as properties now.\r\n\r\nSo, I need to somehow feed my routing module, to consider that information.\r\n\r\nMy routing module uses lazy loading and looks like this, with fixed routing paths.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;category/:category&#39;,\r\n      loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&#39;./view-category/view-category.module&#39;).then(m =&gt; m.ViewCategoryModule)\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;tag/:tag&#39;,\r\n      loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&#39;./view-tag/view-tag.module&#39;).then(m =&gt; m.ViewTagModule)\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;post/:slug&#39;,\r\n      loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&#39;./view-post/view-post.module&#39;).then(m =&gt; m.ViewPostModule)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI was thinking about something like:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      path: customRoutesSvc.category_base + &#39;category/:category&#39;,\r\n      loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&#39;./view-category/view-category.module&#39;).then(m =&gt; m.ViewCategoryModule)\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: customRoutesSvc.tag_base + &#39;/:tag&#39;,\r\n      loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&#39;./view-tag/view-tag.module&#39;).then(m =&gt; m.ViewTagModule)\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;**&#39;,\r\n      loadChildren: () =&gt; import(&#39;./view-post/view-post.module&#39;).then(m =&gt; m.ViewPostModule)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNoting that the last route will absorb everything and then the view-post module will handle the rest and display the post or redirect to an error page.\r\n\r\n**Why am I having issues with this?**\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, Angular loads Angular modules before a service. Not because of any preference, but because a service is a ES2015 module that gets bundled into an Angular module. Which means: Angular needs its Angular modules to know what ES2015 modules (components, services, pipes, ...) to load. So, the Angular routing module is loaded before the service and hence, the service cannot talk with the module itself.\r\n\r\n**What did I try so far?**\r\n\r\nI tried to think and get an answer.\r\n\r\nPlease do not interpret I am here to ask for code. This is more a conceptual question that aims not for a code-answer but for a theory answer that will help me keep on on my own.\r\n\r\n**What I think is the only possible solution?**\r\n\r\nSince the service cannot talk to the routing module (is that true?), I need to make a parent routing with a single path that absorbs everything (**).\r\n\r\nThen I need to have a DispatchComponent that will analyze that url and compare it with the already available information about the permalink structure.\r\n\r\nFinally, I need the DispatchComponent to redirect the content to the correct final component, that will take care of providing the result.\r\n\r\nIf that is the solution, how can I make this happen with lazy loading and how can one Component delegate its render task to another Component before Angular actually renders the HTML template?. I cannot use a redirect here since that would just restart the routing problem again.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to ask for aclarations about my purposes.

What is the return type of `map`?**\r\n\r\n`map`’s return value [is currently typed as an `Iterator[T]`][1]. Since iterators are iterables, your annotation of `x: Iterable[float] = map(int.__float__, [1, 2, 3])` is valid. (Also, just write `map(float, [1, 2, 3])`.)\r\n\r\n&gt; **2.

However, the proper usage for common types are not well documented.\r\n\r\nFor instance, from the official site, I could gather the following (proper) usages:\r\n\r\n**String**\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# The function signature of greeting is: Callable[[str], str]\r\ndef greeting(name: str) -&gt; str:\r\n    return &#39;Hello &#39; + name\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Integer**\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# The function signature of add is: Callable[[int, int], int]\r\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:\r\n    return a + b\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Floating Point Number**\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# The default value of x is 1.0\r\ndef reciprocal(x: float = 1.0) -&gt; float:\r\n    from math import nan\r\n    if x == 0:\r\n        return nan\r\n    return 1 / x\r\n```\r\n\r\n**List**\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import List, TypeVar\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(&#39;T&#39;)\r\n\r\ndef repeat(x: T, n: int) -&gt; List[T]:\r\n    return [x] * n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Tuple**\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Tuple, TypeVar\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(&#39;T&#39;)\r\n\r\ndef double(x: T) -&gt; Tuple[T, T]:\r\n    return (x, x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n**1. What is the return type of `map`?**\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Iterable\r\n\r\n# Is this correct?\r\nx: Iterable[float] = map(int.__float__, [1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is the correct type hint for `x` above.\r\n\r\n**2. In a broader sense, what is the &#39;function signature&#39; of `map`?**\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Callable, Iterable, TypeVar\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(&#39;T&#39;)\r\nU = TypeVar(&#39;U&#39;)\r\n\r\n# In the above usage, the type of the map function seems to be:\r\nFunction1 = Callable[[T], U]\r\ntypeOfMap = Callable[[Function1, Iterable[T]], Iterable[U]]\r\n\r\n# Or in one line:\r\ntypeOfMap = Callable[[Callable[[T], U], Iterable[T]], Iterable[U]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in fact, the map function can accept multiple iterables. It is [documented][2] as:\r\n&gt; `map(function, iterable, ...)`\r\n\r\nIt could be used like this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# The result is: [[&#39;A&#39;], [&#39;B&#39;, &#39;B&#39;], [&#39;C&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;C&#39;]]\r\nresult = list(map(repeat, [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;], [1, 2, 3]))\r\n\r\nT1 = TypeVar(&#39;T1&#39;)\r\nT2 = TypeVar(&#39;T2&#39;)\r\nR = TypeVar(&#39;R&#39;)\r\n\r\n# So, the type of map function in this usage seems to be:\r\nFunction2 = Callable[[T1, T2], R]\r\ntypeOfMap = Callable[[Function2, Iterable[T1], Iterable[T2]], Iterable[R]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn general, I guess it should be something like below, but this is not the correct way to write it:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nFunctionN = Callable[[T1, T2, ..., Tn], R]\r\ntypeOfMap = Callable[[FunctionN, Iterable[T1], Iterable[T2], ..., Iterable[Tn]], Iterable[R]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, what is the correct way to write it?\r\n\r\n**3. In general, where can I find the correct type hint of a Python function / method, including the built-in ones, those in the core libraries?**\r\n\r\nI need them mainly for learning purpose.\r\n\r\n**4.

You will need to install the Cloud Datastore client library for Python:\r\n\r\n    pip install --upgrade google-cloud-datastore\r\n\r\n&gt;2. Set up authentication by creating a service account and setting an environment variable. It will be easier if you see it, please take a look at the [official documentation][1] for more info about this. You can perform this step by either using the GCP console or command line.\r\n\r\n&gt;3.

In the first iteration of the loop `elem` is the value `4` which is located at index 0. Then you&#39;re removing from the array the first value equal to `elem`. In other words the value `4` at index 0 is now removed. This shifts which element is stored at what index. Before the removal `ele_list[0]` would be equal to `4`, however after the removal `ele_list[0]` will equal 3, since 3 is the value that prior to the removal was stored at index 1.\r\n2. Now when the loop continues to the second iteration the index that the loop &quot;looks at&quot; is incremented by 1. So the variable `elem` will now be the value of `ele_list[1]` which in the updated list (after the removal of the value 4 in the previous iteration) is equal to 2. Then you&#39;re (same as before) removing the value at index 1 from the list, so now the length of the list just 2 elements.\r\n3. When the loops is about to start the third iteration it checks to see if the new index (in this case 2) is smaller than the length of the list. Which its not, since 2 is not smaller than 2. So the loop ends. \r\n\r\nThe simplest solutions is to create a new copy of the array and loop over the copy instead. This can easily be done using the [slice syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/a/509295/6224823): `ele_list[:]`\r\n\r\n```py\r\nele_list = [1,2,3,2]\r\n\r\nfor elem in ele_list[:]:\r\n  if not elem &gt; 2:\r\n    print(elem, False)\r\n    ele_list.remove(elem)\r\n    print(ele_list)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465466/if-condition-working-differently-for-same-value-in-python/58465623#58465623","title":"If condition working differently for same value in python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":9024526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87130ef2a73882fcfcd529d116604070?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mellowonpsx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9024526/mellowonpsx"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571502204,"creation_date":1571502204,"answer_id":58465655,"question_id":58465466,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58465655","body_markdown":"I think the problem here is how the remove function interacts with the for function.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation, read the &quot;note&quot; part:\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/compound_stmts.html?highlight=while#grammar-token-for-stmt\r\n\r\n***This can lead to nasty bugs that can be avoided by making a temporary copy using a slice of the whole sequence***\r\n\r\nA possible solution, as suggested into the documentation:\r\n```python\r\nele_list = [1,2,3,2]\r\nfor i in ele_list[:]:\r\n    if not i&gt;2:\r\n        print(i,False)\r\n        ele_list.remove(i)\r\n        print(ele_list)\r\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n1 False\r\n[2, 3, 2]\r\n2 False\r\n[3, 2]\r\n2 False\r\n[3]\r\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465466/if-condition-working-differently-for-same-value-in-python/58465655#58465655","title":"If condition working differently for same value in python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6285,"user_id":129600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8304c94fad5c5a762301de60d0a9bd7e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"acushner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/129600/acushner"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571502834,"creation_date":1571502834,"answer_id":58465756,"question_id":58465466,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58465756","body_markdown":"the problem is that you&#39;re modifying your list as you&#39;re iterating over it, as mentioned in @Olian04&#39;s answer.\r\n\r\nit sounds like what you really want to do, however, is only keep values that are `&gt; 2`. this is really easy using a list comprehension:\r\n\r\n    filtereds_vals = [v for v in ele_list if v &gt; 2]\r\n\r\nif you merely want a function that gives you `True` for numbers greater than 2 and `False` for others, you can do something like this:\r\n\r\n    def gt_2(lst):\r\n        return [v &gt; 2 for v in lst]\r\n\r\nor, finally, if you want to find out if _any_ of the values is `&gt; 2` just do:\r\n\r\n    def any_gt_2(lst):\r\n        return any(v &gt; 2 for v in lst)\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58465466/if-condition-working-differently-for-same-value-in-python/58465756#58465756","title":"If condition working differently for same value in python"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12242912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0420b93f4ac416f48c2a4ace157ed951?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"VishnuVardhan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12242912/vishnuvardhan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2511,"user_id":6224823,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eVoU_E2fMho/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC4/7qlAOwlIJkM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Olian04","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6224823/olian04"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571503020,"creation_date":1571500811,"last_edit_date":1571500949,"question_id":58465466,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58465466","body_markdown":"I am trying to write a function which will return True or False if the given number is not greater than 2. \r\nSo simple, but the if condition is returning different outputs for same value &#39;2&#39;.

The code would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf&lt;-as_tibble(c(&quot;QuikStop&quot;,&quot;TJ&#39;s Foods&quot;,&quot;TJs Foods&quot;,&quot;TJ&#39;s Food&quot;))\r\ndf$match&lt;-n_gram_merge(df$value)\r\n```\r\nThe result looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalue           match\r\nQuikStop        QuikStop\r\nTJ&#39;s Foods      TJ&#39;s Food\r\nTJs Foods       TJ&#39;s Food\r\nTJ&#39;s Food       TJ&#39;s Food\r\n```\r\nThe weights for the match can be tweaked using parameters from stringdist.
