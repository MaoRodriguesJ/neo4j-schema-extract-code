In talks with management to see if we can drop support for older versions of Android, but it seems almost certain we can&#39;t live with 26+ only.\r\n\r\nRecently there has appeared a need to use a library that uses some Java 1.8 features, and those fail to dex.\r\n\r\nI had previously thought that automatic &quot;desugaring&quot; had been enabled when building/dexing with gradle for a while now, and issues like these would be &quot;automagically&quot; solved by converting the unsupported-in-1.7 opcodes to functionally equivalent 1.7 opcode blobs.\r\n\r\nBut my builds are failing with\r\n&quot;Private interface methods are only supported starting with Android N (--min-api 24)&quot;\r\nand similar error messages (as I said, API level 26 is the largest on I see), and:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Failed to transform artifact &#39;...&#39; to match attributes {artifactType=android-dex, dexing-enable-desugaring=false, dexing-is-debuggable=false, dexing-min-sdk=1}&quot;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, dexing seems to be happening with &quot;dexing-enable-desugaring=false&quot; and &quot;dexing-min-sdk=1&quot;, and I&#39;d like to change those. I&#39;ve been searching for a way to set those for quite a while now, and can&#39;t seem to find a way to tell gradle to pass the right parameters to the dexer.\r\n\r\nHere are the relevant snippets of configuration files:\r\n\r\ngradle.properties:\r\n\r\n    androidBuildToolsVersion=28.0.3\r\n    androidCompileSdkVersion=28\r\n\r\ngradle-wrapper.properties:\r\n\r\n    distributionUrl = https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.4.1-all.zip\r\n\r\nbuild.gradle:\r\n\r\n    buildscript {\r\n        repositories {\r\n            jcenter()\r\n            mavenCentral()\r\n            google()\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        dependencies {\r\n            classpath &#39;com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.5.0&#39;\r\n            classpath &#39;com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    allprojects {\r\n        repositories {\r\n            jcenter()\r\n            google()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    apply plugin: &#39;com.android.application&#39;\r\n    \r\n    dependencies {\r\n        compile fileTree(dir: &#39;libs&#39;, include: [&#39;*.jar&#39;])\r\n        compile &#39;com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1&#39;\r\n        compile &#39;com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:23.0.1&#39;\r\n        compile &#39;com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:10.0.0&#39;\r\n        compile &#39;com.google.android.gms:play-services-cast:10.0.0&#39;\r\n        compile &#39;com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:10.0.0&#39;\r\n        compile &#39;com.google.firebase:firebase-core:10.0.1&#39;\r\n        compile &#39;org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on:1.60&#39;\r\n        compile &#39;org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.60&#39;\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    apply plugin: &#39;com.google.gms.google-services&#39;\r\n    \r\n    android {\r\n        compileOptions {\r\n            sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7\r\n            targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        compileSdkVersion androidCompileSdkVersion.toInteger()\r\n    \r\n        buildToolsVersion androidBuildToolsVersion\r\n    \r\n        sourceSets {\r\n            main {\r\n                manifest.srcFile &#39;AndroidManifest.xml&#39;\r\n                ...\r\n           }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        defaultConfig.applicationId = &quot;...&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nAlso, worth noting, this is not a &quot;pure&quot; android / Gradle project, there is native code involved, and a build system that I don&#39;t have good control over, that runs Gradle as a step in the build process. If there are multiple ways to configure the dexer parameters, I&#39;d prefer something that requires modifying build.gradle, as that is the only thing I have direct control over, inserting something into gradle.properties would require hacking the build system in ways I&#39;d rather avoid, but I&#39;ll take it if that&#39;s the only way to do it.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217404/how-the-achieve-desugaring-in-android-gradle-builds","title":"How the achieve desugaring in android gradle builds?"},{"tags":["ssh","centos"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":4079078,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03ecca6fbf67bbe7f679976581e1d8f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adrien Parad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4079078/adrien-parad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570180320,"post_id":58223850,"comment_id":102840084,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217400/rename-multiple-files-in-ssh/58223850#comment102840084_58223850"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":47128,"user_id":980550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8emhY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lurker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570122297,"creation_date":1570122297,"answer_id":58223850,"question_id":58217400,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223850","body_markdown":"The solution will depend upon what shell your CentOS system is running or has available.

parsing large XML definition files.\r\nTo achieve this I have started making classes for each &quot;type&quot; that you can encounter in the xml file.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;Element Factor=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Whatever&lt;/Element&gt;\r\n```\r\nCurrently I put each `type` from the XML file in it&#39;s own class, with a few operators and the members of the type.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of these `types` have both &quot;child elements&quot; and &quot;attributes&quot;.\r\n\r\ni.e.:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;MySimpleType min=&quot;20&quot; max=&quot;100&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;name&gt;MyName&lt;/name&gt;\r\n    &lt;SomeOtherElement&gt;xxxx&lt;/SomeOtherElement&gt;\r\n&lt;/Mysimpletype&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently the class would look like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass MySimpleType{\r\n    std::string MyName;\r\n    TSomeOtherElement SomeOtherElement;\r\n    int min;\r\n    int max;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there&#39;s a way to annotate the class members so that it becomes clear whether the member in question is an attribute or an element.\r\n\r\nThe elements can have different types (which may be another custom class) and the attributes are mostly built-ins or ADT&#39;s. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to clearly mark a member as being a &#39;element&#39; or a &#39;attribute&#39; ?\r\n\r\n(Should it matter, I&#39;m using Visual Studio 2015 with the built-in compiler, so I&#39;m using c++11)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217326/distinction-between-different-kinds-of-member-variables","title":"Distinction between different

   ranks$dominant &lt;- rank_names[x]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I try running it, however, I get 16 warnings:\r\n```\r\n1: In if (ranks[x] == 2) { ... :\r\n  the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used\r\n```\r\nand so on\r\n\r\nAlso the ranks$dominant column contains the same age level for each row, despite the fact I can see that level isn&#39;t always rank 1\r\n\r\nThis is my ranks dataframe and the column created by the code:\r\n```\r\n  Age..Age.30.to.44..measures..Value Age..Age.45.to.59..measures..Value\r\n1                                   1

I get around 1 million records (filtered with the xpath query) per hour for each server (not counting the parsing, that&#39;s why it&#39;s not relevant here) over a VPN.\r\n\r\nI understand the event log on Windows is not an indexed database so the query doesn&#39;t really speed up things (just filters them), but this is the fastest I could get (with several different techniques, including dumping the whole registry on the remote server, copying the file and/or parsing it directly via the network).\r\n\r\nIs there anything I&#39;m missing which could speed it up?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tested this on both .NET Core 3.0 and .NET Framework 4.8 with no difference on results whatsoever. Using the `wevtutil` command line with the same xpath query (using `/q:&quot;&lt;query&gt;&quot;`) give similar performance but I can&#39;t get over my head that this is the fastest that can be done.\r\n\r\nThe servers with big retention in particular are dual xeon servers with LOTS of free CPU and RAM, so I&#39;m quite positive this is not a hardware performance problem.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d be grateful for any tips\r\n\r\nPS: when I wrote the &quot;progress-showing&quot; parts are irrelevant is because I&#39;ve tried removing them (just in case outputting progress was the culprit) with no

A programming language is a set of abstract mathematical rules and restrictions. It is a specification. A piece of paper, essentially.\r\n\r\nA piece of paper doesn&#39;t have a speed in the sense we are talking about here.\r\n\r\nIn order to execute some program written in the programming language, the language needs to be *implemented*. Furthermore, you need to write a program which you can execute. And you need to execute this program in some specific *environment* (CPU, RAM, OS, machine architecture, …)\r\n\r\nThen, and only then can you measure how long it takes to run.\r\n\r\nBut now you are measuring many variables:\r\n\r\n* the program\r\n* the environment\r\n* the implementation\r\n* the specific version of the implementation\r\n* the language\r\n\r\nSince you have so many variables and only one datapoint, it is impossible to tell which variable contributed which amount to the result.\r\n\r\nMany Python benchmarks I see use CPython running on Linux on an Intel AMD64 CPU. This benchmark is a little unfair, however:\r\n\r\n* CPython is actually a very simple implementation. It does not use any of the optimizations that are typically used in high-performance language engines, such as *adaptive optimizations*, *speculative inlining*, *polymorphic inline caching*, *dynamic type feedback*, *de-virtualization*, *escape detection*, to name just a few.\r\n* Linux, like almost all modern operating systems, is not specially optimized for running Python-like languages. It is more optimized for C-like languages. For example, Linux has virtual memory, which is known to have a negative performance impact on garbage collection.\r\n* Intel AMD64 CPUs are not specially optimized for running Python-like languages. They are more optimized for C-like languages. For example, they contain optimizations which don&#39;t really help Python, when that die space and those transistors could be better spent on Python-specific optimizations.\r\n\r\nCheck out, for example, the design of the Azul Vega-3 CPU and the corresponding Operating System, both of which were specially designed for running memory-safe, pointer-safe, type-safe languages with garbage collection, dynamic dispatch, and a high degree of runtime polymorphism.\r\n\r\nIf you want a fair comparison between, for example Python and C, you need to run your Python code on a Python implementation that has the same amount of research, engineering, development, man-power, money, and resources poured into it as a C implementation (such as Microsoft Visual C, Clang/LLVM, GCC, etc.) on an Operating System that is equally optimized for running Python, on a CPU that has the same amount of research, engineering, development, man-power, money, and resources poured into it for making Python run fast and is produced using the same advanced processes that e.g. Intel Xeons are produced with.\r\n\r\nIf you spend enough research, engineering, development, man-power, money, and resources on making Python fast, then it will be fast.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of historical examples: there was a Lisp and Smalltalk hype in the 70s-90s, and people spent tons of money on Lisp and Smalltalk compilers and VMs, and lo and behold, those implementations became much faster. When the Self VM came out, it was competitive with many C++ implementations of the time. Then, Sun cut funding for the Self project, and during that time there was also a C++ hype, so money was spent on C++ compilers, and *those* became fast.\r\n\r\nAfter that, there was a Java hype, where people spent money on JVMs. (Funnily enough, the developers of Self, after Sun cut funding, founded their own company and built a Smalltalk VM, and after realizing that Java and Smalltalk were very similar, they built a JVM. This JVM was so fast that Sun bought the company to get access to the JVM technology that they would have had for free, if they hadn&#39;t pushed the developers out of the company in the first place.) Oracle HotSpot is still based on the codebase of the Animorphic Smalltalk VM written by the former Self developers.\r\n\r\nNow, we are currently in an ECMAScript hype, and as soon as companies started pouring money into ECMAScript engines, *those* became literally ten times faster in the span of just a few years. (One of the drivers of this was Google with its V8 engine, which was actually designed by some former Self developers who had left Oracle to form their own company.)\r\n\r\nThere are some quite fast Python execution engines out there. I personally am looking forward to TrufflePython. And I suspect if people started throwing money at Python implementations, they would also find that there is still a lot of potential for improvement. For example, TruffleRuby (built by the same people) has shown that it can beat C in some cases, and the team working on it is actually tiny compared to e.g. Microsoft Visual C or Clang/LLVM.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217310/can-python-language-be-the-fastest-language-in-future/58217425#58217425","title":"Can Python language be the fastest language in future?"}],"owner":{"reputation":148,"user_id":12073028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b34f63541fa327f23a7ff6def91c41a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nessi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12073028/nessi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1570101072,"accepted_answer_id":58217425,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570101451,"creation_date":1570098925,"question_id":58217310,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58217310","body_markdown":"Recently I researched python language and so many people complain about the speed of the language.

See https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_variables.html#sec_parameters-as-variables\r\n\r\n1. From the error in show1, I think variable `x` is predeclared in this Function scope. So there is a `x` variable already declared in this function.\r\n2. According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6888506/redeclaring-a-javascript-variable. The re-declaration won&#39;t do anything to `x`. Why the results of `show2` and `show3` are different.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217304/if-the-variables-are-already-declared-at-the-beginning-of-function-execution","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"If the variables are already declared at the beginning of function execution"},{"tags":["racket"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":11479158,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--NuEf4m4if0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcM2BlK9xEGz5rfsk4O1B7ufRr5eA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"tjorchrt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11479158/tjorchrt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570696892,"post_id":58217300,"comment_id":102997056,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217300/how-to-fix-contract-violation-for-lists-of-list-in-racket#comment102997056_58217300"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":7632572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hCiZn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ben Petersheim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7632572/ben-petersheim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570099685,"post_id":58217390,"comment_id":102811062,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217300/how-to-fix-contract-violation-for-lists-of-list-in-racket/58217390#comment102811062_58217390"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":59097,"user_id":388787,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f786b1ad349a30e02802ae61b4518fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dan D.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/388787/dan-d"},"last_editor":{"reputation":59097,"user_id":388787,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f786b1ad349a30e02802ae61b4518fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dan D.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/388787/dan-d"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570102447,"last_edit_date":1570102447,"creation_date":1570099177,"answer_id":58217390,"question_id":58217300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58217390","body_markdown":"`(cdr (car lst))` should be `(car (cdr (car lst)))` also `(cadr (car lst))` or in racket preferred `(second (first lst))` that is if `lst` is `&#39;((1 5))` the result should be `5`.\r\n\r\nI had to be sure this was right so I ran the program with the fix and verified the result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(define pairs &#39;((1 5)(6 4)(7 8)(15 10)))\r\n\r\n(define (secondSum lst)\r\n  (if (null? lst) 0\r\n      (+ (car (cdr (car lst))) (secondSum (cdr lst)))\r\n      )\r\n  )\r\n\r\n(secondSum pairs)\r\n\r\n(+ 5 4 8 10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last two expressions both have the value `27`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217300/how-to-fix-contract-violation-for-lists-of-list-in-racket/58217390#58217390","title":"How to fix contract violation for lists of list in racket?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":7632572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hCiZn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ben Petersheim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7632572/ben-petersheim"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570102447,"creation_date":1570098886,"question_id":58217300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58217300","body_markdown":"I am learning Racket for understanding principles of programming languages.

answer**: by specifying `Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a` you claim that `f` can deal with *all* `a`s that are members of the `Num` typeclass, but the `(/)` can only work with types that are members of the `Fractional` typeclass.\r\n\r\n[**`Fractional`**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Fractional) is a &quot;sub&quot; typeclass of `Num`. That means that all types that are a member of `Fractional` are a member of `Num`, but this does *not* hold vice versa.\r\n\r\nBy specifying as type for f:\r\n\r\n    f :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a\r\n\r\nYou say that `f` can deal with *all* types `a` that are members of the `Num` typeclass. But that is incorrect if you define `f` as `f x y = x/2 + y + 3`, since `x/2` means that `x` should be a type that is a member of `Fractional`. Indeed `(/)` has type [**`(/) :: Fractional a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a`**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:-47-). You thus should make `f` more restrictive, such that you can only pass values that are of type `a` with `a` a member of the `Fractional` typeclass:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f :: &lt;b&gt;Fractional a&lt;/b&gt; =&amp;gt; a -&amp;gt; a -&amp;gt; a\r\nf x y = x/2 + y + 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217240/why-i-get-could-not-deduce-fractional-a-arising-from-a-use-of/58217384#58217384","title":"Why I get: Could not deduce (Fractional a) arising from a use of ‘/’?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13030,"user_id":7128034,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T8aRg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dami&#225;n Rafael Lattenero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7128034/dami%c3%a1n-rafael-lattenero"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570125228,"creation_date":1570125228,"answer_id":58224483,"question_id":58217240,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58224483","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s have in mind this **kind of** typeclass hierarchy:\r\n\r\n                 Num a\r\n                 /   \\  \r\n                /     \\ \r\n               /       \\\r\n      (Fractional a)  (Integral a)\r\n          /   \\           /   \\  \r\n         /     \\         /     \\ \r\n        /       \\       /       \\\r\n     Double   Float   Integer   Int\r\n\r\nNow if you say:\r\n\r\n    f :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a\r\n\r\nYou are telling that all the **functions** that will be used by `a` will be from the `Num` typeclass, these here:\r\n\r\n    (+), (*), abs, signum, fromInteger, (negate | (-))\r\n\r\nIf you check the body of your function:\r\n\r\n    f :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a\r\n    f x y = x/2 + y + 3\r\n\r\nyou are using `(/)` function, and that function belongs to the &quot;sub&quot; typeclass of `Num`, `Fractional` and `Fractional` has these functions allowed:\r\n\r\n    fromRational, (recip | (/))\r\n\r\n&gt; Conclusion: \r\n\r\n  If you use one **function** that belongs from one o the bottom in the hierarchy, you are restricting the type to that level.\r\n\r\n&gt; Fix\r\n\r\nThe good thing is, if you read carefully the stack error, in some part of it says:\r\n\r\n      Possible fix:\r\n        add (Fractional a) to the context of\r\n          the type signature for:\r\n\r\nAnd let&#39;s try it:\r\n\r\n    f :: Fractional a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a\r\n    f x y = x/2 + y + 3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217240/why-i-get-could-not-deduce-fractional-a-arising-from-a-use-of/58224483#58224483","title":"Why I get: Could not deduce (Fractional a) arising from a use of ‘/’?"}],"owner":{"reputation":781,"user_id":1788863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgcD1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Flowryn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1788863/flowryn"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58217384,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570125228,"creation_date":1570098655,"question_id":58217240,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58217240","body_markdown":"I have the following code in a *.hs* file \r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule TypeInference1 where\r\nf :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a\r\nf x y = x + y + 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThen if I check the type of **f**, I obtain the following result, which is ok: \r\n```\r\n*TypeInference1&gt; :t f\r\nf :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I pass to **f** one parameter of type fractional and check its type I obtain:\r\n```\r\n*TypeInference1&gt; :t f 1.0\r\nf 1.0 :: Fractional a =&gt; a -&gt; a\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand if I change the **f** by setting a division operation on one of its arguments, as follows:\r\n`f x y = x/2 + y + 3`\r\n\r\nI obtain the following error: \r\n\r\n    5-typeInference1.hs:4:9: error:\r\n        • Could not deduce (Fractional a) arising from a use of ‘/’\r\n          from the context: Num a\r\n            bound by the type signature for:\r\n                       f :: forall a.

Am I missing something with the ajax call or returning the correct response from the PHP?\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;print_delay_report&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function () {\r\n\r\n        $.ajax({\r\n            url: &#39;php_files/report_php_files/report_delay_process.php&#39;\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\nand the below PHP code to create an xlsx file called hello_world.xlsx\r\n\r\n        &lt;?php\r\n\r\n        require (&quot;../vendor/autoload.php&quot;);\r\n\r\n        use PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Spreadsheet;\r\n        use PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Xlsx;\r\n\r\n        \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Shared\\File::setUseUploadTempDirectory(true);\r\n\r\n        $spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet();\r\n        $sheet = $spreadsheet-&gt;getActiveSheet();\r\n        $sheet-&gt;setCellValue(&#39;A1&#39;, &#39;Hello World !&#39;);\r\n\r\n        $writer = new Xlsx($spreadsheet);\r\n        $writer = \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\IOFactory::createWriter($spreadsheet, &#39;Xlsx&#39;);\r\n\r\n        header(&#39;Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel&#39;);\r\n        header(&#39;Content-Disposition: attachment;

is an approach using user-defined variables. It is noteworthy that even Windowing functions cannot be used in a straightforward manner in this problem. Nevertheless, your version is old, and don&#39;t support them either. Following solution is generic, and handle scenario if you dont use `WHERE` condition on the `device_id` and want multiple `device_id` in the result-set. \r\n\r\nGeneral idea here is that we compute an &quot;island number&quot; (denoted as `chng` in the query) for successive rows (based on timestamp) having same `device_id` and `status` value (either ON or OFF). Eventually, we can filter out only those island which are having `ON` status, and then do aggregation to get `MIN()` (start timestamp), and `MAX()` (stop timestamp).\r\n\r\n**Schema (MySQL v5.7)**\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE device_stats\r\n        (`id` int, `device_id` varchar(11), `status` varchar(3), `timestamp` int, `device_iddr` int)\r\n    ;\r\n        \r\n    INSERT INTO device_stats\r\n        (`id`, `device_id`, `status`, `timestamp`, `device_iddr`)\r\n    VALUES\r\n        (16416, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570080242, 1),\r\n        (16427, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570080363, 1),\r\n        (16438, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570080483, 1),\r\n        (16449, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570080602, 1),\r\n        (16460, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570080723, 1),\r\n        (16471, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570080842, 1),\r\n        (16482, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570080963, 1),\r\n        (16493, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081083, 1),\r\n        (16504, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081203, 1),\r\n        (16515, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081323, 1),\r\n        (16526, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081443, 1),\r\n        (16537, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081563, 1),\r\n        (16548, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081682, 1),\r\n        (16559, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081803, 1),\r\n        (16570, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570081922, 1),\r\n        (16581, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082042, 1),\r\n        (16592, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082163, 1),\r\n        (16603, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082283, 1),\r\n        (16614, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082402, 1),\r\n        (16625, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082523, 1),\r\n        (16636, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082643, 1),\r\n        (16647, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082762, 1),\r\n        (16658, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570082882, 1),\r\n        (16669, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083003, 1),\r\n        (16680, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083123, 1),\r\n        (16691, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083242, 1),\r\n        (16702, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083363, 1),\r\n        (16713, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083483, 1),\r\n        (16724, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083603, 1),\r\n        (16735, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083722, 1),\r\n        (16746, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083843, 1),\r\n        (16757, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570083963, 1),\r\n        (16768, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570084083, 1),\r\n        (16779, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570084202, 1),\r\n        (16790, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570084323, 1),\r\n        (16801, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570084442, 1),\r\n        (16812, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570084563, 1),\r\n        (16823, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;ON&#39;, 1570084683, 1),\r\n        (16834, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570084803, 1),\r\n        (16845, &#39;LivingLight&#39;, &#39;OFF&#39;, 1570084922, 1)\r\n    ;\r\n    \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Query #1**\r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n      device_id, MIN(timestamp) AS start, MAX(timestamp) AS stop \r\n    FROM \r\n    (\r\n    SELECT\r\n      @c := IF(@s &lt;&gt;

Here is the code of the activity handling the database checking and moving the results to the presenter - \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Override\r\n  public void onPageAgreed() {\r\n    // current page is accepted, move to next\r\n    int cur = viewPager.getCurrentItem();\r\n    if (cur == adapter.getCount() - 1) {\r\n      // ask for permission\r\n      requestPhoneState();\r\n    } else {\r\n      // move to next\r\n      viewPager.setCurrentItem(cur + 1, true);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private void requestPhoneState() {\r\n    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE)\r\n        != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\r\n      ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE}, RC_PERMISSION_READ_STATE);\r\n    } else {\r\n      // retrieve IMEI\r\n      accessDeviceIdAndVerifyDB(this);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  protected void onRequestPermissionsResultPostResume(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {\r\n    super.onRequestPermissionsResultPostResume(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);\r\n    if (requestCode == RC_PERMISSION_READ_STATE\r\n        &amp;&amp; permissions.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; StringUtils.equals(permissions[0], Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE)\r\n        &amp;&amp; grantResults.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\r\n      // granted, read IMEI\r\n      accessDeviceIdAndVerifyDB(this);\r\n    } else {\r\n      // failed\r\n      onErrorDeviceIdNotGrantedPermission();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private void accessDeviceIdAndVerifyDB(Activity activity) {\r\n    if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(activity, Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\r\n      TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) activity.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);\r\n      if (telephonyManager != null) {\r\n        @SuppressLint(&quot;HardwareIds&quot;) String deviceId = telephonyManager.getDeviceId();\r\n        if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(deviceId)) {\r\n          checkDeviceIdWithDB(deviceId);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private void checkDeviceIdWithDB(String deviceId) {\r\n    presenter.onDeviceIdReceived(deviceId);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like I am stuck in a loop where I have to move a reference of my dialog all over a few classes just in order to cancel it, which seems really broken. How can I cancel my dialog more easily?\r\n\r\n\r\nedit - \r\n\r\nI have added this code before the point where the activity is being finished - \r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n  public void sendDeviceIdResult(String deviceId, boolean isAlreadyExist) {\r\n\r\n    int currentItem = viewPager.getCurrentItem();\r\n    Fragment item = adapter.getItem(currentItem);\r\n    if (item instanceof PhoneStateAndAgeVerificationFragment) {\r\n      Dialog dialog = ((PhoneStateAndAgeVerificationFragment) item).getProgressDialog();\r\n      if (dialog != null &amp;&amp; dialog.isShowing()) {\r\n        dialog.dismiss();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Intent intent = new Intent();\r\n    intent.putExtra(KEY_DEVICE_ID, deviceId);\r\n    intent.putExtra(KEY_IS_SUCCESS, !isAlreadyExist);\r\n    setResult(RESULT_OK, intent);\r\n    finish();\r\n\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut at this point my dialog is always null and I can&#39;t figure out if at this point it will be always null and the check is redundant or I am doing something total wrong?

I did update the .csproj file and I even tried the Package manager Console option and I still get the error.\r\n\r\nI am using Visual Studio 19 fully upgraded to version 16.4.0 Preview 1.\r\n\r\nHow do I get this warning to disappear ie how do I update the EF tools?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\nSo I rebuilt my project from scratch making sure that I added all the packages again and still got the same outcome.\r\n\r\nI also deleted everything in the nuget directory and let it reload all the packages again and still got the same outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project consists of three projects the web project and two database class libraries. \r\n\r\nHere is my csproj file for the web project.\r\n\r\n&lt;Project Sdk=&quot;Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;TargetFramework&gt;netcoreapp3.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;TypeScriptCompileBlocked&gt;true&lt;/TypeScriptCompileBlocked&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;TypeScriptToolsVersion&gt;3.6&lt;/TypeScriptToolsVersion&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;TypeScriptBuildMode&gt;true&lt;/TypeScriptBuildMode&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Compile Remove=&quot;ControllerServices\\Catalog\\UserServices\\UserValidateService.cs&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Compile Remove=&quot;Controllers\\SampleDataController.cs&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Compile Remove=&quot;Controllers\\SelectDataController.cs&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Content Remove=&quot;wwwroot\\favicon.ico&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;None Remove=&quot;ClientApp\\app\\components\\clients\\clientList\\client-detail-view.ts&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;None Remove=&quot;ClientApp\\app\\components\\clients\\clientList\\objectkeysValueConverter.ts&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;None Remove=&quot;ClientApp\\app\\navmenu\\ActiveRoute.ts&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;FluentValidation&quot; Version=&quot;8.5.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer&quot; Version=&quot;3.0.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson&quot; Version=&quot;3.0.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore&quot; Version=&quot;3.0.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational&quot; Version=&quot;3.0.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer&quot; Version=&quot;3.0.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools&quot; Version=&quot;3.0.0&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t  &lt;PrivateAssets&gt;all&lt;/PrivateAssets&gt;\r\n\t\t  &lt;IncludeAssets&gt;runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive&lt;/IncludeAssets&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/PackageReference&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens&quot; Version=&quot;5.5.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;System.Linq.Dynamic.Core&quot; Version=&quot;1.0.19&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;Folder Include=&quot;wwwroot\\&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;ProjectReference Include=&quot;..\\JobsLedger.CATALOG\\JobsLedger.CATALOG.csproj&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;ProjectReference Include=&quot;..\\JobsLedger.DATA\\JobsLedger.DATA.csproj&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;TypeScriptCompile Include=&quot;ClientApp\\app\\components\\clients\\clientList\\client-detail-view.ts&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;TypeScriptCompile Include=&quot;ClientApp\\app\\navmenu\\activeRoute.ts&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design&quot; Version=&quot;3.0.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;Target Name=&quot;DebugRunWebpack&quot; BeforeTargets=&quot;Build&quot; Condition=&quot; &#39;$(Configuration)&#39; == &#39;Debug&#39; And !Exists(&#39;wwwroot\\dist&#39;) &quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;!-- Ensure Node.js is installed --&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Exec Command=&quot;node --version&quot; ContinueOnError=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;Output TaskParameter=&quot;ExitCode&quot; PropertyName=&quot;ErrorCode&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/Exec&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Error Condition=&quot;&#39;$(ErrorCode)&#39; != &#39;0&#39;&quot; Text=&quot;Node.js is required to build and run this project.

(I&#39;d have a masterlist of countries and fruits to check)\r\n\r\nHere is my code, that I wrote as a test:\r\n\r\n    Sub Match()\r\n        crit1 = Sheets(&quot;Sheet4&quot;).Range(&quot;G1&quot;).Value\r\n        crit2 = Sheets(&quot;Sheet4&quot;).Range(&quot;F1&quot;).Value\r\n        Match = Application.WorksheetFunction.Match(crit1 &amp; crit2, Range(&quot;A1:B10&quot;), 0)\r\n        MsgBox Match\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nMy question is quite complex, I hope I could explain with clarity. I&#39;d really appreciate the help!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: here&#39;s some clarification that I also explained in the comments:\r\n\r\n&quot;So the three letter suffixes (`ZZZ` etc) can be ignored, It is there to show that the cells don&#39;t contain an exact string match. So on `Sheet2` I have somewhere a row containing say &quot;Slovakia&quot; in cell `Ax` and &quot;`Apples`&quot; in `Bx`, then I need to find a row on `Sheet1` containing &quot;`Slovakia`&quot; somewhere in `column A` and also &quot;`Apples`&quot; in `column B` next to it. That would be a match. The fruit name is always an exact matching string. The country and fruit values would be rotated dynamically based on a masterlist&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217158/how-to-find-rows-on-two-sheets-with-similar-attributes-and-match-them","title":"How to find rows on two sheets with similar attributes and match them?"},{"tags":["reactjs","graphql","react-apollo","apollo-client"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570108998,"post_id":58217154,"comment_id":102816003,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217154/graphql-with-react-apollo-cannot-read-property-of-undefined#comment102816003_58217154"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":4371498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/26cdae60fd31cbd0d595a81b4d8be71a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Terje Laugaland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4371498/terje-laugaland"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570108109,"creation_date":1570108109,"answer_id":58219861,"question_id":58217154,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58219861","body_markdown":"Do you check if data has loaded yet?\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (loading) return &quot;data not fetched yet&quot;;\r\nreturn &lt;p&gt;{ firstName }&lt;/p&gt;;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217154/graphql-with-react-apollo-cannot-read-property-of-undefined/58219861#58219861","title":"GraphQL with React-Apollo: Cannot read property of undefined"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570109116,"post_id":58219997,"comment_id":102816080,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217154/graphql-with-react-apollo-cannot-read-property-of-undefined/58219997#comment102816080_58219997"},{"owner":{"reputation":6121,"user_id":138261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4aTA3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Calvin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/138261/calvin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570197908,"post_id":58219997,"comment_id":102848708,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217154/graphql-with-react-apollo-cannot-read-property-of-undefined/58219997#comment102848708_58219997"},{"owner":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570198635,"post_id":58219997,"comment_id":102849041,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58217154/graphql-with-react-apollo-cannot-read-property-of-undefined/58219997#comment102849041_58219997"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6121,"user_id":138261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4aTA3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Calvin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/138261/calvin"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570108602,"creation_date":1570108602,"answer_id":58219997,"question_id":58217154,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58219997","body_markdown":"You&#39;re de-structuring the `data` variable before it exists/has loaded.
