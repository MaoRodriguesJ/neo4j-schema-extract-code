And almost there.\r\n\r\nAfter splitting all of the names you&#39;ll need to compare if one of the names given corresponds somehow with the right element in your HTML. You could do this multiple ways, like checking for the `innerText`, or the `className` or an `id` of one of the `&lt;li class=&quot;name name-x&quot;&gt;` elements.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve modified your HTML so that every one of your `&lt;li&gt;` elements has an `id`. This makes them unique and easy to select. I&#39;ve also have given the `&lt;input&gt;` element an `id` for the same reason.\r\n\r\nFor the event listener listen to either `change` or `input`. Either of them triggers on whenever the value has been changed, so that means also when a user types, or pastes a string into it. For the example I&#39;ve chosen `input` as you&#39;ll only want anything to happen whenever the *text* of the `&lt;input&gt;` is changed. Read [this other SO post][1] to learn what the difference between `change` and `input` entails.\r\n\r\nBecause I couldn&#39;t find the jQuery function necessary to build on your example I&#39;ve chosen to do it with ES6.

If you have any questions regarding the code below, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps you out.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    // Select the input.\r\n    const input = document.getElementById(&#39;name&#39;);\r\n\r\n    // Select the &lt;li class=&quot;name&quot;&gt; elements.\r\n    const names = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.name&#39;);\r\n\r\n    // Listen to the &#39;input&#39; event.

Then it stores those values in array where it will filter values that only contains an `@` in the beginning. Then it makes a comparison with another array that has those values.

BackgroundJobFilter(app.ApplicationServices));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen I&#39;ve replaced current job activator \r\n```csharp\r\n    internal class ServiceJobActivatorScope : JobActivatorScope\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly IServiceScope _serviceScope;\r\n\r\n        public ServiceJobActivatorScope([NotNull] IServiceScope serviceScope)\r\n        {\r\n            if (serviceScope == null)\r\n                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(serviceScope));\r\n\r\n            _serviceScope = serviceScope;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override object Resolve(Type type)\r\n        {\r\n            return ActivatorUtilities.GetServiceOrCreateInstance(_serviceScope.ServiceProvider, type);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override void DisposeScope()\r\n        {\r\n            _serviceScope.Dispose();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, set current user details (which is null on the moment of running task)\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n  public class CustomJobActivator : JobActivator\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly IServiceScopeFactory _serviceScopeFactory;\r\n        private readonly IMapper _objectMapper;\r\n\r\n\r\n        public CustomJobActivator([NotNull] IServiceScopeFactory serviceScopeFactory, IMapper objectMapper)\r\n        {\r\n            if (serviceScopeFactory == null)\r\n                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(serviceScopeFactory));\r\n\r\n            _serviceScopeFactory = serviceScopeFactory;\r\n            _objectMapper = objectMapper;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override JobActivatorScope BeginScope(JobActivatorContext context)\r\n        {\r\n            var user = context.GetJobParameter&lt;WebUser&gt;(nameof(ICurrentUser));\r\n\r\n            var serviceScope = _serviceScopeFactory.CreateScope();\r\n\r\n            var currentUser = serviceScope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;ICurrentUser&gt;();\r\n            //Copy value from user to currentUser\r\n            _objectMapper.Map(user, currentUser);\r\n\r\n            return new ServiceJobActivatorScope(serviceScope);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen replace the existing JobAcivator in container \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nservices.Replace(new ServiceDescriptor(typeof(JobActivator), typeof(CustomJobActivator), ServiceLifetime.Scoped));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that when services start resolving from this scope they will get user context and all filter in DbContext and other places when I use ICurrentUser works properly.

Despite being able to call tao_idl and opendds_idl yourself, you should basically never do it. There are a good amount of command-line arguments needed to get both to work, and if they&#39;re not present, each exe will crash without the proper reasoning why.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will add my steps below to create a new basic two-exe pub/sub project using OpenDDS: \r\n\r\n 1. Create your own IDL file.\r\n 2. Starting with the DCPS Messenger example, modify the .mpc file, replacing `Messenger.idl` with your IDL file name.\r\n 3. Create a new file called `&lt;your project&gt;.mwc`, and add the following contents:\r\n\r\n        workspace {\r\n          // the -relative and -include cmdlines make it so this workspace \r\n          // does not have to be in the $DDS_ROOT directory tree.\r\n    \r\n          // tell MPC to substitute our DDS_ROOT environment variables for relative paths\r\n          cmdline += -relative DDS_ROOT=$DDS_ROOT\r\n    \r\n          // tell the projects where to find the DDS base projects (*.mpb)\r\n          cmdline += -include $DDS_ROOT/MPC/config\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n\r\n 4. Open a new VS command-line terminal and run `$DDS_ROOT/setenv.cmd`, or open a regular terminal if you have those environment variables set via Windows settings.\r\n\r\n 5. Navigate to your project directory and call: `mwc.pl -type vs2017`, replacing &quot;vs2017&quot; as needed for your build tool/IDE.\r\n\r\n 6. Open up the generated solution, and retarget it as necessary for your Windows SDK version. \r\n\r\n 7. Build the `&lt;your project&gt;_IDL` project first. If you notice in the output window, it is invoking the `tao_idl` and `opendds_idl` commands automatically. You can view the `.vcxproj` files to see the full command-line arguments that were the original problem.\r\n\r\n 8. Modify the `publisher.cpp`, `subscriber.cpp`, and `DataReaderListenerImpl.cpp` files to match your new IDL. Run the example as usual and ta-da!\r\n\r\nFor completeness, the full commands for both `tao_idl` and `opendds_idl` are as follows:\r\n\r\n    &gt; opendds_idl -Sa -St &quot;&lt;your file&gt;.idl&quot;\r\n\r\n    &gt; tao_idl -Wb,pre_include=ace/pre.h -Wb,post_include=ace/post.h -I$(TAO_ROOT) -Sa -St -I$(DDS_ROOT) &quot;&lt;your file&gt;.idl&quot;\r\n\r\n    &gt; tao_idl -Wb,pre_include=ace/pre.h -Wb,post_include=ace/post.h -I$(TAO_ROOT) -Sa -St -I$(DDS_ROOT) &quot;&lt;your file&gt;TypeSupport.idl&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101613/opendds-solution-builds-fine-examples-run-but-idl-exes-crash/58123623#58123623","title":"OpenDDS - Solution builds fine, examples run, but IDL exes crash"}],"owner":{"reputation":284,"user_id":4130319,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbNwT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4130319/alan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":284,"user_id":4130319,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbNwT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4130319/alan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570558344,"creation_date":1569424367,"last_edit_date":1569495576,"question_id":58101613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58101613","body_markdown":"I have successfully built OpenDDS 3.13.2 from source.

Things have been going swimmingly, but when I want to convert the byte-data back to a String, I decided on using a ByteArrayOutputStream. However, when I try to write to it using .write(byte[], offset, bytes], it throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve messed around with it a bit, and the only configuration of the .write(x, y, z,) call that works is (byte[], 0, 1). When I print the result, it displays as a tilde(~). Any bigger throws the same exception. I&#39;ve verified that the byte array is large enough to write to it, both by printing its contents and making a new byte array and slotting it in. Additionally, it still throws the error even if I manually assign the ByteArrayOutputStream length to be 126 in the constructor call. If I do so, the .size() method still returns a 0.

Here I just have to queue the insances and the solver manager would assign the problems to pyro mip servers. But the pyro mip servers occupy a lot of memory and retain it even after the final result is computed.\r\nusing opt solver.\r\na) I can solve using the opt solver directly, but it is slow.\r\nb) using multi threading.

To estimate the probability of getting a flush in *general*, which I believe is what you&#39;re after, you have to run that experiment many thousands of times over. In practice this is called a Monte Carlo simulation. \r\n\r\n&gt; **Side note**: When I began learning about Monte Carlos I thought they were a sort of &quot;magical&quot;, mysteriously complex thing... mostly because their name sounds so exotic. Don&#39;t be fooled. &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; is just an overly fancy and [arbitrary][1] name for &quot;simulation&quot;. They can be quite elementary.\r\n\r\nEven so, simulations are kind of magical because you can use them to brute force a solution out of a complex system even when a mathematical model of that system is hard to come by. Say, for example, you don&#39;t have a firm understanding of combination or permutation math - which would produce the exact answer to your question *&quot;What are the odds of getting a flush?&quot;*. We can run many simulations of your card game to figure out what that probability would be to a high degree of certainty. I&#39;ve done that below (commented out parts of your original code that weren&#39;t needed):\r\n\r\n    from collections import namedtuple\r\n    from random import shuffle\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    \r\n    #%% What is the likelyhood of getting flush? Mathematical derivation\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot; A flush consists of five cards which are all of the same suit.\r\n    We must remember that there are four suits each with a total of 13 cards.\r\n    Thus a flush is a combination of five cards from a total of 13 of the same suit.\r\n    This is done in C(13, 5) = 1287 ways.\r\n    Since there are four different suits, there are a total of 4 x 1287 = 5148 flushes possible. \r\n    Some of these flushes have already been counted as higher ranked hands.\r\n    We must subtract the number of straight flushes and royal flushes from 5148 in order to\r\n    obtain flushes that are not of a higher rank.\r\n    There are 36 straight flushes and 4 royal flushes.\r\n    We must make sure not to double count these hands.\r\n    This means that there are 5148 – 40 = 5108 flushes that are not of a higher rank. \r\n    We can now calculate the probability of a flush as 5108/2,598,960 = 0.1965%.\r\n    This probability is approximately 1/509. So in the long run, one out of every 509 hands is a flush.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    &quot;SOURCE: https://www.thoughtco.com/probability-of-a-flush-3126591&quot;\r\n    \r\n    mathematically_derived_flush_probability = 5108/2598960 * 100\r\n    \r\n    #%% What is the likelyhood of getting flush?

To prove that our simulation arrived at the correct answer we can compare its output after 80,000 hands:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, our simulated `flush_probability` (in blue) approaches the mathematically derived probability (in black). \r\n\r\nSimilarly, below is a plot of the `estimation_error` between the simulated probability and the mathematically derived value. As you can see, the estimation error was more than `100%` off in the early runs of the simulation but gradually rose to within `5%` of the error.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nIf you were to run the simulation for, say, twice the number of hands, then we would see that the blue and red lines eventually overlap with the black horizontal line in both charts - signifying that the simulated answer becomes equivalent to the mathematically derived answer.\r\n\r\n# To simulate or not to simulate?\r\n\r\nFinally, you might wonder,\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;If I can generate a precise answer to a problem by simulating it, then why bother with all the complicated math in the first place?&quot;*\r\n\r\nThe answer is, as with just about any decision in life, &quot;trade offs&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn our example, we could run the simulation over enough hands to get a precise answer with a high degree of confidence. However, if one is running a simulation because they *don&#39;t know* the answer (which is often the case), then one needs to answer another question,\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;How long do I run the simulation to be confident I have the right answer?&quot;*\r\n\r\nThe answer to that seems simple: \r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;Run it for a long time.&quot;*\r\n\r\nEventually your estimated outputs could converge to a single value such that outputs from additional simulations don&#39;t drastically change from prior runs. The problem here is that in some cases, depending on the complexity of the system you&#39;re simulating, seemingly convergent output may be a temporary phenomena. That is, if you ran a hundred thousand more simulations, you might begin to see your outputs diverge from what you thought was your stable answer. In a different scenario, despite having run tens of millions of simulations, it could happen that an output still hasn&#39;t converged. Do you have the time to program and run the simulation? Or would a mathematical approximation get you there sooner?\r\n\r\nThere is yet another concern:\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;What is the cost?&quot;\r\n\r\nConsumer computers are relatively cheap today but 30 years ago they cost [$4,000 to $9,000][4] in 2019 dollars. In comparison, a [TI89 only cost $215][5] (again, in 2019 dollars). So if you were asking this question back in 1990 and you were good with probability math, you could have saved $3,800 by using a TI89. Cost is just as important today: simulating [self-driving](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/waymo-has-now-driven-10-billion-autonomous-miles-in-simulation/) cars and [protein folding](http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/08/d-wave-quantum-computer-solves-protein-folding-problem.html) can burn many millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nFinally, mission critical applications may require both a simulation and a mathematical model to cross check the results of both approaches. A tidy example of this is when Matt Parker of StandUpMaths calculated [the odds of landing on any property in the game of Monopoly][6] by simulation and confirmed those results with Hannah Fry&#39;s mathematical model of the same game.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#History\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/N5kda.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SUtUv.png\r\n  [4]: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/why-30-year-old-macintosh-works-better-todays/591154/\r\n  [5]: https://www.thocp.net/hardware/ti_calculators.htm\r\n  [6]: https://youtu.be/ubQXz5RBBtU?t=335","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101497/calculate-probability-of-a-flush-in-poker/58106397#58106397","title":"Calculate probability of a flush in poker"}],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":9022690,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0ce0b2daee75aff3ef471a1735143ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"l.m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9022690/l-m"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1725,"user_id":3491991,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmHXU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zelusp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3491991/zelusp"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58106397,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570558862,"creation_date":1569424001,"last_edit_date":1570558862,"question_id":58101497,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58101497","body_markdown":"I have the code to keep going through a loop until a flush is made.\r\nnow I am trying to make it where I use count to show how many hands are dealt then divide by one to get the probability. \r\n\r\nFor the code i have right now using count it returns it as 0\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom collections import namedtuple\r\nfrom random import shuffle\r\n\r\nCard = namedtuple(&quot;Card&quot;, &quot;suit, rank&quot;)\r\n\r\nclass Deck:\r\n    suits = &#39;♦♥♠♣&#39;\r\n    ranks = &#39;23456789JQKA&#39;\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.cards = [Card(suit, rank) for suit in self.suits for rank in self.ranks]\r\n        shuffle(self.cards)\r\n\r\n    def deal(self, amount):\r\n        return tuple(self.cards.pop() for _ in range(amount))\r\n\r\nflush = False\r\ncount = 0\r\nwhile not flush:\r\n    \r\n    deck = Deck()\r\n    stop = False\r\n    while len(deck.cards) &gt;

The problem with testing spaghetti code - and here I mean code which both does something and creates lots of objects at the same time - is that from the outside there is no access to objects created inside a method and stored in a local variable. There are two ways to refactor your code for better testability:\r\n\r\n* If it makes sense, change the code so as to enable the user to inject the dependencies from the outside instead of the code creating them internally. Please google &quot;dependency injection&quot; and find variants like\r\n\r\n  * constructor injection,\r\n  * setter injection,\r\n  * method parameter injection,\r\n  * field injection when using tools/paradigms like CDI.\r\n\r\n* Another way is to factor out the object-creating parts of the method into smaller producer (or creator or factory) methods which then you can overwrite (stub) according to your choice in your test when using a partial mock (spy) object. Spock provides such spies, so you can easily use them.\r\n\r\nI am going to show the latter approach for your information:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    package de.scrum_master.stackoverflow.q58101434;\r\n    \r\n    import org.springframework.http.*;\r\n    import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;\r\n    \r\n    import java.net.URI;\r\n    import java.net.URISyntaxException;\r\n    import java.util.Arrays;\r\n    \r\n    public class MyRestApi {\r\n      public HttpStatus api() throws URISyntaxException {\r\n        //Code to call an API and i want to test this in groovy spock\r\n        HttpHeaders httpHeaders = createHttpHeaders();\r\n        RestTemplate restTemplate = createRestTemplate();\r\n        String url =&quot;url&quot;;\r\n        String body =&quot;body&quot;;\r\n        //How to mock below line\r\n        RequestEntity&lt;String&gt; requestEntity = createRequestEntity(url, body);\r\n        //And this line\r\n        ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; responseEntity = executeRequest(restTemplate, requestEntity);\r\n        return responseEntity.getStatusCode();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      HttpHeaders createHttpHeaders() {\r\n        HttpHeaders httpHeaders = new HttpHeaders();\r\n        httpHeaders.setAccept(Arrays.asList(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON));\r\n        httpHeaders.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\r\n        return httpHeaders;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      RestTemplate createRestTemplate() {\r\n        return new RestTemplate();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      RequestEntity&lt;String&gt; createRequestEntity(String url, String body) throws URISyntaxException {\r\n        return RequestEntity.put(new URI(url)).contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).body(body);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; executeRequest(RestTemplate restTemplate, RequestEntity&lt;String&gt; requestEntity) {\r\n        return restTemplate.exchange(requestEntity,String.class);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSee how the method is more structured and more readable now (could still be improved, I just did it in a quick &amp; dirty way)? Please especially notice the helper methods `createRequestEntity` and `executeRequest`.\r\n\r\nNow here is how you can write your Spock test:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-groovy --&gt;\r\n\r\n    package de.scrum_master.stackoverflow.q58101434\r\n    \r\n    import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus\r\n    import org.springframework.http.RequestEntity\r\n    import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity\r\n    import spock.lang.Specification\r\n    import spock.lang.Unroll\r\n    \r\n    class MyRestApiTest extends Specification {\r\n      @Unroll\r\n      def &quot;API returns status code #statusCode&quot;() {\r\n        given: &quot;prepare mocks + spy&quot;\r\n        RequestEntity&lt;String&gt; requestEntity = Mock()\r\n        ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; responseEntity = Mock() {\r\n          getStatusCode() &gt;&gt; httpStatus\r\n        }\r\n        MyRestApi myRestApi = Spy() {\r\n          createRequestEntity(_, _) &gt;&gt; requestEntity\r\n          executeRequest(_, _) &gt;&gt; responseEntity\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        when: &quot;execute API method&quot;\r\n        def result = myRestApi.api()\r\n    \r\n        then: &quot;check expected results&quot;\r\n        // This actually only tests mockfunctionality, your real test would look differently\r\n        statusCode == result.value()\r\n        reasonPhrase == result.reasonPhrase\r\n    \r\n        where:\r\n        httpStatus                   | statusCode | reasonPhrase\r\n        HttpStatus.OK                | 200        | &quot;OK&quot;\r\n        HttpStatus.MOVED_PERMANENTLY | 301        | &quot;Moved Permanently&quot;\r\n        HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED      | 401        | &quot;Unauthorized&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask (related!) follow-up questions if you do not understand this code.

 &gt;&lt;/app-dossier-correspondence-list&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    this.authService.loginStatus().subscribe(user =&gt; {\r\n      const UUID = user.profile.participant;\r\n\r\n      this.documentCorrespondeceService.getDossierEntry(UUID, &#39;correspondence&#39;).subscribe(result =&gt;
