an HTTP request from a model to a route on the same app results in request timeout.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nWhy would you want to http request itself rather than call a method or something?\r\n\r\nHere is my story: there is a rails app A (let&#39;s call it shop) and a rails app B (let&#39; call it warehouse) that talk to each other over http.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to be able to run both of them in a single system test to test end-to-end workflow.

I don&#39;t know where to start so any hint would be great!\r\n\r\nI can give additional details if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166157/using-nni-inside-of-google-colaboratory","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"Using NNI inside of Google Colaboratory"},{"tags":["r","curve-fitting","nls"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":100,"user_id":5123111,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e68e118a9a46845593e4a5c9a1098d3a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lazarea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5123111/lazarea"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570698478,"post_id":58166965,"comment_id":102997928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166155/what-causes-improper-input-parameters-when-using-nlslm-from-minpack-lm/58166965#comment102997928_58166965"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3734,"user_id":10488504,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MEwgs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GKi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10488504/gki"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569842746,"creation_date":1569842746,"answer_id":58166965,"question_id":58166155,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58166965","body_markdown":"You want to estimate to many coefficients with too less observations.

It doesn&#39;t show the full grid in the canvas\r\n\r\nYou have to sync, the `width` of the `Canvas` with the `width` of the `Frame` inside.  \r\n&gt;**Note**: `fm_grid = tk.Frame(canvas,

`canvas.create_window(...`.  \r\nAlso, i recommend **not** to use a offset `(4, 4)`, because you have to calculate with this offset on every `canvas.configure(..., width=width + 4`. **Use `(0, 0)` instead**.\r\n&gt;\r\n    # fm_grid.pack()\r\n    ...\r\n    canvas.create_window((4,4),window=fm_grid,anchor=&#39;nw&#39;)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt;**Useless**, to create dynamically window:  \r\n\r\n- Your usage of `canvas.bbox` is useless, because it&#39;s the dimension you want to layout this widget. \r\n\r\n- Using a fixed `width=200`, smaller than `fm_grid.width` will **allways cut** the `fm_grid` content, it&#39;s **not dynamically** either.\r\n&gt;```\r\n&gt;   canvas.configure(scrollregion=canvas.bbox(&quot;all&quot;),width=200,height=200)\r\n&gt;   ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt;**How to sync the `width` of the `Canvas` with the `width` of the `Frame` inside?**  \r\n\r\n- You bound `fm_grid.bind(&quot;&lt;Configure&gt;&quot;`, therefore the `event.widget` **is** `fm_grid`, the `Frame` inside. \r\n- Get the dimensions of the `event.widget` from there `w.winfo_...` and build a `bbox` tuple to set `scrollregion`. \r\n- Use `width` to set `canvas.width`, to be in sync with the `event.widget.winfo_width()`.\r\n    ```\r\n    class ScrollCanvas(tk.Canvas):\r\n        def __init__(self, parent, **kwargs):\r\n            super().__init__(parent, **kwargs)\r\n        \r\n

It helps to create objects, in our case AlertDialog(s). Now when you want to view method signature of an Android method or function like `setContentView()` , you can do so by using *Ctrl+Click* or *Command+Click*. You will then be able to view what arguments or parameters to pass to the method.\r\n\r\nFor Builder however, you chain a series or methods on the builder itself, like:\r\n```\r\n// 1. Instantiate an AlertDialog.Builder with its constructor\r\nAlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity()); // getActivity() when you are on a Fragment, ActivityName.this when you are on an Activity\r\n\r\n// 2. Chain together various setter methods to set the dialog characteristics\r\nbuilder.setMessage(R.string.dialog_message)\r\n       .setTitle(R.string.dialog_title);\r\n\r\n// 3. Get the AlertDialog create()\r\nAlertDialog dialog = builder.create();\r\n\r\n// 4. Show the dialog\r\ndialog.show()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRead more about Alert Dialogs on the [official documentation][2]. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\r\n  [2]: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#java","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166070/andriod-alertdialog-builder-method-gives-error-on-getactivity-being-passed-in/58167582#58167582","title":"Andriod AlertDialog.Builder method gives error on getActivity() being passed in"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":10943690,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-P4Dya5O1_bU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAOGQ/_6JheKPsLjM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Preety","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10943690/preety"},"last_editor":{"reputation":502,"user_id":3283350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hfjEh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ravi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3283350/ravi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569849440,"last_edit_date":1569849440,"creation_date":1569845518,"answer_id":58167677,"question_id":58166070,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58167677","body_markdown":" Try this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(ActivityName.this);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`getActivity()` method is used in fragment to get the context of parent activity.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166070/andriod-alertdialog-builder-method-gives-error-on-getactivity-being-passed-in/58167677#58167677","title":"Andriod AlertDialog.Builder method gives error on getActivity() being passed in"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":427,"user_id":9186913,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zy4cI0njmjQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAI14/mwCaW1WNM9E/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"raj kavadia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9186913/raj-kavadia"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569848499,"creation_date":1569848499,"answer_id":58168483,"question_id":58166070,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58168483","body_markdown":"Use RequireContext() instad of getContext(); because when context is null it will get error but not in case of RequireContext();","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166070/andriod-alertdialog-builder-method-gives-error-on-getactivity-being-passed-in/58168483#58168483","title":"Andriod AlertDialog.Builder method gives error on getActivity() being passed in"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":10852037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8089e2d413e52793021de253254b1f5b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nageshwor Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10852037/nageshwor-shah"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2176,"user_id":3780040,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g8J5b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Milo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3780040/milo"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":5,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569849440,"creation_date":1569839562,"last_edit_date":1569846142,"question_id":58166070,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166070","body_markdown":"I have made a package in `com.example.expensemanager`, named model.

Otherwise what could happen is like that: `fetch` takes longer than expected, meantime the component is re-rendered for whatever reason. Maybe because its parent is re-rendered. The cleanup of `useEffect` runs before re-render and the `useEffect` itself runs after re-render. To avoid having another `fetch` inflight it&#39;s better to cancel the previous one. Sample code:\r\n```js\r\nconst [data, setData] = useState();\r\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n  const controller = new AbortController();\r\n  const fetchData = async () =&gt; {\r\n    try {\r\n      const apiData = await fetch(&quot;https://&lt;yourdomain&gt;/&lt;api-path&gt;&quot;,\r\n                               { signal: controller.signal });\r\n      setData(apiData);\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n      if (err.name === &#39;AbortError&#39;) {\r\n        console.log(&quot;Request aborted&quot;);\r\n        return;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  fetchData();\r\n  return () =&gt; {\r\n    controller.abort();\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n__Second issue__&lt;br/&gt;\r\nThis code\r\n```js\r\nreturn async dispatch =&gt; {\r\n```\r\nwill not work because neither dispatch nor Redux store support async actions. The most flexible and powerful way to handle this issue is to use middleware like [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial.html). The middleware lets you:\r\n\r\n* dispatch &#39;usual&#39; sync actions to Redux store. \r\n* intercept those sync actions and in response make one or several async calls doing whatever you want.\r\n* wait until async call(s) finish and in response dispatch one or several sync actions to Redux store, either the original ones which you intercepted or different ones.

you want to play around with cron schedules, I recommend [crontab.guru][1].\r\n\r\nIf you want to add the 21 days yourself, you can use setInterval to schedule a function to run at a specific time:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst waitSeconds = 1814400; // 21 days\r\n\r\nfunction scheduledFunction() {\r\n  // Do something\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Run now\r\nscheduledFunction();\r\n\r\n// Run every 21 days\r\nsetInterval(scheduledFunction, waitSeconds);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, keep in mind that the internal clock might be inaccurate so there can be quite a few seconds of difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n

I&#39;ll write some points here so that you might figure it out yourself, rather easier. \r\n\r\nA simple fact is that: \r\n\r\n&gt; Scale is inversely proportional to frequency. \r\n\r\nFor example, imagine we have a 1-100 Hz range of frequencies in some time series data such as stock markets data or earthquake data. Scale is &quot;supposed to be&quot; the inverse of that. For instance, if scale would be in range of 1 to 100, we&#39;d have had:\r\n\r\n\tScale(1/Hz)      Frequency (Hz)\r\n\t1 \t\t\t\t 100\r\n\t50\t\t\t\t 50\r\n\t100  \t\t\t 1\r\n\r\n----------------- \r\n\r\nTherefore,\r\n\r\n&gt; The frequency is not the real frequency of those time series data (e.g., stock market, earthquake) that we know of. They are only related, inversely.\r\n\r\nAnd we can safely say that here we are calculating some &quot;pseudo-frequencies&quot;, which MATLAB does that (by approximating that). You can read about the approximation process in the documentation in the section [pseudo-frequencies](https://www.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ref/scal2frq.html):\r\n\r\nMATlAB does calculate those pseudo-frequencies based on:\r\n\r\n&gt; In wavelet analysis, the way to relate scales to frequencies is to determine the center frequency of the wavelet function: \r\n\r\nwhich you can visually see in this image and of-course it would differ, when we would change the types of our function in the calculation. Thus, that center frequency will change everytime in our approximation process:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; That &quot;MorletFourierFactor&quot; is a variable to approximate a constant so that when you would do the `1/scale`, it would closely approximate those &quot;pseudo-frequencies&quot;. \r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI thought this image about shifting (time axis) and scaling (frequency axis) might be a little helpful to look into as well: \r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The bottom line is that don&#39;t worry about pseudo-frequencies, you wouldn&#39;t probably need those. If you would want any frequency spectrum, you can likely go towards applying some of those frequency methods (such as Fast Fourier Transform) on whatever time series data that you have. \r\n\r\nIf you really really want to map that, you can also try to design some methods to approximate it yourself. \r\n\r\n###Source\r\n\r\n[Harvard Seismology](http://www.seismology.harvard.edu/research/wavePicking.html)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/phI25.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPwmr.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166010/how-to-convert-scales-to-frequencies-in-wavelet-transform/58479398#58479398","title":"How to convert scales to frequencies in Wavelet Transform"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":4359368,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/214b6d405918b120c80d39316e4117ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Edoardo De Gaspari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4359368/edoardo-de-gaspari"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571628561,"creation_date":1569839359,"question_id":58166010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166010","body_markdown":"I&#39;m dealing with CWT, and I have a big problem converting scales to frequencies.

I&#39;ve tried with other y-values as well, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to get the annotations outside the plot itself. You could also change the fonts of the caption and subtitle to make them stand out from the rest of the labels.\r\n\r\n**Plot:**\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Code:**\r\n\r\n    import plotly.graph_objects as go  \r\n    \r\n    fig = go.Figure()       \r\n    \r\n    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=[&quot;Apple&quot;, &#39;Mango&#39;, &#39;Banana&#39;], y=[400, 300, 500])) \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    fig.update_layout(title=go.layout.Title(text=&quot;Caption&quot;, font=dict(\r\n                    family=&quot;Courier New, monospace&quot;,\r\n                    size=22,\r\n                    color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;\r\n                )))\r\n    \r\n    fig.update_layout(annotations=[\r\n           go.layout.Annotation(\r\n                showarrow=False,\r\n                text=&#39;Subtitle&#39;,\r\n                xanchor=&#39;right&#39;,\r\n                x=1,\r\n                xshift=275,\r\n                yanchor=&#39;top&#39;,\r\n                y=0.05,\r\n                font=dict(\r\n                    family=&quot;Courier New, monospace&quot;,\r\n                    size=22,\r\n                    color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;\r\n                )\r\n            )])\r\n    \r\n    fig[&#39;layout&#39;][&#39;xaxis&#39;].update(side=&#39;top&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    fig.show()\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLajC.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166002/how-to-add-caption-subtitle-using-plotly-method-in-python/58167639#58167639","title":"How to add caption &amp; subtitle using plotly method in python"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":10893993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d618005d19386dee2220f1fc2f581481?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Maddy6","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10893993/maddy6"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5510,"user_id":3437787,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8tmU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"vestland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3437787/vestland"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58167639,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569879909,"creation_date":1569839350,"last_edit_date":1569839886,"question_id":58166002,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166002","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to plot a bar chart using plotly and I wanted to add a caption and subtitle.(Here you can take any example of your choice to add caption and subtitle)    \r\nMy code for plotting the bar chart:\r\n\r\n    import plotly.graph_objects as go  \r\n    \r\n    fig = go.Figure()       \r\n    \r\n    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=[&quot;Apple&quot;, &#39;Mango&#39;, &#39;Banana&#39;], y=[400, 300, 500])) \r\n    \r\n    fig.show()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166002/how-to-add-caption-subtitle-using-plotly-method-in-python","title":"How to add caption &amp; subtitle using plotly method in python"},{"tags":["printing","hex","imp","squirrel","pjl"],"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":6797400,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hxoFh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shubham Agrawal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6797400/shubham-agrawal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569839349,"creation_date":1569839349,"question_id":58166001,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166001","body_markdown":"I have to print image via a Datamax printer which accepts **PCL** commands.

say you have a `QuerySnapshot snapshot` at the ready. You can calculate the sum of all values like so:\r\n\r\n    final sum = snapshot.data.documents.fold(0, (prev, next) =&gt; prev + int.parse(next[&#39;Value&#39;]))\r\n\r\nIn other words, folding should be performed on `List&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt;`.\r\n\r\n**Edit in response to updated code:**\r\n\r\nThe culprit are these lines:\r\n\r\n    var one = int.parse(getValueSTRING);\r\n    var list2 = [one];\r\n    var sum2 = list2.fold(0, (curr, next) =&gt; curr + next);\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the code tries to fold a list that has only one value. Summing list with one item will always net a sum equal to that item&#39;s value. \r\n\r\nTo get the correct value all `DocumentSnapshots` need to be taken into account. Currently, only one `DocumentSnapshot` is considered, as indicated by this line:\r\n\r\n    DocumentSnapshot documentSnapshot = snapshot.data.documents[index];\r\n\r\nInstead, try something like this (I&#39;ve omitted unnecessary code to reduce visual noise):\r\n\r\n    &lt;...&gt;\r\n    builder: (context, snapshot) {\r\n      // Add this line to calculate total sum, and use it later on\r\n      final sum = snapshot.data.documents.fold(0.0, (prev, next) =&gt; prev + int.parse(next[&#39;Value&#39;]))\r\n      return ListView.builder(&lt;...&gt;);\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit 2 (working code):**\r\n\r\nAssume the following Firebase Database structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpenses &gt; doc1 &gt; Value: &quot;100&quot;\r\n           doc2 &gt; Value: &quot;200&quot;\r\n           doc3 &gt; Value: &quot;300&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code below calculates the sum and displays it as a header. It also shows each individual value. As long as Firebase structure is the same, the code should run and produce correct results.

course, you can have optional dependencies - but my recommendation would be to introduce a P3, for keeping the common data. Make P1 and P2 dependent on that plugin and just retrieve the data unconditionally from the common &quot;storage&quot; plugin. \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re making P1 dependent on P2 (and vice versa) you&#39;d need to make this dependency optional, and you&#39;re introducing a cyclic compile time dependency of both. A great way to resolve such a cycle is to introduce a common third module that just implements the common needs.\r\n\r\nEdit: Answering to your comments - if you have P1 register a service that P2 references, then P2 will be dependent on P1 for the service&#39;s interface, unless you register a class from a common P3 on which both depend. That being said, nothing keeps you from registering arbitrary JRE classes as a service - this would be unconventional and a weird hack, but I guess you could register a HashMap as a service. It feels unclean, smelly, hacky, and weird - and the maintainers of your code might haunt you, but I guess technically it&#39;s possible. Did I say that I am not recommending that and that it&#39;s ugly?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58165989/dynamic-sharing-of-data-between-2-plugins-eclipse-rcp/58166327#58166327","title":"Dynamic sharing of data between 2 Plugins Eclipse rcp"}],"owner":{"reputation":380,"user_id":132096,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280142670cafd8c8129bb0a6fa3248da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/132096/gani"},"last_editor":{"reputation":380,"user_id":132096,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280142670cafd8c8129bb0a6fa3248da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/132096/gani"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570082522,"creation_date":1569839314,"last_edit_date":1570082522,"question_id":58165989,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58165989","body_markdown":"Assume there are two plugins P1 and P2 are available in eclipse rcp application.\r\n\r\nBoth P1 and P2 are built separately by different build process\r\n\r\nIn my scenario depending on the user&#39;s choice only p1, only p2 or both plugins are available in the base product.\r\n\r\nI want to exchange the data between Plugin P1 and P2 when both the plugins are available, else the plugins will work with their own data.\r\n\r\nWill OSGI declarative services work well in my scenario,\r\n\r\nis there any way that i can expose service api&#39;s which return json or string from Plugin P1 and P2 can consume it with out depending on it explicitly, I mean, Plugin p2 should only consume it when p1 exists, if not, it should function as normal.\r\n\r\nKindly advice.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nThanks for you suggestion\r\n\r\nI completely agree that having a common plugin will be ideal.\r\n\r\nHowever in our case We have a base product and unfortunately we do not have control over, I mean we can add any plugin to the base repository.\r\n\r\nPlugin P1 and P2 are 2 different products which work independently of each other but has data which can be complimented with each other.

You shouldn&#39;t, although it technically would not matter because EFS endpoints are still private even when placed in a public subnet.\r\n\r\nBut if you only have two subnets -- one public, one private -- in a VPC, then they almost certainly should be in the same availability zone.  Traffic crossing AZ boundaries is billable per gigabyte, and this is exactly why you should never try to mount EFS across zone boundaries.  This error appears to be protecting you from yourself.\r\n\r\nAs noted, you probably shouldn&#39;t have one subnet one AZ and one in another, without a compelling reason, so fixing that is one solution.  Another solution is to simply add a new private subnet in the correct zone.  EFS has no problem crossing subnet boundaries within a zone, and there is no bandwidth charge in that case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58165969/how-to-mount-the-aws-efs-with-ec2-on-different-availability-zone/58176161#58176161","title":"How to mount the AWS EFS with EC2 on different availability zone?"}],"owner":{"reputation":823,"user_id":4412382,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":23,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1303755235/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tara Prasad Gurung","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4412382/tara-prasad-gurung"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2145,"user_id":1723857,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a484360304f8cd53cdffc60746038d98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kenlukas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1723857/kenlukas"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569883817,"creation_date":1569839231,"last_edit_date":1569859919,"question_id":58165969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58165969","body_markdown":"I am trying to mount the EFS with EC2 and what I have done is created the EFS on private subnet and EC2 on public subnet.
