In particular, I am learning the responsive web design. I studied that meta viewport tag is one of the first steps in creating a responsive web design. In particular, I am studying from this link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp\r\n\r\nHere, they have given two images of a website on mobile screens of with and without viewport tag. In the first without screen, the image doesn&#39;t adjust itself with the screen with. But in the latter image, the image adjusts itself. Now, I get this point. I thought of replicating this using the following:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;img src=&quot;jeff.jpg&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing sof&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t make the image change as i change the width. So, what&#39;s going on here?\r\n\r\nI know, I can solve this issue by putting a css block of width:100% but I want to understand why viewport is not working that way it was mentioned on the website.

It will just create the spreadsheets and sheets and make the data transfer total autonomously when it receives the timebased trigger.  So you won&#39;t need to create any html dialogs for your script.  It will just run on the server performing the operations that you specify.  Of course, it&#39;s easier to build something like this if you already know how to program them.

However, It is not triggered when the other &quot;up&quot; button in third row is clicked since it is added by javascript after the window load. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\nI added `NavigateUpDown(object)` custom function to receive it, but the context of $row comes &quot;undefined&quot;. \r\n\r\nUsing another line like: `$(&quot;.up&quot;).click(function () { console.log(&#39;outsideload:&#39; + $(this));});` did not help as it is not triggered as well. \r\n\r\nHow can I get the row added by javascript after the page load, in javascript? Do we have something like window.afterload()? Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4u9eR.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222604/how-can-i-get-the-row-of-a-table-added-after-pageload-by-javascript","title":"How can I get the row of a table added after pageload by javascript?"},{"tags":["c#","func"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":306690,"user_id":267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b11262da6d1cd26b1b0bc99a2620cee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lasse V&#229;gs&#230;ther Karlsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/267/lasse-v%c3%a5gs%c3%a6ther-karlsen"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570118051,"post_id":58222703,"comment_id":102821000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222602/accessing-delegates-in-method/58222703#comment102821000_58222703"},{"owner":{"reputation":7123,"user_id":281014,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c001df5d31b9aa5ebea6d09351876556?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/281014/tomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570119471,"post_id":58222703,"comment_id":102821700,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222602/accessing-delegates-in-method/58222703#comment102821700_58222703"},{"owner":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570119678,"post_id":58222703,"comment_id":102821780,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222602/accessing-delegates-in-method/58222703#comment102821780_58222703"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570279910,"last_edit_date":1570279910,"creation_date":1570117651,"answer_id":58222703,"question_id":58222602,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58222703","body_markdown":"Like this:\r\n\r\n    public object GetOrCreate&lt;T&gt;(string key, Func&lt;ICacheEntry, T&gt;

I&#39;ll try to include pertinent information.\r\n\r\nWhat we primarily see is when a job with 16 cores is submitted from user A vs one with 8 cores from user B the 16 core job takes priority. However, it doesn&#39;t seem to effectively take into account that user A has been eating 400 cpus per day compared to user B who has used &lt; 100 cpus. On top of this, the system seems to not properly allow user C who hasn&#39;t run any jobs in 1 week, priority over User A and User B.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see is proper sharing between users. Meaning, if user A has 400 calculations of 16 cores each and user B has 800 calculations of 8 cores each, the load should be distributed equally (counted with maybe a 1 week history period). In addition, having priority with users who haven&#39;t run in a while would be a bonus.\r\n\r\nIn my mind there are a few things we have tried between increasing the weighting for time queued, increasing ticket amounts, increasing the ticket weight. Sometimes, in each case, we attempt to increase values by many orders of magnitude (x10, x100, x1000 so forth)\r\n\r\nThe system currently is setup with OFS or OSF, neither seem to make a difference.\r\n\r\nI will try to get the current setup once I can from my administrator, but if anyone has any ideas how to properly troubleshoot the system it would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222599/proper-setup-of-sge-sun-grid-engine-and-sharing-resources","title":"Proper Setup of SGE (Sun Grid Engine) and sharing

Right now I am developing my very first web application. I did set up an AJAX function that requests some data from a third party API and populates my html containers with the returned data.\r\n\r\nRight now I query one single object and populate 3 html containers with around 15 lines of Javascript code. When i activate the process/function by clicking a button on my frontend, it needs around 6-7 seconds until the html content is updated.\r\n\r\nIs this a reasonable time? The user experience honestly will be more than bad considering that I will have to query and manipulate far more data (I build a one-site dashboard related to soccer data).\r\n\r\nThere might be very controversal answers to that question, but what would be a fair enough time for the process to run using standard infrastructure? 1-2 seconds?

([see docs][1]) Essentially, you give the button a `ref` attribute, then you can always access that element in your Vue code by calling `this.$refs.&lt;whatever name you gave it&gt;`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;modal fade&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; role=&quot;dialog&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;modal-dialog&quot; role=&quot;document&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;modal-content&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;modal-footer&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-default&quot; data-dismiss=&quot;modal&quot;&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;\r\n                &lt;button ref=&quot;always_focus&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; autofocus class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Always focus&lt;/button&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nThen, add or modify your `show` event handler for the modal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n  ...\r\n  methods: {\r\n    onModalShow() {\r\n      this.$nextTick(() =&gt; {\r\n        this.$refs.always_focus.focus();\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe use of Vue&#39;s `$nextTick()` ([docs][2]) function here is also important. You have to wait for the button to become visible in order to focus it. By adding the focus code to a `$nextTick()` callback, you can be sure that the DOM has finished updating from the previous change to your data model (eg. the change that shows the modal).\r\n\r\n&gt; **NOTE:** the above is just an example, since I don&#39;t know exactly what your modal code looks like.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-refs\r\n  [2]: https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-nextTick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222526/how-to-set-autofocus-on-button-inside-modal-everytime-modal-pops-up/58222636#58222636","title":"How to set autofocus on button inside modal everytime modal pops up?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1753,"user_id":1739821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b235de88b66806243ae1d57065491bea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"O Connor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1739821/o-connor"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570174370,"post_id":58222659,"comment_id":102837536,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222526/how-to-set-autofocus-on-button-inside-modal-everytime-modal-pops-up/58222659#comment102837536_58222659"},{"owner":{"reputation":905,"user_id":6534033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c414f78b33a08b9dc9299236e2e39e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sorayadragon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6534033/sorayadragon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1753,"user_id":1739821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b235de88b66806243ae1d57065491bea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"O Connor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1739821/o-connor"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570200232,"post_id":58222659,"comment_id":102849861,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222526/how-to-set-autofocus-on-button-inside-modal-everytime-modal-pops-up/58222659#comment102849861_58222659"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":905,"user_id":6534033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c414f78b33a08b9dc9299236e2e39e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sorayadragon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6534033/sorayadragon"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570117456,"creation_date":1570117456,"answer_id":58222659,"question_id":58222526,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58222659","body_markdown":"You can use a &#39;mounted&#39; function to always focus the button when the modal is opened:\r\n\r\n    mounted: function() {\r\n      document.getElementById(&quot;focus-button&quot;).focus();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr you may be able to listen for a keypress and check if it&#39;s the enter key and programmatically click the button.\r\n\r\n    onKeyPress: function(e) {\r\n      if (e.which == 13) {\r\n        document.getElementById(&quot;focus-button&quot;).click();\r\n      }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222526/how-to-set-autofocus-on-button-inside-modal-everytime-modal-pops-up/58222659#58222659","title":"How to set autofocus on button inside modal everytime modal pops up?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1753,"user_id":1739821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b235de88b66806243ae1d57065491bea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"O Connor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1739821/o-connor"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570117456,"creation_date":1570116971,"question_id":58222526,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222526","body_markdown":"I am using Vue.js 2 to show Bootstrap modal.

How can I know the shortest path from source point to endpoint in my 2D array?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198683/minimum-amount-of-ascent-and-descent-in-2d-array\r\n  [2]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222504/how-to-create-a-dijkstra-s-graph-from-a-given-2d-array","title":"How to create a Dijkstra’s graph from a given 2D array"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","amazon-ec2","ansible"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":11585840,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1fde06034cdeaa0e70f256d4270a257?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jaboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11585840/jaboy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570118134,"post_id":58222497,"comment_id":102821054,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222497/permission-denied-publickey-during-connection-to-instance-via-ansible-playbook#comment102821054_58222497"},{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":10940998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db793c2c5cb267137223d9f8321b70ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KidOmega","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10940998/kidomega"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":129,"user_id":11585840,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1fde06034cdeaa0e70f256d4270a257?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jaboy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11585840/jaboy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570128787,"post_id":58222497,"comment_id":102825618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222497/permission-denied-publickey-during-connection-to-instance-via-ansible-playbook#comment102825618_58222497"},{"owner":{"reputation":12586,"user_id":225016,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77d3c3ab5ddcf93a8ca1bfe1b481be1c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mdaniel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/225016/mdaniel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570158976,"post_id":58222497,"comment_id":102833401,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222497/permission-denied-publickey-during-connection-to-instance-via-ansible-playbook#comment102833401_58222497"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":10940998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db793c2c5cb267137223d9f8321b70ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KidOmega","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10940998/kidomega"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5,"user_id":10940998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db793c2c5cb267137223d9f8321b70ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KidOmega","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10940998/kidomega"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570129057,"creation_date":1570116874,"last_edit_date":1570129057,"question_id":58222497,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222497","body_markdown":"I have following problem: \r\nafter set up is ready I am trying to connect to instance to make some configuration on EC2, but I always get very long error with conclusion: \r\n```\r\nfatal: [52.59.210.223]: UNREACHABLE! =&gt; {Permission denied (publickey)\r\n```\r\nLoging to instance through ssh via console is succesfull.

I have a messy table that was given to me that I need to &quot;clean up&quot; for the end-user.  One of the columns (varchar255) in the table has multiple date values smashed together.  Most of the values just have one date value (i.e. 10/11/2018) but a few look like this (8/11/201810/6/2019).  I need to split these out but there is no delimiter in which to split other than maybe a pattern but even then it&#39;s variable length so I don&#39;t know how to do it.  Basically, the first date in the sequence can be (1-2 number month/1-2 number day/4 number year) followed by they next date.  How can I split these and separate them by a delimiter so that I can then perform a split_to_array, count the highest number of separate values in the array and then make the appropriate number of new columns to accommodate the separate dates?

An advantage of using $.each here is arguably cleaner, more readable code and you also get the benefit of chaining. \r\n\r\nHowever it is worth noting (although probably not relevant for your example) that a for loop will most likely perform (much)better when iterating over large collections of elements. For example you could write it like this;\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet test = $(&#39;input&#39;); \r\nfor(let i = 0; i &lt; test.length; i++){ \r\n    console.log(test[i].checked) \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther, for...in will work but 1) ```chkbox``` will be the index of the checkbox in the collection and 2) unlike my first ```for...``` example where i will always be an integer index, ```for...in``` this will loop over all properties of the returned JQuery object. You can use ```hasOwnProperty(i)``` to filter out inherited properties like this;\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest = $(&#39;input&#39;); \r\nfor(let i in test){ \r\n    if(!test.hasOwnProperty(i)) { \r\n        continue ; \r\n    } \r\n    console.log(test[i].checked) \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222477/how-can-i-iterate-over-a-list-of-check-boxes-in-jquery/58222557#58222557","title":"How can I iterate over a list of check boxes in jQuery?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2003,"user_id":1159763,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0622d669c6102714da374348a24df617?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ekolis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159763/ekolis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570117833,"post_id":58222677,"comment_id":102820890,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222477/how-can-i-iterate-over-a-list-of-check-boxes-in-jquery/58222677#comment102820890_58222677"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18295,"user_id":2026606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ksr3L.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tyler Roper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2026606/tyler-roper"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18295,"user_id":2026606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ksr3L.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tyler Roper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2026606/tyler-roper"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570118276,"last_edit_date":1570118276,"creation_date":1570117520,"answer_id":58222677,"question_id":58222477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58222677","body_markdown":"`for...in` does not behave as you&#39;re expecting. \r\n\r\nIn your case, `chkbox` is **not** the checkbox element; it is an integer representing the index of the item in the collection.

After that with just another crop around the image borders the process is complete and I can save the image as .png\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not using Gimp because the built in procedure gimp-drawable-transform-rotate-default only accepts radians with two decimals. I tried to find a way to edit that procudere and to create my own but I wasn&#39;t able to do so\r\n\r\nI wal also suggested to use ImageMagick because the batch is very large (50k+ images), therefore, can you help me with the console command to emulate what I would do with Gimp? In particular the important part is the crop with the original image ratio\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nWhen you rotate an image, if the &#176; aren&#39;t 90-180-270 etc.., the size of the image is increased and therefore new pixels must be created. The following crop must:\r\n\r\n 1. Delete all the pixels added during the rotation to fill the blank spaces\r\n 2. The final ratio has to be as close ad possible to the initial one\r\n 3. What comes to be cropped (ofc the crop has to be centered) that was present in the original image has to be the as little as possible\r\n\r\nBasically you should&#39;t be able to see the differences between the original and the edited images just by looking at them\r\n\r\nThe procedure that I described for Gimp already did everything but it works only on one image at a time","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222473/imagemagick-rotate-and-crop-batch-images","title":"ImageMagick rotate and crop batch images"},{"tags":["twilio","twilio-programmable-chat","twilio-javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":43855,"user_id":28376,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ec1383b240b5ba15ffb9743fceb3c0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"philnash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/28376/philnash"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570493372,"post_id":58222467,"comment_id":102923289,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222467/remove-user-from-twilio-chat-channel-when-tab-is-closed#comment102923289_58222467"},{"owner":{"reputation":2911,"user_id":1473968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vua08.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"colxi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1473968/colxi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":43855,"user_id":28376,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ec1383b240b5ba15ffb9743fceb3c0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"philnash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/28376/philnash"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570541367,"post_id":58222467,"comment_id":102939450,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222467/remove-user-from-twilio-chat-channel-when-tab-is-closed#comment102939450_58222467"},{"owner":{"reputation":43855,"user_id":28376,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ec1383b240b5ba15ffb9743fceb3c0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"philnash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/28376/philnash"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570571135,"post_id":58222467,"comment_id":102952749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222467/remove-user-from-twilio-chat-channel-when-tab-is-closed#comment102952749_58222467"},{"owner":{"reputation":2911,"user_id":1473968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vua08.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"colxi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1473968/colxi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":43855,"user_id":28376,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ec1383b240b5ba15ffb9743fceb3c0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"philnash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/28376/philnash"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570626018,"post_id":58222467,"comment_id":102971576,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222467/remove-user-from-twilio-chat-channel-when-tab-is-closed#comment102971576_58222467"}],"owner":{"reputation":2911,"user_id":1473968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vua08.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"colxi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1473968/colxi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2911,"user_id":1473968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vua08.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"colxi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1473968/colxi"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570118830,"creation_date":1570116761,"last_edit_date":1570118830,"question_id":58222467,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222467","body_markdown":"Anybody is aware about a method to automatically unsubscribe/remove a user from a Twilio Programable Chat channel, after some time of inactivity ?

have a react app that uses socket.io to interact with the backend. There is a scenario when the backend pushes a message that causes a page to change. Is there a way to reference react router history from the handler without having to wrap the whole app in a wrapper component? Please see below code sample.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have a follow up question regarding referencing dispatch. Currently, I keep the socket on the App state (I&#39;m not using redux but I implemented a very basic hacky version using useContext and useReducer). So when I connect the socket, I&#39;m able to set up handlers for different socket events and dispatch actions accordingly. However, I feel like socket connection should not be coupled to the Application state. Is there a way pass the app state&#39;s dispatch as a dependency without using a wrapper component? Currently I reference dispatch in a component this way:\r\n\r\n    const { state, dispatch } = useContext(AppContext);\r\n\r\ncode sample:\r\n\r\n    export function connectSocket() {\r\n\r\n    return async (dispatch) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n    const socket = await io.connect(&#39;&#39;, {\r\n        path: &#39;/socket.io/&#39;,\r\n        secure: true,\r\n        transports: [&#39;websocket&#39;],\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      socket.on(&#39;reconnect_attempt&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        socket.io.opts.transports = [&#39;polling&#39;, &#39;websocket&#39;];\r\n        socket.io.opts.pingTimeout = 30000;\r\n      })\r\n\r\n      \r\n      // need to reference history here\r\n      socket.on(&#39;nextpage&#39;, _ =&gt; {\r\n           history.push(&#39;page&#39;);\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      // referencing dispatch\r\n      socket.on(&#39;foo&#39;, _ =&gt; {\r\n        dispatch({\r\n          type: actionTypes.foo,\r\n

working on a project where I have composite items that can contain simple items. The programm is written using Qt. So I have a tree. I decided to use a composite design pattern.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/composite-design-pattern/\r\n\r\nAnd now I&#39;m trying to show this hierarchy in QTreeView. Let&#39;s say I have a ```BaseUnit``` class. And a ```CompositeUnit``` class that inherits my ```BaseUnit```  class.  So a ```CompositeUnit``` instance has children which is stored like this: ```QVector&lt; BaseUnit* &gt; children```. Also I have a treeModel. In it&#39;s constructor I pass a pointer to the root item:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nTreeModel::TreeModel(BaseUnit* rootItem, QObject *parent):\r\n    QAbstractItemModel(parent),\r\n    rootItem(rootItem)\r\n{\r\n\r\n}\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThen I create my model and pass it to ```QTreeView```:\r\n```\r\n scenario = new CompositeUnit();\r\n TreeModel* model = new TreeModel(scenario, this);\r\n ui-&gt;treeView-&gt;setModel(model);\r\n```\r\nAfter that I populate ```scenario``` with children calling it&#39;s function:\r\n```\r\n void BaseUnit::addUnit(BaseUnit *unit)\r\n{\r\n    children.append(unit);\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nscenario-&gt;addUnit(new BaseUnit(Params params));\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf I do this part of code before setting the model to the view everything is fine and I see all parents and children. But I need to populate ```scenario``` after setting the model to the view. So as far as I can understand when I ```addUnit``` the model  doesn&#39;t know about the changes... Am I wrong? Or only the view doesn&#39;t know that smth changed in the model? I&#39;m a little bit complicated with this situation. I guess my architecture might be mistaken from the very beginning and I should have implemented it any other way.  Can you give me a clue?

Avoid redundant database communications(it&#39;s clear)  \r\n2. Solve concurrent issues\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n-\r\n1. Actually I didn&#39;t get how this pattern can help to solve concurrent issues. Could you explain it?\r\n\r\n2. Should I create UoW instance for each entity class or for each entity object or singleton instance per application?\r\n\r\nIn one example from book UoW looks like this:\r\n\r\n    class UnitOfWork ....\r\n    \r\n        private List newObjects = new ArrayList();\r\n        private List dirtyObjects = new ArrayList();\r\n        private List removedObjects = new ArrayList();\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        public void registerNew(DomainObject o){...}\r\n        public void registerDirty(DomainObject o){...}\r\n        public void registerRemoved(DomainObject o){...}\r\n        public void registerClean(DomainObject o){...}\r\n\r\n\r\nHere looks like single UoW is responsible for some set of objects\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in another example :\r\n\r\n    class UnitOfWorkServlet ...\r\n       final protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response){\r\n          try{\r\n             UnitOfWork.newCurrent(); // create UnitOfWorkInstance in ThreadLocal\r\n             handleGet(request, response);\r\n             UnitOfWork.getCurrent().commit() \r\n          } finally(){\r\n             UnitOfWork.setCurrent(null) //threadLocalInstance.set(null)\r\n          }\r\n       }\r\n\r\nHere we create new UoW instance per each Get request and look like each request isolated from  another one. How can it solve concurrent isssues ?\r\n\r\nLets say we have 2 related entities: Client and Order. Should we create 2 different UnitOfWork instances or should we use the single instance fir both entities?\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nAuthor states that we have to store UoF instance in ThreadLocal to avoid disaster but I didn&#39;t get why. What is he speaking about ?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say we have 2 different simultaneous requests from UI but both of them update the Client fieds in database. could you explain the behaviour of such requests? How many UoF works should be created and how they fix concurrent issues ?\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n-\r\n\r\nI mostly experience in java so it is ok for me if your answers will explain things based on JPA/Hibernate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222426/how-unitofwork-patterns-helps-to-resolve-concurrent-issues","title":"How UnitOfWork patterns helps to resolve concurrent issues?"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","keras","semantic-segmentation"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8668595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf24d0b058d9fa2e1678ae296602e964?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Eugene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8668595/eugene"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570170766,"post_id":58223853,"comment_id":102836089,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222425/error-during-compiling-a-keras-model-with-own-loss-function/58223853#comment102836089_58223853"},{"owner":{"reputation":426,"user_id":4531017,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8vSmawKp7oc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKE/GPykLlh0Tk8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Callin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4531017/callin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8668595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf24d0b058d9fa2e1678ae296602e964?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Eugene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8668595/eugene"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570203781,"post_id":58223853,"comment_id":102851565,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222425/error-during-compiling-a-keras-model-with-own-loss-function/58223853#comment102851565_58223853"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":426,"user_id":4531017,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8vSmawKp7oc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKE/GPykLlh0Tk8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Callin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4531017/callin"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570122310,"creation_date":1570122310,"answer_id":58223853,"question_id":58222425,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223853","body_markdown":"When I reproduce your error, I see that the problem is happening at the function `K.dot()`.

The structures for the elements and the whole list look like this:\r\n```lang-c\r\ntypedef struct node_ {\r\n    int num;\r\n    struct node_ *next;\r\n    struct node_ *prev;\r\n} element;\r\n\r\n\r\ntypedef struct list_ {\r\n    element **first;\r\n    element **last;\r\n    int *e_count;\r\n} list;\r\n```\r\nHere is my problem with freeing the list. This code works fine:\r\n```lang-c\r\nvoid wipe(list l) {\r\n    element *p = *l.first;\r\n    element *t;\r\n\r\n    while (p) {\r\n        t = p;\r\n        p = p-&gt;next;\r\n        free(t);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    *l.first = NULL;\r\n    *l.last = NULL;\r\n    *l.e_count = 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut when I try to use double pointers, I start getting an **InvalidRead** error from valgrind: \r\n```lang-c\r\nvoid wipe(list l) {\r\n    element **p = l.first;\r\n    element **t = l.first;\r\n\r\n    while (*p) { // InvalidRead here after &quot;free(*t);&quot;\r\n        *t = *p;\r\n        p = &amp;(*p)-&gt;next;\r\n        free(*t);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    *l.first = NULL;\r\n    *l.last = NULL;\r\n    *l.e_count = 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is expected because in this case `t` and `p` are essentially pointing to the same address which is then being used by `free()`. I am wondering how is it possible to fix this and whether it would be better than the first case with the single pointers.\r\n\r\n_Thank you for your help!_\r\n\r\nCode

I can suggest you to use Angular application as front-end application which can interact with a java backend as a microservice. It mean you can make rest call from Angular application to java based microservice. You can run the Angular application using the command like `npm install` followed by `npm start` provided you should have Node JS installed in the system. It will be better to use **yarn** command which is better than npm .You do not need to deploy the angular based application into Tomcat, you can develop a java based microservice and you can deploy it in Tomcat. I would suggest to create a microservice using Spring Boot and you can directly run without having Tomcat as separate server. Spring boot provides built in embedded Tomcat container. If you want to combine both Angular with Spring Boot, you can check this link.\r\nhttps://dzone.com/articles/java-8-springboot-angularjs-bootstrap-springdata-j\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222406/how-to-deploy-angular-8-app-in-tomcat-server/58223298#58223298","title":"How to deploy Angular 8 app in Tomcat Server?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":10847871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bOSORp0u6XI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAS8/63BLuHJRCgU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SPS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10847871/sps"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570120285,"creation_date":1570116559,"question_id":58222406,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222406","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve completed a tutorial on Angular and I want to deploy it in my tomcat server.
