[Entity Attribute Value] [1] for my &quot;ProductAttribute&quot; table.\r\n\r\nThe queries which I&#39;ve tried are as follow:\r\n\r\nUsing LINQ:\r\n\r\n\r\n    var linqQuery = from c in _context.Categories\r\n                    join cp in _context.CategroyProducts on c.Id equals cp.CategoryId\r\n                    join p in _context.Products on cp.ProductId equals p.Id\r\n                    join pa in _context.ProductAttributes on p.Id equals pa.ProductId\r\n                    join a in _context.Attributes on pa.AttributeId equals a.Id\r\n                    join ac in _context.AttributeCategories on a.AttributeCategoryId equals ac.Id\r\n                    where c.Id == categoryId\r\n\r\n&gt; This query need to use multiple group by which is challenging for me.\r\n\r\nUsing Include and foreach:\r\n\r\n     var includeQuery= _context.Categories\r\n                .Include(x =&gt; x.CategroyProducts)//step1\r\n                .ThenInclude(x =&gt; x.Product)//step2\r\n                .ThenInclude(x =&gt; x.ProductAttributes)//step3\r\n                .ThenInclude(x =&gt; x.Attribute)//step4\r\n                .ThenInclude(x =&gt; x.AttributeCategory);//step5\r\n\r\n&gt; The challenge in this query is to going from step1==&gt;step5==&gt;step4==&gt;step3, which I can&#39;t achieve that in foreach.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to fill the ViewModel?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

per the above question,it was answered how to perform a loop of http requests with an array of urls which works fine.But what I am trying to achieve is to perform another loop of http requests which should be done only after the completion of the first loop (i.e) it should wait for the first loop of http requests to complete.\r\n\r\n    // Import http\r\n    var http = require(&#39;http&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    // First URLs array\r\n    var urls_first = [&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;, &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;];\r\n\r\n    // Second URLs array\r\n    var urls_second = [&quot;http://www.yahoo.com&quot;, &quot;http://www.fb.com&quot;];\r\n\r\n    var responses = [];\r\n    var completed_requests = 0;\r\n        \r\n    function performHTTP(array) {\r\n    for (i in urls_first) {\r\n            http.get(urls[i], function(res) {\r\n                responses.push(res);\r\n                completed_requests++;\r\n                if (completed_requests == urls.length) {\r\n                    // All download done, process responses array\r\n                    console.log(responses);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n     }\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the above snippet ,i have added another array of urls.I wrapped the for inside a function to change the array each time called.Since i have to wait for the first loop to complete, i tried async/await like below.\r\n\r\n    async function callMethod() { \r\n        await new Promise (resolve =&gt;performHTTP(urls_first)))   // Executing function with first array\r\n        await new Promise (resolve =&gt;performHTTP(urls_second)))  // Executing function with second array\r\n    } \r\n\r\nBut in this case both the function calls get executed simultaneously(i.e)it does not wait for the first array execution to complete .Both execution happens simultaneously,which i need to happen only after the completion of one.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986216/nodejs-multiple-loop-of-http-requests-execute-simultaneously","title":"NodeJs : Multiple loop of HTTP requests execute

In practice however this is often a complete waste of time, and will more often than not, slow down your code. \r\n\r\nThe general theory is that you pass a pointer to the _mm_prefetch intrinsic a loop iteration or two prior to using the value. There are however problems with this:\r\n\r\n * It is likely that you&#39;ll end up tuning the code for *your* CPU. When running that same code on other platforms, you&#39;ll probably find that different CPU cache layouts/sizes mean that your prefetch optimisations are now actually slowing the performance down.\r\n * The additional prefetch instructions will end up using up more of your instruction cache, and most likely your uop cache as well. You may find this alone slows the code down. \r\n * This assumes the CPU actually pays attention to the _mm_prefetch instruction. It is only a hint, so there are no guarentees it will be respected by the CPU. \r\n\r\nIf you want to speed up random memory access, there are better methods than prefetching imho. \r\n\r\n * Reduce the size of the data *(i.e. use shorts/float16s inplace of int/float, eradicate any erronious padding in your structs, etc)*.

1.2 of Julia, this does not work.\r\n\r\nThere may be some other clever solution, but my advice is to just write a loop yourself, it&#39;s easy and educational!\r\n\r\nTo address your questions:\r\n\r\n0: (This was not a question) Remember to always name your types with UpperCamelCase: so `MyStruct`, not `myStruct`.\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. No, you don&#39;t need this, and it&#39;s not a good solution. (Also I don&#39;t know why you want a 2-column vector, when you only are looking for the max of `a`). But if you really want it anyway:\r\n\r\n    `v = getproperty.(x, [:a :b])`\r\n\r\n 2. For max value, see the answer by @fredrikekre, for max index see below.\r\n \r\n\r\n 3. No, I don&#39;t think so.\r\n\r\nWrite your own loop to get the max index and value. It&#39;s easy and fun, and you learn to write your own fast Julia code:\r\n\r\n    function find_amax(arr::AbstractArray{MyStruct})\r\n        isempty(arr) &amp;&amp; ArgumentError(&quot;reducing over an empty collection is not allowed&quot;)\r\n        maxind, maxval = firstindex(arr), first(arr).a\r\n        for (i, x) in enumerate(arr)\r\n            if x.a &gt; maxval\r\n                maxind, maxval = i, x.a\r\n            end\r\n        end\r\n        return maxval, maxind\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThere is a small inefficiency in the code above, the first value and index of `x` is read twice. If you want even faster performance, you can figure out a way to avoid that.\r\n\r\nAs for performance, this loop is about as fast as `maximum(x-&gt;x.a, arr)`, and more than 60x as fast as building the 2-column matrix you asked for in question 1.\r\n\r\nThe main lesson is: You don&#39;t need to look for some clever &quot;built-in&quot; solution that you can plug your problem into. If you cannot quickly find one, just make your own, it will most likely be *faster*.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986185/how-to-get-the-maximum-value-of-the-item-of-a-struct-when-you-have-an-array/57988356#57988356","title":"How to get the maximum value of the item of a struct when you have an array?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1704,"user_id":5328289,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0e0e88b500a567f9572d0f8fe4e99405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M.E.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5328289/m-e"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1704,"user_id":5328289,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0e0e88b500a567f9572d0f8fe4e99405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M.E.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5328289/m-e"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57988356,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568796811,"creation_date":1568787484,"last_edit_date":1568788312,"question_id":57986185,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57986185","body_markdown":"I have the following structure in Julia and I create an array with it.\r\n\r\n    julia&gt;     struct myStruct\r\n                  a::Int\r\n                  b::Int\r\n                  c::String\r\n               end\r\n    \r\n    julia&gt;     myArray = myStruct.(1:10,11:20,&quot;ABC&quot;)\r\n    10-element Array{myStruct,1}:\r\n     myStruct(1, 11, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(2, 12, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(3, 13, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(4, 14, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(5, 15, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(6, 16, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(7, 17, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(8, 18, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(9, 19, &quot;ABC&quot;) \r\n     myStruct(10, 20, &quot;ABC&quot;)\r\n\r\nWhat shall I do in Julia to get the maximum value of `a`?\r\n\r\nIs it recommended to first getting a 2 column array with the first two values of the struct and then use `findmax(my2colArray[:,1])` to find the maximum value?\r\n\r\nI have three questions to understand how shall I do this:\r\n\r\n1.

In the original library it is support library.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986166/unable-to-open-third-party-dialogfragment-which-uses-android-support-library-w","title":"Unable to open third party `DialogFragment` which uses Android Support Library while I am using AndroidX"},{"tags":["c#","linq","methods","refactoring"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":88940,"user_id":5133585,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfqcw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sweeper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5133585/sweeper"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568787474,"post_id":57986163,"comment_id":102380472,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986163/refactor-method-c#comment102380472_57986163"},{"owner":{"reputation":4862,"user_id":2057955,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/286aaf1c939cbcfc4d4a812b398066a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"zaitsman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2057955/zaitsman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568787507,"post_id":57986163,"comment_id":102380482,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986163/refactor-method-c#comment102380482_57986163"},{"owner":{"reputation":1197,"user_id":2207426,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5kTR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"4est","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2207426/4est"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568788176,"post_id":57986163,"comment_id":102380754,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986163/refactor-method-c#comment102380754_57986163"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1197,"user_id":2207426,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5kTR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"4est","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2207426/4est"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568788099,"post_id":57986236,"comment_id":102380725,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986163/refactor-method-c/57986236#comment102380725_57986236"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":88940,"user_id":5133585,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfqcw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sweeper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5133585/sweeper"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13746,"user_id":336648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a1c669e7a6a898831c30daaaa15b88d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kjartan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/336648/kjartan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568787994,"last_edit_date":1568787994,"creation_date":1568787688,"answer_id":57986236,"question_id":57986163,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57986236","body_markdown":"One way is to put the enum values that you want to check against into an array, and call `Contains`.\r\n\r\n    return new[] { PlantMoveType.PlantReady, PlantMoveType.PlantRelase }\r\n                     .Contains(plantType.PlantMoveType);\r\n\r\nIf you are using C# 7 or later, you can also write the method as [expression-bodied][1]:\r\n\r\n    private bool MyMethod(PlantType plantType) =&gt;\r\n        new[] { PlantMoveType.PlantReady, PlantMoveType.PlantRelase }\r\n            .Contains(plantType.PlantMoveType);\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986163/refactor-method-c/57986236#57986236","title":"Refactor method (C#)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13746,"user_id":336648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a1c669e7a6a898831c30daaaa15b88d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kjartan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/336648/kjartan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568788829,"creation_date":1568788829,"answer_id":57986512,"question_id":57986163,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57986512","body_markdown":"Well a small simplification would be to pass the type (enum?) of the property `PlantMoveType` instead of `PlantType` as the parameter. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, you could declare the types to check for as e.g. an array.

Or is there better way to share single window between WPF applications.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986080/share-wpf-window-between-few-applications","title":"Share WPF window between few applications"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":125,"user_id":9155369,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a72451cf1bf6e4296f11dfce6e826761?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dhiren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9155369/dhiren"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568787388,"post_id":57986079,"comment_id":102380446,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986079/how-to-bind-a-grouped-viewbag-to-mvc-view#comment102380446_57986079"},{"owner":{"reputation":15231,"user_id":1220550,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1osH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1220550/peter-b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568789496,"post_id":57986079,"comment_id":102381320,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986079/how-to-bind-a-grouped-viewbag-to-mvc-view#comment102381320_57986079"},{"owner":{"reputation":50012,"user_id":728795,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74899fd197722b4ddaeb21de21c6b313?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/728795/andrei"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568795933,"post_id":57986079,"comment_id":102384595,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986079/how-to-bind-a-grouped-viewbag-to-mvc-view#comment102384595_57986079"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1014,"user_id":9233618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/055337ca5cbfadc8e3e5cd7a197f31b6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9233618/matt"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568807418,"creation_date":1568807418,"answer_id":57992103,"question_id":57986079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57992103","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t exactly see the problem here, but you are on the right track. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the structure of your `Cabin_dt_CurrentDeal` list items and the exact HTML structure you need so I can edit the answer better.\r\n\r\n\r\n    @foreach (var item in ViewBag.Cabin_dt_CurrentDeal)\r\n    {\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n            @foreach (var subitem in item.listName)\r\n            {\r\n                &lt;div&gt;\r\n                    &lt;h3&gt;subitem.Name&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            }\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986079/how-to-bind-a-grouped-viewbag-to-mvc-view/57992103#57992103","title":"How to bind a grouped Viewbag to MVC view?"}],"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":6191866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcd6a2084b835fcca941f6f9d037fde2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udaya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6191866/udaya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":185,"user_id":6191866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcd6a2084b835fcca941f6f9d037fde2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Udaya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6191866/udaya"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568807418,"creation_date":1568787016,"last_edit_date":1568789716,"question_id":57986079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57986079","body_markdown":"I have a grouped list like below,\r\n\r\n    var Cabin_dt_CurrentDeal = Cabin_dt_Details.Where(f =&gt; f.SailingID == currentCruiseID)\r\n                                             .GroupBy(a =&gt; a.Name).Select(grp =&gt; grp.ToList())\r\n                                             .ToList();\r\n    ViewBag.Cabin_dt_CurrentDeal = Cabin_dt_CurrentDeal;\r\n\r\nAnd below is the screenshot of my viewbag\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nwhat i am trying to do is, I want to bind this grouped viewbag to my view(something like below)\r\n\r\n    @foreach (var item in ViewBag.Cabin_dt_CurrentDeal)\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nplease guide me how to do that.

It should be a matter of iterating over all data sources for the user, getting the data through the relevant API (that you&#39;re already using to display that data), and then writing to a local file). You can do this either client-side in your Swift code, or server-side on a server you already may have, or using Cloud Functions.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re looking for some inspiration for the latter, there is a [sample repository that shows how to clean up a user&#39;s data](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/user-data-protection), based on a set of wipe-out rules.

But to address the question.\r\n\r\nCurrently, each Buffer that comprises a vector has a 2GB limit.  In addition all Arrow Vectors currently use an `int` index, so the there is a row limit of 2^31-1.  Due to how the default allocation process works (doubling of buffer sizes), the you might be getting close to the actual limit without preallocating.\r\n\r\nThe best practice for Arrow in general and Java in particular is to create small batches (e.g. read N rows convert them to a batch and write them out again, instead of trying to read the whole file). An example of this approach is viewable in the recently refactored [JDBC adaptor](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/adapter/jdbc/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/adapter/jdbc/ArrowVectorIterator.java).\r\n\r\nThere has been [recent discussion](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/arrow-dev/201908.mbox/%3CCAK7Z5T_pvzhWwNpcvm_KyeL8ZXjNK11_T_5Zx5Whs7zL34O-tw%40mail.gmail.com%3E) on the developer mailing list for changing the API to support 64-bit indexing/sizes.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986045/is-there-a-size-limitation-problem-when-writing-the-apache-arrow-format-with-the/57986494#57986494","title":"Is there a size limitation/problem when writing the apache arrow format with the java API"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11806656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7581efab81d68df1c6d31f84f45c319e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ronstein2000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11806656/ronstein2000"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568788744,"creation_date":1568786874,"question_id":57986045,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57986045","body_markdown":"My arrow writer reading data from CSV files works fine for data less 1 GB, but stucks at about this limit (the writing code seems to block).

There are properties about each person, name-value pairs, like questions-answers: hairColor=black, heightInCm=182.5, and so on. There are about 200 questions, different persons answered different subset of questions. We have tables: \r\n\r\n- **persons** (pid int identity(1,1), name, address, …) – about 750.000 rows, where (13,’peter’,…) means ‘peter’ person with #13 id exists in table\r\n- **questions** (qid int identity, text nvarchar(100)) – about 182 rows, where (24,’hairColor’) means question #24 is ‘what is the color of the hair’\r\n- **answers** (aid int identity, qid int, text nvarchar(400)) – about 2.500.000 rows, where (182,24,’black’) means there exists at least one person who answered to question #24 as ‘black’ \r\n- **links** (pid,qid,aid) – about 24.000.000 rows, where (13,24,182) means person   #13 answered question #24 as #182 (peter has black hair)\r\n\r\nOf course we have several indexes on these tables. In this database we can express queries like ‘**find persons who has black hair**’ in this way:\r\n\r\n    SELECT P.* FROM persons P\r\n      INNER JOIN questions q1 ON q1.text=’hairColor’\r\n      INNER JOIN answers a1 ON a1.qid=q1.qid and a1.text=’black’\r\n      INNER JOIN links L1 on L1.qid=q1.qid and L1.aid=a1.aid and p.pid=L1.pid\r\n\r\nEach filtering criteria (*has black hair*) become 3 inner joins, so ‘*has black hair, likes puppies absolutely, height at least 180*’ become 9 inner joins. \r\n\r\nWe have a simple engine translate the queries into sql query, building the select like this according to the user&#39;s current query formulated in a language on a higher abstraction level.\r\n\r\nWe see there are two types of filtering criteria. A **strong criterion** is like ‘*height is exactly 198.92 cm*’ because there are a very few person with this height. \r\nA **weak criterion** is like ‘*likes puppies = yes*’ – almost everybody answered to this question, almost everybody answered by ‘yes’, and there exists very few different answers to this question (*absolutely*|*yes*|*yesss*|*no*).\r\n\r\nWhen we apply a strong criterion (3 inner join), the select executes in an acceptable time, 0.1 sec for example, selecting for example 200 rows. Applying two strong criteria (6 inner joins) in a row, the execution time remains the same, selecting for example 60 rows. But when we apply (for example) two strong and a weak, the execution time increases dramatically, up to 4-10 secs, selecting for example 20 rows at the end (we have use cases as users usually applies 4-6 strong, and 2-3 weak criteria, sometimes the execution takes 10-30 secs).\r\n\r\nBack to the 2+1 use case: my boss keeps asking me why takes it 4-10 secs, as the strong criterion must have been applied on the pre-selected 60 rows only, should not keep so long. I think SQL does not think on this way, using sets and relational algebra operations.\r\n\r\nThe question is: is there a better way to translate the simple queries to SQL selects to achieve better execution time at the end?\r\n\r\nSorry for the long text and my poor english (I am a Hungarian developer)  :( Thanks for any advice!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986026/applying-weak-and-strong-filtering-criteria-on-a-custom-free-attribute-storage-d","title":"Applying weak and strong filtering criteria on a custom free attribute storage database"},{"tags":["html","css","bootstrap-4"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6322,"user_id":3289660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGFex.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nidhin Joseph","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3289660/nidhin-joseph"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568786862,"post_id":57986025,"comment_id":102380266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986025/how-to-make-5-row-bootstrap-grid-take-up-whole-window#comment102380266_57986025"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":5990817,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGK4Q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lvcas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5990817/lvcas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568787038,"creation_date":1568787038,"answer_id":57986085,"question_id":57986025,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57986085","body_markdown":"I suggest reading this article [5 column layout with Bootstrap 4][1]\r\n\r\n...also note that initial size of width is 12, so if you want 5 exactly same items every single one has to be of size 2 + adding some css to space them differently should resolve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.cattlegrid.info/2018/06/21/5-column-layout-with-bootstrap-4.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986025/how-to-make-5-row-bootstrap-grid-take-up-whole-window/57986085#57986085","title":"How to make 5 row bootstrap grid take up whole window?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":7494128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7bc766454c65958820aed355ca73c13e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jan Kruse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7494128/jan-kruse"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568787070,"creation_date":1568787070,"answer_id":57986093,"question_id":57986025,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57986093","body_markdown":"Remove the col-attribute from each label, but take care would look bad on small screens.

That is, label each of the arcs in the solution and verify that the flows are consistent with the given information.\r\n- c) How would your solution change if programmer 3 could not be assigned to tasks 2 or 4?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/s9CmY.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986013/how-can-i-solve-a-task-assigning-job-in-solver","title":"How can I solve a Task Assigning job in Solver?"},{"tags":["laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":609,"user_id":4391408,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1876f2249c5d87fb54e22fbd74f2964a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ivan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4391408/ivan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568789322,"post_id":57986012,"comment_id":102381245,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986012/laravel-5-4-http-error-500-unable-to-handle-this-request#comment102381245_57986012"},{"owner":{"reputation":834,"user_id":7752049,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/570bc77003f2aff3f97addbc3916b0bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"parastoo amini","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7752049/parastoo-amini"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568790058,"post_id":57986012,"comment_id":102381568,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986012/laravel-5-4-http-error-500-unable-to-handle-this-request#comment102381568_57986012"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10201711,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_K3iWeS_pxQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXI/qKN0fy5A99o/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"arpita singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10201711/arpita-singh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568817609,"post_id":57986012,"comment_id":102397179,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986012/laravel-5-4-http-error-500-unable-to-handle-this-request#comment102397179_57986012"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10201711,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_K3iWeS_pxQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXI/qKN0fy5A99o/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"arpita singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10201711/arpita-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1109,"user_id":9763011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5Xh7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gayan S.

know the title sounds confusing but bear with me.\r\nim coding my first game and i&#39;m trying to set up a class for AI (called AI_mode) that my obj_creature class can use to get whatever kind of AI the creature entity needs. im passing a method from AI_mode as a variable to obj_creature. the method thats passed from AI_mode to obj_creature calls another method from inside the obj_creature class.

the owner but im not really sure what to use in its place. when i try to declare obj_creature as the owner of AI_mode like so:\r\n\r\n    class obj_creature:\r\n        def __init__(self, npc_mode=None):\r\n            self.npc_mode=npc_mode\r\n            if npc_mode:\r\n                npc_mode.owner=self\r\n\r\ni get this error: \r\n\r\n    npc_mode.owner=self\r\n    AttributeError:

For example: I have two dataframes:\r\n\r\n    a={&#39;age&#39;:[22,38,26,62,198,27],&#39;no&#39;:[1,2,3,4,5,6]} \r\n\r\n\r\n    TableB= {&#39;name&#39;: [&#39;Braund&#39;, &#39;Cummings&#39;, &#39;Heikkinen&#39;, &#39;Allen&#39;,&#39;Mary&#39;,&#39;Celina&#39;,&#39;Roger&#39;],\r\n    &#39;age&#39;: [22,38,26,35,41,22,38],\r\n    &#39;fare&#39;: [7.25, 71.83, 0 , 8.05,7,6.05,6], \r\n    &#39;survived?&#39;: [False, True, True, False, True, False, True]}\r\n\r\n   \r\nI would like to check if every number in the &#39;age&#39; column of a is included in the &#39;age&#39; column of TableB, if it is included, add a column &#39;Observer&#39; in a and set the value to 1,if not,0.\r\n\r\n    I have tried this:\r\n\r\n    a[&#39;age&#39;].isin(TableB[&#39;age&#39;].set_value(&#39;Observer&#39;,1)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nexpected results are as follows, but my result is that all the values in the observer column of a is 1.\r\n\r\n    a={&#39;age&#39;:[22,38,26,62,198,27],&#39;no&#39;:[1,2,3,4,5,6],&#39;observer&#39;:[1,1,1,0,0,0]}","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986006/how-to-set-the-column-value-of-one-dataframe-depending-on-whether-the-value-in-a","title":"how to set the column value of one dataframe depending on whether the value in another column is included in the specific column of another dataframe"},{"tags":["python-3.x","tensorflow","matplotlib","undefined-variable"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3657,"user_id":554517,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a43616ec586451a008de62b44605eb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gymshoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/554517/gymshoe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568832795,"post_id":57995737,"comment_id":102404176,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57986005/matplotlib-cm-coolwarm-used-in-colaboratory-tensorflow-tutorial-from-google-is/57995737#comment102404176_57995737"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":172124,"user_id":4124317,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wsHAV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ImportanceOfBeingErnest","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4124317/importanceofbeingernest"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568818717,"creation_date":1568818717,"answer_id":57995737,"question_id":57986005,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57995737","body_markdown":"The coolwarm colormap is not deprecated in any newer version of matplotlib.

I&#39;m just assuming that you are using windows forms by the syntax of your example code, `Thread.Sleep(&#39;time&#39;)` should do the trick for you.\r\nIf you want to make the window disappear and then restart itself after the delay you could try and use `Form1.Visible = false` and then the *Sleep* method in your *Application.restart* method, or include those into a helper function like:\r\n\r\n    void restartApplication(Form form1)\r\n    {\r\n       form1.Visible = false;\r\n       Thread.Sleep(300);\r\n       Application.restart();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then set the form to visible again.
