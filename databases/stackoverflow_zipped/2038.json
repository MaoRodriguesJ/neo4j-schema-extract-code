I have illustrated my confusion with an example. I&#39;m working with flask, and I&#39;d like to essentially create a decorator to verify the user is authenticated. This decorator will use a value that is passed from an endpoint/routed parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef require_jwt(func):\r\n    @wraps(func)\r\n    def attempt_authentication(jwt_token, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        print(jwt_token)\r\n        print(list(args))\r\n        return(jsonify({})) #Avoiding compiler error\r\n    return attempt_authentication\r\n\r\n@app.route(&#39;/endpoint-that-needs-jwt/&lt;string:jwt_token&gt;&#39;, methods=[&#39;POST&#39;])\r\n@require_jwt\r\ndef sign_up(id_token):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming I make a POST request to the endpoint, where ```jwt_token``` maps to ```&quot;somejwt&quot;```...\r\n\r\nThe output of the code was just:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;somejwt&quot;\r\n[]\r\n```\r\nI was expecting it to be more like:\r\n```\r\n&quot;somejwt&quot;\r\n[&quot;somejwt&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m really confused as to why I can&#39;t just use ```args[0]``` instead of ```jwt_token```. Doesn&#39;t *args refer to all of the args in the function? \r\nIf someone could help to alleviate my confusion and explain the scoping I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nEdit: Some have suggested that this maybe because I am already adding jwt_token in the attempt_authentication function parameters.

The delegate create through the second call is only invoked once (with output 1).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056836/c-lambda-use-local-variable/58056891#58056891","title":"C# lambda use local variable"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569221444,"last_edit_date":1569221444,"creation_date":1569221088,"answer_id":58056924,"question_id":58056836,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58056924","body_markdown":"Without testing if act is null, when you call Test() for the second time, it assigns a new inline function to act.\r\n\r\nEach inline act() have access to a different count version in the heap memory.\r\n\r\nTo understand, think that the compiler &quot;reminds&quot; that each act has access to the last call to Test memory space.\r\n\r\nEach time Test is called, it creates a distinct heap space, so count has different value.\r\n\r\nIf you test if act is null and not create a new act inline function, act use only one count.\r\n\r\nIf you create a new act because of not testing if null, each act has access to a new count version like if it was a new instance of an object having count as member.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056836/c-lambda-use-local-variable/58056924#58056924","title":"C# lambda use local variable"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":11815085,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AI1Ge.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Snow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11815085/snow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2269,"user_id":9020340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28f9d4d1cf9858c83289a0ceac267b16?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ArunPratap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9020340/arunpratap"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":231,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58056891,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569348127,"creation_date":1569220601,"last_edit_date":1569348127,"question_id":58056836,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58056836","body_markdown":"```\r\nclass Program\r\n    {        \r\n        static Action act = null;\r\n\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            Test();\r\n            act();\r\n            act();\r\n            Test();\r\n            act();\r\n        }   \r\n        \r\n        static void Test()\r\n        {\r\n            int count = 0;\r\n\r\n            if(act == null) act = () =&gt; Console.Write(++count + &quot; &quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }  \r\n```\r\n\r\n**result** : `1 2 3` why?

Maybe other option is to create several `Session` instances in my backend and then set the `sessionid` on the fly.\r\n\r\nIdeas?\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056820/stripe-can-you-set-client-reference-id-via-stripe-js","title":"Stripe - can you set client_reference_id via stripe.js?"},{"tags":["angular","ngrx"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4972,"user_id":10112124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e6297e8a8df7affbe897ed476212148?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"timdeschryver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10112124/timdeschryver"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569244059,"creation_date":1569244059,"answer_id":58063194,"question_id":58056819,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58063194","body_markdown":"If they are two separate entities, I would suggest splitting them up in to multiple reducers.

The doc of Interpolations.jl is as following:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl/blob/master/doc/Interpolations.jl.ipynb\r\n\r\nAnd for Dierckx.jl:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kbarbary/Dierckx.jl\r\n\r\nSo I tried to experiment the interpolation using different functions, for example:\r\nA simple code:\r\n```\r\nusing Interpolations\r\nxs = 0:5\r\nf(x) = x^2 * abs(sin(3*x) + cos(x))\r\nys = f.(xs)\r\nf_int = interpolate(ys, BSpline(Quadratic(Line(OnCell()))))\r\nprintln(&quot;f(3.2) = &quot;, f(3.2))\r\nprintln(&quot;f_int(3.2) = &quot;, f_int(3.2))\r\n```\r\nQuadratic interpolation is supposed to be quite accurate, however the result is as following:\r\n```\r\nf(3.2) = 12.007644743861604\r\nf_int(3.2) = 2.973832923722435\r\n```\r\nSo what have I misunderstood about the functionality of Interpolations.jl? The `interpolate` function in Interpolations.jl does not accept the array `xs` as argument but only `ys`, so I think it maybe due to my &quot;incorrect&quot; choice of `xs`?\r\n\r\nThen I switched to Dierckx.jl, which accept both `xs` and `ys` in the functions `Spline1D` and `Spline2D`. It seemed to me `Spline1D` worked fine in the example as above, as I switched the line of the function interpolation to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nf_int = Spline1D(xs, ys)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when I experimented with 2D, problems arose again:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing Dierckx\r\nxs = 1:5\r\nys = 1:8\r\ng = Float64[(3x + y ^ 2) * abs(sin(x) + cos(y)) for x in xs, y in ys]\r\nf(x) = (3x + y ^ 2) * abs(sin(x) + cos(y))\r\nf_int = Spline2D(xs, ys, g)\r\nprintln(&quot;f(3.2, 3.2) = &quot;, f(3.2, 3.2))\r\nprintln(&quot;f_int(3.2, 3.2) = &quot;, f_int(3.2, 3.2))\r\n```\r\nThe result:\r\n```\r\nf(3.2, 3.2) = -0.6316251447925815\r\nf_int(3.2, 3.2) = 20.578758429637535\r\n```\r\nSo again, what&#39;s wrong with the code above? What have I misunderstood about the functionalities of these packages?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Edit]\r\nI tried to plot a contour to compare the interpolated 2D function produced by Interpolations.jl and the actual contour of the function, and this gives rise to the following result:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing Interpolations\r\nusing Plots\r\ngr()\r\n\r\nxs = 1:0.5:5\r\nys = 1:0.5:8\r\ng = Float64[(3x + y ^ 2) for x in xs, y in ys]\r\nf(x, y) = (3x + y ^ 2)\r\n\r\ng_int = interpolate(g, BSpline(Quadratic(Line(OnCell()))))\r\n\r\ngs_int = scale(g_int, xs, ys)\r\n\r\nxc = 1:0.1:5\r\nyc = 1:0.1:5\r\n\r\nprintln(&quot;gs_int(3.2, 3.2) = &quot;, gs_int(3.2, 3.2))\r\nprintln(&quot;f(3.2, 3.2) = &quot;, f(3.2, 3.2))\r\n\r\np1 = contour(xs, ys, gs_int(xs, ys), fill=true)\r\np2 = contour(xc, yc, f, fill=true)\r\n\r\nplot(p1, p2)\r\n```\r\n![a](https://i.imgur.com/bt43rVg.png)\r\n\r\nThere doesn&#39;t seem to be problems with the interpolated function for now by randomly choosing some values of (x, y), but why does the contour plot of the interpolated function look so distorted?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056815/interpolating-functions-using-interpolations-jl-and-dierckx-jl-in-julia","title":"Interpolating functions using Interpolations.jl and Dierckx.jl in Julia"},{"tags":["json","flutter","split","dropdown","sqflite"],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":11399686,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Z-Td_rchsRg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd_yGtJoae0FWuvhyj1luWOjE8cGw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"santosh adhikari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11399686/santosh-adhikari"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569220538,"creation_date":1569220538,"question_id":58056814,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58056814","body_markdown":"i want dropdown of stages in flutter which values come from sqflite database. the sample value in json is in below format and these values are store locally. there are two dropdown[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n \r\nif i select &#39;teacher&#39; pipeline then it&#39;s id 54 was passed to future builder of stages&#39;s dropdown and i want to select one stage.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qaw0t.png\r\n\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: 54,\r\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;teacher&quot;,\r\n                &quot;stages&quot;: &quot;{\\&quot;advertise\\&quot;:false,\\&quot;interview\\&quot;:false}&quot;,\r\n                &quot;created_at&quot;: &quot;2019-08-23 20:11:54&quot;,\r\n                &quot;updated_at&quot;: &quot;2019-08-23 20:12:48&quot;,\r\n                &quot;deleted_at&quot;: null\r\n            },\r\n\r\nthe below is future builder for dropdown\r\n\r\n                                 FutureBuilder(\r\n                                  future: pipelineHelper.getPipeStage(pipelineId),\r\n                                  builder: (BuildContext context,\r\n                                      AsyncSnapshot&lt;List&lt;Pipeline&gt;&gt;\r\n                                      snapshot) {\r\n                                    if (!snapshot.hasData)\r\n                                      return CircularProgressIndicator();\r\n                                    return DropdownButton(\r\n                                      items: snapshot.data\r\n                                          .map((stageList) =&gt; DropdownMenuItem&lt;Pipeline&gt;(\r\n                                        value: stageList, child: Text(stageList.stages),))\r\n                                          .toList(),\r\n                                      onChanged: (value) {\r\n                                        setState(() {\r\n                                          stageName = value.stages;\r\n                                          debugPrint(&#39;stage selected&#39;);\r\n                                        });\r\n                                      },\r\n                                      isExpanded: true,\r\n                                      hint: Column(\r\n                                        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,\r\n                                        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\r\n                                        children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                                          SizedBox(height: 8.0),\r\n                                          Text(&#39;Stage&#39;,style: _fontSize,),\r\n                                          stageName == null ?

We use these properties to vertically center elements inside containers that have a fixed height. I suspect it might be something to do with [this change][1]. \r\n\r\nI have replicated the issue in a very simple test case: \r\n\r\nindex.html: \r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n      &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;testing&lt;/title&gt;\r\n      &lt;/head&gt;\r\n      &lt;body&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\nstyles.css:\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      width: 300px;\r\n      height: 100px;\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      background-color: yellow;\r\n      overflow: auto;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .child {\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      float: left;\r\n      top: calc(50% - 100vh);\r\n      transform: translateY(-50%) translateY(100vh);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n[Here is the jsfiddle][2]. If you view it in Chrome 77, the yellow div has a vertical scrollbar which scrolls down a long way (the height of vh). If you view it on Chrome &lt;= 76 (or any other browser) it does not. \r\n\r\nThe problem is solved by changing the top and transform properties to the following: \r\n\r\n    .child {\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      float: left;\r\n      top: calc(50%);\r\n      transform: translateY(-50%);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, the reason why the 100vh is subtracted and added was to work around an IE and Edge issue where a vertical scroll bar would appear if .child had a height &gt;= 50% of the .container height. By removing the 100vh to fix the Chrome 77 issue, we have now reintroduced the IE and Edge issue. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a solution for vertically centering elements on all browsers including Chrome 77? \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/06/layoutNG#floats\r\n  [2]:

are a few potential problems\r\n```cpp\r\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; DIGITS ; j++){\r\n            int val = n1_digit * (pow(10, i)) * n2.get(j); // val % 10 == 0 for i &gt; 0\r\n            // You should also be adding the carry to val\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;n1: &quot; &lt;&lt; n1_digit &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;n2: &quot; &lt;&lt; n2.get(j) &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\r\n            if(carry != 0){\r\n                temp.set(j, (Bigint::getDigitValue(val)) + carry);\r\n                // This can set temp[j] to values above 9 depending on the carry\r\n                cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Carry was &quot; &lt;&lt; carry &lt;&lt; &quot;, now set 0&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n                cout &lt;&lt; &quot;value to set: &quot; &lt;&lt; (Bigint::getDigitValue(val)) + carry &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n                carry = 0;\r\n            }\r\n            else if(carry == 0){\r\n                temp.set(j, Bigint::getDigitValue(val));\r\n                cout &lt;&lt; &quot;value to set: &quot; &lt;&lt; (Bigint::getDigitValue(val))&lt;&lt; endl;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            carry = (Bigint::getCarry(val) + carry);\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;carry: &quot; &lt;&lt; carry &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nBecause you multiply by a power of 10, getDigitValue and getCarry aren&#39;t acting the way you expect them to. It might be better to shift the index for temp.set up by i instead of multiplying by pow(10, i).\r\n\r\nI would also recommend cleaning up the cases. Both the if and the else if are actually doing the same work in this case, and resetting the carry doesn&#39;t do anything. So this would have the exact same behavior:\r\n```cpp\r\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; DIGITS ; j++){\r\n            int val = n1_digit * (pow(10, i)) * n2.get(j);\r\n\r\n            temp.set(j, (Bigint::getDigitValue(val)) + carry);\r\n            // If the carry is 0, the addition doesn&#39;t do anything\r\n            // You don&#39;t need to reset the carry to 0, since it&#39;s assigned here anyway\r\n            carry = (Bigint::getCarry(val) + carry);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nWithout the cases and without the print statements, it&#39;s much easier to read, but here the use of methods (getCarry and getDigitValue) still makes it hard to see the problem by moving the relevant operations to the bottom of the class. Making the changes gives:\r\n```cpp\r\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; DIGITS ; j++){\r\n            int val = n1_digit * n2.get(j) + carry;\r\n\r\n            temp.set(i + j, Bigint::getDigitValue(val));\r\n            carry = Bigint::getCarry(val);\r\n            // The carry just gets added to the value at the beginning\r\n            // Everything else just works that way\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nYou also need to change the get and set functions so that they don&#39;t work out of bounds:\r\n```cpp\r\nint Bigint::get(int pos) const {\r\n    //Return address of digit for reading\r\n    if (pos &gt;= DIGITS)\r\n        return 0;\r\n    int ret = digits_[pos];\r\n    return ret;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid Bigint::set(int pos, int val) {\r\n    if (pos &gt;= DIGITS)\r\n        return ;\r\n    this-&gt;digits_[pos] = val;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith this code, I get 3425 for 25 * 137.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056791/bigint-calculator-spitting-out-slightly-wrong-results/58057156#58057156","title":"BigInt calculator spitting out slightly wrong results"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":7824081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f24a6bf3de073b608770c3e5f9d0c7f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cloppy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7824081/cloppy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569225252,"post_id":58057538,"comment_id":102512986,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056791/bigint-calculator-spitting-out-slightly-wrong-results/58057538#comment102512986_58057538"},{"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":5838128,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6cZHlgIgP0E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEE/51L3zXf4Vro/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reshad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5838128/reshad"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13,"user_id":7824081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f24a6bf3de073b608770c3e5f9d0c7f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cloppy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7824081/cloppy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569230307,"post_id":58057538,"comment_id":102515432,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056791/bigint-calculator-spitting-out-slightly-wrong-results/58057538#comment102515432_58057538"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":5838128,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6cZHlgIgP0E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEE/51L3zXf4Vro/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reshad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5838128/reshad"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569223667,"creation_date":1569223667,"answer_id":58057538,"question_id":58056791,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58057538","body_markdown":"you should not use this line`            int val = n1_digit * (pow(10, i)) * n2.get(j);\r\n`\r\nbecause it will give integer overflow since you are working with bigintger\r\ninstead use the digits in the multiplier and add zeros behind the result.\r\n\r\nthe number of zeros to add will depend on the position of the multiplier digit which you can find the variable i from this loop `for(int i = 0; i &lt; DIGITS ; i++)` in the overloaded * function","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056791/bigint-calculator-spitting-out-slightly-wrong-results/58057538#58057538","title":"BigInt calculator spitting out slightly wrong results"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":7824081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f24a6bf3de073b608770c3e5f9d0c7f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cloppy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7824081/cloppy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":7824081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f24a6bf3de073b608770c3e5f9d0c7f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Cloppy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7824081/cloppy"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":87,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569246920,"creation_date":1569220425,"last_edit_date":1569221286,"question_id":58056791,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58056791","body_markdown":"So for my assignment I have to create a calculator that works with big integers up to 256 characters in length. The current part of the assignment I&#39;m up to is getting it work with multiplication of larger numbers. DIGITS is the limit of digits per Bigint class, currently set to 20 for debug sake, but will go up to 256\r\n\r\nWhen doing a calculation like 25 * 137, I get the answer 3285 when it should be 3425. When I look through the couts that I put in place for debug, the first iteration of the i loop works perfectly and adds 685 to sum which is 5 * 137, so that works perfect. However when it gets to the bit where it&#39;s having to do the second iteration of the i loop where it is 20 * 137, it&#39;s getting the answer wrong and I cannot work out why. I have an inkling that it&#39;s something to do with the carry being two digits (14), but I still can&#39;t really work out how I can fix it.\r\n\r\nThe main implementation that obviously has something wrong with it is in the * operator of the bigint class.

Perhaps put them in dot points?\r\n\r\n**overall look:**\r\n\r\nThere are some pre-made themes you can try, I like:\r\n\r\n1.  `theme_void()`     - removes most things\r\n2.  `theme_classic()`  - makes the background nicer to look at\r\n3.  `theme_minimal()`  - removes the outer border and makes the background prettier\r\n\r\nYou can add them as a layer with `+ theme_void()` on the end of the plotting code.\r\n\r\nFor all other specific customisations look at `?theme()` as there are a whole bunch of things you can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n**labels:**\r\n\r\nTo remove the title &#39;label&#39; add `labs(legend = &#39;&#39;)` as a layer. You can also use this to modify the x, y, caption and title text.\r\n\r\nIf you want to remove the legend entirely, you can add `show.legend = F` inside your `geom_jitter()` layer. (e.g. `geom_jitter(show.legend = F)`) This will mean it shows on the graph, but nothing appears in the legend.\r\n\r\n**facets:**\r\n\r\nTo change the colour of the background in `facte_wrap` use `theme(strip.background = element_rect(color = &#39;desired_colour&#39;))`\r\n\r\nTo change the colour of the text in `facte_wrap` use `theme(strip.text = element_text(color = &#39;desired_colour&#39;))`\r\n\r\n**axis lines:**\r\n\r\nadd `theme(axis.line = element_blank())`\r\n\r\n**points:**\r\n\r\nYour points are off center due to the `geom_jitter()`. Try `geom_point()` instead.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056787/r-novice-and-trying-to-improve-the-appearance-of-grouped-box-plots/58057052#58057052","title":"R novice and trying to improve the appearance of grouped box plots"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12104201,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a1738c967c202931e0e3de1d2465be2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kmitch85","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12104201/kmitch85"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569256602,"post_id":58057262,"comment_id":102529570,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056787/r-novice-and-trying-to-improve-the-appearance-of-grouped-box-plots/58057262#comment102529570_58057262"},{"owner":{"reputation":935,"user_id":8757228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1f82aef27a36a80ae9dca9d75bb33eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alex_555","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8757228/alex-555"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12104201,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a1738c967c202931e0e3de1d2465be2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kmitch85","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12104201/kmitch85"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569307148,"post_id":58057262,"comment_id":102543839,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58056787/r-novice-and-trying-to-improve-the-appearance-of-grouped-box-plots/58057262#comment102543839_58057262"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":935,"user_id":8757228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1f82aef27a36a80ae9dca9d75bb33eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alex_555","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8757228/alex-555"},"last_editor":{"reputation":935,"user_id":8757228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1f82aef27a36a80ae9dca9d75bb33eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alex_555","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8757228/alex-555"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569222788,"last_edit_date":1569222788,"creation_date":1569222464,"answer_id":58057262,"question_id":58056787,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58057262","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s an example of your plot with the things you wanted to do.

It&#39;s a GUI tool for your convenience, instead of having to switch to SSMS. It&#39;s part of visual studio, not part of the application you are writing. Your code knows nothing about it. \r\n\r\nYour application must still connect to the database in the normal way using a connection string when it is executing.\r\n\r\nThis is because your application executes separately from Visual Studio. Think about it...when you deploy your code to be a live application, it no longer has any link to Visual Studio. It&#39;s out there on its own. So it would make no sense for it to depend on a component inside Visual Studio. You may be using GUI tools to drag things like datasets into your application, but all that is doing is providing a graphical way to auto-generate some code. In the end that code must still be able to execute independently.\r\n\r\nThe Dataset editor you mentioned is another design-time tool. So yes it can connect to the database via the Connection object in Server Explorer, but that has nothing to do with your application, because the application does not execute the designer code when it runs. Instead it uses the dataset created by it (i.e. the _result_ of using the designer) as part of the application. That dataset, in the context of your running application, needs to connect again to the database in order to fill with data. It does that using the standard connection string in your config file.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nDon&#39;t confuse the tools you&#39;re using the build the application with the actual finished application itself. All that these tools do is make it easier to write and generate your application&#39;s code. You could write exactly the same application completely by hand using Notepad, if you wanted to. And you could compile and execute it using command-line tools, without any need for Visual Studio.

But the problem I faced here is when I open multiple windows in ```webview``` I&#39;m not able to close the parent window through which it was opened. The opening and closing of window is controlled by simple code written on remote server simply consisting of ```window.open(&quot;some_valid_url&quot;)``` and ```window.close()``` to open and close window respectively. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m giving webview to let&#39;s say www.someValidUrl.com which has code to open the window and close the window.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nMain Page --&gt; Then Main Page opens window A--&gt; Then window A Opens window B, Now if I close window B then try to close window A, window A won&#39;t be closed.\r\n\r\nAs a result I&#39;m not able to return to Main page.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m adding the code which is used to ***open*** and ***close*** windows respectively :\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ViewController: UIViewController, UIWebViewDelegate, CLLocationManagerDelegate,WKUIDelegate,WKNavigationDelegate\r\n{\r\n    @IBOutlet weak var webView: WKWebView!\r\n    var popupWebView: WKWebView?\r\n    ...\r\n    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, createWebViewWith configuration: WKWebViewConfiguration, for navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, windowFeatures: WKWindowFeatures) -&gt; WKWebView? {\r\n            popupWebView = WKWebView(frame: view.bounds, configuration: configuration)\r\n            popupWebView!.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]\r\n            popupWebView!.navigationDelegate = self\r\n            popupWebView!.uiDelegate = self\r\n            view.addSubview(popupWebView!)\r\n            return popupWebView!\r\n        }\r\n    func webViewDidClose(_ webView: WKWebView) {\r\n        if webView == popupWebView {\r\n            popupWebView?.removeFromSuperview()\r\n            popupWebView = nil\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI have shared the only code which was used for windows opening and closing.

The error you see in the console is part of the new promise api: before, if no callbacks were supplied to router.push, errors were only sent to the global router error handler. Now, because both push and replace return a promise, if the navigation failure (anything that cancels a navigation like a next(false) or next(&#39;/other&#39;) also counts) is not caught, you will see an error in the console because that promise rejection is not caught. However, the failure was always there because trying to navigate to same location as the current one fails.

For instance, assuming you need to operate on a sequence of integers, you can call it in this way:\r\n\r\n    (function 1 2 3 4 5)\r\n\r\nand inside the body of the function `arg1` will be bound to `1` and `rest-of-args-as-list` will be bound to the list `(2 3 4 5)`.\r\n\r\nSo in you case, if you call the function: `(even-odd-filter 1 2 3 4 5)`, `x` will be bound to `1`, `intlis`t to `(2 3 4 5)` and in the second iteration, the function will be called as: `(even-odd-filter 1 (3 4 5))` (since `x` is `1` and `cdr` of `(2 3 4 5)` is `(3 4 5)`). \r\nAnd calling it in this way will produce the error (in DrRacket):\r\n\r\n    modulo: contract violation\r\n      expected: integer?\r\n      given: &#39;(3 4 5)\r\n      argument position: 1st\r\n      other arguments...:\r\n    &gt; \r\n\r\nHow could you solve this problem?\r\n\r\nA possibility is to define the function with a single argument which is a list. Here is a rewriting of your function in this way:\r\n\r\n    (define (even-odd-filter intlist)   \r\n      (cond ((equal? &#39;() intlist) &#39;())\r\n            ((equal? &#39;() (cdr intlist)) intlist)\r\n            ((equal?

It makes easier to read code. Since you have nested `if` I turned it into `cond` which is for a typical `if-then-else` scenario. \r\n\r\nIf you really want rest arguments in recursion, you need to use `apply` in each recursive call. This is not very efficient since it most likely will create a new list each iteration:\r\n\r\n    (define (even-odd-filter x . intlist)   \r\n      (if (equal? &#39;() intlist)\r\n          &#39;()\r\n          (if (equal?

I wanted to test the `INCR` operation in redis, where I initialize the counter to `1` (by setting a key named total-calls) and then for each incoming request, I increase the counter by 1. So after 3000 requests, the counter should be 3000, after 8000 requests counter must be 8000.\r\n\r\nFor this, I created a simple `NodeJS` script running express and a simple middleware that increments a counter. I used [loadtest][1]\r\nfor the load testing. Everything works fine, when there is no concurrency but the results diverge by `1` , `3` or `5` when the I increase the concurrency. I cannot understand the reason for this.\r\n\r\nSo for the input test where concurrency is 1 and the number of requests are 3000:\r\n\r\n    loadtest -n 3000 -c 1 http://localhost:3000\r\n\r\nthe redis `get total-calls` command gives the expected result of `3000`.\r\n\r\nBut if I increase the concurrency, to 5 and run the same command after removing the previous key from redis, I get total count as 3001. Why does that happen? \r\n\r\n    loadtest -n 3000 -c 5 http://localhost:3000\r\n\r\nand on further increasing the number of requests to 8000, the total count becomes 8003. I cannot understand the reason for this.\r\n\r\nThe code that gets hit by the loadtest:\r\n\r\n    const express = require(&#39;express&#39;);\r\n    const app = express();\r\n    const Redis = require(&quot;./redis-wrapper&quot;);\r\n\r\n    const client = new Redis();\r\n    const maxCallsAllowed = 50000\r\n\r\n    const requestCounter = async (req, resp, next) =&gt; {\r\n        // Increment the request counter\r\n        const redis = client.redis;\r\n        if(await redis.exists(&quot;total-calls&quot;) === 1) {\r\n            // Key already exists\r\n            // Increment the key\r\n            await redis.incr(&quot;total-calls&quot;)\r\n        }else {\r\n            // Key does not exist\r\n            // Set the key\r\n            await redis.set(&quot;total-calls&quot;, 1)\r\n        }\r\n        next();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    app.get(&#39;/&#39;, requestCounter, (req, resp, next) =&gt; {\r\n        resp.json({\r\n            status: &#39;ok&#39;\r\n        })\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    app.listen(3000);\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there something that I am missing?

I.e. instead of return `BaseResponse&lt;SomeClass&gt;` you want to return `SomeClassResponse : BaseResponse&lt;SomeClass&gt;`. If so I would recommend to use [T4 templates][1]. Using T4 you can write template logic like this:\r\n\r\n 1. get all classes from `YourApp.Domain` namespace\r\n 2. for each domain class generate response classes like `public sealed SomeClassresponse : BaseResponse&lt;SomeClass&gt; {}`\r\n 3. just use these classes in your code because they are known in compile time.\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need to generate classes in runtime because you already know all classes you need to generate.
