are several issues with the code.\r\n\r\n- you try to use ```val phoneNumber``` that is not mutable in two way binding, thus is has only getter so binding class can only read value from field, to receive data from the UI - binding class wants to use setter, but there is no setter present, thus the ```phoneNumber``` won&#39;t change.\r\n\r\n- for the property that binds ```phoneNumber``` you try to use ```LiveData``` which is not mutable - you should use ```MutableLiveData``` in case you need it to be able to change.\r\n\r\n- if you want to listen to the changes of ```phoneNumber``` you need to add ```LiveData``` ```Observer``` like \r\n```\r\nphoneNumber.observe{\r\n  val value = it\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope it

(i.e. you are trying to build a library using webpack and you want it to be accessible by other people). This basically means you need to access the original `module` variable, but webpack doesn&#39;t expose it like it happened with `__non_webpack_require__`.\r\n\r\n&gt; See also: [Importing runtime modules from outside webpack bundle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215361/importing-from-outside-webpack-runtime-importing/58215363)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215470/exporting-outside-webpack","title":"Exporting outside webpack"},{"tags":["html","rest","postman","quickbooks"],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9884347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Master Blaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9884347/master-blaster"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9884347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Master Blaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9884347/master-blaster"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570612204,"creation_date":1570092498,"last_edit_date":1570612204,"question_id":58215465,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58215465","body_markdown":"Trying to get authorization code from quickbook (com.intuit.quickbooks.payment) using postman. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have read whole document for how to get authorization code which is give in step 1  https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbpayments/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/M1mjC.png\r\n\r\nAs shown in image I pass exactly same parameters which is shown in link step 1.

(because of some situation we can&#39;t use FCM)\r\nTo be confident that clients are connected to the server, We send a ping to server every 1 minute with JobScheduler. Now we have a battery usage problem.\r\nIt&#39;s better to use CountDownTimer like bellow code in our foreground service :\r\n\r\n    CountDownTimer countDownTimerPingPeriodic;\r\n    public static boolean isPinging;\r\n\r\n    public void pingPeriodic(boolean fromService) {\r\n\r\n        if (countDownTimerPingPeriodic != null) {\r\n            countDownTimerPingPeriodic.cancel();\r\n

reschedule the job\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n      \r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean onStopJob(JobParameters params) {\r\n        Util.scheduleJob(getApplicationContext());\r\n

this service We use bellow code to repeat every 1 minute:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    public class Util {\r\n\r\n    public static final long MinimumSchadulePeriodic = 15 *  60 * 1000 ;\r\n    // schedule the

of all before making any claim on the reason why a piece of code is slow you should really measure its performance on your machine and then with data at hand deduce *why*.\r\n\r\nThat said I am quite confident in this case in saying that the problem might reside in the fact that you are allocating `90k` vectors of string each of them of size `1k`. As you know memory allocation is costly, and it might explain your performance penalty. \r\n\r\nThe following is how you could implement your code using  only a `1D` array allocated upfront. \r\n\r\n    size_t nbRows = mData.size();\r\n    size_t nbCols = mData[0].size();\r\n    \r\n    auto get_idx = [](const int i, const int nr, const int j)\r\n    {\r\n        return i*nr+j;\r\n    };\r\n       \r\n    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; transposedData(nbCols*nbRows);  \r\n    for(size_t i = 0 ; i &lt; nbCols  ; ++i)\r\n    {\r\n        for(size_t j = 0 ; j &lt; nbRows ; ++j)\r\n        {\r\n            const int idx = get_idx(j, nbCols,i);\r\n            transposedData[idx] = std::move(mData[j][i]);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    for(size_t i = 0 ; i &lt; nbCols  ; ++i)\r\n    {\r\n        for(size_t j = 0 ; j &lt; nbRows ; ++j)\r\n        {\r\n            const int idx = get_idx(j, nbCols,i);\r\n            cout&lt;&lt;transposedData[idx]&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        cout&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    }    \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to stress it again: profile your code.

The only place the get is fired is from a button by the sitatra script. I have put a puts before the action. From that I can see the whole get block is fired again. And that is not the method being called from an unexpected place.\r\n\r\nThis is the code: the get comes from a single button press. But I can see &#39;GET MAAKZIP&#39; appearing twice on the screen, the second time after a while. Immediately, sinatra shows an error screen caused by a *raise* that is fired by the method *thistakesalongtime*\r\n\r\n    get &#39;/makezip&#39; do\r\n        puts &quot;GET MAKEZIP&quot;\r\n        Struct.verwerker.thistakesalongtime\r\n        \r\n        erb :show_conversionresult\r\n    end\r\n\r\n\r\nI will add code to the method that prevents the method to start again when another call is running.\r\n\r\nBut I want to understand why the get &#39;/maakzip&#39; in the code example is fired again after some time. Is it a browser feature or is it sinatra that is responsible for this? Where can I influence this?\r\n\r\nthanks, Ruud\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nI have made this testscript that shows the problem. It is not minimal anymore, but it can be run for who wants. I have made a workaround for the problem in the same script.

The structure I used for my code is adapted from the code on UsefulAngle.com: https://usefulangle.com/post/75/typing-effect-animation-javascript-css\r\n\r\nI run into several issues refactoring the code:\r\n\r\n1. I tried to refactor the Type and Delete functions (not shown; they are shown in the link in first paragraph above and that actual code works and is in my remote JS file). I attempted to refactor into TypeRTL and DeleteLTR functions respectively (shown in code snippet below). It did not work.\r\n\r\n2. Even if I were to succeed in refactoring to accommodate TypeRTL and DeleteLTR code, I run into the problem of only being able to run one line of code that can&#39;t be in an if-else statement to have the typing effect occur on load of page. I would have to choose between typing LTR and typing RTL because I would need to specify in one line of code: \r\n   _INTERVAL_VAL = setInterval(Type, 100);\r\nOR\r\n   _INTERVAL_VAL = setInterval(TypeRTL, 100);\r\n\r\n3. For right-to-left words, such as in Arabic, I want to make sure that typing actually is from right to left, taking the rightmost character as the first thing to print. I would imagine that I would have to split() the string, thereby getting an array, reverse() the order in the array, join() so that the rightmost character really does print first. Is my assumption correct in handling these right-to-left words in order for the right-to-left typing effect to work?\r\n\r\n* I&#39;ve unsuccessfully refactored the JS for TypeRTL and DeleteLTR functions.\r\n* I&#39;ve unsuccessfully refactored to have the typing effect work for right-to-left words and left-to-right words to sequentially be typed out and deleted on load.\r\n* As a non-Arabic reader, I&#39;m also baffled if I would have to create a function to split the characters in the word into an array, reverse them, and re-string them OR if the substring method (shown in code below) would work...

say we stick to using the Auto Increment `id` column as Primary Key. Now, we will also need to ensure that the data is consistent, *i.e.*, there are no duplicate rows for a combination of `(student_id, course_id)` values. So, we will need to either handle this in application code (do a select every time before insert/update), or we can fix this thing structurally by defining a Composite `UNIQUE` constraint on `(student_id, course_id)`.\r\n\r\nNow, a Primary Key is basically a UNIQUE NOT NULL Key. If you look at your table definition, this newly defined UNIQUE constraint is basically a Primary Key only (because the fields are NOT NULL as well). So, in this particular case, you don&#39;t really need to use a Surrogate Primary key `id`. \r\n\r\nThe difference in overheads during random DML (Insert/Update/Delete) will be minimal, as you would also have similar overheads when using a UNIQUE index only. So, you can rather define a Natural Primary Composite Key `(student_id, course_id)`:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- Drop the id column\r\nALTER TABLE students_courses DROP COLUMN id;\r\n\r\n-- Add the composite Primary Key\r\nALTER TABLE students_courses ADD PRIMARY(student_id, course_id);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove will also enforce the UNIQUE constraint on the combination of `(student_id, course_id)`. Moreover, you will save **4 bytes** per row (size of `int` is 4 bytes). This will come handly when you would have large tables.\r\n\r\nNow, while Joining from `students` to `students_courses` table, above Primary Key will be a sufficient index. However, if you need to Join from `courses` to `students_courses` table, you will need another key for this purpose. So, you can define one more key on `course_id` as follows:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE students_courses ADD INDEX (course_id);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, you should define Foreign Key constraints to ensure data integrity:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE students_courses ADD FOREIGN KEY (student_id) \r\n                             REFERENCES students(student_id);\r\n\r\nALTER TABLE students_courses ADD FOREIGN KEY (course_id) \r\n                             REFERENCES courses(course_id);\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215417/composite-index-for-a-relationship-table/58215634#58215634","title":"Composite index for a relationship table"}],"owner":{"reputation":793,"user_id":1045043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fff9574381798b4b9c4e13dd1f41d383?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vpp Man","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1045043/vpp-man"},"last_editor":{"reputation":793,"user_id":1045043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fff9574381798b4b9c4e13dd1f41d383?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vpp Man","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1045043/vpp-man"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58215634,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570094227,"creation_date":1570092350,"last_edit_date":1570092703,"question_id":58215417,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58215417","body_markdown":"I have the following tables:\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE `students` (\r\n    \t`student_id`\t\t\tint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\t\t\r\n    \t`student_name`\t\t\tvarchar(40) NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;&#39;,\r\n    \tPRIMARY KEY (`student_id`)\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE `courses` (\r\n    \t`course_id`\t\t\t\tint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\t\t\r\n    \t`course_name`\t\t\tvarchar(40) NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;&#39;,\r\n    \tPRIMARY KEY (`course_id`)\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE `students_courses` (\r\n    \t`id`\t\t\t\t\tint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\t\t\r\n    \t`student_id`\t\t\tint NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;0&#39;,\r\n    \t`course_id`\t\t\t\tint NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;0&#39;,\r\n    \tPRIMARY KEY (`id`)\r\n    );\r\n\r\nHere, am using the `students_courses` table to store the relationships between the Students and Courses.

A *child* can either be a boy or a girl specified by xsi:type. These two classes have some elements in common (like *age*) and some different (excluding) elements (like *isdancing* or *issoccerplayer*)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo read the file, i have this method:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static void main( String[] args ) throws JAXBException\r\n    {\r\n    \tJAXBContext jaxbContext;\r\n        jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Children.class);             \r\n        Unmarshaller jaxbUnmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();\r\n        File file = new File(&quot;C:/test.xml&quot;);\r\n        if (!file.exists()) System.out.println(&quot;File does not exist&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        Children children = (Children) jaxbUnmarshaller.unmarshal(file);\r\n        System.out.println(children.toString());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy Children class looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @XmlRootElement(name=&quot;children&quot;)\r\n    @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)\r\n    public class Children {\r\n\r\n        @XmlElement(name=&quot;child&quot;)\r\n        private List&lt;Child&gt; childrenList;\r\n\r\n        public List&lt;Child&gt; getChildren() { return childrenList; }\r\n        public void setChildren(List&lt;Child&gt; children) {this.childrenList = children;}\r\n\t\r\n\t@Override\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(this);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy Child class looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)\r\n    public class Child {\r\n\r\n\t@XmlAttribute(name=&quot;xsi:type&quot;)\r\n\tprivate XsiType xsiType;\r\n\t\r\n\tprivate int age;\r\n\t\r\n\t@XmlElement(name = &quot;isdancing&quot;)\r\n\tprivate boolean isDancing;\r\n\t\r\n\t@XmlElement(name = &quot;issoccerplayer&quot;)\r\n\tprivate boolean isSoccerPlayer;\r\n\t\r\n        //Getter and setter for all fields\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic String toString() {\r\n\t    return ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(this);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my XsiType class looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)\r\n    public class XsiType {\r\n\r\n        @XmlAttribute(name=&quot;xsi:type&quot;)\r\n        private String name;\r\n\t\r\n        @XmlValue\r\n        private String value;\r\n\t\r\n        public String getName() { return name; }\r\n        public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }\r\n        public String getValue() { return value; \r\n        public void setValue(String value) { this.value = value; }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my pom.xml i have included the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.xml.bind&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxb-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;2.3.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.commons&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;commons-lang3&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;3.9&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy problem is now, that the output is ok, but the element xsiType of Child-class is always null or otherwise  it ends up in IllegalAnnotationExceptions, which are related to XmlTest.model.Child.xsiType\r\n\r\nSo i expect there is a mistake by setting any kind of @Xml-Annotation. Can somebody help me by finding the mistake?\r\n\r\nThe target is to iterate of the list of children and decide at runtime (based on the xsiType), if this is a girl or a boy.\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215407/how-to-read-xsitype-with-java-annotations","title":"How to read xsi:type with java annotations"},{"tags":["html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":572,"user_id":5001958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qv8t8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Collin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5001958/collin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570092469,"post_id":58215400,"comment_id":102807162,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215400/create-a-static-progressive-bar-of-circles-connected-by-horizontal-lines#comment102807162_58215400"},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12158144"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":572,"user_id":5001958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qv8t8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Collin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5001958/collin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570092807,"post_id":58215400,"comment_id":102807345,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215400/create-a-static-progressive-bar-of-circles-connected-by-horizontal-lines#comment102807345_58215400"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12158144"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20858,"user_id":4813913,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1Z4R.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Manoj Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4813913/manoj-kumar"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570097132,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570092680,"creation_date":1570092303,"last_edit_date":1570092680,"question_id":58215400,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58215400","body_markdown":"Create a progressive bar which has circles connected by lines, the active circle is statically set in each page.

This worked perfectly until this one page i created.  I didn&#39;t quite understand why so i have been putting breakpoints, and I am not at a point where i can make it work without understanding why.\r\n\r\nSo basically I have a normal class with properties.  And after the class has been populated it gets wrapped as a proxy where each of the normal properties get extended with things like an accesslevel.\r\nWhen i call this piece of code, it tells me which accesslevel the property in question has:\r\n\r\n````(value as FVM.Sys.Core.Model.EF.Dc2.IDcAccessControlled)?.AccessFor(&quot;Name&quot;)````\r\n\r\nSo for the problem:\r\ncalling this method returns me write, which is not logical because in the backend i see my propertyinterceptor passing Read to each property.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, when i&#39;m in a breakpoint right before executing this piece of code, and in my immediate window i just type &quot;value&quot; which gives me the details of the variable.

You do that by separately calling getElementById on specific fields (in this case, &#39;staff&#39; and &#39;desc&#39;, as per your code example) and call .value function on them to get the value from the fields.\r\n\r\nAfter that, configure the text that will be displayed inside the LI element. \r\n\r\nUsing `` and ${} constructions of ES6 as in my example its quite easy, but you can as well use the example below if you find it easier.

along, we will make some modifications to your files:\r\n\r\nFirst lets modify your `MainTabNavigator.js` since you only posted the relevant part, make sure to implement this for the rest as well.\r\n```JavaScript\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;\r\nimport { createStackNavigator, createBottomTabNavigator } from &#39;react-navigation&#39;;\r\nimport {HomeScreen} from &#39;../screens/HomeScreen&#39;;\r\n\r\nlet HomePage = connect(state =&gt; mapStateToProps)(HomeScreen); // &lt;===== Remove this\r\n\r\nconst HomeStack = createStackNavigator(\r\n    {\r\n        Home: HomePage, // &lt;===== Make this HomeScreen instead of HomePage\r\n    },\r\n    config\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst tabNavigator = createBottomTabNavigator({\r\n  HomeStack,\r\n  SettingsStack,\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) =&gt; {\r\n    return {\r\n        count: state.counter.count\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps = {\r\n    ...CounterActions\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default tabNavigator;\r\n```\r\nWhat we want is to have the mapping of state and props on the Home Screen itself (or any other screen)\r\n\r\nNow lets move on to your `HomeScreen.js`:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\nimport { Platform, StyleSheet, Text, View } from &#39;react-native&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { increment, decrement } from &#39;../store/actions/CounterActions&#39;;  // &lt;===== import your actions here, preferably like this\r\n\r\n\r\n/** add the following: */\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) =&gt; ({\r\n    // ... computed data from state and optionally ownProps\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps = {\r\n    // ... normally is an object full of action creators\r\n    increment,    // &lt;===== Map your dispatch here to props\r\n    decrement     // &lt;===== Mapping the second dispatch\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst HomeScreen = (props) =&gt; {\r\n  alert(JSON.stringify(props));\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\r\n      &lt;Text&gt;COUNT FROM STORE: {props.count}&lt;/Text&gt;\r\n    &lt;/View&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\n/** Export your component like this */ \r\n\r\nexport default connect(\r\n    mapStateToProps,\r\n    mapDispatchToProps\r\n)(HomeScreen)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow anywhere on your `HomeScreen.js` you can call `this.props.increment(yourNumber)` or `this.props.decrement(yourNumber)` and you should be good to go\r\n\r\nHope this Helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215371/cant-connect-components-with-mapdispatchtoprops/58218219#58218219","title":"Can&#39;t connect components with

I am not sure how to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qW1tr.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215370/to-convert-list-to-integer-and-store-it-in-csv-file-using-python","title":"to convert list to integer and store it in csv file using python"},{"tags":["sql","pyspark","amazon-athena"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":74,"user_id":2699504,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d4ddfaee4d4ed61a08f4527d79f26ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2699504","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2699504/user2699504"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570451681,"post_id":58223814,"comment_id":102906316,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215368/aws-athena-insert-into-with-named-columns-not-working-in-pyspark/58223814#comment102906316_58223814"},{"owner":{"reputation":951,"user_id":5164936,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3ca79b7bd1df0018878233618a2caf8d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Harsh Bafna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5164936/harsh-bafna"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":74,"user_id":2699504,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d4ddfaee4d4ed61a08f4527d79f26ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2699504","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2699504/user2699504"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570452550,"post_id":58223814,"comment_id":102906748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215368/aws-athena-insert-into-with-named-columns-not-working-in-pyspark/58223814#comment102906748_58223814"},{"owner":{"reputation":74,"user_id":2699504,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d4ddfaee4d4ed61a08f4527d79f26ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2699504","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2699504/user2699504"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570719601,"post_id":58223814,"comment_id":103010182,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215368/aws-athena-insert-into-with-named-columns-not-working-in-pyspark/58223814#comment103010182_58223814"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":951,"user_id":5164936,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3ca79b7bd1df0018878233618a2caf8d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Harsh Bafna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5164936/harsh-bafna"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570122204,"creation_date":1570122204,"answer_id":58223814,"question_id":58215368,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223814","body_markdown":"As per AWS documentation, you don&#39;t need to pass the column names alongwith the destination table.

Since I&#39;m doing it this way (which you don&#39;t want to utilize)\r\n\r\n```\r\nscroll ($element, offsetY = 0) =&gt; browser.executeScript(\r\n\t\t`arguments[0].scrollIntoView();\r\n\t\twindow.scroll(\r\n\t\t\t0,window.scrollY-50-(${offsetY})\r\n\t\t);`,\r\n\t\t$element.getWebElement()\r\n\t)\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=webdriver.WebDriver.prototype.actions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215354/mousemove-to-element-and-scroll-down-100-px-more-from-that-element/58223343#58223343","title":"mouseMove to element and scroll down 100 px more from that element"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":4669326,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01bc3c5413f8faf7ab5d3409d0e3875d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SScast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4669326/sscast"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36,"user_id":4669326,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01bc3c5413f8faf7ab5d3409d0e3875d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SScast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4669326/sscast"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570120173,"creation_date":1570092131,"last_edit_date":1570092460,"question_id":58215354,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58215354","body_markdown":"I have the following test page - https://testnewsnippetcom.000webhostapp.com/test_scroll.html\r\n\r\nI would like to go to number 15 and scroll down 100 px more from the number.

In theory, this is how it should work:\r\n\r\nFrom a web page, you will upload an image and then using the route to the API, the image information will be sent to the database like this:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNow, I&#39;ve been searching for an answer to this on different several pages but none of them actually helped. In fact, the only guides that I&#39;ve found were about integrating that method into a Web Api (see https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/uploading-image-to-server-using-web-api-2-0/) but this doesn&#39;t really work for me as I can&#39;t inherit some of the methods in my solution. For example, using the link above, I had issues with HttpContext.Current, and I would guess that is because of the solution that I am currently using. However, that&#39;s another question to be asked.\r\n\r\nSo my methods look pretty much like this:\r\n\r\n    public class RecipeController : Controller\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly Func&lt;SqlConnection&gt; _connFactory;\r\n        public RecipeController(Func&lt;SqlConnection&gt; connFactory)\r\n        {\r\n            _connFactory = connFactory;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        [Route(&quot;v1/recipe/{recipeBy}&quot;)]\r\n        [HttpGet()]\r\n        public List&lt;Recipe&gt; GetRecipes(string recipeBy)\r\n        {\r\n            using (var con = _connFactory())\r\n            {\r\n                con.Open();\r\n                return con.Query&lt;Recipe&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM dbo.Recipe WHERE RecipeBy = @recipeBy&quot;, new { recipeBy }).ToList();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        ....\r\n\r\nI am using Dapper to pass the values to the database. \r\n\r\nTherefore, my question is: How can I write a POST method that takes an uploaded image as a parameter and then passes it to the database? I do realize that this question is pretty vague, as I didn&#39;t even provide reproducible code. The thing is, until now I didn&#39;t even figure out a correct way to start working on, so I couldn&#39;t really provide any useful code that you can help me with. Any tips, hints, advice, tutorials...

(...) A `char`, a `signed char`, and an `unsigned char` occupy the same amount of storage and have the same alignment requirements (...) For narrow character types, all bits of the object representation participate in the value representation. (...) For unsigned narrow character types, each possible bit pattern of the value representation represents a distinct number.\r\n\r\n# \r\n&gt; There are five standard signed integer types : “`signed char`”, “`short int`”, “`int`”, “`long int`”, and “`long long int`”. In this list, each type provides at least as much storage as those preceding it in the list.\r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t found anything preventing `sizeof(int) == 1` in the surrounding text. This is obviously not the case in most modern platforms where `sizeof(int)` is 4 or 8 but is explicitly used as an example e.g. in [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types):\r\n\r\n&gt; Note: this allows the extreme case in which bytes are sized 64 bits, all types (including char) are 64 bits wide, and sizeof returns 1 for every type.\r\n\r\n# The question\r\n\r\nIf `int` was as large as `char`, the standard does not leave much space for any object representation of the former that would compare inequal to all values (via `to_int_type`) of the latter, leaving just some corner cases (like negative zero existing in `signed char` but mapping to `INT_MIN` in `int`) unlikely to be implemented efficiently in hardware. Moreover, with [P0907](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0907r1.html) it seems even `signed char` will not allow any two different bit strings representing equal values, thus forcing it to 2^(bitsize) distinct values, the `int` as well, and closing every possible loophole.\r\n\r\n**How, in such platform, would one conform to the requirements of `std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;`?** Do we have a real-world example of such platform and the corresponding implementation?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215328/how-is-char-traitschareof-encoded-in-platforms-where-sizeofint-1","title":"How is char_traits&lt;char&gt;::eof() encoded in platforms where sizeof(int) == 1?"},{"tags":["python","matplotlib","plot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":11075199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4gcOiFJYtpM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAELo/qbIJv24TrWc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shashank Shekhar Shukla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11075199/shashank-shekhar-shukla"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570167410,"post_id":58215324,"comment_id":102835073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215324/plot-with-datetime-type-in-python#comment102835073_58215324"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":11075199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4gcOiFJYtpM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAELo/qbIJv24TrWc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shashank Shekhar Shukla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11075199/shashank-shekhar-shukla"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570168362,"creation_date":1570168362,"answer_id":58230643,"question_id":58215324,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58230643","body_markdown":"It seems like a date conversion issue between numpy and the other libraries [link](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9610).

Probably because I have not added the origin and channel detail like in the action cable. But I don&#39;t know how to go add it here.

I am developing an application that generates random images every time the button is pressed. After generating the image, it loops through an array of bitmaps which are initially empty. What it should do is fill the array with every new image that it creates while making sure to not add it if it already exists in the array. I have tried many attempts and this method is the only one that actually makes sense and is very close to what I am trying to achieve but it still produces duplicates. I have even read through each line of code on my own as if I were the computer reading it and I even went as far as writing down the process on paper as I did it to try to understand exactly what is going on and I have found that this should work, yet I am still getting duplicates in my array. I do not understand why this is not working. Can anyone please enlighten me on something that I may be missing?

Now when I select the tester in question, instead of advancing to the next page, which is the start of a tutorial (as the app does when it&#39;s run from Android Studio), it returns to the previous screen. No error message or crash (I checked with Crashlytics). Anyone have any idea why this is happening?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** I added Firebase event logging to my app and saw that no events are being logged from the LoginActivity (on the other hand, when I install the app via Android Studio, events DO get logged). Logcat shows a NameNotFoundException thrown by the PackageManager for for the app&#39;s package. Thinking the package manager doesn&#39;t like app bundles, I generated an APK instead, but got the same problem.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE #2:** The next thing I tried was re-installing the app via Android Studio. When I simply let the app run, it exhibited the same problem, but if I ran it in Debug mode, it was fine. Not a solution, just a clue.\r\n\r\nIf I don&#39;t get this resolved by this weekend, I&#39;ll have to email my testers the APK. I wish someone in the Firebase group were monitoring this problem because emailing APKs as a workaround really sucks!\r\n\r\n**UPDATE #3:** Getting closer to the cause of the problem. The reason that events weren&#39;t getting logged in LoginActivity was because I was using a reserved event name: user event names cannot start with &quot;google&quot;. After fixing that, events did start getting logged, including an ApiException &quot;10:&quot; when trying to log into a Google account. So I googled around and I THINK the bottom line is that when I opted into Google App Signing I may have uploaded the wrong app signing key. If that&#39;s the case, how do I upload the correct one? I hope the answer isn&#39;t &quot;create a new app with a different package name and start over&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/kn7rN.png\r\n  [2]:

The first byte is a type 0x0a, followed by a length 0x08, followed by eight bytes of data (&quot;bcn_test&quot;), followed by a type (0x12), followed by a length (0x04), followed by 4 bytes of data (&quot;1.14&quot;), etc. \r\n\r\n`0x0A` (Type 10), `0x08` (Len 8)  \r\n`0x62` `0x63` `0x6E` `0x5F` `0x74` `0x65` `0x73` `0x74` (`bcn_test`)\r\n\r\n`0x12` (Type 18) `0x04` (Len 4)  \r\n`0x31` `0x2E` `0x31` `0x34` (`1.14`)\r\n\r\n`0x1A` (Type 26) `0x04` (Len 4)  \r\n`0x65` `0x73` `0x63` `0x63` (`escc`)\r\n\r\n`0x22` (Type 34) `0x04` (Len 4)  \r\n`0x76` `0x73` `0x63` `0x63` (`vscc`)\r\n\r\nand so on ...\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1: however, I&#39;m not sure how to correctly decode the `ђ` in the original string.  It is Unicode codepoint [`U+0452 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER DJE`](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0452/index.htm), which in a Java `Char` is bytes `0x04 0x52`.  Truncated to `0x04` or `0x52`, or interpreted in a Cyrillic charset like Windows-1251 where it would be byte `0x90`, it doesn&#39;t match up with the rest of the TLV format.&lt;/sup&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215270/decode-string-in-an-unknown-format/58227270#58227270","title":"Decode String in an unknown format"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":9537105,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc59372926d0276fc2dfd13a35c605be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hana_CH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9537105/hana-ch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1479,"user_id":9509346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eInAz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dpapadopoulos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9509346/dpapadopoulos"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570142593,"creation_date":1570091765,"last_edit_date":1570096663,"question_id":58215270,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58215270","body_markdown":"I have a string returned in this format: \r\n\r\n    \\n\\bbcn_test\\u0012\\u00041.14\\u001a\\u0004escc\\&quot;\\u0004vscc*(\\u0012\\f\\u0012\\n\\b\\u0001\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0000\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0001\\u001a\\u000b\\u0012\\t\\n\\u0007Org1MSP\\u001a\\u000b\\u0012\\t\\n\\u0007Org2MSP2D\\n \\ufffd\\ufffda\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd3RU4\\ufffd\\ufffdR\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd@\\ufffd\\ufffds\\b\\ufffd\\u0014\\ufffd\\ufffd.\\ufffd!\\ufffd\\u0012 s\\ufffd\\ufffdc\\ufffd6\\ufffd\\ufffd@\\ufffd\\u001eF\\ufffdƳ\\ufffdi\\ufffd$\\ufffd\\ufffd4\\ufffdgP\\ufffd:\\ufffdt\\u000e: 6ђ\\ufffd\\ufffd3\\u007fJ\\ufffdHt\\u0004\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd^{\\\\\\ufffd\\u001d\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd3\\ufffdb?@\\ufffdB,\\u0012\\f\\u0012\\n\\b\\u0001\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0000\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0001\\u001a\\r\\u0012\\u000b\\n\\u0007Org1MSP\\u0010\\u0001\\u001a\\r\\u0012\\u000b\\n\\u0007Org2MSP\\u0010\\u0001\r\n    \r\n    \\n\\u0004mycc\\u0012\\u00031.0\\u001a\\u0004escc\\&quot;\\u0004vscc*,\\u0012\\f\\u0012\\n\\b\\u0002\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0000\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0001\\u001a\\r\\u0012\\u000b\\n\\u0007Org1MSP\\u0010\\u0003\\u001a\\r\\u0012\\u000b\\n\\u0007Org2MSP\\u0010\\u00032D\\n \\ufffd\\u0011}\\ufffdT\\ufffdV \\u0010l\\ufffdNT\\ufffd\\ufffdz\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdv+\\ufffd˹5;\\ufffd@q\\ufffd\\ufffd\\u000e\\u0012 \\u0007\\u001f\\u0014)\\u001e\\u0015+\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt\\ufffd\\u0013ak\\ufffd\\u0015J\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdZ\\u0017_c&amp;: y\\ufffd\\ufffdw\\ufffdnN\\ufffd&lt;\\ufffd3^v\\ufffdbIB`M\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd)&amp;\\u0007x\\ufffd;(u\\ufffdLB,\\u0012\\f\\u0012\\n\\b\\u0001\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0000\\u0012\\u0002\\b\\u0001\\u001a\\r\\u0012\\u000b\\n\\u0007Org1MSP\\u0010\\u0001\\u001a\\r\\u0012\\u000b\\n\\u0007Org2MSP\\u0010\\u0001\r\n\r\nI am trying to decode it in order to obtain a valid string but I don&#39;t understand it&#39;s written in wich format and wich is the good decoder for it if someone has an idea on that ..  comment this post. \r\nthank you ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215270/decode-string-in-an-unknown-format","title":"Decode String in an unknown format"},{"tags":["apache-drill"],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":12152086,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/714b2c83ccdcf0a78fdbef68df176309?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alvent","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152086/alvent"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1161,"user_id":9600234,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BE0C0IYoOi4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF4/tOfEEwamN3A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Angel F Syrus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9600234/angel-f-syrus"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570101163,"creation_date":1570091746,"last_edit_date":1570101163,"question_id":58215269,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58215269","body_markdown":"I configure authentication using PAM on Drill.

per comment conversation.  \r\nReason why you were experiencing issue with expander staying open even though it was bound is because when you use `OneWay` Binding and then click on the button it then becomes disconnected. To have a better idea on when it becomes disconnected use `PresentationTraceSources.TraceLevel=High`.  \r\n  \r\nTo overcome this, one can use an attached property to stop Binding from detaching.  \r\nNow this example is for `ToggleButton` but the logic should apply the same.\r\n\r\n    public class TBExtender\r\n    {\r\n        public static readonly DependencyProperty IsCheckedProperty =\r\n           DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached(&quot;IsChecked&quot;, \r\n                                          typeof(bool),\r\n                                          typeof(TBExtender),\r\n                                          new PropertyMetadata(OnChanged));\r\n\r\n        public static bool GetIsChecked(DependencyObject obj)\r\n        {\r\n            return (bool)obj.GetValue(IsCheckedProperty);\r\n        }\r\n        public static void SetIsChecked(DependencyObject obj, bool value)\r\n        {\r\n          obj.SetValue(IsCheckedProperty, value);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static void OnChanged(DependencyObject o,\r\n                                  DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs args)\r\n        {\r\n            ToggleButton tb = o as ToggleButton;\r\n            if (null != tb)\r\n                tb.IsChecked = (bool)args.NewValue;\r\n        }\r\n    }  \r\nCredit goes to [alex-p](https://stackoverflow.com/users/52401/alex-p)  \r\nand [wallstreet-programmer](https://stackoverflow.com/users/55143/wallstreet-programmer)  \r\nfor responses on [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3771431/oneway-binding-for-togglebuttons-ischecked-property-in-wpf/3772335#3772335).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58215262/binding-datagrid-expander-when-using-listcollectionview/58217862#58217862","title":"Binding DataGrid Expander when using ListCollectionView"}],"owner":{"reputation":9219,"user_id":168425,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/90Rr6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ralf de Kleine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/168425/ralf-de-kleine"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9219,"user_id":168425,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/90Rr6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ralf de Kleine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/168425/ralf-de-kleine"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58217862,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570100804,"creation_date":1570091712,"last_edit_date":1570095394,"question_id":58215262,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58215262","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get all the DataGrid Expanders to open and close using a open/close button like the example below.
