`printTitle` in `Blog` _overrides_ the `printTitle` in `WebText`. Since `b2` is actually an instance of `Blog` at runtime, calling `printTitle` will call the one in `Blog`, even though at compile time, `b2` is of type `WebText`. This is a kind of _polymorphism_.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is actually desirable, because it allows you to have a variable, of type `WebText`, that is able to store many different types of web texts, including blogs, news articles, and stack overflow answers. Each of those types may choose to print their titles differently. [This post might help you understand why we do this better](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/383947/what-does-it-mean-to-program-to-an-interface).\r\n\r\n&gt; Why is this said to be safe then?\r\n\r\nThis is safe, as in that it doesn&#39;t throw an exception. It is unsafe, s as in `b2.printTitle` might not call the method in `WebText`, but you shouldn&#39;t assume that in the first place anyway, unless the method is `final`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179684/why-does-the-sublcass-respond-when-upcasted/58179863#58179863","title":"Why does the sublcass respond when upcasted?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":595,"user_id":5470573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-thC11VQAKcw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHZQ/XgUXx7rYWuY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abishek Aditya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5470573/abishek-aditya"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569914524,"creation_date":1569914524,"answer_id":58179869,"question_id":58179684,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58179869","body_markdown":"At compile time,          `WebText b2 = new Blog();` checks whether the method calls to b2 can be fulfilled.

You should only be able to select polygons or centroids, but not both at a time.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179681/show-only-1-overlay-group-in-leaflet-r","title":"Show only 1 overlay group in leaflet R"},{"tags":["c#","amazon-web-services",".net-core","aws-lambda","serverless"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":532,"user_id":6338382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Hi0F.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krist&#243;f T&#243;th","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6338382/krist%c3%b3f-t%c3%b3th"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569913927,"post_id":58179679,"comment_id":102739529,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179679/aws-net-core-serverless-web-api-calling-another-web-api#comment102739529_58179679"},{"owner":{"reputation":228,"user_id":1964961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b3a5295cbe475aeccd3e19831f85448?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dmitry Merkis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1964961/dmitry-merkis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":532,"user_id":6338382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Hi0F.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krist&#243;f T&#243;th","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6338382/krist%c3%b3f-t%c3%b3th"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569914794,"post_id":58179679,"comment_id":102739976,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179679/aws-net-core-serverless-web-api-calling-another-web-api#comment102739976_58179679"},{"owner":{"reputation":532,"user_id":6338382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Hi0F.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krist&#243;f T&#243;th","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6338382/krist%c3%b3f-t%c3%b3th"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569915782,"post_id":58179679,"comment_id":102740424,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179679/aws-net-core-serverless-web-api-calling-another-web-api#comment102740424_58179679"},{"owner":{"reputation":228,"user_id":1964961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b3a5295cbe475aeccd3e19831f85448?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dmitry Merkis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1964961/dmitry-merkis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":532,"user_id":6338382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Hi0F.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krist&#243;f T&#243;th","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6338382/krist%c3%b3f-t%c3%b3th"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569916269,"post_id":58179679,"comment_id":102740667,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179679/aws-net-core-serverless-web-api-calling-another-web-api#comment102740667_58179679"},{"owner":{"reputation":6483,"user_id":982541,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bde18432e710ba03ce3831ae274890c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rajesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/982541/rajesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569942094,"post_id":58179679,"comment_id":102754925,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179679/aws-net-core-serverless-web-api-calling-another-web-api#comment102754925_58179679"},{"owner":{"reputation":228,"user_id":1964961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b3a5295cbe475aeccd3e19831f85448?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dmitry Merkis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1964961/dmitry-merkis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570021750,"post_id":58179679,"comment_id":102782285,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179679/aws-net-core-serverless-web-api-calling-another-web-api#comment102782285_58179679"}],"owner":{"reputation":228,"user_id":1964961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b3a5295cbe475aeccd3e19831f85448?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dmitry Merkis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1964961/dmitry-merkis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":228,"user_id":1964961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b3a5295cbe475aeccd3e19831f85448?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dmitry Merkis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1964961/dmitry-merkis"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569918361,"creation_date":1569913746,"last_edit_date":1569918361,"question_id":58179679,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58179679","body_markdown":"I have a Serverless Web API in AWS and I need to make a GET request to another third-party Web API which returns stream.

like you want a row by row mask:\r\n\r\n    In [157]: [a[m] for a,m in zip(arr,mask)]                                       \r\n    Out[157]: [array([], dtype=int64), array([54, 45]), array([74, 85]), array([98])]\r\n\r\nWhen the desired output is arrays or lists of differing lengths, it&#39;s a good indication that some sort of iteration is required.  The &#39;whole-array&#39; operations return an array - 1d, 2d, etc, not a list of arrays.\r\n\r\nSometimes it&#39;s handy to create a masked array:\r\n\r\n    In [161]: np.ma.MaskedArray(data=arr, mask=~mask)                               \r\n    Out[161]: \r\n    masked_array(\r\n      data=[[--, --, --],\r\n            [54, --, 45],\r\n            [--, 74, 85],\r\n            [--, --, 98]],\r\n      mask=[[ True,  True,  True],\r\n            [False,  True, False],\r\n            [ True, False, False],\r\n            [ True,  True, False]],\r\n      fill_value=999999)\r\n\r\n`nonzero` (alias `where`) can produce an indexing tuple that the selects the same elements:\r\n\r\n    In [164]: np.nonzero(mask)                                                      \r\n    Out[164]: (array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3]), array([0, 2, 1, 2, 2]))\r\n    In [165]: arr[_]                                                                \r\n    Out[165]: array([54, 45, 74, 85, 98])\r\n\r\nbut it doesn&#39;t obviously help with creating the row list.  Well, you could do some sort of grouping on the first index array.\r\n\r\nThat tuple gives an idea of how the boolean masking is done.  It selects 5 elements, defined by the pairs (1,0),(1,2),(2,1) etc.\r\n\r\nYou could use `where` or the mask to set the False values to 0:\r\n\r\n    In [166]: np.where(mask, arr, 0)                                                \r\n    Out[166]: \r\n    array([[ 0,  0,  0],\r\n           [54,  0, 45],\r\n           [ 0, 74, 85],\r\n           [ 0,  0, 98]])\r\n    In [167]: arr*mask.astype(int)                                                  \r\n    Out[167]: \r\n    array([[ 0,  0,  0],\r\n           [54,  0, 45],\r\n           [ 0, 74, 85],\r\n           [ 0,  0, 98]])\r\n\r\nBut that&#39;s different from your list of lists.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179671/how-to-keep-the-structure-of-an-array-as-it-is-while-boolean-mask-in-numpy-pytho/58179823#58179823","title":"How to keep The structure of an array as it is while Boolean mask in numpy python"}],"owner":{"reputation":161,"user_id":9581027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DS_mVT7Vt5w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABto/mZzkpBPUVKA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ravishankar chavare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9581027/ravishankar-chavare"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569916115,"creation_date":1569913693,"question_id":58179671,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58179671","body_markdown":"I already Search too many post regarding Boolean masking but never found a clear description So Posting a new Questions.\r\n\r\nI have Tried\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    \r\n    #create numpy array\r\n    np_arr=np.array([[1,23,22],[54,28,45],[36,74,85],[25,26,98]])\r\n    print(&quot;Normal Numpy Array:\\n&quot;,np_arr)\r\n    \r\n    #Create boolean mask (no grator than 36)\r\n    mask=np_arr&gt;36\r\n    \r\n    #print mask value\r\n    print(&quot;\\nBoolean Mask:\\n&quot;,mask)\r\n    \r\n    #apply mask on numpy array\r\n    apply_mask=np_arr[mask]\r\n    print(&quot;\\nNumpy array  Apply Mask:\\n&quot;,apply_mask)\r\n\r\nThis Give Output\r\n\r\n    Normal Numpy Array:\r\n     [[ 1 23 22]\r\n     [54 28 45]\r\n     [36 74 85]\r\n     [25 26 98]]\r\n    (4, 3)\r\n    \r\n    Boolean Mask:\r\n     [[False False False]\r\n     [ True False  True]\r\n     [False  True  True]\r\n     [False False  True]]\r\n    \r\n    Numpy array  Apply Mask:\r\n     [54 45 74 85 98]\r\n\r\nBut I Expect\r\n\r\n    Normal Numpy Array:\r\n     [[ 1 23 22]\r\n     [54 28 45]\r\n     [36 74 85]\r\n     [25 26 98]]\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Boolean Mask:\r\n     [\r\n     [ True  True]\r\n     [True  True]\r\n     [True]\r\n     ]\r\n    \r\n    Numpy array  Apply Mask:\r\n    [\r\n     [54 45]\r\n     [74 85]\r\n     [98]\r\n     ]\r\n\r\nI want to Keep the Result structure same as above\r\n\r\ni have tried **np.where** but i need to solve it using with the help of **Boolean mask**\r\n\r\n    np.where(np_arr,np_arr,0)\r\n    #This will add 0 to numpy array \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179671/how-to-keep-the-structure-of-an-array-as-it-is-while-boolean-mask-in-numpy-pytho","title":"How to keep The structure of an array as it is while Boolean mask in numpy python"},{"tags":["php","codeigniter","xampp","rfid"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":35290,"user_id":661872,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqbSi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lawrence Cherone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/661872/lawrence-cherone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569914029,"post_id":58179670,"comment_id":102739583,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179670/connecting-rfid-reader-to-php-mysqlxampp-in-codeigniter-framework#comment102739583_58179670"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12140747,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDzspSlra3yDGiTEmPIBCuYIXDe1lQXs1DPiZw=k-s128","display_name":"Gerald Hannsen Buenafe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12140747/gerald-hannsen-buenafe"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1569913691,"creation_date":1569913691,"question_id":58179670,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58179670","body_markdown":"I am currently working on a project and I need to connect my RFID reader to my PHP MySQL (xampp) using codeigniter framework and I am having a hard time researching about it.

x * tolerance);\r\n\r\n    let reducer = ggT(h1,k1)\r\n\r\n    this.inchesFraction1 = (h1/reducer);\r\n    this.inchesFraction2 = (k1/reducer);\r\n  }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179668/convert-from-length-in-mm-to-feet-and-inces-and-back-to-mm/58182226#58182226","title":"Convert from length in mm to feet and inces and back to mm"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11785120,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a256f79544d1bafb66c4d960d87f58d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11785120/andreas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11785120,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a256f79544d1bafb66c4d960d87f58d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11785120/andreas"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569943895,"creation_date":1569913689,"last_edit_date":1569921686,"question_id":58179668,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58179668","body_markdown":"I have a small Problem with convert a lenght into feet and inches.\r\n\r\nMy code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n // input data\r\n this.data = 2500;\r\n\r\n //get feet\r\n this.feet = Math.floor(this.data / 304.8);\r\n    \r\n //get inches\r\n let feetrestinmm = this.data - this.feet * 304.8;\r\n this.inches = Math.floor(feetrestinmm / 25.4);\r\n\r\n //get fraction inches\r\n let inchesrestinmm = feetrestinmm - this.inches * 25.4;\r\n this.toFraction(inchesrestinmm / 25.4);\r\n\r\n //back to mm\r\n this.mmValueOut = this.fractionToNumber(this.inchesFraction1 + &#39;/&#39;

short answer is **you can&#39;t** - at least not the way your going about it even if you have the Office suite installed on your own machine.\r\n\r\nPDF documents are handled by most browsers with their own implementation of Adobe&#39;s PDF reader - what I suspect your browser is doing, but Microsoft Office documents use a multitude of mimetypes, ranging from `application/ms-word` for the older Word files, to `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` for the newer generations of Office, so built-in browser support for even displaying them is either going to be technically unviable, or restricted by license.\r\n\r\nCheckout this document viewer to build the reader/viewer into your project directly:\r\n\r\n[ASP.NET Document Viewer][1] from [GroupDocs][2]\r\n\r\nNote: This is ***not free*** by any means, it&#39;s actually quite expensive and I wish anyone luck trying to find one that will be cheap.\r\n\r\nAlso, don&#39;t be content with simply providing your user with the file itself unless you&#39;re happy they should have the means to open it.\r\nIn my line of work, the end users we deal with don&#39;t have Microsoft Office installed on their machines by design (licensing really), so providing information through PDF documents is the only way to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Best was, to provide a MCVE (a *stand-alone* sample to reproduce your issue).\r\n\r\nYou can try something along this:\r\n\r\nThis is such a *stand-alone* sample\r\n\r\n\tDECLARE @mockupTable TABLE(ID INT IDENTITY, YourXml XML);\r\n\tINSERT INTO @mockupTable VALUES\r\n\t(N&#39;&lt;PayDetails&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;blah&quot; DataType=&quot;string&quot; Value=&quot;Some blah&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;GROSS&quot; DataType=&quot;float&quot; Value=&quot;1.1&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;Another&quot; DataType=&quot;string&quot; Value=&quot;One more&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;GROSS&quot; DataType=&quot;float&quot; Value=&quot;1.2&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t   &lt;/PayDetails&gt;&#39;)\r\n\t,(N&#39;&lt;PayDetails&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;blah&quot; DataType=&quot;string&quot; Value=&quot;Some blah&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;GROSS&quot; DataType=&quot;float&quot; Value=&quot;2.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;Another&quot; DataType=&quot;string&quot; Value=&quot;One more&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t &lt;Column Name=&quot;GROSS&quot; DataType=&quot;float&quot; Value=&quot;2.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t   &lt;/PayDetails&gt;&#39;);\r\n\r\n--This query will first check, if there are **different values** for `GROSS` within one XML. This might be a reason to look a bit closer before deleting them.\r\n\r\n\tSELECT t.ID\r\n\t\t  ,t.YourXml\r\n\tFROM @mockupTable t\r\n\tWHERE t.YourXml.value(&#39;count(distinct-values(/PayDetails/Column[@Name=&quot;GROSS&quot;]/@Value))&#39;,&#39;int&#39;)&gt;1;\r\n\r\n--And this statement will return each `&lt;Column&gt;` just once per name (always the first of its kind)\r\n\r\n\tUPDATE @mockupTable SET YourXml=YourXml.query(N&#39;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   &lt;PayDetails&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t for $elmt in distinct-values(/PayDetails/Column/@Name)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t return /PayDetails/Column[@Name=$elmt][1]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   &lt;/PayDetails&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   &#39;);\r\n\r\n--Check the output\r\n\r\n\tSELECT * FROM @mockupTable\r\n\r\nThe idea in short:\r\n\r\nWith the Xpath `/PayDetails/Column[@Name=&quot;GROSS&quot;]` we are reducing the observed set to columns, where the attribute `Name` equals `GROSS`. `distinct-values()` is a XQuery-function returning each value in a list just once. So we can use `count()` to check, if there are differing values for `GROSS` within one XML.\r\n\r\nThe `UPDATE` uses XQuery&#39;s FLWOR abilities. We use again `distinct-values` to get all values for `Name` within `&lt;Column&gt;`. Then we return just the first (see the `[1]`) for each name.\r\n\r\n##UPDATE: Check for doubled elements\r\n\r\nWith this query you can run through your whole table to search for any non-unique column name per XML:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSELECT t.YourXml.query(N&#39;\r\n\t                        for $elmt in distinct-values(/PayDetails/Column/@Name)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn &lt;NameCount Name=&quot;{$elmt}&quot; Count=&quot;{count(/PayDetails/Column[@Name=$elmt])}&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&#39;).query(&#39;/NameCount[@Count&gt;1]&#39;)\r\n\tFROM @mockupTable
