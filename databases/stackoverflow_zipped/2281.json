I created the frontend in Vue and the backend in Flask, and I&#39;m trying to get it working on the university&#39;s servers which are running Apache. Right now, my `app.py` just serves up the built `index.html` file I got from running `npm run build` on my Vue project as well as the other files it requests:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import Flask, send_file\r\nfrom src.config import Config\r\nimport os\r\n\r\n# Set up app\r\napp = Flask(__name__, static_folder=&#39;../dist/static&#39;)\r\napp.config.from_object(Config)\r\nDIST_DIR = app.config[&#39;DIST_DIR&#39;]\r\n\r\n@app.route(&#39;/&#39;)\r\ndef index():\r\n  entry = os.path.join(DIST_DIR, &#39;index.html&#39;)\r\n  return send_file(entry)\r\n\r\n@app.route(&#39;/api/endpoint&#39;)\r\ndef some_endpoint():\r\n    return &#39;some JSON response&#39;\r\n\r\n# Catchall, for serving up CSS and JS requested by index.html\r\n@app.route(&#39;/&lt;path:path&gt;&#39;)\r\ndef get_file(path):\r\n  path = os.path.join(DIST_DIR, path)\r\n  if os.path.exists(path):\r\n    return send_file(path)\r\n  else:\r\n    # Fallback route for Vue router\r\n    return send_file(os.path.join(DIST_DIR, &#39;index.html&#39;))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I&#39;m using Vue router, I changed my .htaccess file to have the following as directed by the docs (https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations):\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\r\n  RewriteEngine On\r\n  RewriteBase /\r\n  RewriteRule ^index\\.html$ - [L]\r\n  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\r\n  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\r\n  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]\r\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy router is working fine, but the frontend tries to query /api/endpoint when it starts up and fails. It still just serves up `index.html`, but when I try this locally, it serves up &#39;some JSON response&#39;, as expected. Is there something I need to change in my .htaccess file? I&#39;m not familiar with Apache at all and I&#39;m not quite sure what that file is doing. It just seems to be ignorning the Python code and defaulting to the &#39;/&#39; route. How do I fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997383/rest-api-endpoints-not-working-in-vue-flask-app-hosted-on-apache","title":"REST API endpoints not working in Vue + Flask app hosted on Apache"},{"tags":["r","list","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1680,"user_id":403582,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQQNe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"deepseefan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/403582/deepseefan"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1568825866,"post_id":57997382,"comment_id":102401466,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997382/creating-data-frame-from-time-series-object#comment102401466_57997382"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12086303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Yt8XtA6ujUI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfeosvkZpztt5zrhyY3YDgRLyVbCQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raymond Sibaja","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086303/raymond-sibaja"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568825027,"creation_date":1568825027,"question_id":57997382,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57997382","body_markdown":"How would you take a a time series object and turn it into separate columns in a data frame?

It&#39;s a great database, but it&#39;s not magic.\r\n\r\nNow, what you _can_ do is give Oracle something _else_ to read instead to get the answer... something smaller than the whole table.\r\n\r\n### Option 1 - Covering Index\r\nThe easy way to do this is to make a so-called &quot;covering&quot; index on the table.  A &quot;covering&quot; index is one that contains all of the columns that you use in your query, so that Oracle can use the index instead of the table.  E.g.,\r\n\r\n    CREATE INDEX wine_sum_n1 ON wine (wname, price);\r\n\r\nHowever, in your case, your table rows are not very wide.  So, a covering index won&#39;t be that much smaller than the actual table.  It _would_ help though and it is a very easy approach.\r\n\r\n### Option 2 - Materialized View with `ON QUERY COMPUTATION`\r\nAnother way to give Oracle a smaller thing to read is to pre-compute all the sums in a materialized view.  This is always problematic, because any DML changes to your table will cause the materialized view to become stale and you&#39;ll lose the performance benefits unless and until something refreshes it.\r\n\r\n(Oracle has an `ON COMMIT REFRESH` option that avoids this problem, but that has several dangers and limitations.  I avoid it for having been burned in the past, but it&#39;s still worth reading up on).\r\n\r\nOracle 12.2 introduced a really cool option for materialized views called `ON QUERY COMPUTATION`.  This feature allows Oracle to still use materialized views, even if they are stale, by joining in data from the materialized view log.  It could be a good option for you, so I&#39;ll give a full example, below.\r\n\r\n    -- Setup\r\n    DROP TABLE wine;\r\n    DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW wine_name_sum_mv;\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE wine (\r\n        vintage    NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,\r\n        wine_no    SMALLINT NOT NULL,\r\n        vid        CHAR(08) NOT NULL,\r\n        cid        CHAR(06) NOT NULL,\r\n        pctalc     NUMBER(4, 2),\r\n        price      NUMBER(6, 2),\r\n        grade      CHAR(01) NOT NULL,\r\n        wname      CHAR(40) NOT NULL,\r\n        comments   CHAR(200) NOT NULL\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    INSERT INTO wine \r\n      SELECT mod(rownum,10000) vintage,\r\n             rownum wine_No,\r\n             &#39;xxxxxxxx&#39;

The more data there is in the materialized view logs, the less `ON QUERY COMPUTATION` will help you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997353/how-to-use-object-to-optimise-the-query/58014528#58014528","title":"How to use object to optimise the query"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":10359588,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ToeXZcMtbpY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAE58/-64bRCmtuf0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Polly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10359588/polly"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20,"user_id":10359588,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ToeXZcMtbpY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAE58/-64bRCmtuf0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Polly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10359588/polly"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":101,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58014528,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569146669,"creation_date":1568824911,"last_edit_date":1569146669,"question_id":57997353,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57997353","body_markdown":"I need to optimise this query by creating a object.

However, it is verbose, and I will be happy if there is a shorter version of it (that is not a pressing issue at the moment though I&#39;ll be grateful as well as happy to learn writing clear and concise lines). \r\n\r\nThe pressing problem I have is how to modify the condition `as.integer(names(df1[4, &quot;new&quot;][[1]][df1[4, &quot;new&quot;][[1]][]&gt;=2]))` and apply it to the whole column. For example, for a condition column new `== 3`, `5` and `7` are the expected outputs.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen similar posts [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24835233/subset-based-on-frequency-level) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20204257/subset-data-frame-based-on-number-of-rows-per-group) but didn&#39;t help figure out how to apply the subset condition to a column which is a table. \r\n\r\nThank you.

At some point the app initialization has started randomly face &quot;Java heap space&quot; error at the point of JPA EntityManager initialization. I have increased the memory to 1 Gb, switching the dyno to Standard-1. The metrics were enabled and I have realized, that for the most time I had 512 Mb and even slightly more occupied. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSo, it looks like 1 Gb will be enough, as before it has successfully worked at 512 Mb. And surprisingly, I still get the random success on deployments: for some times I face the Java heap space error and sometimes not. After the success, the memory occupation is of course more than 512 Mb, but significantly less than 1 Gb.\r\n\r\nHeroku specifies the -Xmx by itself, I can&#39;t configure it. \r\n\r\n    java $JAVA_OPTS -Xmx256m -jar target/*.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod,heroku,no-liquibase --server.port=$PORT\r\n\r\nis a command line to start the app. I can set $JAVA_OPTS to -Xmx900m, but it will not be picked up.\r\nAlso, it form JAVA_TOOLS_OPTIONS by itsef, setting something about -Xmx671m there for 1Gb Standard-1 heroku dyno. I also can&#39;t override this value with my own larger -Xmx\r\n\r\nMy question is multiple:\r\n\r\n1) How I can be sure, that at the Spring-Boot start up JVM already uses -Xmx671m, but not -Xmx256m. Once I have tried to upgrade even to 2 Gb dyno, but even under it I have faced the Java heap space error, like -Xmx256m of the initial command line call that is still the same even for the 2Gb dyno makes sense while -Xmx2Gb set for in in JAVA_TOOLS_OPTIONS is not actually influencing that part of the start up, when the application fails.\r\n\r\n2) If the -Xmx from JAVA_TOOLS_OPTIONS actually makes sense, how can Spring Boot application try to occupy more heap at the start up than it use during the work later and how can it occupy the random volume each time? Can be this behavior tuned (say, identify beans that are not used and excluding them; adding some JVM options and so on)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/63A58.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997342/not-enough-memory-for-the-spring-boot-starting-at-1gb-heroku-dyno","title":"Not enough memory for the Spring Boot starting at 1Gb heroku dyno"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","fetch","this","state"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13353,"user_id":3225108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaeMm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"azium","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3225108/azium"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568825136,"post_id":57997339,"comment_id":102401176,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997339/accessing-to-a-state-after-a-fetch-to-displayed-it#comment102401176_57997339"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9966526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2wEW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9966526/stave"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13353,"user_id":3225108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaeMm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"azium","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3225108/azium"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568825449,"post_id":57997339,"comment_id":102401311,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997339/accessing-to-a-state-after-a-fetch-to-displayed-it#comment102401311_57997339"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9966526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2wEW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9966526/stave"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568827236,"post_id":57997513,"comment_id":102401968,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997339/accessing-to-a-state-after-a-fetch-to-displayed-it/57997513#comment102401968_57997513"},{"owner":{"reputation":4428,"user_id":4468021,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVYBZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clarity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4468021/clarity"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9966526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2wEW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9966526/stave"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568827308,"post_id":57997513,"comment_id":102401997,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997339/accessing-to-a-state-after-a-fetch-to-displayed-it/57997513#comment102401997_57997513"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9966526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2wEW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9966526/stave"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568827613,"post_id":57997513,"comment_id":102402112,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997339/accessing-to-a-state-after-a-fetch-to-displayed-it/57997513#comment102402112_57997513"},{"owner":{"reputation":4428,"user_id":4468021,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVYBZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clarity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4468021/clarity"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9966526,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2wEW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9966526/stave"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568827880,"post_id":57997513,"comment_id":102402215,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997339/accessing-to-a-state-after-a-fetch-to-displayed-it/57997513#comment102402215_57997513"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4428,"user_id":4468021,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVYBZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clarity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4468021/clarity"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4428,"user_id":4468021,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVYBZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clarity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4468021/clarity"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568827852,"last_edit_date":1568827852,"creation_date":1568825583,"answer_id":57997513,"question_id":57997339,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57997513","body_markdown":"A few issues with your code:\r\n\r\n1. You set `price` as an empty array on initial state, but then try to access it as object. Change your initial state to `this.state = { price: {} };`\r\n\r\n2. `setState` is async, so logging it to console straight after setting will show the old value, you need to use the callback to `setState`:\r\n```\r\nthis.setState({ price: price } , () =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(&quot;state:&quot;, this.state);\r\n})\r\n        \r\n```\r\n\r\n3. You&#39;re trying to render `this.state.price`, but it&#39;s supposed to be an object, so that&#39;s why you get an error.\r\n\r\n4. Do not use `setInterval` in `componentDidMount` as it will repeatedly call your api fetch method with the same url.\r\n\r\n4. You&#39;re trying to render `this.state.price.BTC.USD`, however before the data has been fetched and set to the state, the price value on state doesn&#39;t have any props, and you&#39;ll get `cannot access property &#39;BTC&#39; of undefined` error. In this case a better idea is to delay the render until the data is fetched. You can do it by showing a loader meanwhile. Additionally, it&#39;s a good idea to have some error handling, where you&#39;d display an error message if the data fetching wasn&#39;t successful: \r\n```\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      price: {},\r\n      error: false, // Track error state\r\n      loading: true // set loading to true in the beginning\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  fetchResult = () =&gt; {\r\n    this.setState({ error: false });\r\n    fetch(\r\n      &quot;https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemulti?fsyms=BTC,ETH&amp;tsyms=USD,EUR&quot;,\r\n      {}\r\n    )\r\n      .then(response =&gt; {\r\n        return response.json();\r\n      })\r\n      .then(price =&gt; {\r\n        this.setState(\r\n          {\r\n            price: price,\r\n            loading: false // Disable loading after data is fetched\r\n          },\r\n          () =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(&quot;state:&quot;, this.state);\r\n          }\r\n        );\r\n      })\r\n      .catch(error =&gt; {\r\n        console.error(error);\r\n        this.setState({ error: true, loading: false });  // Also disable loading in case of error\r\n      });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount = () =&gt; {\r\n    this.fetchResult();\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    if (this.state.error) {\r\n      return &lt;p&gt;Error message here&lt;/p&gt;;\r\n    }\r\n    return this.state.loading ?

is the file that we are going to analyze*\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that we have a csv file, we can be quite sure that the datatype will be consistent among the rows for a given columns.\r\n\r\nDue to this assumption, we can regexp the delimiter in scope (`CL|RF`) with a regexp (`\\|\\d+CR\\|LF`).\r\n\r\nIf the regexp is not matched, we can remove the carriage return, cause is not the end of the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom io import StringIO\r\nimport re\r\n\r\n# Verify that the pattern `|ARBITRARY NUMBER + CR|LF`\r\npattern = re.compile(&quot;\\|\\d+CR\\|LF&quot;)\r\n# Open the file and read the content\r\nwith open(&quot;a.txt&quot;) as f:\r\n    data = f.readlines()\r\nnot_parsed = data.copy()\r\n_max = len(data)\r\ni = 0\r\nparsed_data = []\r\n# Iterate the data\r\nwhile i &lt; _max:\r\n    # Remove unnecessary new line\r\n    line = data[i].strip()\r\n    # If the pattern does not match, we need to strip the carriage return\r\n    if not pattern.search(line) and i + 1 &lt; _max:\r\n        line = line.replace(&quot;CR|LF&quot;, &quot;&quot;).strip()\r\n        line = line + data[i + 1].strip()\r\n        i += 1\r\n    line = line\r\n    if line != &quot;&quot;:\r\n        parsed_data.append(line)\r\n    i += 1\r\n# Comment\r\ndata = [line.replace(&quot;CR|LF&quot;, &quot;&quot;) for line in parsed_data]\r\n# Load the csv using pandas\r\n\r\nprint(&quot;DATA BEFORE -&gt; {}&quot;.format(&quot;&quot;.join(not_parsed)))\r\nprint(&quot;DATA NOW -&gt; {}&quot;.format(&quot;\\n&quot;.join(data)))\r\nDATA = StringIO(&quot;\\n&quot;.join(data))\r\ndf = pd.read_csv(DATA, delimiter=&quot;|&quot;)\r\n```\r\n&gt; How does this remove the unwanted CL|RF, but leave the wanted ones?\r\n\r\nThe file will not be modified, instead it will be saved as a list of single (&#39;line by line&#39;).\r\nThen we are going to replace the carriage return only when the regexp not match and load as a dataframe\r\n\r\nNOTE:  \r\nTested on `Linux` that use `\\n` as `new line`\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

The codes for it I am giving it below.Via this I call the formUI function and in it I build for now just one text field and one dropdown.\r\n\r\n    new Container(\r\n                          alignment: Alignment.topCenter,\r\n                          padding: new EdgeInsets.only(\r\n                              top: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * .83,\r\n                              right: 50.0,\r\n                              left: 50.0),\r\n                          child: new FlatButton(\r\n                            color: Colors.transparent,\r\n                            child: Text(&quot;REGISTER&quot;,style: new TextStyle(\r\n                            fontFamily: &quot;BPreplay&quot;,\r\n                            fontSize: 13.0,\r\n                            color: Colors.grey,\r\n                            fontWeight: FontWeight.w700\r\n                            ),\r\n                            ),\r\n                            onPressed: () {\r\n                              Navigator.push(\r\n                                context,\r\n                                MaterialPageRoute(\r\n                                  builder: (context) =&gt; RegisterPage(\r\n                                    \r\n                                  ),\r\n                                ),\r\n                              );\r\n                            },\r\n                          ),\r\n                        ),       \r\n\r\nSo if the user presses the the Register button it takes him to the next page.

Yes it call the bloc to update the selected value but why there is pop of the page happening.\r\n\r\nI/flutter (31012): [pop old ] unnamed\r\nI/flutter (31012): [to new route] unnamed\r\nI/flutter (31012): Build title dropdown Instance of &#39;SetTitleSelectedState&#39;\r\n\r\n2. When I type anything into the textfield I notice below events are happening. I notice it calls the bloc to update the current dropdown and worse case its also calling the previous Login page bloc to update again which is quite wasteful.\r\nI/flutter (31012): Build login button login page Instance of &#39;LoginData&#39;\r\nI/flutter (31012): Build title dropdown Instance of &#39;SetTitleSelectedState&#39;\r\n\r\nHow to avoid all these event and issue?\r\n\r\nI have done research and tried all the different ways with TextEditingController _searchController1; yet with the opening of the keyboard the all the bloc are reloaded and updated again.

I would like to generate a heatmap of sum with id on the y axis and days on the x axis.  The problem is the data is sparse, so the heatmap consists of discrete bars.  I would like the bars to extend to the right so the bars are solid and change colors when the sum changes values, and keeps that color until the next day value to the right.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example to generate the type of plot that I&#39;m making.  \r\n\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    \r\n    set.seed(13)\r\n    x_id &lt;- sample( LETTERS[1:5], 100, replace=TRUE, \r\n                    prob=c(0.15, 0.2, 0.35, 0.1, 0.2) )\r\n    x_sum &lt;- sample( c(5, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360), 100, replace=TRUE, \r\n                       prob=c(.1, .1, .2, .2, .2, .1, .1) )\r\n    x_days &lt;- sample.int(2000, 100, replace = TRUE)-1000\r\n    \r\n    df &lt;- data.frame(id = x_id, Days = x_days, sum = x_sum)\r\n    \r\n    ggp &lt;- ggplot(data = df, \r\n           mapping = aes(x = Days, \r\n                         y = id, \r\n                         fill = sum)) +\r\n      geom_tile() +\r\n      xlab(label = &quot;Days&quot;) + ylab(label = &#39;id&#39;) +\r\n      scale_fill_gradient(low = &quot;blue&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;) \r\n    print(ggp)\r\n\r\n[![Example of sparse heatmap][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like the colors to extend to the right.  I believe this means that data frame should be sorted by id and days, and additional rows would have to be added for each id in order to fill in the missing days with value of sum and id equal to the last value of sum / id.  But how do I do add the rows for each id and fill in the missing values?  The right most color should be extended by a fixed length so the color is more visible, say extend by 30 days.\r\n\r\nAlso, the color map show indicate a critical value.  Say the critical value is 180.  Then for sums from zero to the critical value (180), then the colors should go from green (0) to yellow (179), and for values above critical value (180), colors should go from light red (180) to dark red (max value or 360)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nHere is a solution for filling in the sparse matrix\r\n\r\n    library(tidyr)\r\n\r\n    setkey(DT, id, Days)\r\n    DT_fill_NA &lt;- DT[setkey(DT[, .(min(Days):(max(Days)+30)), by = id], id, V1)]\r\n    \r\n    DT_fill &lt;- fill(DT_fill_NA, c(&#39;sum&#39;), .direction = &quot;down&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    ggp &lt;- ggplot(data = DT_fill, \r\n                  mapping = aes(x = Days, \r\n                                y = id, \r\n                                fill = sum)) +\r\n      geom_tile() +\r\n      xlab(label = &quot;Days&quot;) + ylab(label = &#39;id&#39;) +\r\n      scale_fill_gradient(low = &quot;blue&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;) \r\n    print(ggp)\r\n\r\nThis creates the figure with the sparse bars extended to right to the next bar\r\n\r\n[![Sparse Heatmap Filled to the Right][2]][2]\r\n\r\nNow the color map should be modified to indicate a critical value.  Let the critical value be 180.  Then for sums from zero to the critical value (180), then the colors should go from green (0) to yellow (179), and for sums above critical value (180), colors should go from light red (180) to dark red (max value or 360)\r\n\r\n2nd Update\r\n\r\nOne way to generate green with a break at 180 is as follows\r\n\r\n    ggp &lt;- ggplot(data = DT_fill, \r\n                  mapping = aes(x = Days, \r\n                                y = id, \r\n                                fill = sum)) +\r\n      geom_tile() +\r\n      xlab(label = &quot;Days&quot;) + ylab(label = &#39;id&#39;) +\r\n      scale_fill_gradient2(low = &quot;green&quot;, mid = &quot;indianred2&quot;, high = &quot;red2&quot;, \r\n                             midpoint = 180, breaks = c(50, 100, 200, 300)) +\r\n      theme_bw()\r\n    \r\n    print(ggp)\r\n\r\n[![Sparse data extended right highlighting break point][3]][3]\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure this clearly identifies the break point at a specific value.

There may well be a simpler way to do this, but here is my solution:\r\n\r\n    meal.pipe(\r\n      groupBy(val =&gt; val.connectedTo),\r\n      mergeMap(group$ =&gt; group$.pipe(\r\n        reduce((acc, cur) =&gt; [...acc, cur], [`${group$.key}`])\r\n      )),\r\n      reduce((acc, cur) =&gt; acc.filter(item =&gt; item.name !== cur[0])),\r\n      map(arr =&gt; arr.slice(1))\r\n    ).subscribe(\r\n      result =&gt; console.log(result)\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThis chain starts by using `groupBy` to create a set of higher order observables grouped by `connectedTo`.  It then uses MergeMap and reduce to take all those higher order Observables and create an array of an array of objects, the first of which is a list of all items without any `connectedTo`, and then each subsequent array item is an array of items with each `connectedTo` item object from the original `meal`.  \r\n\r\nThat is then fed into reduce, which filters the first array item&#39;s sub-objects (acc) to eliminate all the items which show up in any of the subsequent emissions.  That will produce the array of remaining items after the filter.

It&#39;s free, and the license is BSD (open source). A number of game programmers at Java-Gaming.org have used it with good results.\r\n\r\nIt is set up to follow the API of Clip pretty closely, but with extra features. It has real time volume, panning, and frequency capabilities, and allows a user to play overlapping copies of the same cue.\r\n\r\nThere are only five class files, so it is pretty small. Of those, use of the AudioMixer class is optional, but if you have 30 sounds at once, it would probably be helpful, as it funnels everything out to a single SourceDataLine instead of running an output line for each sound.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m happy to help with setting it up, or answer any questions.\r\n\r\nYes, the Controls that Java provides for Clip are problematic. A lot depends on the computer system/hardware involved, as to whether they are implemented or not. And the controls tend to have poor granularity, only change the volume at buffer boundaries. AudioCue stores the internal audio as a &quot;CD Quality&quot; .wav and is granular down the single audio frame.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative to consider is the github project [TinySound][2]. It is a larger project than AudioCue, but still pretty small, and works well. I can&#39;t recall if it has real time faders for the volume. It might not. It&#39;s main advantage is that it can handle .ogg compressed files.

Only use manual snapshots for long term backups.\r\n\r\nThe below is not exact science, only speculation unfortunately.\r\n\r\n**RDS backups are an AWS secret sauce**. However it seems to leverage MySQL binlogs (hence impossible to disable binlogs;) or Postgres WALs for automated backups and possibly LVM snapshots or other technology for other RDS types. But we&#39;ll never know. Rumours also say they are compressed (why wouldn&#39;t you if CPU is free but storage isn&#39;t:)\r\n\r\n**Generally manual snapshots will be more expensive**. Due to the fact snapshots don&#39;t have a previous point in time to compare with so yes they would probably be fulls (an EBS &quot;safe&quot; snapshot then files are probably shipped to S3 for cold storage). Also it will be more expensive because you will necessarily use more storage on top of the automated backups. However if you turn off automatic backups to manually manage them, you will probably end up paying more (can&#39;t confirm) unless they compress well. Even if you could save a few dollars with manuals, the time spent manually managing these snapshots are probably not worth the effort nor risk unless you plan to keep weekly, monthly and yearly rotation which will inevitably cost you more on the long run. FWIW, what we do with our RDS instances is : 7 days backups + a lambda managing weeklies/monthlies/yearlies (and automatic clean-up / rotation). Yes it cost a fair bit of extra $$ on top. \r\n\r\n**As you know, backups are &quot;free&quot;** as long as the total amount of backups and snapshots is less or equal to the total amount of RDS storage (all DB combined). See [Reference][1]. Unfortunately there is no way to know how much your RDS snapshots/backups are using therefore how far you are from paying something.\r\n\r\nI hope the above (speculation) will somehow comfort you in your thoughts.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/pricing/#Backup_Storage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57997269/are-aws-rds-manual-snapshots-stored-incrementally-or-not/58010274#58010274","title":"Are AWS RDS manual snapshots stored incrementally or not?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":3460254,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000557857348/picture?type=large","display_name":"Zapłon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3460254/zap%c5%82on"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569224527,"creation_date":1568824558,"question_id":57997269,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57997269","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s say that I have 100GB RDS database.

This component is a reusable component for loading states. I&#39;m simply trying to take this component and use it inside of another component, UnpublishBlogBtn as the loader after a button click - that all works fine. However, I&#39;d like to change the height and width of the animation inside of UnpublishBlogBtn and cannot for the life of me get that to work properly. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried implementing Object.assign to bring in the CSS from the other file and just change the height and width. I&#39;ve also tried just changing the CSS by doing ```&lt;style={{}}&gt;``` as well as wrapping the component in a div that has a style added(this appears to just change the button and not the animation itself). \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Button type=&quot;main&quot; className=&quot;blogBtn&quot;&gt;\r\n   {currentlyUnpublishingBlog ? &lt;AnimatedLoader css={{ height: 1, width: 1 }}/&gt; : \r\n   &#39;Unpublish Blog&#39;}\r\n&lt;/Button&gt;\r\n``` \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst AnimatedLoader = () =&gt; {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div\r\n      css={{\r\n        height: 45,\r\n        width: 45\r\n      }}\r\n    &gt;\r\n      &lt;AnimatedIcon \r\n        css={{\r\n          animationDelay: &#39;0.7s&#39;,\r\n          height: 35,\r\n          left: 10,\r\n          position: &#39;absolute&#39;,\r\n          top: 10,\r\n          width: 35\r\n        }}\r\n      /&gt;\r\n      &lt;AnimatedIcon \r\n        css={{\r\n          animationDelay: &#39;0.7s&#39;\r\n          display: &#39;none&#39;,\r\n          height: 45,\r\n          left: 0,\r\n          top: 0,\r\n          width: 45,\r\n        }}\r\n      /&gt;\r\n      &lt;div\r\n        css={{\r\n          borderRadius: 20,\r\n          borderStyle: &#39;solid&#39;,\r\n          borderWidth: 3,\r\n          height: 45,\r\n          position: &#39;absolute&#39;,\r\n          width: 45,\r\n        }}\r\n      /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  )\r\n};\r\n  \r\nexport default AnimatedLoader;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter user clicks on Unpublish Blog button, the loader should display as a smaller width and height on top of the button.

can see several issues in [your code](https://snack.expo.io/@matheus_cbrl/react-native-maps-autocomplete). First, you&#39;re getting this error:\r\n\r\n&gt; _this.notifyChange is not a function.\r\n\r\nYou need to use `props` here:\r\n\r\n    onPress={(data, details = null) =&gt; { // &#39;details&#39; is provided when fetchDetails = true\r\n        this.props.notifyChange(details.geometry.location);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen, notice that you have commented out the `region` attribute from your `MapView` and that there is no `onRegionChange` either. If you add these:\r\n\r\n    region={this.props.region}\r\n    onRegionChange={(region) =&gt; this.props.onRegionChange(region)}\r\n\r\nYour map now centers to the chosen place from Autocomplete predictions. But there is no marker, because you should also set its coordinate accordingly:\r\n\r\n    &lt;MapView.Marker coordinate={this.props.region} /&gt;\r\n\r\nI ran your app and after the above changes, your marker gets placed at the selected Autocomplete location.

That will return you a list of `PropertyInfo` objects that you can then iterate through as I did in the fiddle. However, if there are any other properties on `this` you will also grab those, so you can use [BindingFlags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.bindingflags?view=netframework-4.8) within the overload of the [GetProperties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.getproperties?view=netframework-4.8#System_Type_GetProperties_System_Reflection_BindingFlags_) function.\r\n\r\nIn the end it will probably be best for you to create some sort of container that has properties that you expect and want to iterate through.

**PROBLEM**\r\n\r\n\r\n`Dish.model` is a list of dishes (Pizza, Hot Dog, Cake...) \r\n\r\n`Meal.model` saves the related dish and also adds a Table Number\r\n\r\n`Guest.model` relates to a dish and the table number and also adds a guest name. I am using a ManyToMany Relation just for training purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\ni have template where i can enter every value. If i enter all Values it saves the dish and table number in my database, but not the guest name and ManyToMany relation . On top a Error Message appears and relates to a `KeyError &#39;meal_id&#39; ` in my forms.py (after line: `# --- save Guest.model`).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Problem is i need to save the `Meal.model` at first. So i can take the Primary Key of the `Meal.model` and put in the Join Table or the Datafield `Guest.meal`. The Problem is i don&#180;t really understand how this works. So i took the Approach like `Guest.meal` would be a Foreign Key DataField and added `_id`. But `Guest.meal` relates to a Join Table and the the Django Doc (Database Representatio) points it out. \r\n\r\nSo my question is: how can i make the connection between `Guest.model` and the `Meal.model`? I guess also that in a ManyToMany Relation i need to save both `Guest.id` + `Meal.id` in the DataField `Guest.meal`?\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; **Update**\r\n\r\nthanks to @dirkgroten\r\n\r\n* first i changed the naming of one DataField - `Guest.meal` into `Guest.meals` of my model.\r\n\r\n* then i associate both models by using the `.add` method in my form\r\n\r\n&gt;
