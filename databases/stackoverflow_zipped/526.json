The example you linked shows\r\n\r\n*Android -&gt; Swing* conversion. So I will illustrate this with some examples:\r\n\r\n - If you have a `View` in your android app, you replace it with `JPanel` for swing.\r\n - If you have a `Button`, you replace it with `JButton`\r\n - Sometimes elements may look similar, but they do different things, like `CardView` and `CardPane`. This complicates things.\r\n - There might be android `View`s that has no matching pair in swing, so you will have to improvise there\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not this simple of course. Setting the properties of the views is going to be completely different. Moreover, Android uses XML, while in Swing you have to set everything programmatically.\r\n\r\nThe only thing common is basically they are both built on Java. So my best advice is that you shouldn&#39;t try to &quot;convert&quot; your code. Maybe you can reuse some pure Java parts, but other than that, I suggest you re write the application using the other platforms tools.\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415192/reusing-android-code-native-java-in-a-frame-inside-web-app-or-desktop-app/58415445#58415445","title":"reusing android code (native Java) in a frame inside web app or desktop app"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":847,"user_id":2182942,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4f6879c97bd70d60e0d7971294e018a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Simo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2182942/simo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571236560,"creation_date":1571236560,"answer_id":58415869,"question_id":58415192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415869","body_markdown":"you can&#39;t use android code in web app or desktop,\r\n\r\nfirst you have to separate the business code from the ui code \r\n\r\nthe business code can be in a pure java module (completely reusable)\r\n\r\nwhen i speak about business code i mean network calls (using retrofit for example) and any code that is pure java .. \r\n\r\nthe ui and android specific code (like Views ...) should be rewritten entirely because will not have access to android packages containing views (recycler, layouts...)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415192/reusing-android-code-native-java-in-a-frame-inside-web-app-or-desktop-app/58415869#58415869","title":"reusing android code (native Java) in a frame inside web app or desktop app"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":8489632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1138215642946596/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ramy Bakkar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8489632/ramy-bakkar"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571236560,"creation_date":1571234457,"question_id":58415192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415192","body_markdown":"as per [this answer][1] it is possible to reuse android java code inside web app or desktop app frame.\r\n\r\nso how its done step by step?\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a special tool to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8254827/8489632","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415192/reusing-android-code-native-java-in-a-frame-inside-web-app-or-desktop-app","title":"reusing android code (native Java) in a frame inside web app or desktop app"},{"tags":["newline","django-messages"],"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":7658051,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb7iZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tms91","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7658051/tms91"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234448,"creation_date":1571234448,"question_id":58415186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415186","body_markdown":"I have a line of my code\r\n\r\n    messages.error(request, (&#39;ERROR: upload failed.

The first element is your list from which you sample values, the second is the target sum, and third is an parameter that tells the function whether a single element from `lst` can be used multiple times. \r\n\r\nBecause the `_a` is defined within the `subsets_with_sum` it is *enclosed* with the values passed to `subsets_with_sum` - this is important, `lst` is the same for every recursive call of `_a`. The second thing to notice is that `l` is a list of values, whereas `r` is a *list of lists*. Importantly, `l` is a different object for each `_a` call (that&#39;s due to `l + [lst[u]]` resulting in a copy of `l` concatenated with `[lst[u]]`). However, `r` denotes the *same* object for each `_a` call - `r.append(l)` modifies it in place.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll start with `with_replacement == True` because I find it simpler. With the first call `_a` is passed `0, [], [], target`. It then checks if `t == sum(l)` and appends it to `r`, hence the only elements of `r` will be lists that sum to `t` (or `target`). If `sum(l)` that recursive branch is discarded by returning `None`. If the elements of `l` sum to a value lesser then `target` then for **each** element from the `lst` the element is appended to a *copy* of  `l` and `_a` is called with that list. Here&#39;s an amended version of the function that prints out the steps, so we can inspect what happens:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ndef subsets_with_sum(lst, target, with_replacement=False):\r\n    x = 0 if with_replacement else 1\r\n    def _a(idx, l, r, t, c):\r\n        if t == sum(l): \r\n            r.append(l)\r\n        elif t &lt; sum(l): \r\n            return\r\n        for u in range(idx, len(lst)):\r\n            print(&quot;{}. l = {} and l + [lst[u]] = {}&quot;.format(c, l, l + [lst[u]]))\r\n            _a(u + x, l + [lst[u]], r, t, c+1)\r\n        return r\r\n    return _a(0, [], [], target, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `subsets_with_sum([1,2,3], 2, True)` the following gets printed (I re-ordered and separated the printed lines a bit so they&#39;re easier to read):\r\n\r\n```python3\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [1]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [2]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [3]\r\n\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 2]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 3]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 2]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 3]\r\n\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 1]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 2]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that the right column (`l + [lst[u]]`) at a level `c` is equal to the left column (`l`) at a level `c + 1`. Furthermore, observe that `[3]` - the last line where `c == 0` doesn&#39;t make it past the `elif t &lt; sum(l)`, hence it doesn&#39;t get printed. Similarly, `[2]` at `c == 1` gets appended to `r`, but nonetheless the branch continues to the next level, since one or more elements of the `lst` might be equal to 0, hence appending them to `[2]` might result in *another* list that sums to the `target`.\r\n\r\nAlso, observe that for each list at certain level `c`, whose last element is `lst[u]` will appear `len(lst) - u`-times at the next level, `c + 1`, because that&#39;s the number of combinations of the list for each `lst[z]`, where `z &gt;= u`.\r\n\r\nSo what happens with `with_replacement == False` (the default case)? Well, in that case each time `lst[u]` is added to `l` and `sum(l) &lt; t`, so that that specific instance of `l` continues to the next recursion level only `lst[z]` can be added to the list, where `z &gt; u`, since `u + 1` is passed to the respective `_a` call. Let&#39;s look what happens when we call `subsets_with_sum([1,2,3], 2, False)`:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [1]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [3]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [2]\r\n\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 2]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 3]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 2]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 3]\r\n\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 1]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 2]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow observe that for each list at certain level `c`, whose last element is `lst[u]` will appear `len(lst) - u - 1`-times at the next level, `c + 1`, because that&#39;s the number of combinations of the list for each `lst[z]`, where `z &gt; u`. Compare this with the `with_replacement=True` analyzed above.\r\n\r\nI suggest you play around with it somewhat more until you understand it better. Regardless of substitution, what is important to realize is that the return statements always return to the caller. The first call of the `_a` returns to the `subsets_with_sum` which then returns to the caller (presumably you or some other function). All other (recursive) calls to `_a` return to the previous instances of `_a` calls which just discard the returned value (or more precisely, don&#39;t bother to do anything with it). The reason you get back the right `r` is because it behaves somewhat like a global value - each `_a` call that finds a solution, adds it to the same `r`. \r\n\r\nFinally, the `subsets_with_sum` doesn&#39;t work exactly like I&#39;d expect it to based on its desired functionality. Try the following two calls: `subsets_with_sum([2,2,1], 5, True)` and `subsets_with_sum([2,2,1,1,1], 5, False)`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415182/function-that-find-combination-of-values-that-sums-to-a-given-number/58416955#58416955","title":"Function that find combination of values that sums to a given number"}],"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":7065314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2abd5914703d855c00f05861a1365b04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Guilherme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7065314/guilherme"},"last_editor":{"reputation":27942,"user_id":1561176,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/022b5d51f385a2b717c90e8cd371f2fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Inbar Rose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1561176/inbar-rose"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58416955,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571315226,"creation_date":1571234432,"last_edit_date":1571315226,"question_id":58415182,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415182","body_markdown":"This post [Finding Combinations to the provided Sum value][1] presents the function `subsets_with_sum()`.

came across [this question ][1] and couldn&#39;t get why someone needs to digitally sign a request that is submitted over SSL\r\n\r\n 1. Digital Signature aims to guarantee message integrity by identifying the sender and making sure that the message is not getting altered between client and server\r\n 2. SSL aims to secure the communication channel between client and server to prevent sniffing and [MITM attack][2] and hence guarantees that messages cannot be altered\r\n\r\nCan&#39;t one of the above approaches replace the other?\r\n\r\n **For example:**\r\n\r\n - Over SSL, can I just rely on authentication header to identify the sender without digitally sign the request as I guarantee that SSL protects the request from MITM?  \r\n\r\n**Or** \r\n\r\n - Can I trust digitally signed messages over http because the server will know the source of the message and can identify if it was altered or not?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4688056/how-do-i-digitally-sign-an-https-request-in-net\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415172/why-to-digitally-sign-an-http-request-over-ssl","title":"Why to digitally sign an http request over SSL"},{"tags":["java","java-ee","callouts","adempiere"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9626527,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dfb2c3cb33f4ca157c013c9bc27db8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user9626527","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9626527/user9626527"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9626527,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dfb2c3cb33f4ca157c013c9bc27db8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user9626527","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9626527/user9626527"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234719,"creation_date":1571234408,"last_edit_date":1571234719,"question_id":58415171,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415171","body_markdown":"Adempiere **callout** for fields doesn&#39;t working on **import options or create lines from** option.

The [answer in your linked question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27980725/4739755) shows you were on the right track:\r\n\r\nThe following will append your data as expected, but without dumping &quot;gibberish&quot; (bytes). `np.savetxt` apparently takes care of doing the appropriate formatting/encoding so that what&#39;s written is human readable.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith open(some_file, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fo:\r\n    np.savetxt(fo, responses)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Original - left here to explain why the OP approach wasn&#39;t working\r\n\r\nYour comment hints into what&#39;s happening:\r\n&gt; The following does append but it inputs gibberish (i assume because of the binary, but without the b it tells me I need to input a string) --&gt; with open(sampleData, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fs: fs.write(samples) with open(responseData, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fr: fr.write(responses)\r\n\r\nWhen you try to write without `b`, it complains appropriately, because you _need_ to give it a string in normal write-mode - you can&#39;t just write a list/array (which is what `samples` and `responses` are). When you use `b`, you&#39;re writing in binary/bytes mode, so whatever you pass to `write` gets coerced into bytes. This is what I see if I write the following in binary mode:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresp = np.array([1, 2, 4, 5], np.float32)\r\nresp = resp.reshape((resp.size, 1))\r\nnp.savetxt(file1, resp)\r\nwith open(file2, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fo:\r\n    fo.write(resp)\r\n\r\n# From Hex view of written file\r\n00 00 80 3F 00 00 00 40 00 00 80 40 00 00 A0 40\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is identical to calling `bytes(...)` on the array I made:\r\n```\r\nimport binascii\r\nbinascii.hexlify(bytes(resp))\r\n\r\n# produces:\r\nb&#39;0000803f00000040000080400000a040&#39; -&gt; &#39;00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 40 00 00 80 40 00 00 a0 40&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, you just need to format your data into a `str` friendly representation, such as joining into a string (for example):\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;, &#39;.join(str(x) for x in resp)\r\n&#39;[1.], [2.], [4.], [5.]&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n...but how you format it is of course dependent on your requirements.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415169/appending-to-a-data-file-in-python/58415795#58415795","title":"Appending to a .data file in

I know this can be easily done in Excel with a sequential vLookup, but not sure how it can be replicated in SQL.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415128/lookup-loop-in-pl-sql-to-find-a-final-value","title":"Lookup loop in PL/SQL to find a final value"},{"tags":["javascript","firebase","google-cloud-firestore"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234686,"creation_date":1571234686,"answer_id":58415275,"question_id":58415123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415275","body_markdown":"This is currently not possible with a single query.  array-contains can only find a single item in the named array.\r\n\r\nYour alternative is to perform three queries, one for each item in the `friendsId` array, then merge the results in your code.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415123/firestore-query-array-contains-pass-in-array/58415275#58415275","title":"Firestore query &#39;array_contains&#39; pass in array"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":561,"user_id":7725879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IWw6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sllopis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7725879/sllopis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234803,"creation_date":1571234803,"answer_id":58415314,"question_id":58415123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415314","body_markdown":"&gt; **Not sure if this is possible, but here&#39;s an example from the [Firebase Node.js Snippets][2] that can give you an idea:**\r\n\r\n      let citiesRef = db.collection(&#39;cities&#39;);\r\n\r\n      // [START array_contains_filter]\r\n      let westCoastCities = citiesRef.where(&#39;regions&#39;, &#39;array-contains&#39;,\r\n        &#39;west_coast&#39;);\r\n\r\n      // [END array_contains_filter]\r\n    \r\n      westCoastCities.get()\r\n        .then(res =&gt; {\r\n          console.log(&#39;West Coast get: &#39;, res);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n**Reference [Documentation][1]**\r\n\r\n[1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#array_membership\r\n[2]: https://github.com/firebase/snippets-node/blob/d769695bd1159103e7c877849ccaccab3db37039/firestore/main/index.js#L681-L682","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415123/firestore-query-array-contains-pass-in-array/58415314#58415314","title":"Firestore query &#39;array_contains&#39; pass in array"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571299335,"post_id":58415315,"comment_id":103196545,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415123/firestore-query-array-contains-pass-in-array/58415315#comment103196545_58415315"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234804,"creation_date":1571234804,"answer_id":58415315,"question_id":58415123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415315","body_markdown":"According to the official documentation regarding [query operators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#query_operators):\r\n\r\n&gt; You can use the array-contains operator to filter based on array values.\r\n\r\nAs I can see in your code, your `friendIds` argument that is passed as the third parameter to the `where()` function is of type `array`.

So `r[12]` gives something like: `sip:+441498738722`.\r\nWhen the 2nd column is `FW`, you are interested by the 14th column. So, `r[13]` gives something like: `sip:+442086081330@example.com`.\r\n\r\nYour filter is: `FILTER = [&#39;sip:+420&#39;, &#39;sip:+34&#39;, &#39;sip:+44149&#39;]`. It contains 3 items. The length of the 1st item is **8**.\r\nThe length of the 2nd item is **7** and the length of the last item is **10**.\r\n\r\nSo to know if the `r[12]` (`sip:+441498738722`) or `r[13]` (`sip:+442086081330@example.com`) elements are in the `FILTER`,\r\nyou have to take the first 8, 7 and 10 characters and test **if one of them (at least)** is in the `FILTER`.\r\n\r\n    if (r[12][:8] in FILTER) or (r[12][:7] in FILTER) or (r[12][:10] in FILTER):\r\n        # code\r\n\r\n**For example:** `r[12]` is `sip:+441498738722`. So the first 8 characters are `r[12][:8]` which is `sip:+441`. The first 7\r\ncharacters are `r[12][:7]` which is `sip:+44`. The first 10 characters are `r[12][:10]` which is `sip:+44149`. Now, you can\r\nsee that for this `r[12]` (`sip:+441498738722`), only `r[12][:10]` (`sip:+44149`) is in the `FILTER` variable. So, you can\r\nadd this `row` to the `result` list.\r\n\r\nIt is the same logic, when the 2nd column of the `row` is `FW`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415096/python-if-else-condition-on-printing-lines/58416094#58416094","title":"Python: If..else.. condition on printing lines"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11999777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/474e5823ac34c689a6966d32d200d19a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Maria","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11999777/maria"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11999777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/474e5823ac34c689a6966d32d200d19a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Maria","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11999777/maria"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":102,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58416094,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571497812,"creation_date":1571234187,"last_edit_date":1571314766,"question_id":58415096,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415096","body_markdown":"I have code to search 13th column to be matched if field-2 of the line is &quot;IT&quot;, and 14th column to be matched if field-2 of the line is &quot;FW&quot;.

For instance, it could just be the output of Pi at one particular location. Generally, you&#39;ll have to trust the FIPS or Common Criteria certification of the platform, but note that neither one is airtight.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can also rely on the fact that HSM companies want to make money. One way certain to lose (all) marketshare is to show that you cannot be trusted. Multiple companies, including RSA Labs, already found this out to their detriment. If you don&#39;t fully trust a HSM company, then don&#39;t buy anything off of them; but note that there is no such thing as *perfect security* in a practical sense.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to do some simple experiments. If you ask for signature generation using the same data then you should never get the same signature (r and s values for ECDSA). This shows that the output of the RNG at least doesn&#39;t repeat. Testing this - once - with several connections / sessions might be a good idea.\r\n\r\nYou could also verify and then concatenate all the resulting x values (used for the final comparison) and then run a randomness test (such as the diehard suite) over it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, if you don&#39;t trust the entropy source of the HSM&#39;s RNG, note that you can add additional seeds to a HSM. Please check the documentation of your HSM how it reacts to adding / mixing seeds.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432158/how-to-validate-the-randomness-of-ecdsa-signature-generated-using-hsm/58432450#58432450","title":"How to validate the randomness of ECDSA signature generated using HSM?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":80649,"user_id":387076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFyP6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gilles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/387076/gilles"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571381710,"post_id":58445133,"comment_id":103229392,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432158/how-to-validate-the-randomness-of-ecdsa-signature-generated-using-hsm/58445133#comment103229392_58445133"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":340,"user_id":12056564,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ec003d02adbcf6a3065097f6f29fa29?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12056564/gerd"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571380236,"creation_date":1571380236,"answer_id":58445133,"question_id":58432158,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58445133","body_markdown":"[This article][1] gives an overview of methods for checking the randomness of some given data:\r\n\r\n&gt; There are many practical measures of randomness for a binary sequence.\r\n&gt; These include measures based on statistical tests, transforms, and\r\n&gt; complexity or a mixture of these.

Here my code:\r\n\r\n        func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {\r\n        if section == 0 {\r\n            if self.userAdressDict[0].isExpanded == true {\r\n                return 0\r\n            }\r\n            if self.userAdressDict[0].isExpanded == false {\r\n                return self.userAdressDict.count\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        if section == 1 {\r\n            return self.userAdressDictForTeslim.count\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n        return 1\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere my header view code:\r\n\r\n        func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, viewForHeaderInSection section: Int) -&gt; UIView? {\r\n        if section == 0 {\r\n            let button = UIButton(type: .system)\r\n            button.setTitle(&quot;Kapat&quot;, for: .normal)\r\n            button.setTitleColor(.black, for: .normal)\r\n            button.backgroundColor = .lightGray\r\n            button.titleLabel!.font = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 14)\r\n            button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleExpandCloseForAlim(sender:)), for: .touchUpInside)\r\n            return button\r\n        }\r\n        if section == 1 {\r\n            let button = UIButton(type: .system)\r\n            button.setTitle(&quot;Kapat&quot;, for: .normal)\r\n            button.setTitleColor(.black, for: .normal)\r\n            button.backgroundColor = .lightGray\r\n            button.titleLabel!.font = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 14)\r\n            button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleExpandCloseForTeslim), for: .touchUpInside)\r\n            return button\r\n        }\r\n        else{\r\n            return nil\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here button action function:\r\n\r\n    @objc func handleExpandCloseForAlim(sender: UIButton) {\r\n        var indexPaths = [IndexPath]()\r\n        for row in self.userAdressDict.indices{\r\n            print(0 , row)\r\n            let indexPath = IndexPath(row: row, section: 0)\r\n            indexPaths.append(indexPath)\r\n        }\r\n        let indexPath = IndexPath(row: (sender.tag), section: 0)\r\n        let adresso = self.userAdressDict[indexPath.row]\r\n        if adresso.isExpanded == true {\r\n            tableView.deleteRows(at: indexPaths , with: .fade)\r\n        }\r\n        if adresso.isExpanded == false {\r\n            tableView.insertRows(at: indexPaths, with: .fade)\r\n        }\r\n        //self.userAdressDict.removeAll()\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nI can make delete process with removeAll() code. But I want to insert rows also so this way not correct way to do that. (userAdressDict is my model which hold datas). In handleExpandCloseForAlim function&#39;s sender for reach isExpanded variable. I have problem about numberOfRowsInSection part lastly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415045/how-can-i-reach-sender-at-numberofrowinsection-function","title":"How can I reach sender at numberOfRowInSection function?"},{"tags":["powershell"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":884,"user_id":3963478,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d3a6e35e2040331ea94ee194b2017b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3963478/patrick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571234333,"post_id":58415043,"comment_id":103173024,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415043/get-childitem-with-multiple-paths-via-variable#comment103173024_58415043"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":304,"user_id":5553142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207237363599963/picture?type=large","display_name":"Eric Weintraub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5553142/eric-weintraub"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571425134,"post_id":58415139,"comment_id":103250578,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415043/get-childitem-with-multiple-paths-via-variable/58415139#comment103250578_58415139"},{"owner":{"reputation":162101,"user_id":45375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39f6e2dc52425b1e08027c01bb880be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mklement0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/45375/mklement0"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":304,"user_id":5553142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207237363599963/picture?type=large","display_name":"Eric Weintraub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5553142/eric-weintraub"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571426026,"post_id":58415139,"comment_id":103250908,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415043/get-childitem-with-multiple-paths-via-variable/58415139#comment103250908_58415139"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":162101,"user_id":45375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39f6e2dc52425b1e08027c01bb880be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mklement0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/45375/mklement0"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162101,"user_id":45375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39f6e2dc52425b1e08027c01bb880be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mklement0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/45375/mklement0"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":true,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1571242144,"last_edit_date":1571242144,"creation_date":1571234332,"answer_id":58415139,"question_id":58415043,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415139","body_markdown":"Yes, `$LogsToGather` must be an _array_ of strings for your command to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$LogsToGather = &#39;c:\\windows\\temp\\*.log&#39;, &#39;c:\\temp\\*.log&#39;, &#39;C:\\programdata\\Microsoft\\IntuneManagementExtension\\Logs\\*.log&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how the array elements, separated by `,`, must be quoted _individually_ (see bottom section).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`Get-Help` with `-Parameter` is a quick way to examine the data type a given parameter expects:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Parameter Path\r\n\r\n-Path &lt;String[]&gt;\r\n    Specifies a path to one or more locations.

But when the earlier member returns, neither of them see each other in the viewAccepted function, and they run in effectively independent groups (bad).  This non-grouping behavior can be random.  For example, I restarted one host this morning after I had disconnected it at 5pm yesterday, and neither saw the other in the group.  However, once I stopped both of them and restarted, they found each other in the group.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate use of JGroups is to cluster two Tomcat hosts running the same application such that the first host listed in the cluster runs reports while the second waits for the first to die, then takes the first host&#39;s place and runs reports.  When the first host is returned to service, it becomes the second in the cluster membership list, and waits for the other to die.  Right now the application&#39;s behavior echoes that of the test program, below. \r\n\r\nUsing JGroups jgroups-4.1.6.Final.jar out of the box with no custom udp.xml file and no arguments to new JChannel().  I have a test app that runs on two RHEL 7 hosts to get them to cluster.

The admin also said that there are no restrictions or configurations that would inhibit UDP traffic.\r\n\r\nThings I&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n- Increasing the send and receive buffer sizes for Multicast, as per [this][1] solution.  I now get no warning messages on startup due to inadequate buffer size.\r\n- Updating JGroups version to latest.\r\n- Waiting overnight to try to start a stopped host.\r\n\r\nThings I don&#39;t want to try:\r\n\r\n- Using TCP, since the cluster membership is fluid (it can be any two hosts) and I would rather not update a configuration file whenever the host changes.\r\n\r\nI am open to alternate solutions in case I can&#39;t get JGroups to work reliably.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

In your case you would use it as `Chart1.ChartAreas(&quot;Default&quot;).AxisX.Minimum = SomeValue`\r\nNote that when you set the minimum in this way the axis will stop automatically rescaling.\r\n\r\nIf you want the minimum to always be zero when all x-values are positive, have a look at [Axis.IsStartedFromZero](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.datavisualization.charting.axis.isstartedfromzero?view=netframework-4.8)\r\n\r\nI hope i understood your question correctly because you mention intervals, but seem to be talking about the minimum value of your x axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a further comment on your code unrelated to the question; it is unnecessary and inefficient to remove the `ChartArea` every time you want to update the graph, same goes for the `Series`. Doing this will result in having to re-format the chart on every update (like you are in fact doing with the series).\r\n\r\nIt suffices to call `YourSeries.Points.Clear()` and to then add the new points. This way you don&#39;t have to re-specify the series color and chartype on each update.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nI also see that you round the x position to one decimal, presumably to prevent the x-axis from having long ugly numbers on it. However, a better way to do this is to specify a [format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.datavisualization.charting.labelstyle?view=netframework-4.8) for the axis:\r\n\r\n`chart1.ChartAreas.FirstOrDefault.AxisX.LabelStyle.Format = &quot;{0:0.0}&quot;` in your case.  This way your series will still store the exact value, but only one decimal will be displayed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415028/visual-basic-making-a-line-chart/58448615#58448615","title":"Visual Basic - Making a Line Chart"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12095321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2kH_HCxcVls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfQGTnxUhGgWb84Pr7KH8vb2L77lQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Callum Bland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095321/callum-bland"},"last_editor":{"reputation":42649,"user_id":5090771,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EOZG.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"WhiteHat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5090771/whitehat"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58448615,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571396174,"creation_date":1571234008,"last_edit_date":1571311040,"question_id":58415028,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415028","body_markdown":"This is my first post on stackoverflow so sorry in advance for anything I may have messed up, but for a project I am doing a simulator for projectile motion.

need to save my array with UserDefaults because I want users have ability to add or delete rows them selves. I have a plist contains rows of dictionaries.

(filled with data of rows and works fine). my problem is how to save this array in UserDefaults , as it is an array of dictionaries seems it is a little complicated. I did this like the codes in bottom but it throws a thread in app delegate. \r\n\r\nI added this line in viewdidload to call save function \r\n\r\n    savePlaces()\r\n\r\nand then here is my savePlaces function \r\n\r\n     func savePlaces(){\r\n        \r\n        do\r\n        {\r\n            let placesData = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: countries, requiringSecureCoding: false)\r\n        UserDefaults.standard.set(placesData, forKey: &quot;places&quot;)\r\n        print(&quot;Here is save function&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n        catch\r\n        {\r\n        print(&quot;SaveError&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt seems that problem is because of  `countries` array which it is an array of dictionaries coming from plist, because when I change this line \r\n\r\n    let placesData = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: countries, requiringSecureCoding: false)\r\n\r\nto this \r\n\r\n    let placesData = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: imageList, requiringSecureCoding: false)\r\n\r\nI mean I changed the countries to the imageList which is an array of strings , it works fine. I defined image list in first line \r\n\r\n     var imageList = [&quot;usaflag&quot;,&quot;gerflag&quot;,&quot;franceflag&quot;,&quot;jpflag&quot;,&quot;gerflag&quot;]\r\n\r\nso the problem is

currently practicing Vue with Vuex and the REST API architecture (with Django). I wanna retrieve the data from by database and store the data in my global state in order to access it throughout my Vue components. It works fine so far but there is one weird thing I do not understand.\r\n\r\nWhen I start my application I have the homepage where currently nothing is displayed. I click on the menu item &quot;Contacts&quot; and the contacts component loads (router-view) (API GET call is executed) and displays the table of all the created contacts and shows it properly (source of truth is now my global state). I can edit, delete and view a contact.The contacts are now stored in the global state as well.\r\n\r\n**The problem:** Everytime I load the contact component the mounted() lifecycle gets called (which makes sense) and loads the contacts from the API inside the state so the whole lists gets dupblicated over and over. I just want Vue to make a GET request only once and then access the state&#39;s data (where to contacts are stored now).\r\n\r\nAnother scenario is when I update a contact and click back to the contacts menu item the list contains the old contact and the updated one but when I refresh the page it is fine.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**MY CODE**\r\n\r\n**state.js**\r\n\r\n    import Vue from &quot;vue&quot;;\r\n    import Vuex from &quot;vuex&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    Vue.use(Vuex);\r\n    \r\n    import { apiService } from &quot;../utils/api.service.js&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    export const store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n      state: {\r\n        contacts: []\r\n      },\r\n      mutations: {\r\n        initContacts_MU: (state, data) =&gt;

Tkinter I would like to create some frames in main window and then position elements relatively to these frames.\r\n\r\nI created some frames and then some elements thet should be relative to frames, but they are positioned relatively to main window (root).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tkinter\r\n\r\nroot = tkinter.Tk()\r\nroot.title(&#39;Positioning&#39;)\r\nroot.geometry(&#39;{}x{}&#39;.format(800, 600))\r\n\r\nframe1 = tkinter.Frame(root, bg=&#39;cyan&#39;).place(x=0, y=0, width=800,

position against the window should be 200. But it comes at the top of the root object, so the vertical position is 0 (all three labels are vertically aligned). Is there any way to make the labels to be positioned relatively to the particular frames?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58414997/tkinter-position-relative-to-parent","title":"Tkinter -

Is there a way to fix the error and conserve the warning *[-Wmissing-field-initializers]* ?\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include &quot;debug.h&quot;\r\n\r\nstruct test {\r\n    //OK\r\n    /* int a, b, c; */\r\n    /* int a=0, b=0, c=3; */\r\n    //ERROR\r\n    int a, b, c=3;\r\n};\r\n\r\nint main(){\r\n    const test val1 = test();     //{0,0,3}\r\n    constexpr test val2 = test(); //error: call to non-&#39;constexpr&#39; function &#39;test::test()&#39;\r\n    constexpr test val3 = {};     //{0,0,3}\r\n    constexpr test val4 = {1};    //warning: missing initializer for member &#39;test::b&#39;\r\n    constexpr test val5 = {1,2};  //{1,2,3}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput :\r\n```\r\ntest.cpp: In function &#39;int main()&#39;:\r\ntest.cpp:13:32: error: call to non-&#39;constexpr&#39; function &#39;test::test()&#39;\r\n     constexpr test val2 = test();\r\n                                ^\r\ntest.cpp:3:8: note: &#39;test::test()&#39; is not usable as a &#39;constexpr&#39; function because:\r\n struct test {\r\n        ^~~~\r\ntest.cpp:8:9: note: defaulted default constructor does not initialize &#39;int test::a&#39;\r\n     int a, b, c=3;\r\n         ^\r\ntest.cpp:8:12: note: defaulted default constructor does not initialize &#39;int test::b&#39;\r\n     int a, b, c=3;\r\n            ^\r\ntest.cpp:15:29: warning: missing initializer for member &#39;test::b&#39; [-Wmissing-field-initializers]\r\n     constexpr test val4 = {1};\r\n                             ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization\r\n  [2]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/data_members#Member_initialization","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415211/aggregate-constexpr-default-contructor-error-with-partial-nsdmi","title":"Aggregate constexpr default contructor error with partial NSDMI"},{"tags":["excel","vba"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12210,"user_id":9245853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4sRg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BigBen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9245853/bigben"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571234582,"post_id":58415209,"comment_id":103173188,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415209/vba-update-userform-from-macro#comment103173188_58415209"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3565564,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/637c987bb2e1d12352b1fb7a4d848631?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Knocky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3565564/knocky"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12210,"user_id":9245853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4sRg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"BigBen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9245853/bigben"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571237888,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234563,"creation_date":1571234515,"last_edit_date":1571234563,"question_id":58415209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415209","body_markdown":"I have a workbook contain a button to run a macro.

The example you linked shows\r\n\r\n*Android -&gt; Swing* conversion. So I will illustrate this with some examples:\r\n\r\n - If you have a `View` in your android app, you replace it with `JPanel` for swing.\r\n - If you have a `Button`, you replace it with `JButton`\r\n - Sometimes elements may look similar, but they do different things, like `CardView` and `CardPane`. This complicates things.\r\n - There might be android `View`s that has no matching pair in swing, so you will have to improvise there\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not this simple of course. Setting the properties of the views is going to be completely different. Moreover, Android uses XML, while in Swing you have to set everything programmatically.\r\n\r\nThe only thing common is basically they are both built on Java. So my best advice is that you shouldn&#39;t try to &quot;convert&quot; your code. Maybe you can reuse some pure Java parts, but other than that, I suggest you re write the application using the other platforms tools.\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415192/reusing-android-code-native-java-in-a-frame-inside-web-app-or-desktop-app/58415445#58415445","title":"reusing android code (native Java) in a frame inside web app or desktop app"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":847,"user_id":2182942,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4f6879c97bd70d60e0d7971294e018a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Simo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2182942/simo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571236560,"creation_date":1571236560,"answer_id":58415869,"question_id":58415192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415869","body_markdown":"you can&#39;t use android code in web app or desktop,\r\n\r\nfirst you have to separate the business code from the ui code \r\n\r\nthe business code can be in a pure java module (completely reusable)\r\n\r\nwhen i speak about business code i mean network calls (using retrofit for example) and any code that is pure java .. \r\n\r\nthe ui and android specific code (like Views ...) should be rewritten entirely because will not have access to android packages containing views (recycler, layouts...)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415192/reusing-android-code-native-java-in-a-frame-inside-web-app-or-desktop-app/58415869#58415869","title":"reusing android code (native Java) in a frame inside web app or desktop app"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":8489632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1138215642946596/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ramy Bakkar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8489632/ramy-bakkar"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571236560,"creation_date":1571234457,"question_id":58415192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415192","body_markdown":"as per [this answer][1] it is possible to reuse android java code inside web app or desktop app frame.\r\n\r\nso how its done step by step?\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a special tool to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8254827/8489632","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415192/reusing-android-code-native-java-in-a-frame-inside-web-app-or-desktop-app","title":"reusing android code (native Java) in a frame inside web app or desktop app"},{"tags":["newline","django-messages"],"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":7658051,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb7iZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tms91","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7658051/tms91"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234448,"creation_date":1571234448,"question_id":58415186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415186","body_markdown":"I have a line of my code\r\n\r\n    messages.error(request, (&#39;ERROR: upload failed.

The first element is your list from which you sample values, the second is the target sum, and third is an parameter that tells the function whether a single element from `lst` can be used multiple times. \r\n\r\nBecause the `_a` is defined within the `subsets_with_sum` it is *enclosed* with the values passed to `subsets_with_sum` - this is important, `lst` is the same for every recursive call of `_a`. The second thing to notice is that `l` is a list of values, whereas `r` is a *list of lists*. Importantly, `l` is a different object for each `_a` call (that&#39;s due to `l + [lst[u]]` resulting in a copy of `l` concatenated with `[lst[u]]`). However, `r` denotes the *same* object for each `_a` call - `r.append(l)` modifies it in place.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll start with `with_replacement == True` because I find it simpler. With the first call `_a` is passed `0, [], [], target`. It then checks if `t == sum(l)` and appends it to `r`, hence the only elements of `r` will be lists that sum to `t` (or `target`). If `sum(l)` that recursive branch is discarded by returning `None`. If the elements of `l` sum to a value lesser then `target` then for **each** element from the `lst` the element is appended to a *copy* of  `l` and `_a` is called with that list. Here&#39;s an amended version of the function that prints out the steps, so we can inspect what happens:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ndef subsets_with_sum(lst, target, with_replacement=False):\r\n    x = 0 if with_replacement else 1\r\n    def _a(idx, l, r, t, c):\r\n        if t == sum(l): \r\n            r.append(l)\r\n        elif t &lt; sum(l): \r\n            return\r\n        for u in range(idx, len(lst)):\r\n            print(&quot;{}. l = {} and l + [lst[u]] = {}&quot;.format(c, l, l + [lst[u]]))\r\n            _a(u + x, l + [lst[u]], r, t, c+1)\r\n        return r\r\n    return _a(0, [], [], target, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `subsets_with_sum([1,2,3], 2, True)` the following gets printed (I re-ordered and separated the printed lines a bit so they&#39;re easier to read):\r\n\r\n```python3\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [1]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [2]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [3]\r\n\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 2]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 3]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 2]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 3]\r\n\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 1]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 2]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that the right column (`l + [lst[u]]`) at a level `c` is equal to the left column (`l`) at a level `c + 1`. Furthermore, observe that `[3]` - the last line where `c == 0` doesn&#39;t make it past the `elif t &lt; sum(l)`, hence it doesn&#39;t get printed. Similarly, `[2]` at `c == 1` gets appended to `r`, but nonetheless the branch continues to the next level, since one or more elements of the `lst` might be equal to 0, hence appending them to `[2]` might result in *another* list that sums to the `target`.\r\n\r\nAlso, observe that for each list at certain level `c`, whose last element is `lst[u]` will appear `len(lst) - u`-times at the next level, `c + 1`, because that&#39;s the number of combinations of the list for each `lst[z]`, where `z &gt;= u`.\r\n\r\nSo what happens with `with_replacement == False` (the default case)? Well, in that case each time `lst[u]` is added to `l` and `sum(l) &lt; t`, so that that specific instance of `l` continues to the next recursion level only `lst[z]` can be added to the list, where `z &gt; u`, since `u + 1` is passed to the respective `_a` call. Let&#39;s look what happens when we call `subsets_with_sum([1,2,3], 2, False)`:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [1]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [3]\r\n0. l = [] and l + [lst[u]] = [2]\r\n\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 2]\r\n1. l = [1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 3]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 2]\r\n1. l = [2] and l + [lst[u]] = [2, 3]\r\n\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 1]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 2]\r\n2. l = [1, 1] and l + [lst[u]] = [1, 1, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow observe that for each list at certain level `c`, whose last element is `lst[u]` will appear `len(lst) - u - 1`-times at the next level, `c + 1`, because that&#39;s the number of combinations of the list for each `lst[z]`, where `z &gt; u`. Compare this with the `with_replacement=True` analyzed above.\r\n\r\nI suggest you play around with it somewhat more until you understand it better. Regardless of substitution, what is important to realize is that the return statements always return to the caller. The first call of the `_a` returns to the `subsets_with_sum` which then returns to the caller (presumably you or some other function). All other (recursive) calls to `_a` return to the previous instances of `_a` calls which just discard the returned value (or more precisely, don&#39;t bother to do anything with it). The reason you get back the right `r` is because it behaves somewhat like a global value - each `_a` call that finds a solution, adds it to the same `r`. \r\n\r\nFinally, the `subsets_with_sum` doesn&#39;t work exactly like I&#39;d expect it to based on its desired functionality. Try the following two calls: `subsets_with_sum([2,2,1], 5, True)` and `subsets_with_sum([2,2,1,1,1], 5, False)`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415182/function-that-find-combination-of-values-that-sums-to-a-given-number/58416955#58416955","title":"Function that find combination of values that sums to a given number"}],"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":7065314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2abd5914703d855c00f05861a1365b04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Guilherme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7065314/guilherme"},"last_editor":{"reputation":27942,"user_id":1561176,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/022b5d51f385a2b717c90e8cd371f2fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Inbar Rose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1561176/inbar-rose"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58416955,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571315226,"creation_date":1571234432,"last_edit_date":1571315226,"question_id":58415182,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415182","body_markdown":"This post [Finding Combinations to the provided Sum value][1] presents the function `subsets_with_sum()`.

came across [this question ][1] and couldn&#39;t get why someone needs to digitally sign a request that is submitted over SSL\r\n\r\n 1. Digital Signature aims to guarantee message integrity by identifying the sender and making sure that the message is not getting altered between client and server\r\n 2. SSL aims to secure the communication channel between client and server to prevent sniffing and [MITM attack][2] and hence guarantees that messages cannot be altered\r\n\r\nCan&#39;t one of the above approaches replace the other?\r\n\r\n **For example:**\r\n\r\n - Over SSL, can I just rely on authentication header to identify the sender without digitally sign the request as I guarantee that SSL protects the request from MITM?  \r\n\r\n**Or** \r\n\r\n - Can I trust digitally signed messages over http because the server will know the source of the message and can identify if it was altered or not?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4688056/how-do-i-digitally-sign-an-https-request-in-net\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415172/why-to-digitally-sign-an-http-request-over-ssl","title":"Why to digitally sign an http request over SSL"},{"tags":["java","java-ee","callouts","adempiere"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9626527,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dfb2c3cb33f4ca157c013c9bc27db8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user9626527","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9626527/user9626527"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9626527,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dfb2c3cb33f4ca157c013c9bc27db8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user9626527","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9626527/user9626527"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234719,"creation_date":1571234408,"last_edit_date":1571234719,"question_id":58415171,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415171","body_markdown":"Adempiere **callout** for fields doesn&#39;t working on **import options or create lines from** option.

The [answer in your linked question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27980725/4739755) shows you were on the right track:\r\n\r\nThe following will append your data as expected, but without dumping &quot;gibberish&quot; (bytes). `np.savetxt` apparently takes care of doing the appropriate formatting/encoding so that what&#39;s written is human readable.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith open(some_file, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fo:\r\n    np.savetxt(fo, responses)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Original - left here to explain why the OP approach wasn&#39;t working\r\n\r\nYour comment hints into what&#39;s happening:\r\n&gt; The following does append but it inputs gibberish (i assume because of the binary, but without the b it tells me I need to input a string) --&gt; with open(sampleData, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fs: fs.write(samples) with open(responseData, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fr: fr.write(responses)\r\n\r\nWhen you try to write without `b`, it complains appropriately, because you _need_ to give it a string in normal write-mode - you can&#39;t just write a list/array (which is what `samples` and `responses` are). When you use `b`, you&#39;re writing in binary/bytes mode, so whatever you pass to `write` gets coerced into bytes. This is what I see if I write the following in binary mode:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresp = np.array([1, 2, 4, 5], np.float32)\r\nresp = resp.reshape((resp.size, 1))\r\nnp.savetxt(file1, resp)\r\nwith open(file2, &#39;ab+&#39;) as fo:\r\n    fo.write(resp)\r\n\r\n# From Hex view of written file\r\n00 00 80 3F 00 00 00 40 00 00 80 40 00 00 A0 40\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is identical to calling `bytes(...)` on the array I made:\r\n```\r\nimport binascii\r\nbinascii.hexlify(bytes(resp))\r\n\r\n# produces:\r\nb&#39;0000803f00000040000080400000a040&#39; -&gt; &#39;00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 40 00 00 80 40 00 00 a0 40&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, you just need to format your data into a `str` friendly representation, such as joining into a string (for example):\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;, &#39;.join(str(x) for x in resp)\r\n&#39;[1.], [2.], [4.], [5.]&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n...but how you format it is of course dependent on your requirements.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415169/appending-to-a-data-file-in-python/58415795#58415795","title":"Appending to a .data file in

I know this can be easily done in Excel with a sequential vLookup, but not sure how it can be replicated in SQL.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415128/lookup-loop-in-pl-sql-to-find-a-final-value","title":"Lookup loop in PL/SQL to find a final value"},{"tags":["javascript","firebase","google-cloud-firestore"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234686,"creation_date":1571234686,"answer_id":58415275,"question_id":58415123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415275","body_markdown":"This is currently not possible with a single query.  array-contains can only find a single item in the named array.\r\n\r\nYour alternative is to perform three queries, one for each item in the `friendsId` array, then merge the results in your code.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415123/firestore-query-array-contains-pass-in-array/58415275#58415275","title":"Firestore query &#39;array_contains&#39; pass in array"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":561,"user_id":7725879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IWw6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sllopis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7725879/sllopis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234803,"creation_date":1571234803,"answer_id":58415314,"question_id":58415123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415314","body_markdown":"&gt; **Not sure if this is possible, but here&#39;s an example from the [Firebase Node.js Snippets][2] that can give you an idea:**\r\n\r\n      let citiesRef = db.collection(&#39;cities&#39;);\r\n\r\n      // [START array_contains_filter]\r\n      let westCoastCities = citiesRef.where(&#39;regions&#39;, &#39;array-contains&#39;,\r\n        &#39;west_coast&#39;);\r\n\r\n      // [END array_contains_filter]\r\n    \r\n      westCoastCities.get()\r\n        .then(res =&gt; {\r\n          console.log(&#39;West Coast get: &#39;, res);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n**Reference [Documentation][1]**\r\n\r\n[1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#array_membership\r\n[2]: https://github.com/firebase/snippets-node/blob/d769695bd1159103e7c877849ccaccab3db37039/firestore/main/index.js#L681-L682","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415123/firestore-query-array-contains-pass-in-array/58415314#58415314","title":"Firestore query &#39;array_contains&#39; pass in array"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571299335,"post_id":58415315,"comment_id":103196545,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415123/firestore-query-array-contains-pass-in-array/58415315#comment103196545_58415315"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571234804,"creation_date":1571234804,"answer_id":58415315,"question_id":58415123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415315","body_markdown":"According to the official documentation regarding [query operators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#query_operators):\r\n\r\n&gt; You can use the array-contains operator to filter based on array values.\r\n\r\nAs I can see in your code, your `friendIds` argument that is passed as the third parameter to the `where()` function is of type `array`.

So `r[12]` gives something like: `sip:+441498738722`.\r\nWhen the 2nd column is `FW`, you are interested by the 14th column. So, `r[13]` gives something like: `sip:+442086081330@example.com`.\r\n\r\nYour filter is: `FILTER = [&#39;sip:+420&#39;, &#39;sip:+34&#39;, &#39;sip:+44149&#39;]`. It contains 3 items. The length of the 1st item is **8**.\r\nThe length of the 2nd item is **7** and the length of the last item is **10**.\r\n\r\nSo to know if the `r[12]` (`sip:+441498738722`) or `r[13]` (`sip:+442086081330@example.com`) elements are in the `FILTER`,\r\nyou have to take the first 8, 7 and 10 characters and test **if one of them (at least)** is in the `FILTER`.\r\n\r\n    if (r[12][:8] in FILTER) or (r[12][:7] in FILTER) or (r[12][:10] in FILTER):\r\n        # code\r\n\r\n**For example:** `r[12]` is `sip:+441498738722`. So the first 8 characters are `r[12][:8]` which is `sip:+441`. The first 7\r\ncharacters are `r[12][:7]` which is `sip:+44`. The first 10 characters are `r[12][:10]` which is `sip:+44149`. Now, you can\r\nsee that for this `r[12]` (`sip:+441498738722`), only `r[12][:10]` (`sip:+44149`) is in the `FILTER` variable. So, you can\r\nadd this `row` to the `result` list.\r\n\r\nIt is the same logic, when the 2nd column of the `row` is `FW`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415096/python-if-else-condition-on-printing-lines/58416094#58416094","title":"Python: If..else.. condition on printing lines"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11999777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/474e5823ac34c689a6966d32d200d19a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Maria","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11999777/maria"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11999777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/474e5823ac34c689a6966d32d200d19a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Maria","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11999777/maria"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":102,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58416094,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571497812,"creation_date":1571234187,"last_edit_date":1571314766,"question_id":58415096,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415096","body_markdown":"I have code to search 13th column to be matched if field-2 of the line is &quot;IT&quot;, and 14th column to be matched if field-2 of the line is &quot;FW&quot;.

For instance, it could just be the output of Pi at one particular location. Generally, you&#39;ll have to trust the FIPS or Common Criteria certification of the platform, but note that neither one is airtight.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can also rely on the fact that HSM companies want to make money. One way certain to lose (all) marketshare is to show that you cannot be trusted. Multiple companies, including RSA Labs, already found this out to their detriment. If you don&#39;t fully trust a HSM company, then don&#39;t buy anything off of them; but note that there is no such thing as *perfect security* in a practical sense.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to do some simple experiments. If you ask for signature generation using the same data then you should never get the same signature (r and s values for ECDSA). This shows that the output of the RNG at least doesn&#39;t repeat. Testing this - once - with several connections / sessions might be a good idea.\r\n\r\nYou could also verify and then concatenate all the resulting x values (used for the final comparison) and then run a randomness test (such as the diehard suite) over it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, if you don&#39;t trust the entropy source of the HSM&#39;s RNG, note that you can add additional seeds to a HSM. Please check the documentation of your HSM how it reacts to adding / mixing seeds.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432158/how-to-validate-the-randomness-of-ecdsa-signature-generated-using-hsm/58432450#58432450","title":"How to validate the randomness of ECDSA signature generated using HSM?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":80649,"user_id":387076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFyP6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gilles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/387076/gilles"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571381710,"post_id":58445133,"comment_id":103229392,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432158/how-to-validate-the-randomness-of-ecdsa-signature-generated-using-hsm/58445133#comment103229392_58445133"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":340,"user_id":12056564,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ec003d02adbcf6a3065097f6f29fa29?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12056564/gerd"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571380236,"creation_date":1571380236,"answer_id":58445133,"question_id":58432158,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58445133","body_markdown":"[This article][1] gives an overview of methods for checking the randomness of some given data:\r\n\r\n&gt; There are many practical measures of randomness for a binary sequence.\r\n&gt; These include measures based on statistical tests, transforms, and\r\n&gt; complexity or a mixture of these.

Here my code:\r\n\r\n        func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {\r\n        if section == 0 {\r\n            if self.userAdressDict[0].isExpanded == true {\r\n                return 0\r\n            }\r\n            if self.userAdressDict[0].isExpanded == false {\r\n                return self.userAdressDict.count\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        if section == 1 {\r\n            return self.userAdressDictForTeslim.count\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n        return 1\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere my header view code:\r\n\r\n        func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, viewForHeaderInSection section: Int) -&gt; UIView? {\r\n        if section == 0 {\r\n            let button = UIButton(type: .system)\r\n            button.setTitle(&quot;Kapat&quot;, for: .normal)\r\n            button.setTitleColor(.black, for: .normal)\r\n            button.backgroundColor = .lightGray\r\n            button.titleLabel!.font = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 14)\r\n            button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleExpandCloseForAlim(sender:)), for: .touchUpInside)\r\n            return button\r\n        }\r\n        if section == 1 {\r\n            let button = UIButton(type: .system)\r\n            button.setTitle(&quot;Kapat&quot;, for: .normal)\r\n            button.setTitleColor(.black, for: .normal)\r\n            button.backgroundColor = .lightGray\r\n            button.titleLabel!.font = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 14)\r\n            button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleExpandCloseForTeslim), for: .touchUpInside)\r\n            return button\r\n        }\r\n        else{\r\n            return nil\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here button action function:\r\n\r\n    @objc func handleExpandCloseForAlim(sender: UIButton) {\r\n        var indexPaths = [IndexPath]()\r\n        for row in self.userAdressDict.indices{\r\n            print(0 , row)\r\n            let indexPath = IndexPath(row: row, section: 0)\r\n            indexPaths.append(indexPath)\r\n        }\r\n        let indexPath = IndexPath(row: (sender.tag), section: 0)\r\n        let adresso = self.userAdressDict[indexPath.row]\r\n        if adresso.isExpanded == true {\r\n            tableView.deleteRows(at: indexPaths , with: .fade)\r\n        }\r\n        if adresso.isExpanded == false {\r\n            tableView.insertRows(at: indexPaths, with: .fade)\r\n        }\r\n        //self.userAdressDict.removeAll()\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nI can make delete process with removeAll() code. But I want to insert rows also so this way not correct way to do that. (userAdressDict is my model which hold datas). In handleExpandCloseForAlim function&#39;s sender for reach isExpanded variable. I have problem about numberOfRowsInSection part lastly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415045/how-can-i-reach-sender-at-numberofrowinsection-function","title":"How can I reach sender at numberOfRowInSection function?"},{"tags":["powershell"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":884,"user_id":3963478,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d3a6e35e2040331ea94ee194b2017b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3963478/patrick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571234333,"post_id":58415043,"comment_id":103173024,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415043/get-childitem-with-multiple-paths-via-variable#comment103173024_58415043"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":304,"user_id":5553142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207237363599963/picture?type=large","display_name":"Eric Weintraub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5553142/eric-weintraub"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571425134,"post_id":58415139,"comment_id":103250578,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415043/get-childitem-with-multiple-paths-via-variable/58415139#comment103250578_58415139"},{"owner":{"reputation":162101,"user_id":45375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39f6e2dc52425b1e08027c01bb880be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mklement0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/45375/mklement0"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":304,"user_id":5553142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207237363599963/picture?type=large","display_name":"Eric Weintraub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5553142/eric-weintraub"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571426026,"post_id":58415139,"comment_id":103250908,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415043/get-childitem-with-multiple-paths-via-variable/58415139#comment103250908_58415139"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":162101,"user_id":45375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39f6e2dc52425b1e08027c01bb880be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mklement0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/45375/mklement0"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162101,"user_id":45375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39f6e2dc52425b1e08027c01bb880be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mklement0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/45375/mklement0"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":true,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1571242144,"last_edit_date":1571242144,"creation_date":1571234332,"answer_id":58415139,"question_id":58415043,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58415139","body_markdown":"Yes, `$LogsToGather` must be an _array_ of strings for your command to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$LogsToGather = &#39;c:\\windows\\temp\\*.log&#39;, &#39;c:\\temp\\*.log&#39;, &#39;C:\\programdata\\Microsoft\\IntuneManagementExtension\\Logs\\*.log&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how the array elements, separated by `,`, must be quoted _individually_ (see bottom section).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`Get-Help` with `-Parameter` is a quick way to examine the data type a given parameter expects:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Parameter Path\r\n\r\n-Path &lt;String[]&gt;\r\n    Specifies a path to one or more locations.

But when the earlier member returns, neither of them see each other in the viewAccepted function, and they run in effectively independent groups (bad).  This non-grouping behavior can be random.  For example, I restarted one host this morning after I had disconnected it at 5pm yesterday, and neither saw the other in the group.  However, once I stopped both of them and restarted, they found each other in the group.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate use of JGroups is to cluster two Tomcat hosts running the same application such that the first host listed in the cluster runs reports while the second waits for the first to die, then takes the first host&#39;s place and runs reports.  When the first host is returned to service, it becomes the second in the cluster membership list, and waits for the other to die.  Right now the application&#39;s behavior echoes that of the test program, below. \r\n\r\nUsing JGroups jgroups-4.1.6.Final.jar out of the box with no custom udp.xml file and no arguments to new JChannel().  I have a test app that runs on two RHEL 7 hosts to get them to cluster.

The admin also said that there are no restrictions or configurations that would inhibit UDP traffic.\r\n\r\nThings I&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n- Increasing the send and receive buffer sizes for Multicast, as per [this][1] solution.  I now get no warning messages on startup due to inadequate buffer size.\r\n- Updating JGroups version to latest.\r\n- Waiting overnight to try to start a stopped host.\r\n\r\nThings I don&#39;t want to try:\r\n\r\n- Using TCP, since the cluster membership is fluid (it can be any two hosts) and I would rather not update a configuration file whenever the host changes.\r\n\r\nI am open to alternate solutions in case I can&#39;t get JGroups to work reliably.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

In your case you would use it as `Chart1.ChartAreas(&quot;Default&quot;).AxisX.Minimum = SomeValue`\r\nNote that when you set the minimum in this way the axis will stop automatically rescaling.\r\n\r\nIf you want the minimum to always be zero when all x-values are positive, have a look at [Axis.IsStartedFromZero](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.datavisualization.charting.axis.isstartedfromzero?view=netframework-4.8)\r\n\r\nI hope i understood your question correctly because you mention intervals, but seem to be talking about the minimum value of your x axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a further comment on your code unrelated to the question; it is unnecessary and inefficient to remove the `ChartArea` every time you want to update the graph, same goes for the `Series`. Doing this will result in having to re-format the chart on every update (like you are in fact doing with the series).\r\n\r\nIt suffices to call `YourSeries.Points.Clear()` and to then add the new points. This way you don&#39;t have to re-specify the series color and chartype on each update.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nI also see that you round the x position to one decimal, presumably to prevent the x-axis from having long ugly numbers on it. However, a better way to do this is to specify a [format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.datavisualization.charting.labelstyle?view=netframework-4.8) for the axis:\r\n\r\n`chart1.ChartAreas.FirstOrDefault.AxisX.LabelStyle.Format = &quot;{0:0.0}&quot;` in your case.  This way your series will still store the exact value, but only one decimal will be displayed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58415028/visual-basic-making-a-line-chart/58448615#58448615","title":"Visual Basic - Making a Line Chart"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12095321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2kH_HCxcVls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfQGTnxUhGgWb84Pr7KH8vb2L77lQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Callum Bland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095321/callum-bland"},"last_editor":{"reputation":42649,"user_id":5090771,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EOZG.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"WhiteHat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5090771/whitehat"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58448615,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571396174,"creation_date":1571234008,"last_edit_date":1571311040,"question_id":58415028,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58415028","body_markdown":"This is my first post on stackoverflow so sorry in advance for anything I may have messed up, but for a project I am doing a simulator for projectile motion.

need to save my array with UserDefaults because I want users have ability to add or delete rows them selves. I have a plist contains rows of dictionaries.

(filled with data of rows and works fine). my problem is how to save this array in UserDefaults , as it is an array of dictionaries seems it is a little complicated. I did this like the codes in bottom but it throws a thread in app delegate. \r\n\r\nI added this line in viewdidload to call save function \r\n\r\n    savePlaces()\r\n\r\nand then here is my savePlaces function \r\n\r\n     func savePlaces(){\r\n        \r\n        do\r\n        {\r\n            let placesData = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: countries, requiringSecureCoding: false)\r\n        UserDefaults.standard.set(placesData, forKey: &quot;places&quot;)\r\n        print(&quot;Here is save function&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n        catch\r\n        {\r\n        print(&quot;SaveError&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt seems that problem is because of  `countries` array which it is an array of dictionaries coming from plist, because when I change this line \r\n\r\n    let placesData = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: countries, requiringSecureCoding: false)\r\n\r\nto this \r\n\r\n    let placesData = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: imageList, requiringSecureCoding: false)\r\n\r\nI mean I changed the countries to the imageList which is an array of strings , it works fine. I defined image list in first line \r\n\r\n     var imageList = [&quot;usaflag&quot;,&quot;gerflag&quot;,&quot;franceflag&quot;,&quot;jpflag&quot;,&quot;gerflag&quot;]\r\n\r\nso the problem is

currently practicing Vue with Vuex and the REST API architecture (with Django). I wanna retrieve the data from by database and store the data in my global state in order to access it throughout my Vue components. It works fine so far but there is one weird thing I do not understand.\r\n\r\nWhen I start my application I have the homepage where currently nothing is displayed. I click on the menu item &quot;Contacts&quot; and the contacts component loads (router-view) (API GET call is executed) and displays the table of all the created contacts and shows it properly (source of truth is now my global state). I can edit, delete and view a contact.The contacts are now stored in the global state as well.\r\n\r\n**The problem:** Everytime I load the contact component the mounted() lifecycle gets called (which makes sense) and loads the contacts from the API inside the state so the whole lists gets dupblicated over and over. I just want Vue to make a GET request only once and then access the state&#39;s data (where to contacts are stored now).\r\n\r\nAnother scenario is when I update a contact and click back to the contacts menu item the list contains the old contact and the updated one but when I refresh the page it is fine.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**MY CODE**\r\n\r\n**state.js**\r\n\r\n    import Vue from &quot;vue&quot;;\r\n    import Vuex from &quot;vuex&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    Vue.use(Vuex);\r\n    \r\n    import { apiService } from &quot;../utils/api.service.js&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    export const store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n      state: {\r\n        contacts: []\r\n      },\r\n      mutations: {\r\n        initContacts_MU: (state, data) =&gt;

Tkinter I would like to create some frames in main window and then position elements relatively to these frames.\r\n\r\nI created some frames and then some elements thet should be relative to frames, but they are positioned relatively to main window (root).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tkinter\r\n\r\nroot = tkinter.Tk()\r\nroot.title(&#39;Positioning&#39;)\r\nroot.geometry(&#39;{}x{}&#39;.format(800, 600))\r\n\r\nframe1 = tkinter.Frame(root, bg=&#39;cyan&#39;).place(x=0, y=0, width=800, height=200)\r\nframe2 = tkinter.Frame(root, bg=&#39;blue&#39;).place(x=0, y=200, width=800, height=200)\r\nframe3 = tkinter.Frame(root, bg=&#39;green&#39;).place(x=0, y=400, width=800, height=200)\r\n\r\nlabel1 = tkinter.Label(frame1, text=&quot;1st label&quot;).place(relx=0.25, rely=0)\r\nlabel2 = tkinter.Label(frame2, text=&quot;2nd label&quot;).place(relx=0.5, rely=0)\r\nlabel3 = tkinter.Label(frame3, text=&quot;3rd label&quot;).place(relx=0.75, rely=0)\r\n\r\nroot.mainloop()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e. label2 should in my opinion be positioned at the top of frame2, so its vertical position against the window should be 200. But it comes at the top of the root object, so the vertical position is 0 (all three labels are vertically aligned). Is there any way to make the labels to be positioned relatively to the particular frames?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58414997/tkinter-position-relative-to-parent","title":"Tkinter -
