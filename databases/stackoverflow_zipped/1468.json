It is composed of several class library dll files. \r\n\r\nThe host application that the AddIn is launched from is found in a completely different folder on the hard drive. Not a parent nor subdirectory. And this is by the host application&#39;s &quot;AddIn&quot; design schema. I cannot do anything about this.\r\n\r\nI am trying to use CefSharp for users to login with. However, it appears that CefSharp is looking for the dependency redistributable files based on the executable&#39;s location at runtime.\r\n\r\nThat is not where the dependency files are going to be. And I do not have the option to place them there, since I believe the host application is using CefSharp to its own degree, using different versions of those same dependency files.\r\n\r\nI know that CefSettings can be set to guide locales to other directories. Is there any way to do the same thing for libcef.dll and company?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried Fody Costura to combine the dependencies into my own, hoping that CefSharp would see the dependencies at runtime, but all I&#39;m getting, consistently, is \r\n\r\n&quot;Could not load file or assembly &#39;CefSharp, Version=75.1.142.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=40c4b6fc221f4138&#39; or one of its dependencies.

It&#39;s a lot to look through but I&#39;m noticing that it is attempting to find a file at &quot;en/CefSharp.Wpf.Resources.dll&quot; in several locations. I think this is probably just noise.\r\n\r\nAlso, I suspect this whole project will be moving to .NET Core as the GUI options open up with .Net Core 3.0, so if there is a .Net Core direction that would be more future proof to adopt for a simple login-and-leave, please let me know.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192886/using-cefsharp-wpf-when-access-to-exe-directory-and-subdirectories-is-unavaila","title":"Using CefSharp Wpf When Access to Exe Directory (And Subdirectories) is Unavailable"},{"tags":["python","plotly-dash"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11860812,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2315947751808012/picture?type=large","display_name":"Lucas Dresl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11860812/lucas-dresl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569974659,"post_id":58192948,"comment_id":102766427,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192885/not-being-possible-to-open-local-host-with-dash/58192948#comment102766427_58192948"},{"owner":{"reputation":8749,"user_id":2947378,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c054121445db13838d0fbd895f53dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rdas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2947378/rdas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11860812,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2315947751808012/picture?type=large","display_name":"Lucas Dresl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11860812/lucas-dresl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570006957,"post_id":58192948,"comment_id":102774895,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192885/not-being-possible-to-open-local-host-with-dash/58192948#comment102774895_58192948"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8749,"user_id":2947378,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c054121445db13838d0fbd895f53dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rdas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2947378/rdas"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569968194,"creation_date":1569968194,"answer_id":58192948,"question_id":58192885,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58192948","body_markdown":"The default port for Dash server is 8050.

The server side code is printing 1 to 100 documents to several printers and creating some zip files to return to the browser in the same post.  What I have found is that if the $.ajax post takes more that 5 minutes the call gets a 401 unauthorized error and the call posts again.  I believe it is the browser re-posting the call because I can see the 401 unauthorized error and then see the call post again.  Is there a setting I can change to stop this behavior?   I obviously need to rework the server side to deal with the large volume of work to be done but in the mean time I am wondering if there is some setting or timeout I can change to lengthen the time for the ajax call to finish. Because of the re-post all the documents to print and zip all printed and zipped twice for the larger jobs.

I don&#39;t understand where a list comes in; as Yawar points out, try and solve this for rounding a single real, and then apply that recursively (using `map`) to a list of reals.\r\n\r\nSo a function\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun roundN (x, n) = ...\r\n\r\nfun roundManyN (xs, n) = map (fn x =&gt; roundN (x, n)) xs\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart by making some examples and encode them as tests. Since you [can&#39;t compare real for equality](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41394992/why-cant-i-compare-reals-in-standard-ml) in those tests, start by making (or copying) a custom equality operator.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun nearlyEqual (a, b, eps) =\r\n    let val absA = Real.abs a\r\n        val absB = Real.abs b\r\n        val diff = Real.abs (a - b)\r\n    in Real.== (a, b) orelse\r\n     ( if Real.== (a, 0.0) orelse\r\n          Real.== (b, 0.0) orelse\r\n          diff &lt; Real.minNormalPos\r\n       then diff &lt; eps * Real.minNormalPos\r\n       else diff / Real.min (absA + absB, Real.maxFinite) &lt; eps )\r\n    end\r\n\r\nval test_roundN_1 =\r\n  let val got = roundN (3.14159, 1)\r\n      val expected = 3.1\r\n  in nearlyEqual (got, expected, 0.1) end\r\n\r\nval test_roundN_2 =\r\n  let val got = roundN (3.14159, 2)\r\n      val expected = 3.14\r\n  in nearlyEqual (got, expected, 0.01) end\r\n\r\n(* rounding point *)\r\nval test_roundN_3 =\r\n  let val got = roundN (3.14159, 3)\r\n      val expected = 3.142\r\n  in nearlyEqual (got, expected, 0.001) end\r\n\r\n(* rounding point *)\r\nval test_roundN_4 =\r\n  let val got = roundN (3.14159, 4)\r\n      val expected = 3.1416\r\n  in nearlyEqual (got, expected, 0.0001) end\r\n\r\nval test_roundN_5 =\r\n  let val got = roundN (3.14159, 5)\r\n      val expected = 3.14159\r\n  in nearlyEqual (got, expected, 0.00001) end\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou also have some edge cases that you eventually want to deal with:\r\n\r\n - When `n` is zero or negative, or when `n` is greater than the number of digits in the fraction.\r\n - When `x` is close to a rounding point, e.g. `roundN (3.1451, 2)` ~&gt; `3.15`.\r\n - When `x&#183;10ⁿ` has a magnitude that exceeds the size of an int.\r\n - When `n` is so large that a magnitude change may affect the precision of a real.\r\n\r\nFor a better testing library, check out testlib.sml (and its use in test.sml) in [this exercism exercise](https://github.com/exercism/sml/tree/master/exercises/leap).\r\n\r\nExtracting your second solution into a function, and giving `Math.pow (10.0, real n)` a temporary binding, you get the solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun roundN (x, n) =\r\n    let val m = Math.pow(10.0, real n)\r\n    in real (round (x * m)) / m end\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; this solution will give me an uncaught exception overflow\r\n\r\nOn what input, I might ask.\r\n\r\nOne source could be that `round : real -&gt; int` is a partial function: There are real values that cannot be expressed as int, such as `Real.posInf`, `Real.negInf`,  `1e10` (on 32-bit SML) and `1e19` (on 64-bit SML). To avoid this, consider using `Real.realRound : real -&gt; real` to avoid the int conversion.\r\n\r\nOne way to avoid errors related to `x * Math.pow(10.0, real n)` causing imprecision because the number grows too big, could be to strip the integer part before multiplying, and adding the integer part back after dividing.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192815/how-to-round-up-a-real-number-to-nth-decimal-in-sml/58215153#58215153","title":"How to round up a real number to nth decimal in

to SML, trying to round up a real number to nth decimal, by declaring a function round(n,L), where L is a list of real numbers and n decide the nth decimal that can round up to. \r\n\r\nMy approach is to convert the real number to a string first, and then get the substring to the nth decimal and then parse the substring back to real number, this works fine if I only want to get the real number to nth decimal, but if I have a number like 0.3456 which I want to round to 0.35, my method won&#39;t really achieve that.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun rd(_,[]) = []\r\n|rd(a:int, x::y:real list) =\r\nif

writing some units tests and need to mock a named export from a file, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work when the export is a function that returns a promise.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a module located at `lib/api.js` that exports a single function called `getFoo`, which itself returns axios.get(&#39;/foo&#39;).\r\n\r\nIn my tests, I want to mock the return value of `getFoo` to be a resolved promise with the foo payload, so I mock using a module factory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport * as api from &#39;lib/api&#39;;\r\njest.mock(&#39;lib/api&#39;, () =&gt; ({\r\n  getFoo: jest.fn(() =&gt; Promise.resolve(&#39;foo&#39;)),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in my test I want to assert that getFoo was called as part of larger process of chained promises.\r\n\r\n```\r\nit(&#39;getBar should call getFoo&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n  return getBar().then(() =&gt; {\r\n    expect(api.getFoo).toHaveBeenCalled();\r\n  });\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error I get here is `cannot read property &#39;then&#39; of undefined`, as though the jest function used in the mocked module factory is not returning the promise.\r\n\r\nIf the return value for `getFoo` is not a promise, it works as expected. If I use `jest.fn()` as the value for getFoo, and then in the test itself mock the implementation...\r\n\r\n```\r\nit(&#39;getBar should call getFoo&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n  api.getFoo.mockImplementation(() =&gt; Promise.resolve(&quot;foo&quot;));\r\n  return getBar().then(() =&gt; {\r\n    expect(api.getFoo).toHaveBeenCalled();\r\n  });\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then it works. My understanding is that the jest.fn(() =&gt; {}) should just be a shorter way of defining the implementation, so I am not sure why I am getting the error. Any help appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n\r\nThe `lib/api` looks like this...\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport axios from &#39;axios&#39;;\r\n\r\nexport const getFoo = (host: string, accessToken: string): Promise&lt;{}&gt; =&gt;\r\n  axios.get(`${host}/foo`, {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,\r\n      &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;,\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n  // return foo\r\n  .then((response) =&gt; response.data)\r\n  .catch(() =&gt; {\r\n    throw new Error(&#39;Failed to load foo&#39;);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I console log the mocked `getFoo` function while the test is running, it shows up as...\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetFoo function mockConstructor() {\r\n  return fn.apply(this, arguments);                                                                         }\r\n ```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192814/mocking-a-promise-in-jest-mock-module-factory","title":"mocking a promise in jest mock module factory"},{"tags":["swift","core-audio"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":63236,"user_id":341750,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JgAmt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"hotpaw2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/341750/hotpaw2"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569977355,"creation_date":1569977355,"answer_id":58193930,"question_id":58192813,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58193930","body_markdown":"Your ABSD has mFormatFlags == 41 .\r\n\r\nif (mFormatFlags &amp; 32) != 0 , that means the format includes the kAudioFormatFlagIsNonInterleaved bit.\r\n\r\nA non-interleaved format only returns one channel of data per frame, not 2.\r\nInstead you get multiple buffers, each buffer with only one channel per frame, or 4 bytes (for Float32 format), not 8.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192813/understanding-audiostreambasicdescription/58193930#58193930","title":"Understanding AudioStreamBasicDescription"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12150836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fd96116bd6f38bc1a610f85cdf9fe42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"miks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12150836/miks"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58193930,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569977355,"creation_date":1569967263,"question_id":58192813,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58192813","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to understand the AudioStreamBasicDescription results.

You don&#39;t have to worry about `Handlers`, or even `Intents` (once the client is bound).\r\n\r\nReferring to the example at the given link: You can simply add functionality on to the `LocalService` object, e.g., \r\n\r\n    /** method for clients */\r\n    public int getRandomNumber() {\r\n      return mGenerator.nextInt(100);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private Set&lt;MyEventListener&gt; mListeners = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    /** A MyEventListener (your Activity, Fragment, etc.) calls this in its\r\n     * onServiceConnected() method, on the reference it gets from getService(). */\r\n    public void registerListener(MyEventListener listener)\r\n    {\r\n        mListeners.add(listener);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void sendEvent()\r\n    {\r\n        for(MyEventListener listener : mListeners)\r\n        {\r\n             listener.onEvent();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n...and so forth. All methods execute synchronously, on the UI thread. All objects (`Services` and clients (`MyEventListener`)) are guaranteed to have a lifetime at least as long as the `ServiceConnection`. Also, the `ServiceConnection` will not experience an `onServiceDisconnected()` call until you explicitly unbind, since you&#39;re using an in-process service.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192793/android-communicating-from-service-to-clients/58194061#58194061","title":"Android communicating from Service to Clients"}],"owner":{"reputation":279,"user_id":3838233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100005877673471/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sofia Clover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838233/sofia-clover"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58194061,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569980731,"creation_date":1569967141,"question_id":58192793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58192793","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to keep a reference to each client that binds to a started &amp; bound Android service.

Perhaps line and/or column delimiters are off in either the problem or &quot;good&quot; partition files (293 lines seems to be too low for ~80 Mb file).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192791/spark-task-hanging-at-gc-allocation-failure/58193305#58193305","title":"Spark task hanging at [GC (Allocation Failure) ]"}],"owner":{"reputation":1156,"user_id":7082628,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/001b3b26760ae03253305b8948994ce7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NateH06","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7082628/nateh06"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1156,"user_id":7082628,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/001b3b26760ae03253305b8948994ce7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NateH06","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7082628/nateh06"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58193305,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570576619,"creation_date":1569967125,"last_edit_date":1570576619,"question_id":58192791,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58192791","body_markdown":"**EDIT:** Note: An executor will normally emit the message `[GC (Allocation Failure) ]` . It runs it because it is trying to allocate memory to the Executor, but the executor is full, so it will GC in attempt to make space when loading something new to the Executor. If your Executor does this in a loop, it may mean what you are trying to load into that Executor is too big.\r\n\r\nI am running Spark 2.2, Scala 2.11 on AWS EMR 5.8.0\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to run a `count` operation on a Dataset that refuses to finish. What&#39;s frustrating, is that it is only hanging on one particular file. I run this job on a different file from S3, no problem - it finishes completely. The original CSV file is @18GB itself, and we run a transformation on it to turn the original CSV into a struct column, giving it one extra column.\r\n\r\nMy environment&#39;s core slaves are 8 instance where each is:\r\n\r\n    r3.2xlarge\r\n    16 vCore, 61 GiB memory, 160 SSD GB storage\r\n\r\nMy Spark session settings are:\r\n\r\n    implicit val spark = SparkSession\r\n          .builder()\r\n          .appName(&quot;MyApp&quot;)\r\n          .master(&quot;yarn&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.speculation&quot;,&quot;false&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;hive.metastore.uris&quot;, s&quot;thrift://$hadoopIP:9083&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;hive.exec.dynamic.partition&quot;, &quot;true&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode&quot;, &quot;nonstrict&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version&quot;, &quot;2&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled&quot;, false)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.executor.cores&quot;, 5)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.executors.memory&quot;, &quot;18G&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead&quot;, &quot;2G&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.driver.memory&quot;, &quot;18G&quot;)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.executor.instances&quot;, 23)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.default.parallelism&quot;, 230)\r\n          .config(&quot;spark.sql.shuffle.partitions&quot;, 230)\r\n          .enableHiveSupport()\r\n          .getOrCreate()\r\n\r\nThe data comes from a CSV file: \r\n\r\n    val ds = spark.read\r\n              .option(&quot;header&quot;, &quot;true&quot;)\r\n              .option(&quot;delimiter&quot;, &quot;,&quot;)\r\n              .schema(/* 2 cols: [ValidatedNel, and a stuct schema */)\r\n              .csv(sourceFromS3)\r\n              .as(MyCaseClass)\r\n\r\n    val mappedDs:Dataset[ValidatedNel, MyCaseClass] = ds.map(...)\r\n\r\n    mappedDs.repartition(230)\r\n\r\n    val count = mappedDs.count() // never finishes\r\n\r\n\r\nAs expected, it spins up 230 tasks, and 229 finish, except one somewhere in the middle.

However the mask has a thick black stroke around it.  Black in a mask makes things transparent.  The rest of the mask is white, which stays visible.\r\n\r\nYou can alter the amount of the shape reduction by changing the `stroke-width` value in the `.reduce-amount` class.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of this method are:\r\n1. you need a mask for every different path shape\r\n2. you can&#39;t set the stroke style of the reduced size shape.  However you could simulate a stroke colour by overlaying two paths with different reduction amounts.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192760/svg-reduced-path-with-fill-pattern/58193711#58193711","title":"SVG reduced path with fill pattern"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21683,"user_id":271353,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdjXN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael Mullany","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/271353/michael-mullany"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21683,"user_id":271353,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdjXN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael Mullany","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/271353/michael-mullany"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570386048,"last_edit_date":1570386048,"creation_date":1570041103,"answer_id":58207383,"question_id":58192760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58207383","body_markdown":"You can extend the filter to make this work.

Please note that this is an expected\r\n&gt; behavior.  In general, Aurora Serverless works differently than\r\n&gt; Provisioned Aurora , In Aurora Serverless, while the cluster is\r\n&gt; &quot;dormant&quot; it has no compute resources assigned to it and when a db.\r\n&gt; connection is received, Compute resources are assigned. Because of\r\n&gt; this behavior, you will have to &quot;wake up&quot; the clusters and it may take\r\n&gt; a few minutes for the first connection to succeed as you have seen.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In order to avoid that you may consider increasing the timeout on the\r\n&gt; client side. Also, if you have enabled Pause, you may consider\r\n&gt; disabling it [2]. After disabling Pause, you can also adjust the\r\n&gt; minimum Aurora capacity unit to higher value to make sure that your\r\n&gt; Cluster always having enough computing resource to serve the new\r\n&gt; connections [3]. Please note that adjusting the minimum ACU might\r\n&gt; increase the cost of service [4].\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Also note that Aurora Serverless is only recommend for certain\r\n&gt; workloads [5]. If your workload is highly predictable and your\r\n&gt; application needs to access the DB on a regular basis, I would\r\n&gt; recommend you use Provisioned Aurora cluster/instance to insure high\r\n&gt; availability of your business.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] How Aurora Serverless Works - Automatic Pause and Resume for Aurora Serverless - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.pause-resume\r\n\r\n[3] Setting the Capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB Cluster - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.setting-capacity.html\r\n\r\n[4] Aurora Serverless Price https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/\r\n\r\n[5] Using Amazon Aurora Serverless - Use Cases for Aurora Serverless - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html#aurora-serverless.use-cases","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192747/aws-aurora-serverless-communication-link-failure/58332476#58332476","title":"AWS Aurora Serverless - Communication Link Failure"}],"owner":{"reputation":304,"user_id":6903322,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09ca033e2d207bde73ac4dc1359c3437?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"john","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6903322/john"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58332476,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570751346,"creation_date":1569966798,"question_id":58192747,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58192747","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using MySQL Aurora Serverless cluster (with the Data API enabled) in my python code and I am getting a `communications link failure` exception.

In that case, it might make sense to create a function on the the related model (whatever type `$record` is...) that returns that model&#39;s suppliers set. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic function getSuppliers()\r\n{\r\n  $suppliers = Supplier::active()-&gt;get();\r\n  $supplier = $this-&gt;supplier;\r\n\r\n  if (!$supplier-&gt;active) {\r\n    $suppliers-&gt;add($supplier);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return $suppliers;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192732/best-practice-laravel-controller-eloquent-merge/58192804#58192804","title":"Best Practice - Laravel Controller Eloquent merge"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":453,"user_id":7574023,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2VwF6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"boolfalse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7574023/boolfalse"},"last_editor":{"reputation":453,"user_id":7574023,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2VwF6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"boolfalse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7574023/boolfalse"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569969713,"last_edit_date":1569969713,"creation_date":1569969366,"answer_id":58193118,"question_id":58192732,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58193118","body_markdown":"I saw @Vince&#39;s answer about 1st question, and I&#39;m agree with him.\r\nAbout 2nd question:\r\n\r\nWrite scope in Supplier model like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;     public function scopeActive($query){\r\n&gt;         $query-&gt;where(&#39;active&#39;, 1); // for boolean type\r\n&gt;     }\r\n\r\nFor good practice, you need to write the logic parts in services like &quot;App\\Services\\SupplierService.php&quot;. And there write the function you want:\r\n\r\n&gt;     public function activeSuppliersWithCurrent($record) {\r\n&gt;         $suppliers = Supplier::active()-&gt;get();\r\n&gt;         $supplier = Supplier::find($record-&gt;supplier-&gt;id);\r\n&gt;         if (!$supplier-&gt;active) {\r\n&gt;             $suppliers-&gt;add($supplier);\r\n&gt;         }\r\n&gt;     }\r\n\r\nIn your SupplierController&#39;s constructor inject the instance of that service and use the function, for example:\r\n\r\n&gt;     use App\\Servives\\SupplierService;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     protected $supplierService = null;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     public function __construct(SupplierService $supplierService) {\r\n&gt;         $this-&gt;supplierService = $supplierService;\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     public function getActiveSuppliersWithCurrent(...) {\r\n&gt;        $result = $this-&gt;supplierService-&gt;activeSuppliersWithCurrent($record);\r\n&gt;     }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, later you will not need to change anything in controller. If you&#39;ll need to change for example the query of suppliers selection, you will just have to change something only in service. This way will make your code blocks separated and shorter.\r\nAlso the sense for this pattern: you don&#39;t need to access the models from controller. All logic related with models will implemented in services.\r\nFor other projects you can grab only services or only controllers, and implement another part differently. But in that case if you had all codes in controller, that will prevent you to grab the portions of necessary codes, cuz may you don&#39;t remember what doing each blocks...\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192732/best-practice-laravel-controller-eloquent-merge/58193118#58193118","title":"Best Practice - Laravel Controller Eloquent merge"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16067,"user_id":2109233,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f3Zle.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lagbox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2109233/lagbox"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16067,"user_id":2109233,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f3Zle.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lagbox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2109233/lagbox"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569992476,"last_edit_date":1569992476,"creation_date":1569992152,"answer_id":58195412,"question_id":58192732,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58195412","body_markdown":"You could add a `where` clause to the query to also find that id.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$suppliers = Supplier::active()-&gt;orWhere(&#39;id&#39;, $record-&gt;supplier-&gt;id)-&gt;get();\r\n```\r\nYou could potentially slide this into the `active` scope by passing the &#39;id&#39; as an argument.\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function scopeActive($query, $id = null)\r\n{\r\n    $query-&gt;where(&#39;active&#39;, true);\r\n\r\n    if ($id) {\r\n        $query-&gt;orWhere(&#39;id&#39;, $id);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSupplier::active($record-&gt;supplier-&gt;id)-&gt;get();\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr make another scope that does this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192732/best-practice-laravel-controller-eloquent-merge/58195412#58195412","title":"Best Practice - Laravel Controller Eloquent merge"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":7024046,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a46a1c13c99c33382921786e09fa4c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"GlenUK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7024046/glenuk"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46,"user_id":7024046,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a46a1c13c99c33382921786e09fa4c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"GlenUK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7024046/glenuk"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58192804,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570029228,"creation_date":1569966677,"last_edit_date":1570014898,"question_id":58192732,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58192732","body_markdown":"I have a scope on my Supplier model that returns results where `active = true`. \r\n\r\nThis works great when creating new entries, as I only want the user to see active suppliers.\r\n\r\nCurrent entries may have an inactive supplier; When I edit it, I want to see all active Suppliers, plus the current supplier (if it is inactive)\r\n\r\nI have this code in my controller:\r\n```php\r\n        $suppliers = Supplier::active()-&gt;get();\r\n        if (!$suppliers-&gt;contains(&#39;id&#39;, $record-&gt;supplier-&gt;id))\r\n        {\r\n            $suppliers-&gt;add(Supplier::find($record-&gt;supplier-&gt;id));\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo questions: Is this the correct way to do this?

In the not too distant future there will also a be an Ubuntu server and a dual boot Ubuntu/Windows desktop and possibly a Mac laptop.\r\n\r\nI have recently begun using Unison to keep up to date copies of the files on both of the laptops, as this allows me to make metadata changes on one machine and then push those updates to the other machine. If unison worked properly on Android, I&#39;d do the same with my phone. As it doesn&#39;t, I&#39;m going to figure out a way to get it to sync that folder, preferably through something lightweight like rsync. If I notice incorrect metadata on my phone I will have to make the changes on the laptops then percolate them down. C&#39;est la vie.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\n\r\nHowever, the most annoying thing that I cannot believe I haven&#39;t found a simple solution for on the googs is how to synchronize my playlists through the same process. For some absurd reason, it appears that while [someone took the time to add relative playlist functionality to clementine](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/pull/4489), which was [pushed to master in 2014](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/pull/4495), it is for reasons unknown not a feature in Clementine today.\r\n\r\nFollowing [sscirrus&#39;s reply to a related question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25676803/what-is-proper-way-to-specify-relative-path-to-file-in-m3u-playlists), I modified his/her answer to allow me to rewrite my absolute .m3u playlists in the default Playlist folder directly to my music folder as relative m3u files. This way, I can write a script to just go down the line and hit every playlist in turn (I have many and don&#39;t want to do them manually), then fire up unison, and voila. `declare name=&#39;excited_walking_mod&#39; ; cd ~/Playlists/ ; LC_ALL=C sed &#39;s+/media/zach/data/music/+../music/+g&#39; $name.m3u &gt; /media/zach/data/music/${name}_relative.m3u`  \r\n\r\nThis makes the problem &#39;solved&#39; in that I have a working solution. However, because Clementine has (as far as I can google) next to no relative playlist capability, I can play these playlists, but I cannot save any changes I make in Clementine as anything other than an absolute playlist. Thus, I&#39;d have to save the file, run my script again, and THEN call unison. While I could just add unison to my script and call it a day, I feel like I really cannot be the first person to have this issue and it has to be much simpler than I&#39;m making it out to be. More importantly, I&#39;d have to do some goofy nonsense with WSL on my windows machine to do the same thing from there, and getting modified playlists from my phone is a more or less manual affair.\r\n\r\nSurely there is a better solution than all this. Surely I&#39;m not the only one who wants to have the same playlists on all my different machines and doesn&#39;t want to have to jump through all these hoops to do it. Please help me.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want to have to download or use some fancy extraneous software if I can help it, as I think the likelihood of that software being kept up to date on Ubuntu, Android, AND Windows (and possibly mac) in perpetuity is slim at best. My plan is to in the future make a home Ubuntu samba server that will host my music folder and a few other shares. That way I can have a &#39;master&#39; folder accessible via the internet that I can unison to from wherever the hell I feel like.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192724/what-is-the-most-elegant-way-to-maintain-identical-playlists-with-clementine-on","title":"What is the most elegant way to maintain identical playlists with Clementine on different machines?"},{"tags":["istio"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2133,"user_id":147265,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/507934b473fbd5c371865b37497e3764?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Adam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/147265/adam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570029886,"post_id":58200024,"comment_id":102787365,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192721/set-static-response-from-istio-ingress-gateway/58200024#comment102787365_58200024"},{"owner":{"reputation":800,"user_id":11300382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--60p8TrZJ9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdVkvzIwx95HddIyzzIAh5M9eTXPg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MaggieO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11300382/maggieo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2133,"user_id":147265,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/507934b473fbd5c371865b37497e3764?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Adam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/147265/adam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570087829,"post_id":58200024,"comment_id":102805031,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192721/set-static-response-from-istio-ingress-gateway/58200024#comment102805031_58200024"},{"owner":{"reputation":800,"user_id":11300382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--60p8TrZJ9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdVkvzIwx95HddIyzzIAh5M9eTXPg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MaggieO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11300382/maggieo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2133,"user_id":147265,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/507934b473fbd5c371865b37497e3764?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Adam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/147265/adam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570088258,"post_id":58200024,"comment_id":102805229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192721/set-static-response-from-istio-ingress-gateway/58200024#comment102805229_58200024"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":800,"user_id":11300382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--60p8TrZJ9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdVkvzIwx95HddIyzzIAh5M9eTXPg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"MaggieO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11300382/maggieo"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570013573,"creation_date":1570013573,"answer_id":58200024,"question_id":58192721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58200024","body_markdown":"You have to do it manually by creating [VirtualService](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/v1alpha3/virtual-service/) to specific service connected to pod. \r\nOf course firstly you have to create pod and then attached service to it,\r\neven if your application will return single word. \r\n\r\nIstio Gateway’s are responsible for opening ports on relevant\r\nIstio gateway pods and receiving traffic for hosts.

found similar questions posted here but none which apply to row-defined time series data. I&#39;m anticipating the solution might be found via numpy or scipi. Because I have so much data, I&#39;d prefer not to use pandas dataframes. \r\n\r\nI have *many* runs of 19-channel EEG data stored in 2d numpy arrays. I&#39;ve gone through and marked noisy data as nan, so a given run might look something like:\r\n\r\n    C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6  C7  C8  C9  C10  C11  C12  C13  C14  C15  C16  C17  C18  C19\r\n    nan 7   5   4   nan nan 7   9   0   -3   nan  2    nan  nan  5    7    6    nan  8\r\n    0   6   7   3   5   9   2   2   4   6    8    7    5    6    4    -1   nan  -8   -9\r\n    6   8   7   7   0   3   2   4   5   1    3    7    3    8    4    6    9    0    0\r\n    ...\r\n    nan nan nan 3   5   -1  0   nan nan nan  1    2    0    -1   -2   nan  nan  nan  nan\r\n\r\n(without channel labels)\r\n\r\nEach run is between 80,000 and 120,000 rows (cycles) long.\r\n\r\nFor each of these runs, I want to create a new stack of contiguous non-overlapping epochs where no values were artifacted to nan. Something like:\r\n\r\n    def generate_contigs(run, length):\r\n       contigs = np.ndarray(three-dimensional array of arbitrary depth x 19 x length)\r\n       count = 0\r\n       for row in run:\r\n          if nan not in row:\r\n             count+=1\r\n             if count==length:\r\n                stack array of last (length) rows on contigs ndarray\r\n                count = 0\r\n          else:\r\n             count = 0\r\n       return(contigs)\r\n    \r\nSay, for example, that I specified length 4 (arbitrarily small), and that my function found 9 non-overlapping contigs where no value for 4 straight rows was nan.\r\n\r\nMy output should look something like:\r\n\r\n    contigs = [\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array],\r\n    [19x4 array]\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nWhere each element in the output stack resembles the following:  \r\n\r\n    [4 6 5 8 3 5 4 1 8 8 7 5 6 4 3 5 6 6 5]  \r\n    [5 5 7 2 2 9 8 7 7 8 3 0 7 4 4 6 3 7 3]  \r\n    [4 4 6 7 9 0 9 9 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3]  \r\n    [1 2 3 4 5 4 3 6 5 4 3 7 6 5 8 7 6 9 8]\r\n\r\nWhere the 4 rows contained in that element were found continuously in the original run&#39;s data array. \r\n\r\nI feel like I&#39;m pretty close here, but I&#39;m struggling with the row operations and minimizing iteration. Bonus points if you can find a way to attach the start/stop row indices as a tuple for later analysis.  \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192692/finding-fixed-length-contiguous-regions-of-an-nan-filled-array-no-overlap","title":"Finding fixed-length contiguous regions of an nan-filled array (no overlap)"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas","list","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":43145,"user_id":131930,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91536fe27d32713b8a154a0bf42f6748?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeremy Friesner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/131930/jeremy-friesner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569966670,"post_id":58192690,"comment_id":102764650,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192690/what-is-a-fast-way-to-check-whether-each-of-10m-strings-is-in-a-list-of-4000-oth#comment102764650_58192690"},{"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":9775974,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbe88816e28637fe6df584e16928c8a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kyle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9775974/kyle"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":43145,"user_id":131930,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91536fe27d32713b8a154a0bf42f6748?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeremy Friesner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/131930/jeremy-friesner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569977863,"post_id":58192690,"comment_id":102766942,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192690/what-is-a-fast-way-to-check-whether-each-of-10m-strings-is-in-a-list-of-4000-oth#comment102766942_58192690"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":9775974,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbe88816e28637fe6df584e16928c8a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kyle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9775974/kyle"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569966422,"creation_date":1569966422,"answer_id":58192691,"question_id":58192690,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58192691","body_markdown":"df.series.isin() proved a lot faster than a pandas apply.

Everything remains the same on the .NET side, but the `minMaxValidate()` function becomes this: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction minMaxValidate() {\r\n    $.validator.addMethod(&quot;maxTo&quot;, function (value, element, param) {\r\n        var $element = $(element), $min;\r\n\r\n        if (typeof (param) === &quot;string&quot;) {\r\n            $min = $(param);\r\n        } else {\r\n            $min = $(&quot;input[name=&#39;&quot; + $element.attr(&quot;data-val-min&quot;) + &quot;&#39;]&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (this.settings.onfocusout) {\r\n            $min.off(&quot;.validate-maxTo&quot;).on(&quot;blur.validate-maxTo&quot;, function () {\r\n                $element.valid();\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        return parseInt(value) &gt;= parseInt($min.val());\r\n    }, &quot;Max must not be less than min&quot;);\r\n\r\n    $(&quot;input[data-val-ismax]&quot;).each(function (i, ele) {\r\n        $(ele).rules(&#39;add&#39;, { maxTo: true });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    $.validator.addMethod(&quot;minTo&quot;, function (value, element, param) {\r\n        var $element = $(element), $max;\r\n\r\n        if (typeof (param) === &quot;string&quot;) {\r\n            $max = $(param);\r\n        } else {\r\n            $max = $(&quot;input[name=&#39;&quot; + $element.attr(&quot;data-val-max&quot;) + &quot;&#39;]&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (this.settings.onfocusout) {\r\n            $max.off(&quot;.validate-minTo&quot;).on(&quot;blur.validate-minTo&quot;, function () {\r\n                $element.valid();\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        return parseInt(value) &lt;= parseInt($max.val());\r\n    }, &quot;Min must not be greater than max&quot;);\r\n\r\n    $(&quot;input[data-val-ismin]&quot;).each(function (i, ele) {\r\n        $(ele).rules(&#39;add&#39;, { minTo: true });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis adds methods and rules for the normal jQuery validation to run itself.\r\n\r\nIt does exactly what I want.

However, after the error message shows up and the code exits, it disappears again. My guess is that .NET&#39;s default number input validation is taking over, and since the inputs are both valid numbers, it removes the error message.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to disable .NET&#39;s default validation on number type inputs so that I can handle it myself and not have external black box code messing with my stuff?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nHere are the view and Default.js files in their entirety, just in case.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@model Coils.CoilParts.Distributor\r\n@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers\r\n\r\n@{\r\n    ViewData[&quot;Title&quot;] = ViewData[&quot;ProgramName&quot;];\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Create&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Distributor&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;form asp-action=&quot;Create&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div asp-validation-summary=&quot;ModelOnly&quot;

The test framework is compiled in Visual Studio 2017 using mstest.\r\n\r\nThe problem that I am having is with tests that use a right-click to open a context menu, then select an element from the resulting menu. Locally, it works. It also works on our remote CI/CD machine. However, it does not work for the other two developers on the project, and we&#39;ve spent two business days fruitlessly trying to figure out why.\r\n\r\nWe have the same Windows version (Windows 10, version 1903), we have the same Visual Studio 2017 (we also tried it with 2019, no luck), we have the same monitor resolution (1920 x 1080), we are targeting the same .NET framework (4.72), we have the same WinAppDriver, etc.\r\n\r\nEverything else works just fine. But when the UI Test reaches that context menu, the test fails with the error &quot;An element could not be located on the page using the given search parameters.&quot;\r\n\r\nI used the WinAppDriver UI Recorder to find the XPath for the element. We also used it on the other user&#39;s machine and confirmed that, as far as the UI Recorder is concerned, the path is identical on both machines.\r\n\r\nThe specific call that fails:\r\n\r\n    Session.FindElementByXPath(&quot;/Pane[@ClassName=\\&quot;#32769\\&quot;][@Name=\\&quot;Desktop 1\\&quot;]/Menu[@ClassName=\\&quot;#32768\\&quot;][@Name=\\&quot;Context\\&quot;]/MenuItem[@Name=\\&quot;&quot; + itemName + &quot;\\&quot;]&quot;);\r\n\r\nThe WinAppDriver call on my machine (success):\r\n\r\n    {&quot;using&quot;:&quot;xpath&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;/Pane[@ClassName=\\&quot;#32769\\&quot;][@Name=\\&quot;Desktop 1\\&quot;]/Menu[@ClassName=\\&quot;#32768\\&quot;][@Name=\\&quot;Context\\&quot;]/MenuItem[@Name=\\&quot;New Location\\&quot;]&quot;}\r\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n    Content-Length: 125\r\n    Content-Type: application/json\r\n    \r\n    {&quot;sessionId&quot;:&quot;8970FDC1-E869-4304-A87D-D8F2CB711EA2&quot;,&quot;status&quot;:0,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;ELEMENT&quot;:&quot;42.856234.4.-2147483646.8140.18614751.1&quot;}}\r\n\r\nand the same call on the other user&#39;s machine (fail):\r\n\r\n    {&quot;using&quot;:&quot;xpath&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;/Pane[@ClassName=\\&quot;#32769\\&quot;][@Name=\\&quot;Desktop 1\\&quot;]/Menu[@ClassName=\\&quot;#32768\\&quot;][@Name=\\&quot;Context\\&quot;]/MenuItem[@Name=\\&quot;New Location\\&quot;]&quot;}\r\n    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n    Content-Length: 139\r\n    Content-Type: application/json\r\n    \r\n    {&quot;status&quot;:7,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;error&quot;:&quot;no such element&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;An element could not be located on the page using the given search parameters.&quot;}}\r\n\r\nAgain, everything else works. Other UI tests that *don&#39;t* use the right-click context menus work just fine. It&#39;s only this particular area that fails.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;ve tried so far:\r\n\r\n 1. Using Thread.Sleep to force a long wait before making the call\r\n 2. Wrapping the call with a DefaultWait and polling it over a period of several seconds to see if the element becomes available during that time.\r\n 3. When the &quot;An element could not be located&quot; is thrown, retry up to a set number of times to find the element.\r\n 4. Lots and lots of double-checking to make sure we&#39;re both on the same version of the code, same libraries, same nuget packages, etc.\r\n 5. Trying a much broader locator ( Session.FindElementByName(itemName); )\r\n\r\nThe biggest head-scratcher is that when we check with UI Recorder, the element is there. When we check on my machine or the remote build machine, WinAppDriver can find it normally.
