Why would the app want to read all passwords, and append it to the query we expect to see? There&#39;s a strong chance this is an attempt at hacking.\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n\r\n    SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM MyTable WHERE account_id = 1\r\n    OR account_id = 473\r\n\r\nIs this legitimate? Or is it illicit? Is the query executed for a user who _should_ have privileges to read data for account 473? How can you know? On the MySQL side, the query looks exactly the same whether it was the result of SQL injection or not.\r\n\r\nIt might have been code like the following PHP, which is vulnerable to SQL injection (this is not a failing of PHP, because similar vulnerable code can be written in any programming language):\r\n\r\n    $sql = &quot;SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM MyTable WHERE account_id = &quot; . $_GET[&#39;id&#39;];\r\n\r\nIf the attacker caused the input parameter to be: `&quot;1 OR account_id = 473&quot;`\r\n\r\nThe point is, once the query is formatted in the app and submitted to MySQL, MySQL can&#39;t tell _how_ it was formatted. MySQL can only trust that the developer of the code did format the query in a safe way.\r\n\r\nOne method of blocking illicit queries is by using a type of [Web Application Firewall (WAF)][1] that you design to recognize legitimate inputs and block requests that are not legitimate. In other words, you need to program the WAF with a whitelist or set of patterns to recognize safe requests. This list will be unique for each app, so you need to be very familiar with the app. Any modification to the app may require you to update the WAF&#39;s whitelist.\r\n\r\nThe WAF is typically a proxy at the http layer, to prevent illicit request from reaching the web app. There are also proxy solutions to protect the request between the app and the database. You program the proxy to recognize which SQL queries are expected, and it blocks any queries that have unexpected terms. It would \r\n\r\nAn example of a database firewall is https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/audit-vault-firewall.html\r\n\r\nThey aren&#39;t perfect. They may block queries you want to allow. And they don&#39;t work for dynamic queries run in stored procedures.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you should just establish safe programming standards in your application code.

We would not be able to represent the 64 bit virtual memory addresses using just a byte right? \r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to learn these unsafe aspects of rust because there I will be working on some kernel related project and it is necessary to work with raw pointers. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58370586/rust-alloc-memory-layout-not-consistent-with-size","title":"Rust alloc memory layout not consistent with size"},{"tags":["javascript","google-apps-script","google-sheets"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14341,"user_id":1595451,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/08TCi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rub&#233;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1595451/rub%c3%a9n"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571031505,"post_id":58370585,"comment_id":103090839,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58370585/how-do-i-translate-sort-and-match-google-sheet-formula-into-app-script-javascri#comment103090839_58370585"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12199493,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aK-37lGCiZE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc9-SQUOhZQR58EfGnASfjV23CXfg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alvis ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199493/alvis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571104029,"post_id":58373179,"comment_id":103119693,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58370585/how-do-i-translate-sort-and-match-google-sheet-formula-into-app-script-javascri/58373179#comment103119693_58373179"},{"owner":{"reputation":617,"user_id":12152337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0a63fcf6cc90b9937ef23d7dcc88829?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carlesgg97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152337/carlesgg97"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12199493,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aK-37lGCiZE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc9-SQUOhZQR58EfGnASfjV23CXfg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alvis ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199493/alvis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571124591,"post_id":58373179,"comment_id":103125492,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58370585/how-do-i-translate-sort-and-match-google-sheet-formula-into-app-script-javascri/58373179#comment103125492_58373179"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":617,"user_id":12152337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0a63fcf6cc90b9937ef23d7dcc88829?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carlesgg97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152337/carlesgg97"},"last_editor":{"reputation":617,"user_id":12152337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0a63fcf6cc90b9937ef23d7dcc88829?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carlesgg97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152337/carlesgg97"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571124476,"last_edit_date":1571124476,"creation_date":1571043133,"answer_id":58373179,"question_id":58370585,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58373179","body_markdown":"To sort your sheet, you can use the following code:\r\n```js\r\nfunction myFunction() {\r\n  var inSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheets()[0];\r\n  var outSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheets()[1];\r\n  \r\n  var values = inSheet.getRange(&#39;A2:C23&#39;).getValues();\r\n  values.sort(mySort);\r\n  \r\n  outSheet.getRange(&#39;A2:C23&#39;).setValues(values);\r\n}\r\n  \r\n \r\nfunction mySort(row1, row2) {\r\n  var values = [&quot;QTA 10 Days&quot;,&quot;QTA-REMAKE&quot;,&quot;QTA-SAMPLE&quot;,&quot;QTA NEW PROJECT&quot;,&quot;QTA NPI-CVF-Bryan&quot;,&quot;Qual-QTA-NPI Remake&quot;];\r\n  var val1 = values.indexOf(row1[2]);\r\n  var val2 = values.indexOf(row2[2]);\r\n  return val1 - val2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will of course have to change the ranges and/or sheets that you are using.

The front end wants to display this data, grouped in stages, before rendering it. The number of stages is variable. So originally they were making an api per stage to bunching up the data before binding to a grid control.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of stages become quite high, it becomes too slow. The browser will queue api requests and the overall response time would be very long. Better - we decided - would be to have a single api call that can deal with grouping AND paging. That is, you could say &#39;take=30&#39; and it would give you 30 records of EACH stage, for however many stages there are.\r\n\r\nSo the query on the back end looks like what I have below. The problems is that the sorting of the data, before the skip and take is on a dynamic field, and this is where it falls over. Dynamic Linq doesn&#39;t seem to work (although it works perfectly fine for normal queries outside the GroupBy call), and I haven&#39;t been able to get any of the huge number of extension methods out there working either. They are all some variation of the errors you would find below: (Keep in mind the problem is getting it working with linq to sql)\r\n\r\n\r\n            TestEntities context = new TestEntities();\r\n            \r\n            List&lt;TestTable1&gt; result;\r\n\r\n            // This works (Hard coding at design time)\r\n            result = context.TestTable1.GroupBy(x =&gt; x.StageId)\r\n                .SelectMany(x =&gt; x.OrderBy(y =&gt; y.StageId).Skip(1).Take(1)).ToList();\r\n\r\n            // This works (using a hard coded function at design time)\r\n            Func&lt;TestTable1, int&gt; orderByExpression = x =&gt; x.StageId;\r\n            result = context.TestTable1.GroupBy(x =&gt; x.StageId)\r\n                .SelectMany(x =&gt; x.OrderBy(orderByExpression).Skip(1).Take(1)).ToList();\r\n\r\n            // This doesn&#39;t work.

currently trying to write a simple audio visualizer (Non realtime), but am running into a very weird problem.\r\n\r\nAfter about 515-545 iterations of ImageIO.write(), the program freezes; no exceptions, the program doesn&#39;t crash, just, nothing.\r\n\r\nBefore you read the code below, here&#39;s a quick rundown of it to make it a bit easier to understand:  \r\n1. Load data from program arguments.  \r\n2. Start ffmpeg with its input set to stdin.  \r\n3. In a loop; Continually render an image, then send it to ffmpeg with ImageIO.write().  \r\n\r\nOther info:  \r\nI&#39;ve verified ImageIO.write() IS actually the problem by placing a print before and after the try/catch statement.  \r\nMy first thought was a memory leak, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case, at least according to Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();  \r\nThe iterations needed to freeze the program is inconsistent, though its always been in the range of 515-540.  \r\nRendering a video with less frames works flawlessly.  \r\nMy previous solution was to write all images to a folder, then run ffmpeg on them all at once. This worked fine on any number of frames, but used upwards of a gigabyte of storage for a fairly small test video, unacceptable for the small program I&#39;m trying to create.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, I realize the code probably has a ton of optimization/general problems, I haven&#39;t had the time to try and get it to work well, as it isn&#39;t even fully working yet.  \r\nWith that said, if you see any obvious problems, feel free to include them in your answer if you have the time, it&#39;ll certainly save me some.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Run {\r\n\r\n    public static

a simpler solution, you can store the data a `Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt;` (can also be `Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;.\r\n\r\nOn every TextFormField&#39;s `onSave` or `onChange`, you can set the value of the `Map`.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    TextFormField(\r\n      // We set the initial value of the text field here\r\n      initialValue: _map[&#39;firstName&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;,\r\n      onSave: (String value) {\r\n        _map[&#39;firstName&#39;] = value;\r\n      }\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you will pass the `Map` to the next page/screen. \r\n\r\n    Navigator.of(context).push(\r\n

`TextFormField`?\r\n\r\nHere is the example how to have a filled (initial value) `TextFormField`\r\n\r\n```\r\nTextFormField(\r\n          // We set the value of the TextFormField\r\n

PHP&#39;s builtin `strtotime(...)` method expects valid time format and treats your input as *seconds*, and about the value which you try to convert to time we can say that:\r\n\r\n   - Your number `43556 seconds` equals `725.9` hours (divided by `60`)\r\n   - The `725.9` hours equal `30.2` days.\r\n   - The `30` days equal one and only one month.\r\n   - The first month of the year is `January`.\r\n   - The first year of the PHP clock is `1970`.\r\n\r\nAnd this concludes why you are stuck with `Jan-70`.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAnyway, if your times are `Excel` based, you can use below formula to change from *Excel date* to *Unix date*, then you can use &quot;`gmdate(...)`&quot; to get the real date (like [another answer][1]):\r\n```php\r\n$EXCEL_DATE = 43556; // Your CSV value goes here\r\n$UNIX_DATE = ($EXCEL_DATE - 25569) * 86400;\r\necho gmdate(&quot;d-M-Y H:i:s&quot;, $UNIX_DATE);\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n01-Apr-2019 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut, if your times are NOT `Excel` based you should:\r\n\r\n   - Find out on which year and date your CSV times are based.\r\n   - Convert that to seconds (where `1970` should be zero), to get `$baseTime`.\r\n   - At last, simply add `$baseTime` to your CSV time-values.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```php\r\n$baseTime = strtotime( &#39;Tue Dec 15 2009&#39; );\r\n$tt = date( &quot;d-m-Y H:i:s&quot;, strtotime( $baseTime

What is the correct syntax? I have seen material all over the internet and none of it seems to be working.\r\n\r\n**Frustration:** I have posted way too many questions on the same topic: how to change data from an existing STRING column into a BIGINT column on a table that is EXTERNAL and created by an AVRO metadata file and stored as AVRO. None of that seems to work. So, now I have created a duplicate *_new table with the updated metadata and I am now trying to INSERT the existing data INTO the new table by SELECTing from the existing table. And, that is not working. I have tried numerous permutations of the HQL to perform this task and have received a corresponding permutation of errors.\r\n\r\nHQL seems to require a PHD in rocket science... This simple task should not be so f&#39;ng difficult.\r\n\r\n**Sample query:**\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO TableName_New\r\n    --PARTITION (partition_year=&quot;2000&quot;, partition_month=&quot;01&quot;, partition_date=&quot;2000-01-01&quot;)\r\n    PARTITION (partition_year, partition_month, partition_date)\r\n    SELECT Column1, Column2\r\n         --,CAST(Column3 AS BIGINT) Column3\r\n         ,Column3\r\n    ,partition_year, partition_month, partition_date\r\n    --,partition_year, partition_month, partition_date\r\n    FROM TableName\r\n    WHERE partition_year=&quot;2000&quot;\r\n        AND partition_month=&quot;01&quot;\r\n        AND partition_date=&quot;2000-01-01&quot;\r\n\r\n**Typical Error Message:**\r\n\r\n&gt; Error while processing statement: FAILED: Execution Error, return code\r\n&gt; 2 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.mr.MapRedTask\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58369559/is-it-possible-to-change-an-existing-columns-metadata-on-an-external-table-that\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nThe error appears to be in the SELECT statement. Now, I can SELECT * no problem. But, when I SELECT either by a specific column or using a WHERE constraint, then I was getting the error above in HUE. I decided to run the same command in HIVE CLI and I think I may have gotten the underlying error:\r\n\r\n**Excerpted from below:** \r\n\r\n&gt; org.apache.avro.AvroTypeException: Found long, expecting union\r\n\r\nNow, what strikes me as odd here is that I did DROP and CREATED the new table using the modified AVRO metadata file and I migrated a single PARTITION (contains 3 files). I verified that both the AVRO metadata file and the PARTITION file have the same metadata for Column3. But, in HUE, the column&#39;s metadata shows as BIGINT. It appears that Hive&#39;s metastore is not correctly up-to-date (I suspect this is from all of the testing and troubleshooting we have done). How can I correct this?\r\n\r\nRegardless, I decided to go ahead and create a whole new table using the old metadata and copied the partition files over within HDFS CLI. In HUE, Column3&#39;s metadata now shows correctly as STRING. I then added the partition to the table. I can SELECT * no problem, but I am still getting the same excerpted error above when I try to SELECT either by column or WHERE constraint. I am wondering if column3&#39;s metadata was updated for all of the rows within the partition file while the AVRO metadata contained at the top of the partition file was not changed. I&#39;m kind of stuck right now and am open to ideas.\r\n\r\nProblem 1: How can I fix the original table&#39;s metadata in Hive, considering the AVRO file is correct?\r\n\r\nProblem 2: How do I fix the inability to SELECT from the old temp table if the partition files were somehow modified when I ran the `ALTER COLUMN ... PARTITION (...) CHANGE COLUMN Column3 Column3 BIGINT CASCADE` command? Do I just run the same command but with STRING instead of BIGINT?\r\n**Full Error Message: **\r\n&gt; Error: java.lang.RuntimeException:\r\n&gt; org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: Hive Runtime Error\r\n&gt;
