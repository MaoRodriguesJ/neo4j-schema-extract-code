As the docs are pain and there is little to no help online, I have decided to post my solution here in the hope that it will help others. I am no good at stackoverflow so let me know if I need to improve my formatting. \r\n\r\n    app.get(&quot;/login/ebay&quot;, (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n      res.redirect(\r\n        `https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=DeanSchm-TestApp-SBX-b843acc90-fd663cbb&amp;redirect_uri=Dean_Schmid-DeanSchm-TestAp-kqmgc&amp;response_type=code`\r\n      );\r\n    });\r\n\r\nfirst thing you need to do is redirect to this url. \r\n\r\nThe format is like this\r\n\r\nhttps://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=&lt;your_client_id&gt;&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;your_redirect_uri&gt;&amp;response_type=code\r\n\r\nThere is also a scope property, but I don&#39;t understand that yet, and I got back a token without is so mehhh.\r\n\r\nThat url takes you to the ebay login page. If you are using the sandbox, you need to create a sandbox user and login with sandbox credentials.\r\n\r\nOnce you login, ebay will redirect you a url of your choosing. You enter the url you want to be redirected to here. \r\n\r\n[![Oauth Accepted URL][1]][1] \r\n\r\nIt&#39;s in the ebay developer section under Get A Token From Ebay Via your Application. \r\n           \r\nThis url can be anything. you just have to handle it in node or express or whatever, because as soon as someone signs in that url is where they are heading. \r\n\r\nHere is how I handled it \r\n\r\n       app.get(&quot;/auth/ebay/callback&quot;, (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n      axios(&quot;https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token&quot;, {\r\n        method: &quot;post&quot;,\r\n        headers: {\r\n          &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;,\r\n          Authorization:\r\n            &quot;Basic &quot; +\r\n            btoa(\r\n              `client public key:client secret keys`\r\n            )\r\n        },\r\n        data: qs.stringify({\r\n          grant_type: &quot;authorization_code&quot;,\r\n          // parsed from redirect URI after returning from eBay,\r\n          code: req.query.code,\r\n          // this is set in your dev account, also called RuName\r\n    \r\n          redirect_uri: &quot;Dean_Schmid-DeanSchm-TestAp-kqmgc&quot;\r\n        })\r\n      })\r\n        .then(response =&gt; console.log(response))\r\n        .catch(err =&gt; console.log(err));\r\n    });\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/CEbq8.png\r\n\r\n\r\nA few gotchas that got me.\r\n\r\n - Make sure you have a space after &quot;Basic &quot; in the authorisation\r\n   header. \r\n   \r\n  \r\n - bota is a 3rd party library that base 64 encodes your public and\r\n   secret     keys. There are many ways to do this. I just did it this\r\n   way because I stole a bunch of code.\r\n - With axios the request body is called data but with fetch and other\r\n   methods it might be called something else like body or param\r\n -The axios method is in a get request because the redirect from ebay  defaults to a http get.\r\n - ebay now uses https. \r\n - **Make sure you are using sandbox urls**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229903/working-ebay-oauth-node-express-javascript","title":"Working Ebay Oauth Node Express JavaScript"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","amazon-ses"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":406,"user_id":4975875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-e1eGINartG8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/9xYTcoUv1PM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aaron NoHuanKnows","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4975875/aaron-nohuanknows"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570169043,"post_id":58229901,"comment_id":102835513,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229901/how-to-stop-aws-ses-mail-queue#comment102835513_58229901"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":406,"user_id":4975875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-e1eGINartG8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/9xYTcoUv1PM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aaron NoHuanKnows","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4975875/aaron-nohuanknows"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570169097,"creation_date":1570169097,"answer_id":58230761,"question_id":58229901,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58230761","body_markdown":"AWS has a built-in queue purging function.  \r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_PurgeQueue.html\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue/\r\n?Action=PurgeQueue\r\n&amp;Expires=2020-12-12T22%3A52%3A43PST\r\n&amp;Version=2012-11-05\r\n&amp;AUTHPARAMS\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229901/how-to-stop-aws-ses-mail-queue/58230761#58230761","title":"How to stop aws ses mail queue?"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":6006902,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c575c54fca515537df1fc2514c46b85d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"guillemus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6006902/guillemus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21601,"user_id":333340,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUElo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Synchro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/333340/synchro"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58230761,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570174835,"creation_date":1570163261,"last_edit_date":1570174835,"question_id":58229901,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229901","body_markdown":"Due to a bug in our application, one of our testing servers started spamming mail orders to AWS SES.

So my thoughts would be\r\n\r\n1. **do not remove old activestorage record**: this is more like a workaround but actually I can&#39;t find this option in activestorage\r\n2. **just get image&#39;s static URL instead of using `url_for` to bypass rails and related 404 activestorage record not found**: cannot found related methods either\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229886/activestorage-blob-removed-after-attachment-file-changed-how-to-handle-the-situ","title":"ActiveStorage blob removed after attachment file changed, how to handle the situation?"},{"tags":["python","string"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11633,"user_id":7093741,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XyiZA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7093741/chris"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570163275,"post_id":58229885,"comment_id":102834162,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229885/python-string-manipulation-moving-a-character-from-one-spot-to-another#comment102834162_58229885"},{"owner":{"reputation":52449,"user_id":3874623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YiDTj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Meyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3874623/mark-meyer"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570163559,"post_id":58229885,"comment_id":102834210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229885/python-string-manipulation-moving-a-character-from-one-spot-to-another#comment102834210_58229885"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9476,"user_id":1092820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc78da24118b403595f62fa7856e1b6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ruzihm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1092820/ruzihm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570163925,"creation_date":1570163925,"answer_id":58229988,"question_id":58229885,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58229988","body_markdown":"`string.replace` doesn&#39;t alter the string in-place.

&#39;well defined procedure&#39; just means that it should contain a series of steps that deal with every possible input variation.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nfor example, in a decision tree, you need to account for all cases till you reach the leaf. Take the example of an algorithm that finds the maximum of a list:\r\n&lt;br&gt; What should it do when you encounter only integers? How do you compare them? What happens if you try to compare two elements in the array which are not of the same type? Is there a restriction on the values that the elements in the array can take? What about the size of the array?\r\n&lt;br&gt; As such, you can find a ton of other questions along these lines. Algorithms need to be able to answer all of them and as such are &#39;well defined&#39;.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n**non-deterministic** algorithms is actually a very big field in CS. Look at this wikipedia link for more examples [Non-deterministic algorithms][1]. These algorithms can generate a different output for the same input in subsequent runs. For example something that uses a coin-flip to print &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot;. As such, based on your random number, the output will change across multiple runs.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nCompare this to **deterministic algorithms** which produce the same output for the same input every single time\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229844/could-an-algorithm-be-non-deterministic-or-ambiguous/58229931#58229931","title":"Could an algorithm be non deterministic or ambiguous?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12078270,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8c336fa376a0c9c2a0bd630c2793754?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"smiley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078270/smiley"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570163420,"creation_date":1570162774,"question_id":58229844,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229844","body_markdown":"CLSR says that an algorithm is a &quot;well defined procedure&quot;.What exactly is meant by &quot;well defined&quot;.

been experimenting all day and trying to figure out just how to get my UISearchBar to appear the same in iOS13 as it appears in iOS12/11\r\n\r\nSo the way the search bar is added is simply a new UISearchController.\r\n\r\n                var searchController = new UISearchController(searchResultsController: null);\r\n                searchController.SearchBar.Placeholder = &quot;Search&quot;;\r\n                searchController.SearchResultsUpdater = this;\r\n                searchController.HidesNavigationBarDuringPresentation = false;\r\n                searchController.DimsBackgroundDuringPresentation = false;\r\n\r\n                NavigationItem.SearchController = searchController;\r\n                NavigationItem.HidesSearchBarWhenScrolling = false;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results on iOS 11/12:\r\n\r\n![iOS11/iOS12] (https://i.imgur.com/Pxtl3BS.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results on iOS 13:\r\n\r\n![iOS13] (https://i.imgur.com/Ysg8jbk.png)\r\n\r\nOn iOS 13 I am using the new UINavigationBarAppearance code like this:\r\n\r\n                    var appearance = new UINavigationBarAppearance();\r\n                    appearance.ConfigureWithOpaqueBackground();\r\n                    appearance.BackgroundColor = ColorPalette.TintColor;\r\n                    appearance.TitleTextAttributes = new UIStringAttributes { ForegroundColor = UIColor.White };\r\n\r\n                    NavigationItem.StandardAppearance = appearance;\r\n\r\n\r\nOn iOS 11/12 I am using legacy way to achieve it:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    NavigationController.NavigationBar.BarStyle = UIBarStyle.Black;\r\n                    NavigationController.NavigationBar.TintColor = UIColor.White;\r\n                    NavigationController.NavigationBar.BarTintColor = ColorPalette.TintColor;\r\n                    NavigationController.NavigationBar.Translucent = false;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a number of things, but can&#39;t seem to get the UISearchBar to tint by itself how iOS11/12 achieves it.\r\n\r\nI know that the new UISearchBar now has access to the UITextField and I can configure the background color&#39;s etc.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229829/ios-13-changes-to-uisearchbar-tints-cant-achieve-the-same-outcome","title":"iOS 13 Changes to UISearchBar tint&#39;s,

You can see the spikes happening for the &quot;negative&quot; signal - I suspect it&#39;s because of some concurrency issue but I have tried searching all kinds of keywords to find the root of this problem and haven&#39;t come up with anything:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/AtrKW.png\r\n\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\nOne bit full adder\r\n```vhdl\r\nlibrary ieee;\r\nuse ieee.std_logic_1164.all;\r\n\r\nentity one_bit_full_adder is\r\n  port (\r\n    x, y, cin : in std_logic;\r\n    sum, cout: out std_logic);\r\nend one_bit_full_adder;\r\n\r\narchitecture arch of one_bit_full_adder is\r\n  begin\r\n    sum &lt;= x xor y xor cin;\r\n    cout &lt;= (x and y) or (cin and (x xor y));\r\n  end arch;\r\n```\r\nN-bit subtractor\r\n```vhdl\r\nlibrary ieee;\r\nuse ieee.std_logic_1164.all;\r\nuse ieee.numeric_std.all;\r\n\r\nentity n_bit_subtractor is\r\n  generic(constant BIT_LENGTH : integer);\r\n  port (\r\n    a, b : in std_logic_vector(BIT_LENGTH - 1 downto 0);\r\n    negative: out std_logic;\r\n    difference: out std_logic_vector(BIT_LENGTH - 1 downto 0));\r\nend n_bit_subtractor;\r\n\r\narchitecture arch of n_bit_subtractor is\r\n  component one_bit_full_adder port (x, y, cin: in std_logic; sum, cout: out std_logic); end component;\r\n  signal carry_ins: std_logic_vector(BIT_LENGTH downto 0) := (0 =&gt; &#39;1&#39;, others =&gt; &#39;0&#39;);\r\n  signal differences: std_logic_vector(BIT_LENGTH - 1 downto 0);\r\n  signal b_operand: std_logic_vector(BIT_LENGTH - 1 downto 0);\r\n\r\n  begin\r\n    b_operand &lt;= not b;\r\n    difference &lt;= differences;\r\n    negative &lt;= differences(BIT_LENGTH - 1) and &#39;1&#39;;\r\n    adders: for i in 0 to BIT_LENGTH-1 generate\r\n      H2: one_bit_full_adder port map(x=&gt;a(i), y=&gt;b_operand(i), cin=&gt;carry_ins(i), sum=&gt;differences(i), cout=&gt;carry_ins(i+1));\r\n    end generate;\r\n  end arch;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTestbench:\r\n\r\n```vhdl\r\nlibrary ieee;\r\nuse ieee.std_logic_1164.all;\r\nuse ieee.numeric_std.all;\r\n\r\nentity n_bit_subtractor_test is\r\nend n_bit_subtractor_test;\r\n\r\narchitecture arch_test of n_bit_subtractor_test is\r\nconstant BIT_LEN : integer := 3;\r\ncomponent n_bit_subtractor is\r\n  generic(constant BIT_LENGTH : integer);\r\n  port (\r\n    a, b : in std_logic_vector(BIT_LENGTH - 1 downto 0);\r\n    negative: out std_logic;\r\n    difference: out std_logic_vector(BIT_LENGTH - 1 downto 0));\r\nend component n_bit_subtractor;\r\nsignal p0, p1, difference: std_logic_vector(BIT_LEN-1 downto 0) := (others =&gt; &#39;0&#39;);\r\nsignal negative: std_logic;\r\nbegin\r\n  uut: n_bit_subtractor\r\n    generic map (BIT_LENGTH =&gt; BIT_LEN)\r\n    port map (a =&gt; p0, b =&gt; p1, difference =&gt; difference, negative =&gt; negative);\r\n\r\n  process\r\n  variable difference_actual: std_logic_vector(BIT_LEN-1 downto 0) := (others =&gt; &#39;0&#39;);\r\n  begin\r\n    for i in 0 to (2**BIT_LEN)-1 loop\r\n      for k in 0 to (2**BIT_LEN)-1 loop\r\n        wait for 200 ns;\r\n        p1 &lt;= std_logic_vector(unsigned(p1) + 1);\r\n      end loop;\r\n      p0 &lt;= std_logic_vector(unsigned(p0) + 1);\r\n    end loop;\r\n\r\n    report &quot;No errors detected.

you get an error with information as helpful as this, you should immediately be thinking &quot;I have a buffer overflow&quot;.  Then go looking for it.\r\n\r\nSure enough, here it is:\r\n\r\n    void assign(int a[20]) {\r\n        a[20] = {};            // &lt;--- BOOM!\r\n        draw(a);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYour array can only store 20 elements.  When you store something at the 21st element, you have undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nJust adding some more information here.  It&#39;s _possible_ that you thought the offending line would zero-initialize the entire array (like it does when defining the variable).  However, outside of an array definition, this is not the case.  `a[20] = {}` is an assignment.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to zero the array, use `std::fill` as follows:\r\n\r\n    std::fill(a, a+20, 0);\r\n\r\nI should point out, however, that there&#39;s no point zeroing the array in the context of your code as written.  It&#39;s already zeroed on entry, and the `draw` function initializes every element anyway.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229812/stack-around-array-variable-corrupted/58229848#58229848","title":"stack around array variable corrupted"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12162364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4fe0d355ef44f9fe5a0d92bca8208da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mooha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12162364/mooha"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58229848,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570163237,"creation_date":1570162367,"question_id":58229812,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229812","body_markdown":"i am trying to pass my array through my assign and draw functions. the assign function only exists to take the wins array and assign a value of 0 for all of the elements in the array. my draw function fills the array with random numbers 1-100 with 20 numbers in the array. when i try to compile i end up with a runtime error stating that the stack around my variable (array) wins is corrupted. where should i go from here?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    #include&lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;ctime&gt;\r\n    \r\n    using std::cout; using std::cin; using std::endl;\r\n    \r\n    void draw(int a[]);\r\n    void assign(int a[]);\r\n    int sizeofarray = 20;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n    \tint wins[20] = {};\r\n    \r\n    \tassign(wins);\r\n    \r\n    \tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;compiled!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void assign(int a[20]) {\r\n    \r\n    \ta[20] = {};\r\n    \tdraw(a);\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void  draw(int a[])\r\n    \r\n    {\r\n    \tsrand(time(nullptr));\r\n    \tint rannum = (1 + rand() % 100);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {\r\n    \r\n    \t\ta[i] = 1 + rand() % 100;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229812/stack-around-array-variable-corrupted","title":"stack around array variable corrupted"},{"tags":["c++","windows","dll","dllimport"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4272,"user_id":1548468,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0745dce203d52699e63a575b3103ad70?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Botje","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1548468/botje"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570175741,"post_id":58229809,"comment_id":102838109,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229809/trouble-getting-a-stripped-dll-to-work-with-a-c-console-app#comment102838109_58229809"},{"owner":{"reputation":156,"user_id":885014,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2679176316562ab46621a53e9a761621?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark McWiggins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/885014/mark-mcwiggins"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4272,"user_id":1548468,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0745dce203d52699e63a575b3103ad70?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Botje","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1548468/botje"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570202489,"post_id":58229809,"comment_id":102850988,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229809/trouble-getting-a-stripped-dll-to-work-with-a-c-console-app#comment102850988_58229809"}],"owner":{"reputation":156,"user_id":885014,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2679176316562ab46621a53e9a761621?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark McWiggins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/885014/mark-mcwiggins"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570162334,"creation_date":1570162334,"question_id":58229809,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229809","body_markdown":"I have a project to make an oldish (stripped, non-Com) DLL work in a new C++ console app. I&#39;ve tried several things:\r\n\r\n - Import a new reference from the Visual Studio console ... this doesn&#39;t work (apparently) because it&#39;s a non-COM thing ... &#39;browse&#39; shows nothing in both Visual Studio 2017 and 2019.\r\n\r\n- use dumpbin and lib to create a lib from the DLL; dumpbin worked but lib gets a bunch of warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLNK4017: statement not supported for the target platform: ignored\r\n```\r\n... and produces an apparently blank library.\r\n\r\nTried cygwin tools ... which don&#39;t work with stripped DLLs but otherwise look lovely ...\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n 1.

This will fix your issue.\r\n\r\nThe long answer:\r\n\r\nWhen writing a Tkinter GUI 99.99% of the time you are only ever going to use 1 tkinter instance `Tk()`. The reason for this is that each instance of `Tk()` is contained within its own personal &quot;Sandbox&quot;. Meaning it cannot play with others. So one instance of `Tk()` cannot communicate with a separate `Tk()` instance.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that if you do not specify what instance a method belongs to within the method then it will default to the 1st instance of `Tk()`. So the `StringVar()` and `IntVar()` you have create cannot be printed due to them belonging to `main`. Because `main` cannot talk to `m1` you cannot update this value.\r\n\r\nWe can actually test this if you change:\r\n\r\n    entry_val = StringVar()\r\n    check_val = IntVar()\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n    entry_val = StringVar(m1)\r\n    check_val = IntVar(m1)\r\n\r\nYou will see your variables update properly.\r\n\r\nOr if you change `m1 = Tk()` to `m1 = Toplevel()` (the correct solution) you will see that everything works as needed.\r\n\r\n`Toplevel()` is specifically designed for creating new windows in tkinter so everything can stay in the same &quot;Sandbox&quot; and work together.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229805/i-want-to-get-value-of-entrybox-and-checkbutton-but-i-get-nothing-why-i-am-new/58236358#58236358","title":"I want to get value of Entrybox and Checkbutton but I get nothing why?

`Optional` could either contain an object or not. It does not matter what is in there.\r\n\r\nGenerally, `.get()` gives you the object which is wrapped in the `Optional`. But if there is no object (it wraps a `null`), you would get an exception.\r\n\r\nTo check whether the object in there is present, you could just say `OptionalObject.isPresent()`. This returns a `boolean` which tells you whether the `OptionalObject` actually wraps an object.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(fetchList.isEmpty()) {\r\n    throw new RuntimeException();\r\n    // Consider not to throw RuntimeExceptions (see comments below)\r\n}\r\n// Continue your programme\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually, `.isEmpty()` is only available since Java 11. In previous versions this could be achieved by negating `.isPresent()`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(!fetchList.isPresent()) {\r\n    throw new RuntimeException();\r\n}\r\n// Continue your programme\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother, for this situation shorter and easier option is the by @ernest_k suggested one. It gets the element wrapped in the `Optional`. If the `Optional` is empty, the exception mentioned in the `.orElseThrow()` gets thrown. Furthermore, the lambda expression could be converted to a method reference (consider a good exception).\r\n\r\n```\r\nAbcDTO abcDTO = fetchList.orElseThrow(RuntimeException::new);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, this code checks only whether the `List` object is present. For checking further whether the existing `List` has no entries, you could call `.isEmpty()` for the list (not only for the `Optional`).\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(abcDTO.isEmpty()) {\r\n    throw new RuntimeException();\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229792/getting-an-list-of-optional-type-in-java/58229930#58229930","title":"getting an list of optional type in

You need to specify what that type is with a `class` or `struct` constraint. You don&#39;t need to specify `notnull` as structs were always nullable and, with nullable ref types enabled, so are classes.\r\n\r\nJust add `where T:class` or `where T:struct`.\r\n\r\n**Reference Types**\r\n\r\nIf you add the `class` constraint, eg: \r\n\r\n```\r\n#nullable enable\r\n\r\ninterface IDataAdapter&lt;T&gt;       \r\n    where T:class\r\n{\r\n    T?

For a class, it doesn&#39;t have to do anything special. For a struct, it has to generate a Nullable&lt; T&gt;.\r\n\r\nThis is explained in the `The issue with T?` section in [Try out Nullable Reference Types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/try-out-nullable-reference-types/) :\r\n\r\n&gt; This distinction between nullable value types and nullable reference types comes up in a pattern such as this:\r\n\r\n&gt; `void M&lt;T&gt;(T? t) where T: notnull`\r\n\r\n&gt;This would mean that the parameter is the nullable version of T, and T is constrained to be notnull. If T were a string, then the actual signature of M would be M&lt;string&gt;([NullableAttribute] T t), but if T were an int, then M would be M&lt;int&gt;(Nullable&lt;int&gt; t). These two signatures are fundamentally different, and this difference is not reconcilable.\r\n\r\n&gt; Because of this issue between the concrete representations of nullable reference types and nullable value types, any use of T? must also require you to constrain the T to be either class or struct.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229782/receiving-error-about-nullable-type-parameter-even-when-parameter-has-notnull-co/58231699#58231699","title":"Receiving error about nullable type parameter even when parameter has notnull constraint"}],"owner":{"reputation":194,"user_id":5847190,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4d8ba109d8b110aef7d0a9c337de3c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DylanSp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5847190/dylansp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58231002,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570174748,"creation_date":1570162028,"last_edit_date":1570174748,"question_id":58229782,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229782","body_markdown":"I have a generic interface `IDataAdapter&lt;T&gt;`; implementors of the interface should be able to read POCOs with `Guid` IDs from a data source. `IDataAdapter&lt;T&gt;` has a method `Read(Guid id)` which I want to return a `T?`, where null indicates that no matches were found in the data source.

have a pandas dataframe that looks like this:\r\n```\r\nClient   1_act      2_act      3_act      4_act      5_act      6_act   ...\r\n1        hiking     swimming   skating    jumping    climbing

only has unique activities and can have MANY columns all named #_act (new columns can also be added at any time as a client reports a new activity). Every row has at least a pair (no one has less than 2 activities per row). New activity values can also be added at any time.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find a way to return the most common pair of activity. So desired output would be like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPair                       Qty\r\n(hiking, swimming)         2\r\n(hiking, skating)          1\r\n(hiking, jumping)          1\r\n(hiking, climbing)         2\r\n(hiking, eating)           2\r\n(swimming, skating)        1\r\n(swimming, jumping)        1\r\n(swimming, climbing)       1\r\n(swimming, eating)         1\r\n(skating, jumping)         1\r\n(skating, climbing)        1\r\n(skating, eating)          1\r\n(jumping, climbing)        1\r\n(climbing, eating)         2\r\n(eating, exploring)        1\r\n(hiking, exercising)       1\r\n(hiking, screaming)        1\r\n(hiking, yelling)          1\r\n(hiking, hopping)          1\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe above output is an example output of all possible pairs in each row across all their columns in this sample dataset.

So when the view controller is so complicated, we can divide it into smaller views with their own view models, a table view cell can have its view model if needed, it&#39;s similar to your case here.\r\n\r\nSo we might have a view model like this\r\n\r\n    class CustomControlViewModel: NSObject {\r\n        var data: String!\r\n        var flag: Int!\r\n    \r\n        init(data: String, flag: Int) {\r\n            self.data = data\r\n            self.flag = flag\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd the data is controlled inside the ViewControllerViewModel\r\n\r\n    func createCustomControlViewModel() -&gt; CustomControlViewModel {\r\n        return CustomControlViewModel(data: &quot;data from view model&quot;, flag: 1)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHope this answer helps you","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229726/adding-dynamic-custom-controls-into-view-with-rxswift-from-view-model/58230312#58230312","title":"Adding Dynamic custom controls into view with RxSwift from View model"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10360782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e583e45e41fb38f142b34dc5564f1909?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raghav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10360782/raghav"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570166222,"creation_date":1570161539,"question_id":58229726,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229726","body_markdown":"I recently started working using RxSwift. I do have some basic knowledge now. I have a view controller for which I have created corresponding View model and I have some properties defined and are bound to some labels on the view in view controller. This binding works fine.\r\n\r\nI also have some custom controls which are added dynamically into a scrollview in the view controller based on certain conditions in the api response. Since the API call is made through view model, view model would have the complete response and is straight forward to set the properties which are bound with the labels controls on the view. Here is the scenario for which I need some idea or hints\r\n\r\nBased on some flags in the API response I need to tell view to dynamically add custom control A, B, C into the scroll view and pass the required data to the custom controls to populate. And the data to be passed to custom controls is with view model.\r\n\r\nIs it recommended to create view model even for custom controls? If yes, how can I manage to handle the above scenario and comply with MVVM pattern using RxSwift. Basically since the complete data is with view model of the view controller, how to share this data with custom controls in the best possible way and at the same time comply with MVVM pattern and keep the code structured.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229726/adding-dynamic-custom-controls-into-view-with-rxswift-from-view-model","title":"Adding Dynamic custom controls into view with RxSwift from View model"},{"tags":["html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":457,"user_id":11561672,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ncBiB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ranjith v","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11561672/ranjith-v"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570161577,"post_id":58229723,"comment_id":102833856,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229723/how-to-stop-the-stepper-line-from-extending-when-it-is-at-the-end-of-the-step#comment102833856_58229723"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":832,"user_id":7934629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f317864efe49007e9393dc29c68b7a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hitech Hitesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7934629/hitech-hitesh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570161857,"creation_date":1570161857,"answer_id":58229767,"question_id":58229723,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58229767","body_markdown":"```\r\n._stepper:last-child:after{\r\n      display: none;\r\n }\r\n                    \r\n```\r\n\r\nMake the steppers last child after to display none","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229723/how-to-stop-the-stepper-line-from-extending-when-it-is-at-the-end-of-the-step/58229767#58229767","title":"How to stop the stepper line from extending when it is at the end of the step"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":4804114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vjedQismjRY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABtM/LyWAcUe2BlA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zPOKOin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4804114/zpokoin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570164138,"creation_date":1570164138,"answer_id":58230021,"question_id":58229723,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58230021","body_markdown":"I would rather use opacity to hide than display:none\r\n\r\n     ._stepper {\r\n         &amp;:last-child {\r\n             &amp;::after {\r\n                 opacity: 0;\r\n             }\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229723/how-to-stop-the-stepper-line-from-extending-when-it-is-at-the-end-of-the-step/58230021#58230021","title":"How to stop the stepper line from extending when it is at the end of the step"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10449210,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HJiJdelfy0A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABU0/3O20RUedRao/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Karen Mana-ay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10449210/karen-mana-ay"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570164138,"creation_date":1570161521,"question_id":58229723,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229723","body_markdown":"I have a problem with my stepper line.

Long answer, it is, if you are using a webapp instead of the SpreadsheetsApp.getUI().\r\n\r\nThat would mean you&#39;d have to rewrite your whole application, so keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a webapp you could use this [reference][1] and modify it to suit [your needs][2] like this:\r\n\r\n**UserBrowserAgent.hmtl**\r\n```html\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;base target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;response&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n      if (/Mobi/.test(navigator.userAgent)) {\r\n        // mobile!\r\n        document.getElementById(&quot;response&quot;).textContent = &quot;mobile&quot;;\r\n      } else {\r\n        // something else\r\n        document.getElementById(&quot;response&quot;).textContent = &quot;other&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n  &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Web app that calls the page**\r\n```\r\nfunction doGet() {\r\n  return HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile(&quot;UserBrowserAgent&quot;).evaluate().setTitle(&quot;User Agent - Google Apps Script&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ctrlq.org/code/20503-find-visitor-browser-os-google-apps-script\r\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229683/how-to-detect-mobile-user-with-google-app-script/58232403#58232403","title":"How to detect mobile user with Google App Script?"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":10282530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/965721746967955/picture?type=large","display_name":"catmandx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10282530/catmandx"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570176825,"creation_date":1570161131,"question_id":58229683,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58229683","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing an app for an organization and they use Google Sheets a lot, about half of them uses the mobile Sheets app.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to have an UI Alert if they change some cells&#39; values. This works fine on the desktop browser (Chrome PC, Firefox etc..) but it doesn&#39;t work on the mobile app. I know it wouldn&#39;t work, and it&#39;s messing up my code because after the alert there are some other codes to execute, example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction showAlert(message) {\r\n  var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();\r\n\r\n  var result = ui.alert(\r\n     &#39;Please confirm&#39;,\r\n     message,\r\n      ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO);\r\n\r\n  // Process the user&#39;s response.\r\n  if (result == ui.Button.YES) {\r\n    // User clicked &quot;Yes&quot;.\r\n    return true;\r\n  } else {\r\n    // User clicked &quot;No&quot; or X in the title bar.\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Test(){\r\n   if(showAlert(&quot;Are you sure?&quot;)){\r\n       Logger.log(&quot;User says yes&quot;);\r\n   }else{\r\n       Logger.log(&quot;No&quot;);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe execution time for a function in Google App Script is 300 seconds, and while the alert didn&#39;t show, the timer continued waiting for the user input. The result is the script timed out without executing other codes, like this:\r\n\r\n[![Example of a failed execution due to waiting for user input!][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIf there&#39;s a way to detect if an user is on mobile I can skip the alert so the codes can be executed, something like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Test(){\r\n    if( user not on mobile &amp;&amp; showAlert(&quot;Are you sure?&quot;){\r\n         Logger.log(&quot;User says Yes&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this possible? Or can I wait for 1 minute, if there&#39;s no response from the user, skip the alert and continue with other code?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/xC30t.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229683/how-to-detect-mobile-user-with-google-app-script","title":"How to detect mobile user with Google App Script?"},{"tags":["mysql","sql"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57829,"user_id":9473764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1a6d80ec4ac5549a392ae88fb0ed688?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9473764/nick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570161780,"post_id":58229749,"comment_id":102833887,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58229678/how-do-i-modify-the-case-where-function-to-give-me-the-total/58229749#comment102833887_58229749"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1100,"user_id":12022565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c2c8a3b0ce2375f236807e8cf806043?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Islingre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12022565/islingre"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570161721,"creation_date":1570161721,"answer_id":58229749,"question_id":58229678,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58229749","body_markdown":"You have a missing ```)``` in the ```ELSE``` part of the ```CASE```.
