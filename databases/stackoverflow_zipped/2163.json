So, to rerun only failed tests you need to use a test runner that records which tests passed or failed, and which can be instructed to run only tests it knows failed.\r\n\r\nThe tested runner in the Eclipse IDE can do this. Typically, and IDE is the only place you need this functionality, because an IDE is interactive and when using it you want fast feedback on whether a fix works.

I have 2 files, with few matching columns and there is a common column between them for comparison.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n``` \r\nTable 1 , about 10K rows\r\n| col1 | col2 | col3 |\r\n|------|------|------|\r\n| adam | key1 | def  |\r\n| mike | key2 | efg  |\r\n```\r\n```\r\nTable 2 , about 5k rows\r\n| col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 |\r\n|------|------|------|------|\r\n| adam | key1 | def  | abc  |\r\n| mike | key2 |      | cdf  |\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I am trying to get data from first file, compare it with the second one and if it is different, create a new file to get the complete row from first file.\r\nSo in above example, taking the first column as comparison column,\r\nfor adam, col1, 2, 3 are same so no update record required.\r\nfor mike, col2 value will is same, but the col3 has different value so it will be part of the update file.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am using python and this currently is too basic and I cannot seem to find a more efficient way for it\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ndf_1 = pd.read_excel(&quot;file1.xlsx&quot;)\r\ndf_2 = pd.read_excel(&quot;file2.xlsx&quot;)\r\n\r\ndf_1 = df_1.fillna(&#39;&#39;)\r\ndf_2 = df_2.fillna(&#39;&#39;)\r\n\r\ndf_3 =

break;\r\n            \r\nwriter = ExcelWriter(&quot;update.xlsx&quot;)\r\ndf_3.to_excel(writer,index=False,header=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried few variations like below, was trying to use something along lines of match on common row using the col1 value and then check if other two column values are same of different and return that, but it does not return all required data\r\n```\r\ndf_3 = df_1[(\r\n\t\t\tdf_1[&#39;col1&#39;].isin(df_2[&#39;col1&#39;]) &amp; \r\n\t\t\t\t(~df_1[&#39;col2&#39;].isin(df_2[&#39;col2&#39;]) \r\n\t\t\t\t| ~df_1[&#39;col3&#39;].isin(df_2[&#39;col3&#39;]) \r\n\t\t\t\t) \r\n\t\t\t)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n   col1  col2 col3\r\n0  mike  key2  efg

trying to make a class template that will have a vector of objects, and that will be able to run a function of the objects class on them, so i dont have to loop throw the objects and run the class i could just right something like \r\n```c++ \r\nallObjects.runFunc(objectsType::someFunc); \r\n```\r\nin the class I want 3 commands:\r\n\r\n* `add` - that adds an item to the Group  \r\n* `remove` - reomves an Item  \r\n* `runFunc(someFunc)` - thats the most important one, and i want it to run the `someFunc` on all the objects in the Group  \r\n\r\nand the class will have one varible:  \r\n`std::vector&lt;Object&gt; objects` - that will store all of the objects\r\n\r\nso Ive looked alot on the internet and havent found what i needed yet\r\nI tried using std::bind and got some really

are experiencing some strange problems with ranging and monitoring the same beacon region in the same time on iPhone 5S. These problems are not experienced on an iPhone XR so we suspect that it could be some kind of iOS issue on iPhone 5S. \r\n\r\n\r\niOS: 12.4.1\r\nDevice: iPhone 5S\r\nXcode: 10.3\r\nDeployment target set to: 12.4\r\nCode: Objective C\r\n\r\n**Description / steps of the problem:**\r\n\r\n- In a really simple test application we start monitoring and ranging a beacon region (with 2 beacons in proximity) in the same time (code snippet attached below)\r\n- We are logging the beacons found by the ranging process (in didRangeBeacons)\r\n- The app shows that 2 beacons are detected\r\n- Move the app in background, wait a little bit, and bring it into foreground again\r\n- The app will show only one beacon (the other one is lost)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n- When our test app detects only 1 beacon instead of 2 beacons, then any other apps on that iPhone 5S that uses ranging will detect just one beacon (this is why we suspect that it should be an iOS issue)\r\n- If that beacon region contains only 1 beacon then I can reproduce that issue only if I stop and restart the beacon in the proximity of the iPhone (the ranging process will not see it again). With 2 or more beacons it is reproducible even if the app is moved to background and brought into foreground again as noted above.\r\n- Sometimes if I close the screen of the iPhone and re-open it then the lost beacon will re-appear for a moment but it will disappear again\r\n- If &#39;startMonitoringForRegion&#39; is commented out in the code then everything works fine\r\n- The above issues are not reproducible on an iPhone XR\r\n\r\n\r\nDid somebody experienced the above issues and have a good workaround for them?

When I close the screen of the phone and reopen it with the app in foreground, usually the beacon re-appers (but sometimes just reappears for a several seconds and disappears again). When a beacon disappears from my app then it will not show up in any apps that ranges beacons (like Locate Beacons app). If I delete my app or comment out the `startMonitoringForRegion` call then the above problems are not happening and everything works fine.\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is that everything works fine on an iPhone XR and couldn&#39;t reproduce any of the above problems on it.

When i tried to execute the following command using Azure CLI i came across this error message.\r\n\r\n    az container exec --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $aciInstanceName --exec-command &quot;zap-baseline.py -t https://example.com -x OWASP-ZAP-Report.xml&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; rpc error: code = 2 desc = oci runtime error: exec failed:\r\n&gt; container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused &quot;exec:\r\n&gt; \\&quot;zap-baseline.py -t https://example.com -x OWASP-ZAP-Report.xml\\&quot;:\r\n&gt; stat zap-baseline.py -t https://example.com -x OWASP-ZAP-Report.xm l:\r\n&gt; no such file or directory&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen i did some digging around, I found that `az container exec` [command does not support using arguments on the official documentation][2].\r\n\r\nThen I created a custom docker image based off of owasp/zap2docker-stable image where I added a bash script that basically runs the same command and tried to call the bash file from Azure CLI\r\n\r\n    az container exec --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $aciInstanceName --exec-command &quot;execute-zap-baseline-test.sh&quot;\r\n\r\nBut then i get the following error message.\r\n\r\n&gt; rpc error: code = 2 desc = oci runtime error: exec failed:\r\n&gt; container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused &quot;exec format\r\n&gt; error&quot;\r\n\r\nWould really appreciate some help resolving this issue.

We simply load our aggregates from the db, perform the associated business logic and persist the result.\r\n\r\nIntroducing micro services will require asynchronous processing. In other words, we should send a command to a bus and return status code 202.\r\n\r\nIn our plan, we want to fire a command named `RequestInvitationConfirmation`. Basic validation will occur while instantiating this command. \r\n\r\nThen this command will be sent through the bus to a consumer in charge of:\r\n- Loading the invitation aggregates (make sure it exists)\r\n- Calling the RequestConfirmation methods (will check that the invitation can be confirmed)\r\n- Raising the `InvitationConfirmationRequested` event\r\n\r\nThe `InvitationConfirmationRequested` event will trigger a SAGA in charge of orchestrating the cross services communication\r\n\r\n- `OnInvitationConfirmationRequested`\r\n\t- Send `CreateUser` command\r\n- `OnUserCreated`\r\n\t- Send `CreateAccount` command\r\n- `OnAccountCreated`\r\n\t- Send `DeleteInvitation` command\r\n- `OnInvitationDeleted`\r\n\t- Raise `InvitationConfirmed`\r\n\r\nSince it&#39;s asynchronous we need to provide a way to get the current operation state. I saw (https://www.adayinthelifeof.nl/2011/06/02/asynchronous-operations-in-rest/, https://asyncrestapi.docs.apiary.io/#) that a common approach\r\nis to offer a `/queue/:id` OR `/actions/:id` endpoints.\r\n\r\nThis is where we get confused. How can you offer a single endpoint when states may be totally different from a SAGA to another?\r\n\r\nThx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026479/query-asynchronous-operation-state-within-a-micro-service-architecture","title":"Query asynchronous operation state within a micro service architecture"},{"tags":["r","machine-learning","r-caret"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1442,"user_id":2974951,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4596e20fc7b9882d10758f75da4d4b7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2974951","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2974951/user2974951"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568975290,"post_id":58026466,"comment_id":102455480,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026466/how-to-get-cut-off-scores-of-a-trained-algorithm-with-caret#comment102455480_58026466"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12078320,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71ac08eb9ba007c46aee9acb5e0990d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"atnplab","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078320/atnplab"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1442,"user_id":2974951,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4596e20fc7b9882d10758f75da4d4b7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2974951","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2974951/user2974951"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568976429,"post_id":58026466,"comment_id":102456004,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026466/how-to-get-cut-off-scores-of-a-trained-algorithm-with-caret#comment102456004_58026466"},{"owner":{"reputation":1442,"user_id":2974951,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4596e20fc7b9882d10758f75da4d4b7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2974951","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2974951/user2974951"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568976660,"post_id":58026466,"comment_id":102456115,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026466/how-to-get-cut-off-scores-of-a-trained-algorithm-with-caret#comment102456115_58026466"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12078320,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71ac08eb9ba007c46aee9acb5e0990d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"atnplab","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078320/atnplab"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1442,"user_id":2974951,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4596e20fc7b9882d10758f75da4d4b7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2974951","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2974951/user2974951"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568982219,"post_id":58026466,"comment_id":102458905,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026466/how-to-get-cut-off-scores-of-a-trained-algorithm-with-caret#comment102458905_58026466"},{"owner":{"reputation":1442,"user_id":2974951,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4596e20fc7b9882d10758f75da4d4b7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2974951","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2974951/user2974951"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569418432,"post_id":58026466,"comment_id":102591078,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026466/how-to-get-cut-off-scores-of-a-trained-algorithm-with-caret#comment102591078_58026466"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12078320,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71ac08eb9ba007c46aee9acb5e0990d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"atnplab","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078320/atnplab"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8498,"user_id":10323798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/723926e5087b067e92d4d877d604a304?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NelsonGon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568976913,"creation_date":1568974876,"last_edit_date":1568976913,"question_id":58026466,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58026466","body_markdown":"After selecting the most accurate ML technique with caret, I would like to get cut-off scores of the predictors on the class.

One simple way to do it is to console.log it.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSo, `this` is the DOM element you have your inline javascript on ! Confirmed here: [this in an inline event handler][2]. Okay, if you want to have more information, console.log paragraph.constructor.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nSo, it&#39;s a `HTMLParagraphElement`. That&#39;s what you would get if you call this:\r\n\r\n    document.createElement(&quot;p&quot;);\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to be able to call `this.setParagraphText`, it comes down to calling `setParagraphText` on an HTMLParagraphElement object. But in order to do that, HTMLParagraphElement has to implement it and one way to do this, as subarachnid suggested, is to add the function to its prototype so that it is shared by all instances of it. If you think this would be useful, take a look at Web Components.\r\n\r\nHere is a link: [Extending native HTML elements][4].\r\n\r\nBasically, you do it like this (and the cool thing here is the functionality, that is changing its content when clicking on it, will be encapsulated within the class):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n\r\n    \t// See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#element-interfaces\r\n    // for the list of other DOM interfaces.\r\n    class CoolParagraph extends HTMLParagraphElement {\r\n\r\n      constructor() {\r\n        super(); \r\n        this.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, e =&gt; this.setParagraphText(&#39;new value&#39;));\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      setParagraphText(v) {\r\n        this.innerHTML = v;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    customElements.define(&#39;cool-paragraph&#39;, CoolParagraph, {extends: &#39;p&#39;});\r\n    \t\t\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- This &lt;p&gt; is a cool paragraph. --&gt;\r\n    &lt;p is=&quot;cool-paragraph&quot;&gt;Cool paragraph!

drop down option field was empty with no options to change to. The problem is that it&#39;s hard to debug the issue because I can&#39;t step through my code and analyse variable values prior to the issue. I have searched for days for any way of seeing the values by either writing to console, making files with strings in them etc but no luck.\r\n\r\nLuckily I managed to locate the line of the issue by using alertdisplays which didn&#39;t show up but did crash the app if they were shown, so I was able to see how high up i could put the alertdisplay in my try catch statement before it would crash the app. If there was no crash it suggested that the try statement must have switched to the catch at the line before the alert display.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\n - It only breaks on android release mode\r\n - It works fine on IOS release and debug mode\r\n - Release mode works on android if I enable shared mono runtime (but this means I can&#39;t publish the app)\r\n - Debug mode works regardless of whether shared mono runtime is used\r\n - I&#39;ve tried both on a physical and virtual device for android, same outcome\r\n\r\nHere is the try catch statement which is meant to retrieve a list of specialties from a uri (putting the uri into my search bar shows me a correct list of specialties) which catches an exception:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language-all: csharp --&gt;\r\n\r\n    /// Summary: Gets the specialty list \r\n    /// Returns: JArray of specialties   \r\n    public async Task&lt;string&gt; getSpecialtyAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\r\n        var uri = new Uri(string.Format(&quot;https://medphys.royalsurrey.nhs.uk/space/tools/web_services.php?cmd=getSpecialtyList&quot;, string.Empty));            \r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            var response = await client.GetAsync(uri); //This line seems to cause the catch to fire\r\n            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\r\n            {\r\n                var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\r\n                return content;\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n        catch (Exception ex)\r\n        {\r\n            //How do i print out the exception here, along with some variable values?\r\n        }           \r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis appears in the console when I press the search button with an empty

would need to have all of your code and be able to run it locally in order to diagnose the problem because your posting is devoid of details (I would need to see inside your `ManipulatePixel` function, as well as the code that calls `ProcessFrame`). but here&#39;s some general tips that apply in your case.\r\n\r\n* 2D arrays in .NET are significantly slower than 1D arrays and staggered arrays, even in .NET Core today - this is a longstanding bug.\r\n    * See here:\r\n        * https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/4059\r\n        * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/468832/why-are-multi-dimensional-arrays-in-net-slower-than-normal-arrays\r\n        * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5476000/multi-dimensional-array-vs-one-dimensional\r\n    * So consider changing your code to use either a jagged array ([which also helps with memory locality/proximity caching, as each thread would have its own private buffer][1]) or a 1D array with your own code being responsible for bounds-checking.\r\n    * Or better-yet: use `stackalloc` to manage the buffer&#39;s lifetime and pass that by-pointer (`unsafe` ahoy!) to your thread delegate.\r\n\r\n* Sharing memory buffers between threads makes it harder for the system to optimize safe memory accesses.\r\n* Avoid allocating a new buffer for each frame encountered - if a frame has a limited lifespan then consider using reusable buffers using a buffer-pool.\r\n* Consider using the SIMD and AVX features in .NET. While modern C/C++ compilers are smart enough to compile code to use those instructions, the .NET JIT isn&#39;t so hot - but you can make explicit calls into [SMID/AVX instructions using the SIMD-enabled types][2] (you&#39;ll need to use .NET Core 2.0 or later for the best accelerated functionality)\r\n\r\n* Also, avoid copying individual bytes or scalar values inside a `for` loop in C#, instead consider using `Buffer.BlockCopy` for bulk copy operations (as these can use hardware memory copy features).\r\n\r\n* Regarding your observation of &quot;80% CPU usage&quot; - if you have a loop in a program then that _will_ cause 100% CPU usage within the time-slices provided by the operating-system - if you don&#39;t see 100% usage then your code then:\r\n    * Your code is actually running _faster_ than real-time (this is a good thing!) - (unless you&#39;re certain your program can&#39;t keep-up with the input?)\r\n    * Your codes&#39; thread (or threads) is blocked by something, such as a blocking IO call or a misplaced `Thread.Sleep`. Use tools like ETW to see what your process is doing when you think it should be CPU-bound.\r\n    * Ensure you aren&#39;t using any `lock` (`Monitor`) calls or using other thread or memory synchronization primitives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12065774/why-does-cache-locality-matter-for-array-performance\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/numerics#simd-enabled-types","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026420/full-cpu-usage-for-parallel-for-loops/58027830#58027830","title":"Full CPU usage for Parallel.For loops"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21847,"user_id":3666197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79fc6c23061326c7e6a6f82a1663634b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user3666197","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3666197/user3666197"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21847,"user_id":3666197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79fc6c23061326c7e6a6f82a1663634b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user3666197","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3666197/user3666197"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568983046,"last_edit_date":1568983046,"creation_date":1568982515,"answer_id":58028417,"question_id":58026420,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58028417","body_markdown":"&lt;sub&gt;Efficiency matters&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; ( it is **not** true-**`[PARALLEL]`**, but may, yet need not, benefit from a *&quot;just&quot;*-`[CONCURRENT]` work&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nThe BEST, yet a rather hard way, if ultimate performance is a MUST :\r\n------------\r\nin-line an assembly, optimised as per cache-line sizes in the CPU hierarchy and keep indexing that follows the actual memory-layout of the 2D data `{ column-wise | row-wise }`. Given there is no 2D-kernel-transformation mentioned, your process does not need to &quot;touch&quot; any topological-neighbours, the indexing can step in whatever order &quot;across&quot; both of the ranges of the 2D-domain and the `ManipulatePixel()` may get more efficient on transforming rather blocks-of pixels, instead of bearing all overheads for calling a process just for each isolated atomicised-1px ( ILP + cache-efficiency are on your side ).\r\n\r\nGiven your target production-platform CPU-family, best use (block-SIMD)-vectorised instructions available from AVX2, best AVX512 code. As you most probably know, may use C/C++ using AVX-intrinsics for performance optimisations with assembly-inspection and finally &quot;copy&quot; the best resulting assembly for your C# assembly-inlining.

With parallel loops, it would seem this creates competitive access of those properties from multriple threads which noticeably slows things down.\r\n- removed allocation of output buffers within the processing functions. They now return void and accept the output buffer as an argument. The caller creates one buffer for each image processing step (filtering, scaling, colorizing) only, which doesn&#39;t change in size but gets overwritten with each frame.\r\n- removed an extra data processing step where raw image data in the format ushort (what the camera originally spits out) was converted to double (actual temperature values). Instead, processing is applied to the raw data directly. Conversion to actual temperatures will be dealt with later, as necessary.\r\n\r\nI also tried, without success, to use 1D arrays instead of 2D but there is actually no difference in performance. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because the bug Dai mentioned was fixed in the meantime, but I couldn&#39;t confirm 2D arrays to be any slower than 1D arrays.\r\n\r\nProbably also worth mentioning, the ManipulatePixel() function in my original post was actually more of a placeholder rather than a real call to another function. Here&#39;s a more proper example of what I am doing to a frame, including the changes I made:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static void Rescale(ushort[,] originalImg, byte[,] scaledImg, in (ushort, ushort) limits)\r\n{\r\n  Debug.Assert(originalImg != null);\r\n  Debug.Assert(originalImg.Length != 0);\r\n  Debug.Assert(scaledImg != null);\r\n  Debug.Assert(scaledImg.Length == originalImg.Length);\r\n\r\n  ushort min = limits.Item1;\r\n  ushort max = limits.Item2;\r\n  int width = originalImg.GetLength(1);\r\n  int height = originalImg.GetLength(0);\r\n\r\n  Parallel.For(0, height, row =&gt;\r\n  {\r\n    for (var col = 0; col &lt; width; ++col)\r\n    {\r\n      ushort value = originalImg[row, col];\r\n      if (value &lt; min)\r\n        scaledImg[row, col] = 0;\r\n      else if (value &gt; max)\r\n        scaledImg[row, col] = 255;\r\n      else\r\n        scaledImg[row, col] = (byte)(255.0 * (value - min) / (max - min));\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is just one step and some others are much more complex but the approach would be similar.\r\n\r\nSome of the things mentioned like SIMD/AVX or the answer of user3666197 unfortunately are well beyond my abilities right now so I couldn&#39;t test that out.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s still relatively easy to put enough processing load into the stream to tank the frame rate but for my application the performance should be enough now. Thanks to everyone who provided input, I&#39;ll mark Dai&#39;s answer as accepted because I found it the most helpful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026420/full-cpu-usage-for-parallel-for-loops/58064505#58064505","title":"Full CPU usage for Parallel.For loops"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":11642908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98f21cf2a6178a23f016c426f7771932?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"flibbo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11642908/flibbo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":28,"user_id":11642908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98f21cf2a6178a23f016c426f7771932?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"flibbo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11642908/flibbo"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":90,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58027830,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569248340,"creation_date":1568974680,"last_edit_date":1568984219,"question_id":58026420,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58026420","body_markdown":"I am writing a WPF application that processes an image data stream from an IR camera. The application uses a class library for processing steps such as rescaling or colorizing, which I am also writing myself. An image processing step looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProcessFrame(double[,] frame)\r\n{\r\n  int width = frame.GetLength(1);\r\n  int height = frame.GetLength(0);\r\n  byte[,] result = new byte[height, width];\r\n  Parallel.For(0, height, row =&gt;\r\n  {\r\n    for(var col = 0; col &lt; width; ++col)\r\n      ManipulatePixel(frame[row, col]);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFrames are processed by a task that runs in the background. The issue is, that depending on how costly the specific processing algorithm is ( `ManipulatePixel()` ), the application can&#39;t keep up with the camera&#39;s frame rate any more. However, I have noticed that despite me using parallel for loops, the application simply won&#39;t use all of the CPU that is available - task manager performance tab shows about 60-80% CPU usage.\r\n\r\nI have used the same processing algorithms in C++ before, using the `concurrency::parallel_for` loops from the parallel patterns library. The C++ code uses all of the CPU it can get, as I would expect, and I also tried `PInvoking` a C++ DLL from my C# code, doing the same algorithm that runs slowly in the C# library - it also uses all the CPU power available, CPU usage is right at 100% virtually the whole time and there is no trouble at all keeping up with the camera.\r\n\r\nOutsourcing the code into a C++ DLL and then marshalling it back into C# is an extra hassle I&#39;d of course rather avoid. How do I make my C# code actually make use of all the CPU potential? I have tried increasing process priority like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  using (Process process = Process.GetCurrentProcess())\r\n    process.PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich has an effect, but only a very small one. I also tried setting the degree of parallelism for the `Parallel.For()` loops like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nParallelOptions parallelOptions = new ParallelOptions();\r\nparallelOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Environment.ProcessorCount;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then passing that to the `Parallel.For()` loop, this had no effect at all but I suppose that&#39;s not surprising since the default settings should already be optimized. I also tried setting this in the application configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;runtime&gt;\r\n  &lt;Thread_UseAllCpuGroups enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/Thread_UseAllCpuGroups&gt;\r\n  &lt;GCCpuGroup enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/GCCpuGroup&gt;\r\n  &lt;gcServer enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/gcServer&gt;\r\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this actually makes it run even slower.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**EDIT**:\r\nThe ProcessFrame code block I quoted originally was actually not quite correct. What I was doing at the time was:\r\n```\r\nProcessFrame(double[,] frame)\r\n{\r\n  byte[,] result = new byte[frame.GetLength(0), frame.GetLength(1)];\r\n  Parallel.For(0, frame.GetLength(0), row =&gt;\r\n  {\r\n    for(var col = 0; col &lt; frame.GetLength(1); ++col)\r\n      ManipulatePixel(frame[row, col]);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSorry for this, I was paraphrasing code at the time and I didn&#39;t realize that this is an actual pitfall, that produces different results. I have since changed the code to what I originally wrote (i.e. the width and height variables set at the beginning of the function, and the array&#39;s length properties only queried once each instead of in the for loop&#39;s conditional statements). Thank you @Seabizkit, your second comment inspired me to try this. The change in fact already makes the code run noticeably faster - I didn&#39;t realize this because C++ doesn&#39;t know 2D arrays so I had to pass the pixel dimensions as separate arguments anyway. Whether it is fast enough as it is I cannot say yet however.\r\n\r\nAlso thank you for the other answers, they contain a lot of things I don&#39;t know yet but it&#39;s great to know what I have to look for. I&#39;ll update once I reached a satisfactory result.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026420/full-cpu-usage-for-parallel-for-loops","title":"Full CPU usage for Parallel.For loops"},{"tags":["eclipse-scout"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":163,"user_id":3181809,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGTuS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3181809/andre"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568991660,"creation_date":1568991660,"answer_id":58030876,"question_id":58026418,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58030876","body_markdown":"The icons you see in the table footer are a concept called &#39;table controls&#39;.

I originally added the ```nullable = false``` as I thought &quot;yes, man, I always want to have that sort criteria / index for my list, so why should it be nullable?&quot;. But it seems that parameters serves a different purpose - *if any purpose at all* (maybe someone who has more information about that can share his knowledge in the comments).\r\n\r\nUsing ```@OrderColumn(name = &quot;item_index&quot;)``` I can see the following in the log (if SQL logging for Hibernate is activated):\r\n```\r\nHibernate: \r\n    /* insert org.example.TestOrderEntity\r\n        */ insert \r\n        into\r\n            test_order\r\n            (customer, number, id) \r\n        values\r\n            (?, ?, ?)\r\nHibernate: \r\n    /* insert org.example.TestOrderItemEntity\r\n        */ insert \r\n        into\r\n            test_order_item\r\n            (amount, article_number, order_id, id) \r\n        values\r\n            (?, ?, ?, ?)\r\nHibernate: \r\n    /* insert org.example.TestOrderItemEntity\r\n        */ insert \r\n        into\r\n            test_order_item\r\n            (amount, article_number, order_id, id) \r\n        values\r\n            (?, ?, ?, ?)\r\nHibernate: \r\n    update\r\n        test_order_item \r\n    set\r\n        item_index=? \r\n    where\r\n        id=?\r\nHibernate: \r\n    update\r\n        test_order_item \r\n    set\r\n        item_index=? \r\n    where\r\n        id=?\r\n```\r\nUp until this point I thought that the ```item_index``` will be inserted during the initial insert of the entity. But it isn&#39;t. Therefore having a NOT NULL column kills the approach of Hibernate. Also I&#39;m wondering why Hibernate uses extra SQL statements for doing that as the index position is known beforehand. Sure, the ID will be created during the initial insert. But it doesn&#39;t need to be known during the initial insert which could have included the ```item_index``` column value.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026416/jpa-hibernate-ordered-list-throws-constraintviolationexception/58027954#58027954","title":"JPA / Hibernate: Ordered list throws ConstraintViolationException"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11055481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEiKK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Grizzly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11055481/grizzly"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11055481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEiKK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Grizzly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11055481/grizzly"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568980633,"creation_date":1568974673,"last_edit_date":1568980067,"question_id":58026416,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58026416","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently working with Hibernate 5.3.7 and trying to use ordered list - which is done by the JPA annotation @OrderColumn.

For example, the project bin folder is &quot;C:\\Main\\MyMainProject\\MyMainProject\\bin&quot;, and DLL is loaded from C:\\MyProject\\MyAssembly.dll&quot;\r\n\r\n-If I move the &quot;MyAssembly.dll&quot; file into the bin folder (using `File.Copy()` or `File.Move()`), it somehow stop the rest of the code to be executed.\r\n\r\nThe error message I received\r\n\r\n```\r\nCould not load file or assembly &#39;MyAssembly, Version=1.0.0.0,\r\nCulture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=2c20c56a5e1f4bd4&#39; or one of its dependencies.\r\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n\r\nI know I can use `Assembly.LoadFrom(@&quot;PATH\\TO\\MY\\DLL&quot;)`, but the problem with this one is I cannot unload the

Create a function that calls the required API, handle request response and returns a Live Data. Make extra functions for the parameter to be passed with URL.\r\n- Create one View Model class, in that class, initialize above Repo class. Create a function that calls repo class function which returns Live Data and this function also returns LiveData. Make extra functions for the parameter to be passed to Repo for adding with URL.\r\n- In your View class (Activity/Fragment), initialize View Model class and pass those parameters which are required URL params. Call the View Model function, which returns Live Data and observe that in your View class.\r\n\r\nYou will get data in your View Class when any change appears in Live Data.\r\n\r\nAbove is a simple practice, but it can be made good by making responses generic according to your requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I&#39;ve used POSTMAN as well as already created a same functioning iOS app that is working with no issue. So my question is am i creating the single instance of OkHttpClient wrong? Or is OkHttpClient not suitable for this kind of ipcheck system? Should i use other library, and if yes, any suggestion and examples?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nCurrently i tried creating it like this :\r\n```\r\nclass MyApplication: Application(){\r\n    companion object{\r\n        lateinit var client: OkHttpClient\r\n    }\r\n    override fun onCreate(){\r\n        super.onCreate()\r\n        client = OkHttpClient()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen i created a helper class for it :\r\n```\r\nclass OkHttpRequest {\r\n    private var client : OkHttpClient = MyApplication.client\r\n\r\n    fun POST(url: String, parameters: HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;, callback: Callback): Call {\r\n        val builder = FormBody.Builder()\r\n        val it = parameters.entries.iterator()\r\n        while (it.hasNext()) {\r\n            val pair = it.next() as Map.Entry&lt;*, *&gt;\r\n            builder.add(pair.key.toString(), pair.value.toString())\r\n        }\r\n        val formBody = builder.build()\r\n        val request = Request.Builder()\r\n            .url(url)\r\n            .post(formBody)\r\n            .build()\r\n\r\n\r\n        val call = client.newCall(request)\r\n        call.enqueue(callback)\r\n        return call\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fun GET(url: String, callback: Callback): Call {\r\n        val request = Request.Builder()\r\n            .url(url)\r\n            .build()\r\n\r\n        val call = client.newCall(request)\r\n        call.enqueue(callback)\r\n        return call\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally I&#39;m using it like this : \r\n```\r\nval loginUrl = MyApplication.postLoginUrl\r\nvar userIdValue = user_id_textfield.text.toString()\r\nvar passwordValue = password_textfield.text.toString()\r\n\r\nval map: HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; = hashMapOf(&quot;email&quot; to userIdValue, &quot;password&quot; to passwordValue)\r\n\r\nvar request = OkHttpRequest()\r\nrequest.POST(loginUrl, map, object : Callback {\r\nval responseData = response.body?.string()\r\n    // do something with response Data\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd on another activity after user log in : \r\n```\r\nval getPaidTo = MyApplication.getPaidTo\r\nvar request = OkHttpRequest()\r\n\r\nrequest.GET(getPaidTo, object: Callback{\r\n    //do something with data\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026361/kotlin-okhttpclient-correct-way-of-creating-single-instance-okhttpclient-does","title":"Kotlin : Okhttpclient correct way of creating single instance?

in `didSelect` function .\r\n\r\n    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n    items = items.shiftRight(indexPath.row)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLast step is to add a property listener to your data source, so you can automatically refresh the `tableView` or the `collectionView` whenever it changes values like this \r\n\r\n    var items = [&quot;one&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;three&quot;,&quot;four&quot;,&quot;five&quot;] {\r\n        didSet {\r\n            //tableView.reloadData()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAdditionally to your case : \r\n\r\nChange this: `var items = [UserObject]()`\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    var items: [UserObject] = [] {\r\n            didSet {\r\n                DispatchQueue.main.async {\r\n                    tableView.reloadData()\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  [1]:

or such.\r\n\r\nI think I need to do this using transactions, so race conditions / concurrent requests wouldn&#39;t work, and a malicious user wouldn&#39;t be able to send concurrent requests and have multiple jobs start because all saw `locked = false` (as they started simultaneously)\r\n\r\nHow can I do this with Slick? My current attempt looks like this:\r\n\r\n    def lock(id: Long): Future[Int] = {\r\n            val select = (for {p &lt;- projects if p.id === id &amp;&amp; p.locked === false} yield l.locked)\r\n            val q = select.update(true).transactionally //attempting to use transactions\r\n            db.run(q)\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI believe `db.run` will return the number of rows which were updated, and if `p.locked === false` condition fails, then the number of rows updated will be 0, and I could use that to determine if project was successfully locked. And the `.transactionally` should perhaps make this run in transactions so concurrent requests won&#39;t be an issue.\r\n\r\nAre my assumptions / reasoning here correct? Is there a better way to do this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026303/how-to-avoid-concurrent-writes-to-a-row-using-slick","title":"How to avoid concurrent writes to a row using Slick?"},{"tags":["sql","arrays","postgresql","aggregate-functions","generate-series"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568974857,"post_id":58026300,"comment_id":102455257,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026300/how-to-get-arrays-from-a-normalised-table-that-stores-array-elements-by-index#comment102455257_58026300"},{"owner":{"reputation":8390,"user_id":593144,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a745d80a7031bdd56c5a3f5b04fd790f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Abelisto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/593144/abelisto"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568975969,"post_id":58026300,"comment_id":102455810,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026300/how-to-get-arrays-from-a-normalised-table-that-stores-array-elements-by-index#comment102455810_58026300"},{"owner":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568980487,"post_id":58026300,"comment_id":102457991,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026300/how-to-get-arrays-from-a-normalised-table-that-stores-array-elements-by-index#comment102457991_58026300"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569514883,"post_id":58026772,"comment_id":102630580,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58026300/how-to-get-arrays-from-a-normalised-table-that-stores-array-elements-by-index/58026772#comment102630580_58026772"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568975989,"creation_date":1568975989,"answer_id":58026772,"question_id":58026300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58026772","body_markdown":"Not sure if this qualifies as &quot;simpler&quot;

It seemed smart because the arrays were\r\nexpected to be sparse, and have their elements updated individually.\r\nLet&#39;s say this is the table:\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE values (\r\n        pk TEXT,\r\n        i INTEGER,\r\n        value REAL,\r\n        PRIMARY KEY (pk, i)\r\n    );\r\n\r\n&lt;!--&gt;\r\n\r\n     pk | i | value\r\n    ----+---+-------\r\n     A  | 0 | 17.5\r\n     A  | 1 | 32.7\r\n     A  | 3 | 5.3\r\n     B  | 1 | 13.5\r\n     B  | 2 | 4.8\r\n     B  | 4 | 89.1\r\n\r\nNow I would like to get these as real arrays, i.e. `{17.5, 32.7, NULL, 53}` for A and `{NULL, 13.5, 4.8, NULL, 89.1}` for B.\r\n\r\nI would have expected that it&#39;s easily possible with a grouping query\r\nand an appropriate aggregate function. However, it turned out that there\r\nis no such function that puts elements into an array by its index (or\r\nsubscript, as postgres calls it). It would&#39;ve been much simpler if the\r\nelements were successive - I just could&#39;ve used `array_agg` with\r\n`ORDER BY i`.
