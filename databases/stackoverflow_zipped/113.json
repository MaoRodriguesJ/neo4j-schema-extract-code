I want to optimize it so that I it takes less time. I have noticed that the last step of the job takes a lot of time (55 mins) (**see the screenshots of the spark job in Spark UI below**).\r\n\r\nI need to join a big dataset with a smaller one, apply transformations on this joined dataset (creating a new column).\r\n\r\nAt the end, I should have a dataset repartitioned based on the column `PSP` (**see snippet of the code below**). I also perform a sort at the end (sort each partition based on 3 columns).\r\n\r\nAll the details (infrastructure, configuration, code) can be found below.\r\n\r\n### Snippet of my code : ###\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    spark.conf.set(&quot;spark.sql.shuffle.partitions&quot;, 4158)\r\n\r\n    val uh = uh_months\r\n      .withColumn(&quot;UHDIN&quot;, datediff(to_date(unix_timestamp(col(&quot;UHDIN_YYYYMMDD&quot;), &quot;yyyyMMdd&quot;).cast(TimestampType)),\r\n        to_date(unix_timestamp(col(&quot;january&quot;), &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;).cast(TimestampType))))\r\n&quot;ddMMMyyyy&quot;)).cast(TimestampType)))\r\n      .withColumn(&quot;DVA_1&quot;, date_format(col(&quot;DVA&quot;), &quot;dd/MM/yyyy&quot;))\r\n      .drop(&quot;UHDIN_YYYYMMDD&quot;)\r\n      .drop(&quot;january&quot;)\r\n      .drop(&quot;DVA&quot;)\r\n      .persist()\r\n\r\n    val uh_flag_comment = new TransactionType().transform(uh)\r\n    uh.unpersist()\r\n\r\n    val uh_joined = uh_flag_comment.join(broadcast(smallDF), &quot;NO_NUM&quot;)\r\n      .select(\r\n        uh.col(&quot;*&quot;),\r\n        smallDF.col(&quot;PSP&quot;),\r\n        smallDF.col(&quot;minrel&quot;),\r\n        smallDF.col(&quot;Label&quot;),\r\n        smallDF.col(&quot;StartDate&quot;))\r\n      .withColumnRenamed(&quot;DVA_1&quot;, &quot;DVA&quot;)\r\n\r\n    smallDF.unpersist()\r\n\r\n    val uh_to_be_sorted = uh_joined.repartition(4158, col(&quot;PSP&quot;))\r\n    val uh_final = uh_joined.sortWithinPartitions(col(&quot;NO_NUM&quot;), col(&quot;UHDIN&quot;), col(&quot;HOURMV&quot;))\r\n\r\n    uh_final\r\n```\r\n\r\n`smallDF` is a small dataset (535MB) that I broadcast.\r\n\r\n`TransactionType` is a class where I add a new column of string elements to my `uh` dataframe based on the value of 3 columns (`MMED`, `DEBCRED`, `NMTGP`), checking the values of those columns using regex.\r\n\r\nI previously faced a lot of issues (job failing) because of shuffle blocks that were not found. I discovered that I was spilling to disk and had a lot of GC memory issues so I increased the &quot;spark.sql.shuffle.partitions&quot; to 4158.\r\n\r\n### WHY 4158 ? ###\r\n\r\n`Partition_count = (stage input data) / (target size of your partition)`\r\n\r\nso `Shuffle partition_count = (shuffle stage input data) / 200 MB = 860000/200=4300`\r\n\r\nI have `16*24 - 6 =378 cores availaible`. So if I want to run every tasks in one go, I should divide 4300 by 378 which is approximately 11. Then **11*378=4158**\r\n\r\n### Spark Version: 2.1 ###\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cluster configuration: ###\r\n\r\n- 24 compute nodes (workers)\r\n- 16 vcores each\r\n- 90 GB RAM per node\r\n- 6 cores are already being used by other processes/jobs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Spark configuration: ###\r\n\r\n-master: yarn\r\n\r\n-executor-memory: 26G\r\n\r\n-executor-cores: 5\r\n\r\n-driver memory: 70G\r\n\r\n-num-executors: 70\r\n\r\n-spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max=512\r\n\r\n-spark.driver.cores=5\r\n\r\n-spark.driver.maxResultSize=500m\r\n\r\n-spark.memory.storageFraction=0.4\r\n\r\n-spark.memory.fraction=0.9\r\n\r\n-spark.hadoop.fs.permissions.umask-mode=007\r\n\r\n\r\n### How is the job executed: ###\r\n\r\n\r\nWe build an artifact (jar) with IntelliJ and then send it to a server.

For the actual most recent table, you need to change the Order By clause from the sub query to `ORDER BY T1.\\&quot;DocDate\\&quot;,T1.\\&quot;DocTime\\&quot; DESC` and optionally, at the end of the entire query again to order the results.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507324/filtering-out-duplicate-entires-for-older-rows","title":"Filtering out duplicate entires for older rows"},{"tags":["drag-and-drop","angular7","pinchzoom","angular-material-7","angular-material-8"],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":1833509,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c721301da571b619cdce9f00456ad60?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"H3llrais3R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1833509/h3llrais3r"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571757096,"creation_date":1571757096,"question_id":58507323,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507323","body_markdown":"In the zoomed mode for pinch-zoom the drag doesn&#39;t align properly with the mouse pointer.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve detailed the problem here:https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-t7hwqg\r\n \r\n\r\nI expect the drag to work same way irrespective of the zoom.\r\nI saw in version 8 of angular material they have added @Input(&#39;cdkDragConstrainPosition&#39;)\r\nconstrainPosition: (point: Point, dragRef: DragRef) =&gt; Point, which will solve my problem as in the zoomed mode I can write a custom logic to map the drag properly with pointer, but I can&#39;t upgrade to version 8 as there are other parts of the application with version 7.\r\n\r\nSo if someone can suggest what can be done?

Deleting an object through a pointer to a base with non-virtual destructor has undefined behaviour.\r\n\r\n&gt; How delete knows, where the object starts in the memory?\r\n\r\nIn case of non-virtual destructor, you pass the starting address to the operator (or if you don&#39;t, then you have UB), so there&#39;s no mystery.\r\n\r\nIn case of virtual destructor, virtual dispatch is used. The compiler will somehow implement it to work correctly. Typically, a &quot;vptr&quot; is used.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507257/how-delete-knows-where-the-object-starts-in-the-memory/58507338#58507338","title":"How delete knows, where the object starts in the memory?"}],"owner":{"reputation":351,"user_id":266197,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c716172f17e144f8c252d28d2baa2d49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"smrt28","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/266197/smrt28"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1571757201,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571757446,"creation_date":1571756862,"question_id":58507257,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507257","body_markdown":"Consider following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Base1 { public: int a1; };\r\nclass Base2 { public: int a2; };\r\nclass Foo: public Base1, public Base2 {}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n   Foo *foo = new Foo();\r\n   Base2 *b = foo; \r\n   delete b; // note pointer foo != pointer b\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow delete knows, where the memory, which should be freed, begins? \r\n\r\nSince all the classes contain only atomic integers, is virtual destructor needed in this particular case?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507257/how-delete-knows-where-the-object-starts-in-the-memory","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How delete knows, where the object starts in the memory?"},{"tags":["java","netbeans"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3931,"user_id":1638237,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ffa06966d694c32fd87adbcd6bccdad6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nafas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1638237/nafas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571757054,"post_id":58507254,"comment_id":103342677,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507254/how-am-i-supposed-to-change-user-input-into-a-constructer-where-different-varia#comment103342677_58507254"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1958,"user_id":275347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10f731d047c7746e749039098536f12f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gunnar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/275347/gunnar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571768838,"post_id":58509917,"comment_id":103348262,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507254/how-am-i-supposed-to-change-user-input-into-a-constructer-where-different-varia/58509917#comment103348262_58509917"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11799079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3bc3c2ff2a7aead4af92c9ccf4b8c36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11799079/karla"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1958,"user_id":275347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10f731d047c7746e749039098536f12f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gunnar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/275347/gunnar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571788188,"post_id":58509917,"comment_id":103354541,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507254/how-am-i-supposed-to-change-user-input-into-a-constructer-where-different-varia/58509917#comment103354541_58509917"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11799079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3bc3c2ff2a7aead4af92c9ccf4b8c36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11799079/karla"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11799079,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3bc3c2ff2a7aead4af92c9ccf4b8c36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11799079/karla"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571788126,"last_edit_date":1571788126,"creation_date":1571767049,"answer_id":58509917,"question_id":58507254,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58509917","body_markdown":"Before creating a new Member, you need to deal with the input.\r\n\r\n**EDITED** Conforming suggested by Gunnar, first verify if the input is the way expected.

Because of design problem, this the only parameter it recieves: its signature: \r\n\r\n    public Integer create(String values){}\r\n\r\nMy problem is: How can I write a code in which the method will know what columns it has - in string names?\r\n\r\nI am thinking of:\r\n\r\n    Statement s = c.createStatement(); //c is of type Connection\r\n    String insert_Q = &quot;INSERT INTO &quot; + tableName + (THIS IS WHERE I AM STUCK - HOW TO RETRIEVE COLUMNS??) + &quot; VALUES(&#39;&quot; + VALUES    + &quot;&#39;);&quot; ;\r\n\r\n    s.executeUpdate(insert_Q);\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507222/insert-values-to-dynamic-mysql-table-without-knowing-its-columns","title":"Insert values to dynamic mysql table without knowing its columns"},{"tags":["http","retrofit2","okhttp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30031,"user_id":50543,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCFWL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Julian Reschke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/50543/julian-reschke"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571854768,"post_id":58507220,"comment_id":103381791,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58507220/made-sure-content-type-and-content-encoding-still-get-415-unsupported-media-typ#comment103381791_58507220"}],"owner":{"reputation":528,"user_id":4792543,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/645270bd35dead438a41818d71540eb3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Spider","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4792543/spider"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2562,"user_id":2088053,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94dea02770bfefa01a08fa848c7d622b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Yuri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2088053/yuri"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571850623,"creation_date":1571756761,"last_edit_date":1571850623,"question_id":58507220,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58507220","body_markdown":"In my application, I am sending request with *okhttp3* and *retrofit2*.

-Recurse  # if $recuseIfTrue was $true\r\n# or:\r\n#   Get-ChildItem -Path &#39;.&#39;           # if $recuseIfTrue was $false\r\nGet-ChildItem @parameters\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, loosely speaking:\r\n\r\n* use `$true` to _pass_ the switch\r\n* use `$false` to _not_ pass the switch.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to keep a single hashtable definition that unconditionally includes the switch parameter, but whose value can determine programmaticaly.\r\n\r\n**Caveat**: \r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, hashtable entry **`Recurse = $true`** translates to parameter **`-Recurse:$true`** and **`Recurse = $false`** doesn&#39;t translate into _omitting_ the parameter, it translates to passing **`-Recurse:$false`**.\r\n\r\n**In _most_ cases, _omitting_ a switch `-Foo` and passing it with value `$false` - i.e. `-Foo:$false` - are *equivalent*.**\r\n\r\n**However, commands _can_ detect the difference and sometimes _act differently_:**\r\n\r\nA notable example is the `-Confirm` common (switch) parameter: _omitting_ `-Confirm` means that the `$ConfirmPreference` preference variable is respected, whereas `-Confirm:$false` means that the preference variable should be _overridden_ (and confirmation should *not* be requested).\r\n\r\nIf you want to make this distinction yourself in a PowerShell script or function, you can call `$PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey(&#39;Foo&#39;)` in addition to checking the `$Foo` (`-Foo`) switch parameter variable&#39;s value.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re dealing with such a command and you want to programmatically enforce _omission_ of a switch parameter, you&#39;ll have no choice but to _conditionally_ add an entry for this switch, in a separate step:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Dynamically determine if -Recurse should be turned on.\r\n$recurseIfTrue = $true\r\n\r\n# A &#39;Recurse&#39;

However, since the `yarn` gem is so old (2011), and there is a npm/js library called yarn which is used to install npm packages: are you sure you need to use the `yarn` gem at all?

I think you better try for some bash script instead of bat.\r\n\r\nYou can use `SED` [Stream Editor][1] to search and replace characters from file.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nsed -i &#39;s#\\\\##g&#39; sample.txt # This will replace back slash from sample.txt\r\nsed -i &#39;s#/##g&#39; sample.txt # This will replace forward slash from sample.txt\r\n```\r\nTo execute for multiple files in a
