For training audio length is already known.\r\n\r\n&gt; how does one know when the speaker has ended one sentence and started another?\r\n\r\nThere are different strategies here. Decoders search for the silence to wrap around decoding. Silence doesn&#39;t necessary mean the break between sentences, there could be no break between sentences at all. There could be break in the middle of a sentence too. \r\n\r\nSo to find silence decoder can use standalone voice activity detection algorithm and break when VAD detects silence or decoder can analyze backtrack information to decide if silence appeared. The second method is a bit more reliable.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967222/how-to-determine-length-of-observation-sequence-for-hmm-in-speech-recognition/57972227#57972227","title":"How to determine length of observation sequence for HMM in speech recognition"}],"owner":{"reputation":1235,"user_id":699285,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/37511b1e65178162ce63a8920bb117b7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Marc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/699285/marc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568715766,"creation_date":1568693250,"question_id":57967222,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967222","body_markdown":"I&#39;m re-learning how to use Hidden Markov Models for speech recognition and I have a question. It seems that most/all discussions of using HMM&#39;s consider the case of a known sequence of observation: [O1, O2, O3,...,OT] where T is a known number. However, if we were to try to use a trained HMM on speech in real time, or in a WAV file where someone was speaking one sentence after another, how exactly does one select the value of T? In other words, how does one know when the speaker has ended one sentence and started another? Does a practical HMM for speech recognition just use a fixed value for T and periodically recomputes the optimal state sequence up to the current observation using a fixed size window of length T into the past? Or is there some better way for dynamically selecting T at any instance of time?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967222/how-to-determine-length-of-observation-sequence-for-hmm-in-speech-recognition","title":"How to determine length of observation sequence for HMM in speech recognition"},{"tags":["batch-file","vbscript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12474,"user_id":692942,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c23d23a6c35f8e8a0af302e6e86a9643?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lankymart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/692942/lankymart"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568713827,"post_id":57967214,"comment_id":102353398,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967214/passing-a-windows-path-to-a-vbs-script-which-then-runs-a-batch-file#comment102353398_57967214"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":12009993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e6d97f3f34bfdf2601ba26e6d3da555?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gh3ttoKinG.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12009993/gh3ttoking"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568702418,"creation_date":1568702418,"answer_id":57968651,"question_id":57967214,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57968651","body_markdown":"You forgot the ``&amp;`` as well as a space between the script and your argument.\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\n    CreateObject(&quot;Wscript.Shell&quot;).Run &quot;G:\\test\\clipTest.bat &quot; &amp; WScript.Arguments(0), 0, True","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967214/passing-a-windows-path-to-a-vbs-script-which-then-runs-a-batch-file/57968651#57968651","title":"Passing a windows path to a vbs script which then runs a batch file"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":1721958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f490e4a8dbb2f96c45b9823b1a38cab1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tyee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1721958/tyee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568736558,"post_id":57971408,"comment_id":102365885,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967214/passing-a-windows-path-to-a-vbs-script-which-then-runs-a-batch-file/57971408#comment102365885_57971408"},{"owner":{"reputation":483,"user_id":4181058,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":12,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30c4aaeafb9fbe6e2fcc095e7f2c4018?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Captain_Planet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4181058/captain-planet"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":76,"user_id":1721958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f490e4a8dbb2f96c45b9823b1a38cab1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tyee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1721958/tyee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568739002,"post_id":57971408,"comment_id":102366957,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967214/passing-a-windows-path-to-a-vbs-script-which-then-runs-a-batch-file/57971408#comment102366957_57971408"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":483,"user_id":4181058,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":12,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30c4aaeafb9fbe6e2fcc095e7f2c4018?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Captain_Planet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4181058/captain-planet"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568712882,"creation_date":1568712882,"answer_id":57971408,"question_id":57967214,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57971408","body_markdown":"Try the following.

This is different from\r\n&gt; C where const file scope variables have external linkage.\r\n\r\nAlso, having external symbols used in a function, most likely, would not prevent it from being inline-optimized, since the compiler would unpack the function in place, leave any external symbols in an as-is manner. These symbols are then resolved by the linker. However compilers implementations can vary so no definite word can be said about this. That said, using `extern const` would most likely not cause any trouble for inline optimization. (I tried with msvc, hinted inline with `__inline` keyword, and the emitted assembly shows that `SomeFunction()` got inlined).\r\n\r\nI would suggest using the `extern const` approach since there will be only one instance for each result object.\r\n\r\nBelow was my original answer, which is good to have if you use c++ 17 (with `extern const` you will have to write things twice: definition and then declaration, but not if you are using `inline` variables)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC++ 17 has been shipped with some features you need. Essentially, we can build the `my_result_t` class with `string_view`, `constexpr` and `inline` variable.

However, this can be avoided by implementing a `constexpr` &quot;strcmp&quot; function:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconstexpr bool strings_equal(char const* a, char const* b) {\r\n\treturn a == nullptr ? (b == nullptr) : (b != nullptr &amp;&amp; std::string_view(a) == b);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can happily use `const char *` in your result class instead of `string_view`!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://godbolt.org/z/4iJE3_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967210/should-immutable-global-objects-be-declared-as-const-my-result-t-blah-or-ext/57968333#57968333","title":"Should immutable global objects be declared as &#39;const my_result_t BLAH;&#39; or &#39;extern const my_result_t BLAH;&#39;?"}],"owner":{"reputation":43145,"user_id":131930,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91536fe27d32713b8a154a0bf42f6748?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeremy Friesner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/131930/jeremy-friesner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43145,"user_id":131930,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91536fe27d32713b8a154a0bf42f6748?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeremy Friesner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/131930/jeremy-friesner"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57968333,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568704573,"creation_date":1568693192,"last_edit_date":1568694359,"question_id":57967210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967210","body_markdown":"First, some motivating background info; I&#39;m experimenting with the idea of representing error-codes (returned from functions) as super-lightweight human-readable-strings rather than enum-integers, something like this:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n\r\n    /** Ultra-lightweight type for returning the success/error status from a function. */\r\n    class my_result_t\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n       /** Default constructor, creates a my_result_t indicating success */\r\n       my_result_t() : _errorString(NULL) {/* empty */}\r\n\r\n       /** Constructor for returning an error-result */\r\n       my_result_t(const char * s) : _errorString(s) {/* empty */}\r\n\r\n       /** Returns true iff the result was &quot;success&quot; */\r\n       bool IsOK() const {return (_errorString == NULL);}\r\n\r\n       /** Returns true iff the result was an error of some type */\r\n       bool IsError() const {return (_errorString != NULL);}\r\n\r\n       /** Return a human-readable description of the result */\r\n       const char * GetDescription() const {return _errorString ? _errorString : &quot;Success&quot;;}\r\n\r\n       /** Returns true iff the two objects are equivalent */\r\n       bool operator ==(const my_result_t &amp; rhs) const\r\n       {\r\n          return _errorString ?

Since `sizeof(my_result_t)==sizeof(const char *)`, this shouldn&#39;t be significantly less efficient than the traditional return-an-integer-error-code convention that e.g. POSIX likes to use.  (I do have to be careful not to return pointers-to-temporary-char-buffers, of course)\r\n\r\n... all that works reasonably well; my question concerns the subsequent refinement, which is the creation of some global `my_result_t` definitions for certain common error-types, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY(&quot;Out of Memory&quot;);\r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_ACCESS_DENIED(&quot;Access Denied&quot;);  \r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_BAD_ARGUMENT(&quot;Bad Argument&quot;);  \r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_FILE_NOT_FOUND(&quot;File not Found&quot;);  \r\n    [...]\r\n\r\n... that way the author of `SomeFunction()` could just `return RESULT_FILE_NOT_FOUND;` rather than being required to enter a custom error-string and risk typos, inconsistency with other function&#39;s result-strings for the same type of error, etc.\r\n\r\nMy question is, what is the most runtime-efficient way to declare these common/global result-codes?\r\n\r\nOne way to do it would be to make them &#39;singleton objects&#39;, like this:\r\n\r\n    // my_result_t.h  \r\n    extern const my_result_t RESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY(&quot;Out of Memory&quot;);\r\n    extern const my_result_t RESULT_ACCESS_DENIED(&quot;Access Denied&quot;);  \r\n    extern const my_result_t RESULT_BAD_ARGUMENT(&quot;Bad Argument&quot;);  \r\n    extern const my_result_t RESULT_FILE_NOT_FOUND(&quot;File not Found&quot;);  \r\n    \r\n    // my_result_t.cpp\r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY(&quot;Out of Memory&quot;);\r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_ACCESS_DENIED(&quot;Access Denied&quot;);  \r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_BAD_ARGUMENT(&quot;Bad Argument&quot;);  \r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_FILE_NOT_FOUND(&quot;File not Found&quot;);\r\n\r\n... or the other way, is to simply put the following in a central header file:\r\n\r\n    // my_result_t.h  \r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY(&quot;Out of Memory&quot;);\r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_ACCESS_DENIED(&quot;Access Denied&quot;);  \r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_BAD_ARGUMENT(&quot;Bad Argument&quot;);  \r\n    const my_result_t RESULT_FILE_NOT_FOUND(&quot;File not Found&quot;);  \r\n\r\n... this latter way seems to work fine, but I&#39;m not 100% confident it&#39;s kosher to do that; for one thing, it means that e.g. RESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY is a separate object in every translation unit, which seems like it might put stress on the linker to de-duplicate, or even invoke conceivably undefined behavior (I&#39;m not sure how the One Definition Rule applies here).  On the other hand, using the &quot;extern&quot; approach means that the actual contents of the `my_result_t` objects are only available to optimizer when compiling `my_result_t.cpp`, and not when compiling any other functions that reference these objects, which means the optimizer might not be able do inlining-optimizations.\r\n\r\nIs one approach better than the other, from the perspective of correctness, but also helping the optimizer to make the code as efficient as possible?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967210/should-immutable-global-objects-be-declared-as-const-my-result-t-blah-or-ext","title":"Should immutable global objects be declared as &#39;const my_result_t BLAH;&#39; or &#39;extern const my_result_t BLAH;&#39;?"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","jquery-dirtyforms"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7116041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/261cc9e89be60158d66d475fd488ec13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user7116041","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7116041/user7116041"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568922378,"creation_date":1568922378,"answer_id":58018052,"question_id":57967209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58018052","body_markdown":"try $(&quot;#uAForm&quot;).dirrty(&quot;setClean&quot;);\r\n\r\nI just got into needing to do the same thing and that worked for me.\r\n\r\nCheers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967209/jquery-dirrty-form-set-it-clean-manually/58018052#58018052","title":"jquery dirrty form set it clean manually"}],"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":11022213,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17377b5fadbe47cd08634ff5a271e2cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aayush Dahal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11022213/aayush-dahal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568922378,"creation_date":1568693191,"question_id":57967209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967209","body_markdown":"I am using jquery dirrty plugin to check the state of a form and prevent it from reloading if there are some unsaved changes.\r\n\r\nLink to [jquery.dirrty github][1]\r\n\r\nFlow:\r\n\r\n1) I have initialized jquery.dirty as follows\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(function(){\r\n\tinitializeDirtyForm();\r\n})\r\n\r\n/** dirty form initialization*/\r\nfunction initializeDirtyForm(){\r\n    $(&quot;#uAForm&quot;).dirrty().on(&quot;dirty&quot;, function(){\r\n        $(&quot;#uAFormSubmit&quot;).removeAttr(&quot;disabled&quot;);\r\n    }).on(&quot;clean&quot;, function(){\r\n        $(&quot;#uAFormSubmit&quot;).attr(&quot;disabled&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot;);\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) There is a table on the page and when it click on the td cells it make an ajax call.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction ajaxCallEdit()\r\n{\r\n\tvar result = checkDirtyStatus();\r\n        if(result === false) {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n    $.ajax({\r\n    \t....\r\n    \t....\r\n    \t....\r\n    \t....\r\n    \tsuccess:function(){\r\n           initializeDirtyForm();\r\n    \t}\r\n    )}\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** check if the form is dirty */\r\nfunction checkDirtyStatus(){\r\n    dirtyStatus = $(&quot;#uAForm&quot;).dirrty(&quot;isDirty&quot;);\r\n    if(dirtyStatus == true){\r\n        if (confirm(&quot;Changes you made may not be saved.

I have a google chrome extension that tracks some data and posts it to: Either a server on the web or a locally installed application on the user&#39;s machine; depending on the user&#39;s choice. So far the best way to do this *(so far, lemme know otherwise)* is to run AJAX&#39;s `post()` / `get()`. I noticed [w3schools&#39;s][1]  tutorials mentioned that jQuery is able to run AJAX&#39;s `post()` / `get()`;\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;I currently have [compressed jQuery][2] `3.4.1` downloaded to `extension_root/thirdParty/jquery.min.js` and am attempting to load it via the `extensions_root/manifest.json` file:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    &quot;background&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;scripts&quot;: [\r\n          &quot;thirdParty/jquery.min.js&quot;,\r\n          &quot;background.js&quot;\r\n        ],\r\n        &quot;persistent&quot;: true\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nIn my `extensions_root/background.js` I&#39;ve attempted to use `$` like the examples I&#39;ve seen. *This is the first time I&#39;ve ever used jQuery so am working based off of examples.* and anything using the `$()` breaks. **Error:**(Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function)\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;A sample I&#39;ve tried: `$(&#39;p&#39;).innerHTML = &#39;jQuery working&#39;;`\r\n\r\nNow I **did** notice that `jQuery` is defined, but I don&#39;t know how I use it, as `jQuery` in place of `$` also breaks. I noticed a similar problem [here][3] and was inspired by one of the comments to check whether `jQuery.fn.init` was defined, *it was*; But I&#39;m still stuck.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMy problems I still have are that I:&lt;br&gt;\r\n - A: Can&#39;t send data to a local server or a web server. (Due to B)&lt;br&gt;\r\n - B: Can&#39;t find any way to load / use jQuery\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.w3schools.com/JQuery/jquery_ajax_get_post.asp\r\n  [2]: https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10665324/jquery-not-loading-in-chrome-extension","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967203/how-to-post-get-data-to-another-server-in-a-chrome-extension","title":"How to post / get data to another server in a chrome extension"},{"tags":["python-3.x","python-3.6","python-3.7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32166,"user_id":2011147,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGRgf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Selcuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2011147/selcuk"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568693348,"post_id":57967199,"comment_id":102344852,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967199/greatest-in-number-a-b-c#comment102344852_57967199"},{"owner":{"reputation":35993,"user_id":6779307,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p7O3q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Patrick Haugh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6779307/patrick-haugh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568728660,"post_id":57967199,"comment_id":102361447,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967199/greatest-in-number-a-b-c#comment102361447_57967199"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10180949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4de2200492a829e8fe1c817a5daf83c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"khora","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10180949/khora"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568693335,"creation_date":1568693335,"answer_id":57967232,"question_id":57967199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57967232","body_markdown":"There is no question, but greater(1,1) probably returns &quot;equal&quot;, so you are then calling greatest(&quot;equal&quot;,1,1), causing you to compare a string with an integer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967199/greatest-in-number-a-b-c/57967232#57967232","title":"greatest in number a,b,c"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11586927,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7ZOf.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"root13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11586927/root13"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32166,"user_id":2011147,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGRgf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Selcuk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2011147/selcuk"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568693335,"creation_date":1568693094,"last_edit_date":1568693322,"question_id":57967199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967199","body_markdown":"    def greater(a,b):\r\n        if a &gt;

Due to the nature of the problem, FFT based approximations of convolution (e.g. scipy fftconvolve) is not desired, and the &quot;direct sum&quot; is the way to go. The images are ~(150, 150, 150) in size, and the largest kernels are ~(40, 40, 40) in size. the images are periodic (has periodic boundary condition, or needs to be padded by the same image) since ~100 such convolutions has to be done for one analysis, the speed of the convolution function is critical. \r\n\r\nI have implemented and tested several functions, including the scipy implementation of convolve with &quot;method = direct&quot;, and the results are shown below. I used a (100, 100, 100) image and a (7, 7, 7) kernel to benchmark the methods here:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport time\r\nfrom scipy import signal\r\nimage = np.random.rand(Nx,Ny,Nz)\r\nkernel = np.random.rand(3,5,7)\r\n\r\nsignal.convolve(image,kernel, mode=&#39;same&#39;,method = &quot;direct&quot;)\r\n```\r\ntook: 8.198s\r\n\r\nI then wrote my own function based on array addition\r\n```\r\ndef shift_array(array, a,b,c):\r\n    A = np.roll(array,a,axis = 0)\r\n    B = np.roll(A,b,axis = 1)\r\n    C = np.roll(B,c,axis = 2)\r\n    return C\r\n\r\ndef matrix_convolve2(image,kernel, mode = &quot;periodic&quot;):\r\n    if mode not in [&quot;periodic&quot;]:\r\n        raise NotImplemented\r\n    if mode is &quot;periodic&quot;:\r\n        Nx, Ny, Nz = image.shape\r\n        nx, ny, nz = kernel.shape\r\n        rx = nx//2\r\n        ry = ny//2\r\n        rz = nz//2\r\n        result = np.zeros((Nx, Ny, Nz))\r\n        for i in range(nx):\r\n            for j in range(ny):\r\n                for k in range(nz):\r\n                    result += kernel[i,j,k] * shift_array(image, rx-i, ry-j, rz-k) \r\n        return result\r\n\r\n\r\nmatrix_convolve2(image,kernel)\r\n```\r\ntook: 6.324s\r\n\r\nIt seems in this case the limiting factor here is the np.roll function for periodic boundary condition, so I tried to circumvented this by tilling up the input image\r\n```\r\ndef matrix_convolve_center(image,kernel):\r\n    # Only get convolve result for the &quot;central&quot; block\r\n    nx, ny, nz = kernel.shape\r\n    rx = nx//2\r\n    ry = ny//2\r\n    rz = nz//2\r\n    result = np.zeros((Nx, Ny, Nz))\r\n    for i in range(nx):\r\n        for j in range(ny):\r\n            for k in range(nz):\r\n                result += kernel[i,j,k] * image[Nx+i-rx:2*Nx+i-rx,Ny+j-ry:2*Ny+j-ry,Nz+k-rz:2*Nz+k-rz]\r\n    return result\r\n\r\ndef matrix_convolve3(image,kernel):\r\n    \r\n    Nx, Ny, Nz = image.shape\r\n    nx, ny, nz = kernel.shape\r\n\r\n    extended_image = np.tile(image,(3,3,3))\r\n    result = matrix_convolve_center(extended_image,kernel,Nx, Ny, Nz)\r\n    return result\r\n\r\nmatrix_convolve3(image,kernel)\r\n```\r\ntook: 2.639s\r\n\r\nThis approach gives the best performance so far, but still way too slow for actual application. \r\n\r\nI did some research, and it seems using &quot;Numba&quot; could significantly improve the performance, or maybe write the same function in a parallel way could help too, but I&#39;m not farmiliar with Numba, nor python parallelization (I had some bad experience with the `multiprocess` library... it seemed to skip iterations or suddenly stop sometimes) \r\n\r\nCould you guys help me here? Any improvement would be greatly appreciated.

{\r\n      return t.items.exists(itemId)\r\n        .then(exists =&gt; {\r\n          if (!exists) { // item does not exist\r\n            // 404\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          return t.items.isOwner(itemId, userId)\r\n            .then(isOwner =&gt; {\r\n              if (!isOwner) {\r\n                // redirect to some other page\r\n              }\r\n\r\n              return t.items.getById(itemId);\r\n            })\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n    .then(data =&gt; {\r\n      // OK, process data and render\r\n    })\r\n    .catch(console.error); // unexpected errors\r\n\r\nIf I try to redirect to a 404 page for instance, the promise will still be resolved afterwards.\r\nAn another way would be to have the following:\r\n\r\n    if (!exists) { // item does not exist\r\n      return Promise.reject(&#39;404&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    .then(data =&gt; {\r\n      // OK, process data and render\r\n    }, reason =&gt; {\r\n      // KO, conditions were not met to resolve\r\n    })\r\n\r\nwhich &#39;works&#39;, but catches both errors and unmet conditions. I would prefer to have a dedicated &#39;unmet condition&#39; handler.\r\n\r\nYet another approach I thought of:\r\n\r\n    var p = db.task(t =&gt; {\r\n      return t.items.exists(itemId)\r\n        .then(exists =&gt; {\r\n          if (!exists) { // item does not exist\r\n            //  resolve p (and break promise chain) with something like\r\n            //  p.resolve(() =&gt; {\r\n            //    return res.redirect...\r\n            //  });\r\n          }\r\n         \r\n          // else we can go on with the queries\r\n          return t.items.isOwner(itemId, userId);\r\n        }\r\n        .then(isOwner =&gt; {\r\n          if (!isOwner) {\r\n            // resolve p and redirect to some other page\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          return t.items.getById(itemId);\r\n        })\r\n        .then(item =&gt; {\r\n          // everything OK, resolve with a handler to render the page\r\n        });\r\n    })\r\n    .then(action =&gt; {\r\n      action();\r\n    })\r\n    .catch(console.error); // unexpected errors\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t see any way I can resolve `p`. Calling `Promise.resolve(...)` inside a nested promise resolves the next promise itself before falling through `p`&#39;s `then`.\r\n\r\nWhat is the recommended way of chaining conditional queries and dealing with different results in `pg-promise` while keeping an eye on performance?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://vitaly-t.github.io/pg-promise/Database.html#task","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967135/pg-promise-chaining-conditional-queries","title":"Pg-promise: chaining conditional queries"},{"tags":["regex","vue.js","routing","routes","vue-router"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":966850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9230eb855afaaedead516119dfe77a18?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jjmu15","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/966850/jjmu15"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568693582,"creation_date":1568693582,"answer_id":57967256,"question_id":57967134,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57967256","body_markdown":"Found the solution myself.

The project tree is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── CMakesList.txt\r\n├── First.h\r\n|\r\n└── include\r\n|    └──Second.h\r\n|\r\n└── src\r\n    └──First.cpp\r\n    └──Second.cpp\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I&#39;ve made the necessary changes to the CMakesList file, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1...3.15)\r\n\r\nproject(First VERSION 1.0 \r\n              DESCRIPTION &quot;It does very little&quot;\r\n              LANGUAGES CXX)\r\n\r\ninclude(GNUInstallDirs)\r\n\r\nadd_library(First SHARED \r\n    src/First.cpp\r\n    src/Second.cpp)\r\n\r\nset_target_properties(First PROPERTIES\r\n    VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION}\r\n    PUBLIC_HEADER First.h)\r\n\r\nconfigure_file(FIRST.pc.in FIRST.pc @ONLY)\r\n\r\ntarget_include_directories(First PRIVATE .)\r\n\r\ninstall(TARGETS First\r\n    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}\r\n    PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})\r\n\r\ninstall(FILES ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/First.pc\r\n    DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR}/pkgconfig)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this file is also run sucessfully. It builds the library with no errors. \r\n\r\nHowever, now, when I&#39;m linking the library and using it in another project, it does not compile, and gives me the following error: \r\n\r\n```\r\n /usr/local/include/First.h:36: error: include/Second.h: No such file or directory\r\n #include &quot;include/Second.h&quot;\r\n          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is:\r\n\r\n**How can I also create a directory (in this case, at /usr/local/include/) that contains all the necessary headers requested by my public header (as well as other headers that can be requested by the headers requested by my public header, etc)? In this case, I would like to include the &quot;Include&quot; directory at the same directory where my public header is.**\r\n\r\nSorry for the dumb question, I&#39;m just exploring!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967102/creating-a-c-shared-library-with-cmake-using-several-headers","title":"Creating a C++ Shared Library with CMake using several

App scripts noob here. I am trying to send email from google sheets and I have a working code. However, the challenge I have unaddressed is to paste an image in the email before sending it. The image that needs to be pasted is copied from the snipping tool. In Microsoft Outlook, I have used `.Show` function to preview the email and paste the image but I am unable to achieve the same in google app scripting. The image is different every time an email is sent and saving the image to a drive location defeats the automation effort so the preferred option is to paste the image before its sent.

This information needs to be persisted whether or not the trade failed because of validation errors, insufficient funds, or some other reason.

But I have had no automatic downloads of any kind and removing that made no difference.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967044/how-do-i-reference-native-asp-controls-in-typescript","title":"How do I reference native ASP controls in Typescript?"},{"tags":["android","webview"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7911514,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1007978656003227/picture?type=large","display_name":"Vishnu S Vichu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7911514/vishnu-s-vichu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568691750,"creation_date":1568691750,"question_id":57967042,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57967042","body_markdown":"I set up a webview for login.I want username and password auto filled after first login.It is working on the honor 8 mobile.It is not working in redmi note 6 pro \r\n\r\nI have already tired javascript codes to save login data\r\n\r\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n\r\n        requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);\r\n        getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN,WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);\r\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n        web_view=(WebView)findViewById(R.id.webview_scienceapp);\r\n        WebSettings webSettings_scienceapp=web_view.getSettings();\r\n        webSettings_scienceapp.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\r\n        webSettings_scienceapp.setDomStorageEnabled(true);\r\n        webSettings_scienceapp.setSavePassword(true);\r\n        webSettings_scienceapp.setSaveFormData(true);\r\n        CookieManager.getInstance().setAcceptCookie(true);\r\n        web_view.loadUrl(&quot;https://example.php&quot;);\r\n\r\n\r\n        web_view.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {\r\n\r\n            public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {\r\n\r\n                //Do you have cookies?\r\n                Log.d(&quot;Cookie&quot;, &quot;url: &quot; + url + &quot;, cookies: &quot; + CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie(url));\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967042/store-login-data-as-cookies","title":"store login data as cookies"},{"tags":["xml","vb.net","linq"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":5322755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153659943904074/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brett Hyland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5322755/brett-hyland"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568710861,"post_id":57968166,"comment_id":102351782,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967041/is-it-possible-to-get-a-single-element-from-xml-with-the-lowest-value/57968166#comment102351782_57968166"},{"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9,"user_id":5322755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153659943904074/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brett Hyland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5322755/brett-hyland"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568713404,"post_id":57968166,"comment_id":102353167,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967041/is-it-possible-to-get-a-single-element-from-xml-with-the-lowest-value/57968166#comment102353167_57968166"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568715258,"last_edit_date":1568715258,"creation_date":1568700116,"answer_id":57968166,"question_id":57967041,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57968166","body_markdown":"Use Xml linq with OrderBy.

The texture you&#39;re using for your particle has the color fading to black on the RGB channels, instead of being pure white or blue and only having the alpha channel contain the circle pattern.\r\n 2. The shader being used is &quot;pre-multiplying&quot; the color by the alpha, giving a darker look around semitransparent overlaps.\r\n 3. The particles are being lit and thus differences in position can result in differences in lighting, breaking color/shading continuity.\r\n\r\nIf you use a Unity &quot;Unlit&quot; particle shader, there should be no visible overlaps, assuming you don&#39;t have the first issue.

What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nFunction declaration: (contained in an object called `RentalCar`)   \r\n`void setMake(char make[5]);`\r\n\r\nHere is the code for `setMake()`:\r\n\r\n    void RentalCar::setMake(char make[5]){\r\n\t    for(int i = 0; (make+i) != &#39;\\0&#39;;i++){\r\n\t\t    *(m_make+i) = *(make+i);\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I call `setMake()` no matter what I pass the function the output is `Process returned` followed by a very large number.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967037/method-to-set-a-char-array-equal-to-each-other-wont-work","title":"Method to set a char array equal to each other wont work"},{"tags":["javascript","angular","typescript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4035,"user_id":11711316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Rg_GowQlj3w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfLj8t6hakEDETL9uz_CwtGbUd3oQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cuong Le Ngoc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11711316/cuong-le-ngoc"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568691852,"post_id":57967033,"comment_id":102344607,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967033/loading-spinner-with-ngif-not-showing-during-execution-of-function#comment102344607_57967033"},{"owner":{"reputation":5516,"user_id":4283738,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcb938f3ad5a68706c055de350612b01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"joyBlanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4283738/joyblanks"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568691870,"post_id":57967033,"comment_id":102344616,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967033/loading-spinner-with-ngif-not-showing-during-execution-of-function#comment102344616_57967033"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":11377766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/730cd9884a328f10ad707c99cd055f4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DarkIudeX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377766/darkiudex"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568773528,"post_id":57967086,"comment_id":102377167,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57967033/loading-spinner-with-ngif-not-showing-during-execution-of-function/57967086#comment102377167_57967086"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39261,"user_id":1009922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/K0eeL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ConnorsFan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1009922/connorsfan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39261,"user_id":1009922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/K0eeL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ConnorsFan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1009922/connorsfan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568772645,"last_edit_date":1568772645,"creation_date":1568692135,"answer_id":57967086,"question_id":57967033,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57967086","body_markdown":"To allow time for the spinner to initialize, you can run the code asynchronously after setting `loading` to `true`.

One with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` of &quot;H&quot; and the other &quot;D&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Reference for input of ```ACCOUNT CODE``` and ```SL DEBIT``` or ```SL CREDIT```][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe ```SL DEBIT``` OR ```SL CREDIT``` with the ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` of &quot;D&quot; will be summed up to the ```GL DEBIT``` or ```GL CREDIT``` of the row with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` of &quot;H&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![REFERENCE FOR WHEN DETAILS IS ADDED TO DATATABLE][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo if a user inputs another ```ACCOUNT CODE``` and the ```ACCOUNT NUMBER``` has the same leading numbers as the ```ACCOUNT CODE```, the ```SL CREDIT``` or ```SL DEBIT``` will be added to the ```GL DEBIT``` or ```GL CREDIT``` of the row with a &quot;H&quot; ```ACCOUNT TYPE```.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Reference for adding another ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` of &quot;D&quot;][3]][3]\r\n\r\nIn short, all ```SL DEBIT``` or ```SL CREDIT``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` of &quot;D&quot; will be summed to the ```GL DEBIT``` or ```GL CREDIT``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` of &quot;H&quot; as long as the leading 6 numbers of the ```ACCOUNT NUMBER``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;D&quot; is the same with the leading numbers of the ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;H&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo if a user inputs another ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with a different leading number than the ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;H&quot;, a new row with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;H&quot; and ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;D&quot; will be added.\r\n\r\n[![Reference for adding ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with a different leading number][4]][4]\r\n\r\nMy problem is when I add another ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with the same leading number as the second ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;D&quot; the ```SL CREDIT``` or ```SL DEBIT``` will be added to the first ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;H&quot; rather the the latest added ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;H&quot;.\r\n\r\n[![REFERENCE FOR THE PROBLEM][5]][5]\r\n\r\nI want to know how to get the row number of the last added ```ACCOUNT CODE``` with an ```ACCOUNT TYPE``` &quot;H&quot;\r\n\r\nHERE IS MY CODE\r\n```\r\nif ($(&#39;#transactionEntryTable&#39;).DataTable().hasValue(&quot;H&quot;) &amp;&amp; $(&#39;#transactionEntryTable&#39;).DataTable().hasValue(accountCode1) ) {\r\n\r\n           data = [accountCode,\r\n            accountTitle,\r\n            accountType,\r\n            accountHeadCode,\r\n            glDebit,\r\n            glCredit,\r\n            slDebit,\r\n            slCredit,\r\n            refNo];\r\n           dt.row.add(data).draw();\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            var table = $(&#39;#transactionEntryTable&#39;).DataTable();\r\n            let acctTotalValue = 0;\r\n            let acctTotalValue2 = 0;\r\n            let acctTotalValueD = 0;\r\n            \r\n            table.rows().eq(0).each(function(index){\r\n                var row = table.row( index );\r\n                console.log(row.data());\r\n                // the &quot;type&quot; column is #5, but arrays are 0 based, so subtract one.\r\n                \r\n                if (row.data()[3] == accountHeadCode ) {\r\n                    // the &quot;amount&quot; column is #2, but arrays are 0 based, so subtract one\r\n                    acctTotalValue += parseInt(row.data()[7]);\r\n                }\r\n                if (row.data()[3] == accountHeadCode ) {\r\n                    // the &quot;amount&quot; column is #2, but arrays are 0 based, so subtract one\r\n                    acctTotalValue2 += parseInt(row.data()[6]);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n            dt.cell({ row: 0, column: 5 }).data(+acctTotalValue.toFixed(2)).draw();\r\n            dt.cell({ row: 0, column: 4 }).data(+acctTotalValue2.toFixed(2)).draw();\r\n\r\n    }else{\r\n        data = [accountCode1,\r\n            accountTitle1,\r\n            accountType1,\r\n            accountHeadCode1,\r\n            glDebit1,\r\n            glCredit1,\r\n            slDebit1,\r\n            slCredit1,\r\n            refNo1];\r\n           dt.row.add(data).draw();\r\n           \r\n           data = [accountCode,\r\n            accountTitle,\r\n            accountType,\r\n            accountHeadCode,\r\n            glDebit,\r\n            glCredit,\r\n            slDebit,\r\n            slCredit,\r\n            refNo];\r\n           dt.row.add(data).draw();\r\n       }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther source code can be provided upon request.\r\n\r\nI am stuck.

Length is a method in Java that is used to get the length of a Java String that you know already.\r\n\r\n    if(s.charAt(s.length - 1) != &#39;)&#39;)\r\n\r\nSo your above statement should be as follows.\r\n\r\n    if(s.charAt(s.length() - 1) != &#39;)&#39;)\r\n\r\n**Issue 2**\r\n\r\nIn your `isValid` method it&#39;s returning a `boolean` value. The return type of that method is `boolean`. But you are not returning any boolean value inside your method. So you have to add a return statement. It may be,\r\n\r\n`return true;` or `return false;` or any `boolean variable` declared inside `isValid` method.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/3558960/robby-cornelissen\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/57967004/8440358","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57966991/valid-parentheses-java/57967100#57967100","title":"Valid Parentheses Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":367,"user_id":2603139,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad73ce07668e793760bf5b4d8a471b12?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2603139","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2603139/user2603139"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2433,"user_id":2621706,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0aead89db990468d5359999664020289?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Uwe Allner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2621706/uwe-allner"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":87,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57967004,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568705809,"creation_date":1568691248,"last_edit_date":1568705809,"question_id":57966991,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57966991","body_markdown":"I am trying to solve the Valid Parentheses problem in Java (described here among other places: [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/submissions/))\r\n\r\nMy code is as follows thus far:\r\n\r\n    class Solution {\r\n        public boolean isValid(String s) {\r\n            \r\n            if(s.charAt(0) =&quot;(&quot;) {\r\n                if(s.charAt(s.length-1) != &quot;)&quot;){\r\n                    system.out.println(&quot;false&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            if(s.charAt(0) =&quot;[&quot;) {\r\n                if(s.charAt(s.length-1) != &quot;]&quot;){\r\n                   system.out.println(&quot;false&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            if(s.charAt(0) =&quot;{&quot;) {\r\n                if(s.charAt(s.length-1) != &quot;}&quot;){\r\n                    system.out.println(&quot;false&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }       \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nCurrently I am getting the following error:\r\n\r\nLine 4: error: `unexpected type`\r\n        \r\n       if(s.charAt(0) =&quot;(&quot;){\r\n\r\nCan anyone advise on what the issue is?

If you could run VBA code in the protected view this would be a securtity hole.

That means if macros are enabled and the user is not in protected view he will not see the warning worksheet. But if macros are disabled or in protected view, the user will see the warning.\r\n\r\nMake sure to make the worksheet `ProtectionInfo` visible on `Workbook_BeforeClose` so it is shown again next time anyone opens it with macros disabled.
