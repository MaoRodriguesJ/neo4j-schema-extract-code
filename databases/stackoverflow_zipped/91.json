You&#39;re going to want to use masks and some form of [mean ranks](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.rank.html#mean-bilateral) to accomplish this.

My implementation has a triple loop, but maybe someone else can make it faster!\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, read in the image.

As I build and try a lot, I&#180;d like to define a &quot;unique&quot; number each build. After uploading, sometimes my ESP32 boots the old sketch, so I need a way to see if it is the last build version. ESP sends me the number via MQTT, all fine. \r\nAll I need to see is the same number while building to compare.\r\n\r\nAs I found out there is no way to define a random number at compile time and &quot;print&quot; it, so I decided to use `__TIME__` (hh:mm:ss). \r\n\r\nProblem is, `#pragma message` is always internal handled as a `#pragma warning`, so the colon gets interpreted as a instruction, only the hour is printed. If I add something at the end, I also get the seconds, f.e. \r\n`#pragma message (&quot;Last modified on &quot; __TIME__ &quot;x&quot;)`\r\nprints\r\n&quot;Last modified on 22 25x&quot; (hour and second), but that is the maximum I can get.\r\n\r\nI have also experimented with constexpr, but they do not get printed using `#pragma message`.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to also print out the minutes?

I know how to do one forecast, but I&#39;m confused with how to implement a multiple output approach where each forecast gives a vector of predictions for each hour in the day head for one shot (the multiple output strategy in https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-step-time-series-forecasting/).\r\n\r\nThe gist of what I&#39;ve done is get the code that predicts one time step, and modify it by converting the output into a sequence for the next 24 hours time shift, instead of just say one ElecPrice shifted 24 hours into the future:\r\n\r\n```\r\nY[&#39;ElecPrice1&#39;] = df[&#39;RT_LMP&#39;].shift(-1)\r\nY[&#39;ElecPrice2&#39;] = df[&#39;RT_LMP&#39;].shift(-2)\r\nY[&#39;ElecPrice3&#39;] = df[&#39;RT_LMP&#39;].shift(-3)\r\n...\r\nY[&#39;ElecPrice3&#39;] = df[&#39;RT_LMP&#39;].shift(-24)\r\n```\r\nI also changed the number of output signals my model has to predict.\r\n\r\nBasically I made an entire 24 new columns instead of just one for my predictions.

Whether or not it is revealing an actual bug in some type signature of RxJS, Redux Observable, or a bug in your code, or if it&#39;s &quot;just how it has to practically be&quot;, or something else, I&#39;m not immediately sure--sorry! Just wanted to drop by to at least let you know it&#39;s very very likely to be related.\r\n\r\nYou can avoid this by breaking your operations into sub streams, i.e. not piping as many operators.

Also the version of Python that I&#39;m running is 2.7 , I don&#39;t know if that would affect the outcome of this code.\r\n\r\nHere is the Code :\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMAX_KEY_SIZE = 26\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndef getMode():\r\n     while True:\r\n         print(&#39;Do you wish to encrypt or decrypt a message?&#39;)\r\n         mode = input()\r\n         if mode in &#39;encrypt e decrypt d&#39;.split():\r\n             return mode\r\n         else:\r\n             print(&#39;Enter either &quot;encrypt&quot; or &quot;e&quot; or &quot;decrypt&quot; or &quot;d&quot;.&#39;)\r\n\r\ndef getMessage():\r\n     print(&#39;Enter your message: &#39;)\r\n     return input()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndef getKey():\r\n     key = 0\r\n     while True:\r\n         print(&#39;Enter the key number (1-%s) &#39; % (MAX_KEY_SIZE))\r\n         key = int(input())\r\n         if (key &gt;= 1 and key &lt;= MAX_KEY_SIZE):\r\n            return key\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndef getTranslatedMessage(mode, message, key):\r\n     if mode[0] == &#39;d&#39;:\r\n         key = -key\r\n     translated = &#39;&#39;\r\n\r\n     for symbol in message:\r\n         if symbol.isalpha():\r\n             num = ord(symbol)\r\n             num += key\r\n\r\n             if symbol.isupper():\r\n                if num &gt; ord(&#39;Z&#39;):\r\n                    num -= 26\r\n                elif num &lt; ord(&#39;A&#39;):\r\n                    num +=  26\r\n             elif symbol.islower():\r\n                 if num &gt; ord(&#39;z&#39;):\r\n                     num -= 26\r\n                 elif num &lt; ord(&#39;a&#39;):\r\n                     num += 26\r\n\r\n             translated += chr(num)\r\n         else:\r\n             translated += symbol\r\n     return translated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmode = getMode()\r\nmessage = getMessage()\r\nkey = getKey()\r\n\r\nprint(&#39;Your translated text is: &#39;)\r\nprint(getTranslatedMessage(mode, message, key))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512222/caesar-cypher-code-is-throwing-an-nameerror-message-when-running-on-centos7","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Caesar cypher code is throwing an NameError message when running on Centos7"},{"tags":["computer-science","regular-language","automata","context-free-language","automata-theory"],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10526839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KoFWjcEztnY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBxVC9B_5DIoDIQ28wuf-S0EuLlzA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"gorillaman33","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10526839/gorillaman33"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571783875,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571777833,"creation_date":1571777833,"question_id":58512219,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58512219","body_markdown":"Let A and B be languages.

Once I have identified lines like this, I will put the first item of that line into a separate list.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first list above, the first two inner lists share ```&#39;G&#39;``` as their 5th item. Hence I would want to output one of these lists to a different list. This would create another list of lists, but one only with two layers of lists, not three layers of lists like my example.\r\n\r\nI have code that works to do this, but I think there must be a more efficient way of doing this, maybe using a loop, that I haven&#39;t figured out. Here is my current code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsharedLists1_2 = []\r\ni = 0\r\nwhile i &lt; len(allLinesList):\r\n\tif allLinesList[i][0][4] != &quot;.&quot; and allLinesList[i][0][4] == allLinesList[i][1][4] and allLinesList[i][1][4] != allLinesList[i][2][4] and allLinesList[i][1][4] != allLinesList[i][3][4]:\r\n\t\tsharedLists1_2.append(allLinesList[i][1])\r\n\ti +=1\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I am running a version of this code 6 times, to get all the pairwise combinations for the four items in my list ((1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,4)). \r\n\r\nHow can I get the same result but in a more efficient way that doesn&#39;t involve me putting in this block of code, but with different numbers, 6 times?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512212/sorting-through-lists-of-lists-to-find-shared-variants","title":"sorting through lists of lists to find shared

The `quickAdd` lambda in main is just so I don&#39;t have to always type `sortedSet` as the first parameter. You can naturally modify the `comp` function to get whatever behavior you want like sorting matching A keys by the B key, or A keys from high to low.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512198/c-sorted-set-of-objects/58512517#58512517","title":"C++ Sorted Set of Objects"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":660,"user_id":10803671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mt-5s4Zqfyk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-i_80atK5hWxwK60_Ren7qQV1TVuQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ALX23z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10803671/alx23z"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571783067,"creation_date":1571783067,"answer_id":58513049,"question_id":58512198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513049","body_markdown":"Just sort by both properties, with property `A` having a larger priority than property `B`.\r\n\r\n    class T\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n       int A;\r\n       int B;\r\n       bool operator &lt; (T other) const\r\n       {\r\n           return (A&lt;other.A) || ((A == other.A) &amp;&amp; (B &lt; other.B));\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ensure uniqueness without sorting by both parameters.

HTML `&lt;form&gt;` needs a submit button (and usually some controls) before it will call the controller action.  It looks like the form in your example is empty. \r\n\r\nYou haven&#39;t shown the controller, but let&#39;s assume you want to pass a string to the controller action, maybe to search or filter:\r\n\r\n    public ActionResult Index(string searchTerm)\r\n    {\r\n        // do something with parameters then return view\r\n        return View();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nInstead of this in your view:\r\n\r\n    Html.BeginForm(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Default&quot;, FormMethod.Get);    // empty form\r\n\r\nIt should be something like this:\r\n\r\n    @Html.BeginForm(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Default&quot;, FormMethod.Get) \r\n    {\r\n        // add controls here, what parameters are you passing? \r\n        @Html.TextBox(&quot;SearchTerm&quot;)\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Tag Helpers**\r\n\r\nSince you&#39;re using ASP.Net-Core you can take advantage of tag helpers which allow you to write code in a more HTML like manner.  I encourage you to read [Tag Helpers in forms in ASP.NET Core][1].  One way the above could be written using tag helpers is:\r\n\r\n    &lt;form asp-action=&quot;Index&quot; asp-controller=&quot;Default&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;SearchTerm&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;button&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**ActionLink**\r\n\r\nPerhaps you want to create a hyperlink to `Default/Index`?  In that case, use the `@Html.ActionLink` helper:\r\n\r\n    @Html.ActionLink(&quot;go to this link&quot;, &quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Default&quot;)\r\n\r\nWhich will create a regular anchor `&lt;a&gt;`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;a href=&quot;/Default&quot;&gt;go to this link&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n**Tag Helper version**\r\n\r\n    &lt;a asp-action=&quot;Index&quot; asp-controller=&quot;Default&quot; &gt;Click this link&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/mvc/views/working-with-forms?view=aspnetcore-3.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512188/asp-net-core-web-app-cshtml-file-cant-invoke-controller-method/58512550#58512550","title":"ASP.Net Core Web App - cshtml file can&#39;t invoke Controller method"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":787,"user_id":11398810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89bd7b8788ddd5146b748606d3ce59a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11398810/rena"},"last_editor":{"reputation":787,"user_id":11398810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89bd7b8788ddd5146b748606d3ce59a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11398810/rena"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571818746,"last_edit_date":1571818746,"creation_date":1571818401,"answer_id":58518386,"question_id":58512188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58518386","body_markdown":"Here is a simple demo that could get into the controller when the page loads:\r\n\r\n    &lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    &lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&#39;@Url.Action(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Default&quot;)&#39;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n    @section Scripts{ \r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n        $(function () { \r\n            $(&#39;form&#39;).submit();\r\n    });\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512188/asp-net-core-web-app-cshtml-file-cant-invoke-controller-method/58518386#58518386","title":"ASP.Net Core Web App - cshtml file can&#39;t invoke Controller method"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":1385322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c35322759cd5d384eee205b9bd05952?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eloise","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1385322/eloise"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3990,"user_id":9665021,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HlcMo.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"haldo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9665021/haldo"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571818746,"creation_date":1571777669,"last_edit_date":1571790097,"question_id":58512188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58512188","body_markdown":"Trying to invoke a method on my controller from my index.cshtml file.\r\n\r\n    Html.BeginForm(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Default&quot;, FormMethod.Get);\r\n\r\nWhere index is my method name, default is the controller and get is self explanatory.

But I don&#39;t know to get my data properly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n//Method to get Data :\r\ngetAllBars() {\r\n    this.afd.list(&#39;/Bar/&#39;).valueChanges().subscribe(\r\n      data =&gt; {\r\n          this.bars = data;\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n//Constructor with init:\r\nconstructor(private navCtrl: NavController, public modalCtrl: ModalController, public db:AngularFireDatabase) {\r\n    this.stackConfig = {\r\n      // Default setting only allows UP, LEFT and RIGHT so you can override this as below\r\n      allowedDirections: [\r\n        Direction.LEFT,\r\n        Direction.RIGHT\r\n      ],\r\n      throwOutConfidence: (offsetX, offsetY, element) =&gt; {\r\n        return Math.min(Math.abs(offsetX) / (element.offsetWidth/2), 1);\r\n      },\r\n      transform: (element, x, y, r) =&gt; {\r\n        this.onItemMove(element, x, y, r);\r\n      },\r\n      throwOutDistance: (d) =&gt; {\r\n        return 800;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n  } \r\n    ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.cards = [];\r\n    this.bars = [];\r\n    //this.users = USERS;\r\n    this.getAllBars();\r\n    this.addNewCard();\r\n    this.addNewCard();\r\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n      this.isLoading = false;\r\n    }, 3000);\r\n  }\r\n//Add my array to cards :\r\naddNewCard() {\r\n    console.log(&quot;BARS TABLEAU:&quot;, this.bars);\r\n    let differences = _.difference(this.bars, this.cards);\r\n\r\n    if (!differences.length) return;\r\n\r\n    let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * (differences.length));\r\n    this.cards.push(differences[randomIndex]);\r\n\r\n    console.info(&#39;CURRENT STACK:&#39;, this.cards.map(c =&gt; c.name));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThanks for help in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512184/how-to-get-my-data-from-firebase-database-with-ionic4","title":"How to get my data from Firebase Database with Ionic4"},{"tags":["oracle","oracle12c","database-performance","sql-tuning"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571778629,"post_id":58512183,"comment_id":103352105,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512183/how-to-know-the-statistics-are-up-to-date-in-oracle-database#comment103352105_58512183"},{"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":2761145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da67e643e0bd09c68c9e31d2c3e56e5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"general46","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2761145/general46"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571779070,"post_id":58512183,"comment_id":103352264,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512183/how-to-know-the-statistics-are-up-to-date-in-oracle-database#comment103352264_58512183"},{"owner":{"reputation":195944,"user_id":10397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a116491222bf3f94c85381528593fd7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Justin Cave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10397/justin-cave"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571781022,"post_id":58512183,"comment_id":103352831,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512183/how-to-know-the-statistics-are-up-to-date-in-oracle-database#comment103352831_58512183"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":2761145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da67e643e0bd09c68c9e31d2c3e56e5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"general46","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2761145/general46"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571827273,"post_id":58513110,"comment_id":103367284,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512183/how-to-know-the-statistics-are-up-to-date-in-oracle-database/58513110#comment103367284_58513110"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":37968,"user_id":213136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b84a36c241e04175fcec402dac43018?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bob Jarvis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/213136/bob-jarvis"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571783414,"creation_date":1571783414,"answer_id":58513110,"question_id":58512183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513110","body_markdown":"You can find this in the `XXX_TABLES` views (e.g. DBA_TABLES, USER_TABLES, ALL_TABLES).

Columns A and B in rows 0, 1, 2 are columns C and D in rows 3, 4, 5. \r\n\r\nFor example, in row 0, [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;] is [1, 2, 3, 4]. In row 3, [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;] is [3, 4, 1, 2]. \r\n\r\nThis is true with columns E and F as well---E values in rows 0, 1, 2 are the F values in rows 3, 4, 5. \r\n \r\nI would like to remove these &quot;mirror copy&quot; rows and only leave the &quot;unique&quot; pairs. The correct output above should be either:\r\n\r\n    ##     A   B   C   D   E   F\r\n    ## 0   1   2   3   4  47  27\r\n    ## 1   5   6   7   8  21  40\r\n    ## 2   9  10  11  12  45  33\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    ##     A   B   C   D   E   F\r\n    ## 0   3   4   1   2  27  47\r\n    ## 1   7   8   5   6  40  21\r\n    ## 2  11  12   9  10  33  45\r\n\r\nbut not both---only one copy of the rows. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how to subset a pandas DataFrame in order to remove these sorts of rows. How could one do this in an algorithmically efficient (without an explosion of memory) way? \r\n\r\nMy first idea is wrong, as it only checks per row:\r\n\r\n    df1 = df1[~((df1.A == df1.C) &amp; (df1.B == df1.D) &amp; (df1.E == df1.F))]\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated!

Instead,  you should parse out the portion of the `$_SERVER[&#39;REQUEST_URI&#39;]` value that you want, and map that through some kind of function or associative array to a non-user provided value. If the mapping produces no value, you know that something is wrong with the user provided data.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512125/insert-blob-image-in-mysql","title":"insert blob image in mysql"},{"tags":["javascript","video.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31424,"user_id":740553,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/764d053af4d74ff8aef282c01a37166e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike &#39;Pomax&#39; Kamermans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/740553/mike-pomax-kamermans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571779291,"post_id":58512123,"comment_id":103352334,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512123/how-to-reduce-javascript-for-video-js#comment103352334_58512123"},{"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":2790882,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2i6Z0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"slynagh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2790882/slynagh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571781042,"post_id":58512123,"comment_id":103352837,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512123/how-to-reduce-javascript-for-video-js#comment103352837_58512123"},{"owner":{"reputation":2007,"user_id":9964622,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EkXAHBaYomU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2Bs-8MB-H8pgJfyU9OTcdippVV6w/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user9964622","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9964622/user9964622"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571781765,"post_id":58512123,"comment_id":103353036,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512123/how-to-reduce-javascript-for-video-js#comment103353036_58512123"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10569111,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4a3fa3533dd5072c23d5c0549cc3ca6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10569111","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10569111/user10569111"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571795774,"post_id":58512123,"comment_id":103355909,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58512123/how-to-reduce-javascript-for-video-js#comment103355909_58512123"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10569111,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4a3fa3533dd5072c23d5c0549cc3ca6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10569111","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10569111/user10569111"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571777337,"creation_date":1571777337,"question_id":58512123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58512123","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to implement video-js on my company website, and it works beautifully.

I&#39;m sure this is a very simple problem to solve, but I&#39;m very new to loops and haven&#39;t been able to figure it out. I also don&#39;t know how to provide reproducible spatial data, so....\r\n\r\nI have spatial data consisting of a series of points from a tagged animal.  I&#39;m using the package `adehabitat` to create minimum convex polygons containing variable percentages of the points. I&#39;m then saving each polygon as a .shp file named with a unique animal id, the date range, and the percentage, and saving it to different directory depending on what site it comes from. This is an operation I perform a lot, so I&#39;d like to automate it as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is what I&#39;m using now:\r\n\r\n    library(sp)\r\n    library(adehabitatHR)\r\n    library(rgdal)\r\n    \r\n    df &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data.csv&#39;, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)\r\n    \r\n    site &lt;- &#39;SiteName&#39;\r\n    date &lt;- &#39;2019-06-22_2019-07-20&#39;\r\n    id &lt;- &#39;HAR04&#39;\r\n\r\n    # The adehabitat packages requires data to be in a spatial format.\r\n    coordinates(df) &lt;- df[, c(&#39;lon&#39;, &#39;lat&#39;)]\r\n    proj4string(df) = CRS(&quot;+init=epsg:4326&quot;)\r\n\r\n    # Create the polygons for each percentage point.\r\n    # The column specified just refers to the id, which adehabitat requires\r\n    mcp_est100 &lt;- mcp(df[, 2], percent = 100)\r\n    mcp_est90 &lt;- mcp(df[, 2], percent = 90)\r\n    mcp_est50 &lt;- mcp(df[, 2], percent = 50)\r\n    \r\n    # Save the polygons as shapefiles.\r\n    writeOGR(obj=mcp_est100,\r\n             dsn=site,\r\n             layer=paste(id, &#39;_&#39;, date, &#39;_100&#39;, sep=&#39;&#39;), \r\n             driver=&#39;ESRI Shapefile&#39;, overwrite_layer=TRUE)\r\n    \r\n    writeOGR(obj=mcp_est90,\r\n             dsn=site,\r\n             layer=paste(id, &#39;_&#39;, date, &#39;_90&#39;, sep=&#39;&#39;), \r\n             driver=&#39;ESRI Shapefile&#39;, overwrite_layer=TRUE)\r\n    \r\n    writeOGR(obj=mcp_est50,\r\n             dsn=site,\r\n             layer=paste(id, &#39;_&#39;, date, &#39;_50&#39;, sep=&#39;&#39;), \r\n             driver=&#39;ESRI Shapefile&#39;, overwrite_layer=TRUE)\r\n\r\nYou can see the code is highly repetitive and requires me to make changes in multiple locations if anything varies (ie, if I want 80% polygons instead of 50%). Is there a way for me to streamline this using `for` loops or some kind of `apply` function?

I am using deck, card, and hand classes.  The point of the program is to compare the players hand and the computers hand.  Whoever has the highest card wins.  If the highest two cards from each hand are equal, then the highest of the two middle cards wins, and if those are equal, the highest of the lowest cards.  If not, it&#39;s a tie.  My problem is where the compare function is comparing two hands.  I am getting erroneous results for my computer high card, and my computer middle card (c.hc and c.mc).  The results are correct in the sort function, but when they are pulled up in the compare function, it&#39;s not the right numbers.  However, the players hc, mc, and lc are correct as well as the computers lc.\r\n\r\nDisregard the strange words in my compare function.  I have them there to figure out where the program is pulling the winner result in my if statements.  Also disregard how weird it looks that the results of hc, mc, and lc come after the word &quot;winner is&quot;.  I only did this to see if my strange results were a result of the wrong numbers being in those parameters, and yes that was the problem.\r\n\r\n    Here is my main.cpp:\r\n    #include &quot;3chc.h&quot;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;ctime&gt;\r\n    using namespace std;\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n      srand(time(0));  \r\n      Deck d;\r\n      d.shuffle();\r\n    \r\n      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;computer: &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n      Hand comp(3);\r\n      comp.dealFrom(d);\r\n      comp.reveal();\r\n      comp.sort();\r\n    \r\n      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;player: &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n      Hand player(3);\r\n      player.dealFrom(d);\r\n      player.reveal();\r\n      player.sort();\r\n    \r\n      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Winner is &quot; &lt;&lt; player.compare(comp, player) &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    \r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    --------------------------------------------\r\n    \r\n    here is my 3chc.h:\r\n    \r\n    //3chc.h Deck, Card, and Hand classes\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class Card { \r\n      friend class Deck;\r\n      private:\r\n        int card_index; //card number 0 to 51\r\n        Card(int index) { card_index = index; } //made this private so user can&#39;t say card at index 100..can use it because of friend class\r\n      public:\r\n        Card() { card_index = 52; }\r\n        char suit() const;\r\n        char value() const;\r\n        std::string str() const;\r\n        int getValue(std::string c);\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class Deck {\r\n      private:\r\n        Card cards[52];\r\n        int pos;\r\n      public:\r\n        Deck();\r\n        Card deal() { return cards[pos++]; };\r\n        void shuffle();\r\n        int size() const { return 52 - pos; };\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class Hand {\r\n      friend class Deck;\r\n      friend class Card;\r\n      private:\r\n        int handSize;\r\n        int hc; //high card\r\n        int mc; //middle card\r\n        int lc; //low card\r\n        Card myCards[];\r\n        \r\n      public:   \r\n        Hand() { handSize = 1; };\r\n        Hand(int n) { handSize = n; };\r\n        void dealFrom(Deck&amp; d);\r\n        void reveal(); \r\n        //int getHandValues();   \r\n        int total();\r\n        void sort();\r\n        std::string compare(Hand&amp; c, Hand&amp;p);\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; out, const Card&amp; c);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    ----------------------------------------------\r\n    \r\n    and here is my 3chc.cpp:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    //3chc.cpp - Implementations of the Deck, Card, and Hand classes\r\n    #include &quot;3chc.h&quot;\r\n    #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    char Card::suit() const {\r\n      static char suits[] = { &#39;H&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;C&#39; };\r\n      //return card_index &lt; 52 ?
