My C# WinForms application is 32-bit and so is the referenced `FaceSDK.NET.dll`.\r\n\r\n - Windows 10 1903\r\n - Windows Forms Application\r\n - .NET Framework 4.8\r\n - 32-bit\r\n\r\nThe code simply creates a `Bitmap` object and tries to create a Luxand `CImage` object from it. Here is the code:\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate void ButtonDetect_Click (object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tvar pixelFormat = PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb;\r\n\t\t\tvar luxandImageMode = Luxand.FSDK.FSDK_IMAGEMODE.FSDK_IMAGE_COLOR_32BIT;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar bitmap = new Bitmap(100, 100, pixelFormat);\r\n\t\t\tusing (var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap))\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tgraphics.Clear(Color.Yellow);\r\n\t\t\t\tgraphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, 10, 10, bitmap.Width - (10 * 2), bitmap.Height - (10 * 2));\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar data = bitmap.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bitmap.Width, bitmap.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, bitmap.PixelFormat);\r\n\t\t\tvar buffer = new byte [data.Stride * data.Height];\r\n\t\t\tMarshal.Copy(data.Scan0, buffer, 0, buffer.Length);\r\n\t\t\tbitmap.UnlockBits(data);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar handle = 0;\r\n\t\t\tvar result = 0;\r\n\t\t\t//result = Luxand.FSDK.LoadImageFromCLRImage(ref handle, bitmap);\r\n\t\t\t//result = Luxand.FSDK.LoadImageFromFile(ref handle, @&quot;D:\\Images\\Test.png&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tresult = Luxand.FSDK.LoadImageFromBuffer(ref handle, buffer, data.Width, data.Height, data.Stride, luxandImageMode);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nThe code produces an `AccessViolationException: Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.`.\r\n\r\nThe last three lines ALWAYS produce this error no matter what combination of `PixelFormat` I use. It is strange that even loading various `Bitmaps/Jpegs/Pngs` image files also produces the same error.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** Just for good measure, I also tried the following in vain (same result):\r\n\r\n - 64-Bit\r\n - Console Application\r\n - LINQPad\r\n\r\nPlease note that the library needs to be activated: `Luxand.FSDK.ActivateLibrary(@&quot;Activation Code&quot;);`\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.luxand.com/facesdk/download/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446579/image-pixelformat-causing-accessviolationexception","title":"Image PixelFormat causing AccessViolationException"},{"tags":["c++","vb.net","openmp","solidworks","comobject"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":703,"user_id":2659161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29e7a0497c9070fbb0b9df262eef3dbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Craig","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2659161/craig"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571413372,"post_id":58446576,"comment_id":103245685,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446576/not-responding-during-the-execution-of-function-from-com-object#comment103245685_58446576"},{"owner":{"reputation":653,"user_id":5086631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKrb6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Keith Stein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5086631/keith-stein"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":703,"user_id":2659161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29e7a0497c9070fbb0b9df262eef3dbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Craig","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2659161/craig"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571428299,"post_id":58446576,"comment_id":103251748,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446576/not-responding-during-the-execution-of-function-from-com-object#comment103251748_58446576"},{"owner":{"reputation":466,"user_id":1706731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f140de688bf0671d92fabc6919a9d68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vladyslav Litunovsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1706731/vladyslav-litunovsky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571444862,"post_id":58446576,"comment_id":103255722,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446576/not-responding-during-the-execution-of-function-from-com-object#comment103255722_58446576"},{"owner":{"reputation":817870,"user_id":17034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cii6b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hans Passant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17034/hans-passant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571643785,"post_id":58446576,"comment_id":103295266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446576/not-responding-during-the-execution-of-function-from-com-object#comment103295266_58446576"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12237106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZoKk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"nigavevoli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12237106/nigavevoli"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":653,"user_id":5086631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKrb6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Keith Stein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5086631/keith-stein"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571649656,"post_id":58446576,"comment_id":103297858,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446576/not-responding-during-the-execution-of-function-from-com-object#comment103297858_58446576"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":703,"user_id":2659161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29e7a0497c9070fbb0b9df262eef3dbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Craig","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2659161/craig"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571665134,"post_id":58481721,"comment_id":103305729,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446576/not-responding-during-the-execution-of-function-from-com-object/58481721#comment103305729_58481721"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":530,"user_id":8089332,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df1a20c63e0888ffcb2569928c15e97e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8089332/vlad"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571643331,"creation_date":1571643331,"answer_id":58481721,"question_id":58446576,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58481721","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t think you can invoke solidworks API from multiple threads.

This spread out the size of x axis BUT reduced the size of the title and height.\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n(It might not look that way in this screenshot, but consider in the context of the 1st image. I want it to be that big)\r\n\r\nEssentially, all I want to do is either\r\n\r\n- Stretch out the x axis on the first image, without making reducing the size of the title or height or axis labels.\r\n\r\n- Or make the second image larger in general\r\n\r\n**Extra things I&#39;ve tried so far**\r\n\r\n- `fig.height`. This just makes the second image longer, but the titles still remain tiny and the width is still tiny no matter how large I set it.\r\n\r\n- `out.height` and `out.width`. If used by themselves, makes the plot absolutely minuscule no matter how small/large these values are. If used in conjunction with `fig.width`, doesn&#39;t make the graph any larger, can only make it smaller\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated\r\nHere&#39;s a sample aov object if people want to do some testing `aov_obj = aov(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Length*Sepal.Length, data = iris)`\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUTgm.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/g42Pz.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446564/ggforityautoplot-residual-plot-is-tiny","title":"ggfority::autoplot residual plot is tiny"},{"tags":["flow","dynamics-365","ms-flow"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":10726705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-824q9IOvesk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-i7iztM2LTt9YzFtvm65GkODorQ3A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tom Sutherland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10726705/tom-sutherland"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571388943,"creation_date":1571388943,"answer_id":58447316,"question_id":58446563,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58447316","body_markdown":"I fixed it myself.

below method is pretty verbose, because I&#39;m using string operations instead of a regex. This hopefully makes it a bit more readable for you, but I&#39;d suggest moving to a regex whenever you feel comfortable enough.\r\n\r\nPlease note, the function that deals with the string format to rename your scene will use a minimum of 2 digits (01, 02, etc) and a maximum of 3 digits (100, 101, etc). If you go above 999 iterations, you&#39;ll need to modify this slightly.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nThis methodology relies on an underscore before your file version (eg. _01.mb) instead of your current string index method.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport maya.cmds as cmds\r\n\r\ndef getNextVersion():\r\n    curName = cmds.file(query=True, expandName=True) # eg. D:/yourScene_01.mb\r\n    curVersionFull = curName.split(&#39;_&#39;)[-1]          # eg. 01.mb\r\n    versionExtension = curVersionFull.split(&#39;.&#39;)     # eg. [&#39;01&#39;, &#39;mb&#39;]\r\n    curVersionNum = int(versionExtension[0])         # eg. 1\r\n    extension = versionExtension[1]                  # eg. &#39;mb&#39;\r\n\r\n    nextVersionNum = curVersionNum + 1               # increment your version\r\n    if nextVersionNum &lt; 100:\r\n        nextVersionFull = &#39;{:02d}.{}&#39;.format(nextVersionNum, extension) # eg. 02.mb\r\n    else:\r\n        nextVersionFull = &#39;{:03d}.{}&#39;.format(nextVersionNum, extension) # eg. 100.mb\r\n\r\n    newName = curName.replace(curVersionFull, nextVersionFull)\r\n    return newName\r\n    \r\n\r\ncmds.file(rename=getNextVersion())\r\ncmds.file(save=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ve already accepted another answer, and I believe the core of your issue is what @green-cell describes. As for how that is even possible, I don&#39;t actually know. Maya would generally not let you save to a folder that doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nEg:\r\n```python\r\nimport maya.cmds as cmds\r\ncmds.file(rename=&quot;D:/doesntexist/somefile.mb&quot;)\r\n# Error: An invalid path was specified. : D:/doesntexist/\r\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n#   File &quot;&lt;maya console&gt;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n# RuntimeError: An invalid path was specified. : D:/doesntexist/ # \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, I&#39;ve thrown together a more thorough function for you here. Please note that it&#39;s difficult to cater for all possible filename patterns, especially if users are allowed to specify their own file names in any part of the process. This time I&#39;m using `regular expressions`, which makes your replacement much more robust (though, far from infallible).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\nimport os\r\nimport maya.cmds as cmds\r\n\r\ndef getNextVersion(createDir=True):\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;Find next available filename iteration based on current scene name\r\n    \r\n    Args:\r\n        createDir (bool, optional): True to create the output directory if required.

a direct approach is to look at the structure of your log file. \r\nIf the `Po` key is the second string, can do something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n    log_line = &#39;1     Po1(SU)     Eth      LACP      Eth1/24(P)   Eth2/24(P)   Eth3/24/10(P)&#39;\r\n\r\n    log_line_list = log_line.split()   # will look like: [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;Po1(SU)&#39;, &#39;Eth&#39;, ...]\r\n    k = log_line_list[1]

problem with setting the column to “not visible” in the grids `CellValueChanged` event is that while the scope of execution is in the `CellValueChanged` event, the grid is NOT going to give you ANY information about “where” the user clicked/moved “to” after the cells value changed.\r\n\r\nThis alone is ALWAYS going to leave hiding the column (in that event) prone to errors since we do not know “where” the user clicked/moved. Because of this it would appear obvious that if we want to avoid the error we are going to have to “hide” the column in some other event.\r\n\r\nAnother issue you may run into is that some events don’t like it when you try to “change” the grids “selected” cell, which is what we are looking to do when the user clicks on the column we want to make invisible. We need to “change” the selected cell to some other cell to avoid the error.\r\n\r\nGiven this, below is a hacky approach that may help. Be aware that there was NOT a lot of testing on the code and one issue/error occurred when the user clicked on the column header (to sort) for the first column. This caused a crash and I ended up turning the “sorting” off for that column.\r\n\r\nThe small example below uses this logic... A `DataGridView` with four (4) text columns is set on a form and filled with some data. `ConditionColumn` (column 0) in the grid is the “condition” column and it has string values from 0-19. It is this column that will trigger “when” to “hide” the `HideColumn` (column 2).\r\n\r\nIF a value greater than twenty (20) is entered into any cell in the `ConditionColumn,` THEN the `HideColumn` will be set as invisible. There is a small function `AllCellsLessThan20` that loops through all the rows in the grid and checks the `ConditionColumn` cells for any values that are greater than 20. If at least one cell value is greater than 20, then the function will return false. This is used to turn the hidden column on or off such that if ALL cells in the `ConditionColumn` are less than 20, then the column will be shown. Otherwise, if one or more cells is greater than 20, then the column will be hidden.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the error described, the code will set the column to invisible in the grids `SelectionChanged` event. This event will fire “after” the `CellValueChanged` event if the user selects another cell by any means… click, tab or arrow keys. We will check several things to determine if we need to hide or show the column.\r\n\r\nObviously since this event is called AFTER the `CellValueChange` event fired, the grid is not going to give us ANY information about “where” the previously selected cell was. Hence, the global variables. Setting these global values in the `CellValueChanged` event will make them available in the `SelectionChanged` event.\r\n\r\nMaybe some variables like:\r\n `ColumnShown` : `bool` to indicated if the column is currently hidden or shown.\r\n `ValueGreaterThan20`: `bool` to indicate if any value in the `ConditionColumn` is greater than 20\r\n and `PreviousRow` : `int` to indicate the row index of the last “Changed” cell.\r\n\r\n    bool ColumnShown = true;\r\n    bool ValueGreaterThan20 = false;\r\n    int PreviousRow = 0;\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the grids columns with some useful names to avoid any indexing problems, then fill the grid with some test data.\r\n\r\n    public Form1() {\r\n      InitializeComponent();\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[0].Name = &quot;ConditionColumn&quot;;\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[0].HeaderText = &quot;Condition&quot;;\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[2].Name = &quot;HideColumn&quot;;\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[2].HeaderText = &quot;Hide Column&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {\r\n      FillGrid();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void FillGrid() {\r\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {\r\n        dataGridView1.Rows.Add(i, &quot;C1R&quot; + i, &quot;C2R&quot; + i, &quot;C3R&quot; + i);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext is a function to check if any value in the `ConditionColumn` is greater than 20.\r\n\r\n    private bool AllCellsLessThan20() {\r\n      foreach (DataGridViewRow row in dataGridView1.Rows) {\r\n        if (row.Cells[0].Value != null) {\r\n          string sValue = row.Cells[&quot;ConditionColumn&quot;].Value.ToString();\r\n          if (int.TryParse(sValue, out int value)) {\r\n            if (value &gt; 20) {\r\n              return false;\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext, is the grids `CellValueChanged` event. Here we only need to check two things: 1) was the value changed in column 0 `ConditionColumn` and since a value did change in that column we need to check ALL the values. If any value is over 20, then set the variable `ValueGreaterThan20` to `true` otherwise `false`. Also, we will save the row index (`PreviousRow`) of the changed cell since we will want to use it in the `SelectionChanged` event.\r\n\r\n    private void dataGridView1_CellValueChanged(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) {\r\n      if (e.ColumnIndex == 0) {\r\n        if (AllCellsLessThan20())\r\n          ValueGreaterThan20 = false;\r\n        else\r\n          ValueGreaterThan20 = true;\r\n      }\r\n      PreviousRow = e.RowIndex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `SelectionChanged` event is below. I am aware this could be more compact. First a check is made to see if the column is shown or hidden.\r\n\r\nIf the column is already “hidden”, then we just need to check to make sure at least one value in the `ConditionColumn` is greater than 20 and simply leave it hidden. If all values are less than 20 then we want to un-hide the column.\r\n\r\nIf the column is NOT “hidden,” then we check to see if any values are greater than 20. If no values are greater than 20, then simply leave the column visible.\r\n\r\nIf the column is NOT “hidden,” and one or more values are greater than 20, then we need to check to see if the current selection is the column we want to hide. If the current selection is NOT the column we want to hide, then simply hide it since we know this will not throw an error.\r\n\r\nLastly, if the column is NOT “hidden” AND there is a value greater than 20 AND the current selection IS the column we want to hide. In this case the code will set/change the `CurrentCell` to the first cell in the `PreviousRow`. Then set the column to invisible and set the global variable `ColumnShown.`\r\n\r\nIn my test, if the user changes a cell in column 0 to a value grater than 20 then “Clicks” on a cell in column 2 `HideColumn`, then the error does not pop up and the selection changes to the first cell in the previous row.\r\n\r\n    private void dataGridView1_SelectionChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) {\r\n      if (ColumnShown) {\r\n        if (ValueGreaterThan20) {\r\n          int curColIndex = dataGridView1.CurrentCell.ColumnIndex;\r\n          if (dataGridView1.Columns[curColIndex].Name == &quot;HideColumn&quot;) {\r\n            dataGridView1.CurrentCell = dataGridView1.Rows[PreviousRow].Cells[&quot;ConditionColumn&quot;];\r\n            dataGridView1.CurrentCell.Selected = true;\r\n          }\r\n          dataGridView1.Columns[&quot;HideColumn&quot;].Visible = false;\r\n          ColumnShown = false;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n        if (!ValueGreaterThan20) {\r\n          dataGridView1.Columns[&quot;HideColumn&quot;].Visible = true;\r\n          ColumnShown = true;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I said its hacky but it works with some caveats.

I want to re-use **that** `HttpClientBuilder` but on-top of that **add** my own specific configurations, for each unique endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe problem though is that the `HttpCientBuilder` is not immutable with `withXYZ()` methods, nor is there a `copy` or `clone` method on the builder, so I can&#39;t copy the original and change just my specific changes there without altering the base `HttpClientBuilder` and get into conflicts with others that use the same instance of the builder. Be it racing conditions between threads or conflicting configurations between the different endpoints.\r\n\r\nOne place in the Spring Boot project where I have seen them seemingly wanting to do something similar is in `HttpClientConfiguration` of `Spring Cloud Commons` where it creates an own `ApacheHttpClientFactory` which takes the original autowired `HttpClientBuilder` and then sets `disableContentCompression()`, `disableCookieManagement()` and `useSystemProperties()` -- but it seemingly does it to the original instance of the `HttpClientBuilder` which just seems completely wrong to me. It will alter how all the built `HttpClient` works, and not just the one they will later be using in their Ribbon code in `HttpClientRibbonConfiguration` of `Spring Cloud Netflix Ribbon`. A potential bug in hiding? To me it seems like it, since it highly depends on calling order.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas how something like this should be solved?\r\n\r\nThe easy alternative that I could do is to just not try and build upon the given `HttpClientBuilder` from Sleuth, but instead build a completely new one from the ground-up every time I need one, and check if a `HttpTracing` bean is available and use `TracingHttpCientBuilder` instead of `HttpClientBuilder` in that case, but this seems counter-intuitive.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446515/spring-boot-extend-edit-apache-httpclientbuilder-with-different-configurations","title":"Spring Boot: Extend/Edit Apache

Unfortunately, this can&#39;t be adressed with the normal ggplot interface (as far as I know), but you could mess around in the gtable to produce the plot you want.\r\n\r\nConsider the following plot:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(grid)\r\n\r\ng &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)) +\r\n  geom_point() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ Species) +\r\n  theme(strip.background.x = element_rect(colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;white&quot;, \r\n                                          size = 0.5, linetype = &quot;solid&quot;),\r\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = &quot;black&quot;, size = 0.5))\r\ng\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nYou can see that the apparent linewidths of the facet strips and the axes are unequal. We can turn of the clipping by messing around in the gtable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Convert plot to gtable\r\ngt &lt;- ggplotGrob(g)\r\n\r\n# Find the strips\r\nis_strip &lt;- grep(&quot;strip&quot;, gt$layout$name)\r\n\r\n# Turn off clipping at highest level\r\ngt$layout$clip[is_strip] &lt;- &quot;off&quot;\r\n\r\n# Turn off clipping at the strip level\r\ngt$grobs[is_strip] &lt;- lapply(gt$grobs[is_strip], function(strip) {\r\n  strip$layout$clip &lt;- &quot;off&quot;\r\n  strip\r\n})\r\n\r\n# Plot\r\ngrid.newpage(); grid.draw(gt)\r\n```\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nNow the apparent linewidths are the intended linewidths, but it took quite some extra steps to get there.

(Which one of those two will work, seems to depend on the version of Firefox.)\r\n\r\nOr if you don&#39;t want your users to go changing advanced settings in Firefox, you can undo the Bootstrap CSS by setting the line-height for those inputs back to `normal` in your own CSS.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    input[type=date].form-control,input[type=datetime-local].form-control,input[type=month].form-control,input[type=time].form-control {\r\n      line-height:normal;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446491/why-does-a-bootstrap-3-date-input-look-different-in-firefox-compared-to-chrome/58446784#58446784","title":"Why does a Bootstrap 3 date input look different in Firefox compared to Chrome?"}],"owner":{"reputation":673,"user_id":3437688,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd1ae144fcd4cee87689c0e64542dd00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Barrosy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3437688/barrosy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16663,"user_id":2756409,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UIrGI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TylerH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2756409/tylerh"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58446784,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571388262,"creation_date":1571385826,"last_edit_date":1571386012,"question_id":58446491,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58446491","body_markdown":"Would anyone happen to know why there is a difference between the appearance of a Bootstrap 3 date picker input in Mozilla Firefox (as of version 69.0.1)  and Google Chrome (version 77.0.3865.120)?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to fix the appearance and if so, how could I fix this?

It just assumes the default, which means the columns will adjust to their content.\r\n\r\nSo the only solution is to work with the Word Open XML. Simplest would probably be to insert the entire table (at least the basic structures) using the OOXML methods of the Word JS API, rather than trying to change (replace) an existing table. \r\n\r\nThe column width, when set as a percentage, is controlled in a number of elements that define the table. This [link][1] to OfficeOpenXML.com may be useful.\r\n\r\nThe following Word Open XML, generated using the COM object model and the property `Table.Range.WordOpenXML`, illustrates the basic table structures of a table formatted as a percent of the page width (`w:tblW`), and cells as a percentage of the table&#39;s width (`w:tcW`). The table had two columns, set to 20% and 80%. Note that Word will minimally adjust the percentages based on its layout algorithm, so the actual percentage used in always an approximation.\r\n\r\nThe `w:gridCol` settings also reflect these proportions.\r\n\r\nBesides the percentages, the `w:type` attribute is important. It tells Word how to interpret the width settings: `w:type=&quot;pct&quot;` specifies &quot;percent&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe values may see quite large, that&#39;s because they&#39;re a ***fifths of a percent***. So 5000 is 100%.\r\n\r\n    &lt;w:tbl&gt;\r\n      &lt;w:tblPr&gt;&lt;w:tblStyle w:val=&quot;TableGrid&quot;/&gt;\r\n               &lt;w:tblW w:w=&quot;5000&quot; w:type=&quot;pct&quot;/&gt;\r\n               &lt;w:tblLayout w:type=&quot;fixed&quot;/&gt;\r\n               &lt;w:tblLook w:val=&quot;04A0&quot; w:firstRow=&quot;1&quot; w:lastRow=&quot;0&quot; w:firstColumn=&quot;1&quot; w:lastColumn=&quot;0&quot; w:noHBand=&quot;0&quot; w:noVBand=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;/w:tblPr&gt;\r\n      &lt;w:tblGrid&gt;&lt;w:gridCol w:w=&quot;944&quot;/&gt;&lt;w:gridCol w:w=&quot;3700&quot;/&gt;&lt;/w:tblGrid&gt;\r\n      &lt;w:tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;w:tc&gt;&lt;w:tcPr&gt;&lt;w:tcW w:w=&quot;1016&quot; w:type=&quot;pct&quot;/&gt;&lt;/w:tcPr&gt;\r\n              &lt;w:p/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/w:tc&gt;&lt;w:tc&gt;&lt;w:tcPr&gt;&lt;w:tcW w:w=&quot;3984&quot; w:type=&quot;pct&quot;/&gt;&lt;/w:tcPr&gt;\r\n              &lt;w:p/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/w:tc&gt;&lt;\r\n      /w:tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;/w:tbl&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://officeopenxml.com/WPtableWidth.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446490/how-to-set-table-width-percentage-using-office-js/58462658#58462658","title":"How to set table width percentage using office js"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":3879133,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b670a3ccb24e46a1a8efc6e2ef6a0ba0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3879133","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3879133/user3879133"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58462658,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571480361,"creation_date":1571385825,"question_id":58446490,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58446490","body_markdown":"I am working on Office JS word addin project.\r\nI am creating a table with 4 columns.

When you do your research, make sure that you include your security and integrity requirements in your assessment criteria.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446428/what-is-the-best-way-to-develop-a-java-file-transfer-application/58446768#58446768","title":"What is the best way to develop a java file transfer application?"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":3400722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3de74c91cc8285b48ff32179fe02d116?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sepointes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3400722/sepointes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":47,"user_id":3400722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3de74c91cc8285b48ff32179fe02d116?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sepointes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3400722/sepointes"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571388042,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571811138,"creation_date":1571385621,"last_edit_date":1571811138,"question_id":58446428,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58446428","body_markdown":"in one side i have an API that store many xml files.\r\non the other side, an another API have to receive all these files.\r\ni have created a service in the first API that create an ByteArrayOutputStream with all the files and return it.\r\n\r\nBut i&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the best solution if files are too large.\r\nHow can i receive in a safe way all the xml files in my second API ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446428/what-is-the-best-way-to-develop-a-java-file-transfer-application","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"What is the best way to develop a java file transfer application?"},{"tags":["javascript","bootstrap-4","tooltip","twitter-bootstrap-tooltip"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":321,"user_id":6793922,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Y5BAAUjz2V0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/uRjF9W5Vi9g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"hifebriansyah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6793922/hifebriansyah"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571386588,"creation_date":1571386588,"answer_id":58446684,"question_id":58446423,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58446684","body_markdown":"hopefully these links can help you, have a nice day!\r\n\r\ndiscussion https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13704789/can-i-use-complex-html-with-twitter-bootstraps-tooltip\r\n\r\nfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/44khF/200/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;.tooltip-demo.well&#39;).tooltip({\r\n      selector: &quot;a[rel=tooltip]&quot;\r\n    })\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;link href=&quot;http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/css/bootstrap-combined.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;tooltip-demo well&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0;&quot; class=&quot;muted&quot;&gt;Tight pants next level keffiyeh you probably haven&#39;t heard of them.

So it&#39;s retrying, it&#39;s just your expectations are off with how errors are going to be logged. If you want to log errors as they happen *before* the retry, you&#39;d need to use `tap` to produce a side effect before the `retry`:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    source$.pipe(\r\n       tap({ error: err =&gt; console.log(&#39;error: &#39;, err.message) }),\r\n       retry(5),\r\n    )\r\n    .subscribe({\r\n      next: value =&gt; console.log(value),\r\n      error: err =&gt; console.log(&#39;only fires once &#39;, err.message),\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n### Unrelated: You&#39;re doing something odd with async/await there.\r\nAlso, it doesn&#39;t make sense to `await source$.subscribe()`, because in doing so, your function will just return `Promise&lt;Subscription&gt;`. `subscribe` does not return a `Promise`.

9\tA13\t            A12\r\n    10\tA12\t            A14\r\n    ...\t...\t            ...\r\n    121\tA16\t            A21\r\n    122\tA21\t            A17\r\n    123\tA17\t            A16\r\n    124\tA16\t            A19\r\n    125\tA19\t            A24\r\n    126\tA24\t            A24\r\n    127\tA24\t            A27\r\n\r\nand i want to group it based on my intervals dataframe, and i want to count how many transitions made from state a to state b.\r\n\r\nI have written a code and it didnt show any error.\r\n\r\n    flrg = pd.DataFrame(columns=[&#39;Present State&#39;, &#39;Next State&#39;])\r\n    states = intervals[&quot;Ai&quot;]\r\n    firststate = []\r\n    secstate = []\r\n    counter = 0\r\n    for i in states:\r\n        for index, row in flr.iterrows():\r\n            temp = {}\r\n            if(i == row[&quot;Present State&quot;]):\r\n                if row[&quot;Next State&quot;] in temp:\r\n                    temp[row[&quot;Next State&quot;]] += 1\r\n                else:\r\n                    temp[row[&quot;Next State&quot;]] = 1\r\n        firststate.append(i)\r\n        secstate.append(temp)\r\n    flrg[&quot;Present State&quot;] = firststate\r\n    flrg[&quot;Next State&quot;] = secstate\r\n    \r\n    flrg  \r\n\r\nbut the results is not right. It only catched one transition.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Present State\tNext State\r\n    0\tA1\t            {}\r\n    1\tA2\t            {}\r\n    2\tA3\t            {}\r\n    3\tA4\t            {}\r\n    4\tA5\t            {}\r\n    5\tA6\t            {}\r\n    6\tA7\t            {}\r\n    7\tA8\t            {}\r\n    8\tA9\t            {}\r\n    9\tA10\t            {}\r\n    10\tA11\t            {}\r\n    11\tA12\t            {}\r\n    12\tA13\t            {}\r\n    13\tA14\t            {}\r\n    14\tA15\t            {}\r\n    15\tA16\t            {}\r\n    16\tA17\t            {}\r\n    17\tA18\t            {}\r\n    18\tA19\t            {}\r\n    19\tA20\t            {}\r\n    20\tA21\t            {}\r\n    21\tA22\t            {}\r\n    22\tA23\t            {}\r\n    23\tA24\t            {&#39;A27&#39;: 1}\r\n    24\tA25\t            {}\r\n    25\tA26\t            {}\r\n    26\tA27\t            {}\r\n         \r\nwhat should i do to fix it? I really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nthe output should be like this:\r\n\r\n        Present State\tNext State\r\n    0\tA1\t            {&#39;A4&#39;: 1}\r\n    1\tA2\t            {}\r\n    2\tA3\t            {&#39;A8&#39;: 1}\r\n    3\tA4\t            {&#39;A1&#39;: 1,&#39;A3&#39;: 1,&#39;A4&#39;: 1,&#39;A5&#39;: 1,&#39;A8&#39;: 1}\r\n    4\tA5\t            {&#39;A4&#39;: 1,&#39;A5&#39;: 1,&#39;A6&#39;: 1,&#39;A8&#39;: 2,&#39;A10&#39;: 1}\r\n    ..  ...             ...\r\n    22\tA23\t            {}\r\n    23\tA24\t            {&#39;A24&#39;: 1,&#39;A27&#39;: 1}\r\n    24\tA25\t            {}\r\n    25\tA26\t            {}\r\n    26\tA27\t            {}\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446568/grouping-data-in-pandas-for-fuzzy-logical-relationship-group","title":"Grouping data in pandas for fuzzy logical relationship group"},{"tags":["php","debugging","phpunit"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12259520,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/800eb3172f504229b4c1679261dffcbb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Felipe Gon&#231;alves","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12259520/felipe-gon%c3%a7alves"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571774632,"creation_date":1571774632,"answer_id":58511550,"question_id":58446567,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58511550","body_markdown":"I was having the same problem.

This hopefully makes it a bit more readable for you, but I&#39;d suggest moving to a regex whenever you feel comfortable enough.\r\n\r\nPlease note, the function that deals with the string format to rename your scene will use a minimum of 2 digits (01, 02, etc) and a maximum of 3 digits (100, 101, etc). If you go above 999 iterations, you&#39;ll need to modify this slightly.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nThis methodology relies on an underscore before your file version (eg. _01.mb) instead of your current string index method.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport maya.cmds as cmds\r\n\r\ndef getNextVersion():\r\n    curName = cmds.file(query=True, expandName=True) # eg. D:/yourScene_01.mb\r\n    curVersionFull = curName.split(&#39;_&#39;)[-1]          # eg. 01.mb\r\n    versionExtension = curVersionFull.split(&#39;.&#39;)     # eg. [&#39;01&#39;, &#39;mb&#39;]\r\n    curVersionNum = int(versionExtension[0])         # eg. 1\r\n    extension = versionExtension[1]                  # eg. &#39;mb&#39;\r\n\r\n    nextVersionNum = curVersionNum + 1               # increment your version\r\n    if nextVersionNum &lt; 100:\r\n        nextVersionFull = &#39;{:02d}.{}&#39;.format(nextVersionNum, extension) # eg. 02.mb\r\n    else:\r\n        nextVersionFull = &#39;{:03d}.{}&#39;.format(nextVersionNum, extension) # eg. 100.mb\r\n\r\n    newName = curName.replace(curVersionFull, nextVersionFull)\r\n    return newName\r\n    \r\n\r\ncmds.file(rename=getNextVersion())\r\ncmds.file(save=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ve already accepted another answer, and I believe the core of your issue is what @green-cell describes. As for how that is even possible, I don&#39;t actually know. Maya would generally not let you save to a folder that doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nEg:\r\n```python\r\nimport maya.cmds as cmds\r\ncmds.file(rename=&quot;D:/doesntexist/somefile.mb&quot;)\r\n# Error: An invalid path was specified. : D:/doesntexist/\r\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n#   File &quot;&lt;maya console&gt;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n# RuntimeError: An invalid path was specified. : D:/doesntexist/ # \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, I&#39;ve thrown together a more thorough function for you here. Please note that it&#39;s difficult to cater for all possible filename patterns, especially if users are allowed to specify their own file names in any part of the process. This time I&#39;m using `regular expressions`, which makes your replacement much more robust (though, far from infallible).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\nimport os\r\nimport maya.cmds as cmds\r\n\r\ndef getNextVersion(createDir=True):\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;Find next available filename iteration based on current scene name\r\n    \r\n    Args:\r\n        createDir (bool, optional): True to create the output directory if required.

problem with setting the column to “not visible” in the grids `CellValueChanged` event is that while the scope of execution is in the `CellValueChanged` event, the grid is NOT going to give you ANY information about “where” the user clicked/moved “to” after the cells value changed.\r\n\r\nThis alone is ALWAYS going to leave hiding the column (in that event) prone to errors since we do not know “where” the user clicked/moved. Because of this it would appear obvious that if we want to avoid the error we are going to have to “hide” the column in some other event.\r\n\r\nAnother issue you may run into is that some events don’t like it when you try to “change” the grids “selected” cell, which is what we are looking to do when the user clicks on the column we want to make invisible. We need to “change” the selected cell to some other cell to avoid the error.\r\n\r\nGiven this, below is a hacky approach that may help. Be aware that there was NOT a lot of testing on the code and one issue/error occurred when the user clicked on the column header (to sort) for the first column. This caused a crash and I ended up turning the “sorting” off for that column.\r\n\r\nThe small example below uses this logic... A `DataGridView` with four (4) text columns is set on a form and filled with some data. `ConditionColumn` (column 0) in the grid is the “condition” column and it has string values from 0-19. It is this column that will trigger “when” to “hide” the `HideColumn` (column 2).\r\n\r\nIF a value greater than twenty (20) is entered into any cell in the `ConditionColumn,` THEN the `HideColumn` will be set as invisible. There is a small function `AllCellsLessThan20` that loops through all the rows in the grid and checks the `ConditionColumn` cells for any values that are greater than 20. If at least one cell value is greater than 20, then the function will return false. This is used to turn the hidden column on or off such that if ALL cells in the `ConditionColumn` are less than 20, then the column will be shown. Otherwise, if one or more cells is greater than 20, then the column will be hidden.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the error described, the code will set the column to invisible in the grids `SelectionChanged` event. This event will fire “after” the `CellValueChanged` event if the user selects another cell by any means… click, tab or arrow keys. We will check several things to determine if we need to hide or show the column.\r\n\r\nObviously since this event is called AFTER the `CellValueChange` event fired, the grid is not going to give us ANY information about “where” the previously selected cell was. Hence, the global variables. Setting these global values in the `CellValueChanged` event will make them available in the `SelectionChanged` event.\r\n\r\nMaybe some variables like:\r\n `ColumnShown` : `bool` to indicated if the column is currently hidden or shown.\r\n `ValueGreaterThan20`: `bool` to indicate if any value in the `ConditionColumn` is greater than 20\r\n and `PreviousRow` : `int` to indicate the row index of the last “Changed” cell.\r\n\r\n    bool ColumnShown = true;\r\n    bool ValueGreaterThan20 = false;\r\n    int PreviousRow = 0;\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the grids columns with some useful names to avoid any indexing problems, then fill the grid with some test data.\r\n\r\n    public Form1() {\r\n      InitializeComponent();\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[0].Name = &quot;ConditionColumn&quot;;\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[0].HeaderText = &quot;Condition&quot;;\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[2].Name = &quot;HideColumn&quot;;\r\n      dataGridView1.Columns[2].HeaderText = &quot;Hide Column&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {\r\n      FillGrid();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void FillGrid() {\r\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {\r\n        dataGridView1.Rows.Add(i, &quot;C1R&quot; + i, &quot;C2R&quot; + i, &quot;C3R&quot; + i);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext is a function to check if any value in the `ConditionColumn` is greater than 20.\r\n\r\n    private bool AllCellsLessThan20() {\r\n      foreach (DataGridViewRow row in dataGridView1.Rows) {\r\n        if (row.Cells[0].Value != null) {\r\n          string sValue = row.Cells[&quot;ConditionColumn&quot;].Value.ToString();\r\n          if (int.TryParse(sValue, out int value)) {\r\n            if (value &gt; 20) {\r\n              return false;\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext, is the grids `CellValueChanged` event. Here we only need to check two things: 1) was the value changed in column 0 `ConditionColumn` and since a value did change in that column we need to check ALL the values. If any value is over 20, then set the variable `ValueGreaterThan20` to `true` otherwise `false`. Also, we will save the row index (`PreviousRow`) of the changed cell since we will want to use it in the `SelectionChanged` event.\r\n\r\n    private void dataGridView1_CellValueChanged(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) {\r\n      if (e.ColumnIndex == 0) {\r\n        if (AllCellsLessThan20())\r\n          ValueGreaterThan20 = false;\r\n        else\r\n          ValueGreaterThan20 = true;\r\n      }\r\n      PreviousRow = e.RowIndex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `SelectionChanged` event is below. I am aware this could be more compact. First a check is made to see if the column is shown or hidden.\r\n\r\nIf the column is already “hidden”, then we just need to check to make sure at least one value in the `ConditionColumn` is greater than 20 and simply leave it hidden. If all values are less than 20 then we want to un-hide the column.\r\n\r\nIf the column is NOT “hidden,” then we check to see if any values are greater than 20. If no values are greater than 20, then simply leave the column visible.\r\n\r\nIf the column is NOT “hidden,” and one or more values are greater than 20, then we need to check to see if the current selection is the column we want to hide. If the current selection is NOT the column we want to hide, then simply hide it since we know this will not throw an error.\r\n\r\nLastly, if the column is NOT “hidden” AND there is a value greater than 20 AND the current selection IS the column we want to hide. In this case the code will set/change the `CurrentCell` to the first cell in the `PreviousRow`. Then set the column to invisible and set the global variable `ColumnShown.`\r\n\r\nIn my test, if the user changes a cell in column 0 to a value grater than 20 then “Clicks” on a cell in column 2 `HideColumn`, then the error does not pop up and the selection changes to the first cell in the previous row.\r\n\r\n    private void dataGridView1_SelectionChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) {\r\n      if (ColumnShown) {\r\n        if (ValueGreaterThan20) {\r\n          int curColIndex = dataGridView1.CurrentCell.ColumnIndex;\r\n          if (dataGridView1.Columns[curColIndex].Name == &quot;HideColumn&quot;) {\r\n            dataGridView1.CurrentCell = dataGridView1.Rows[PreviousRow].Cells[&quot;ConditionColumn&quot;];\r\n            dataGridView1.CurrentCell.Selected = true;\r\n          }\r\n          dataGridView1.Columns[&quot;HideColumn&quot;].Visible = false;\r\n          ColumnShown = false;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n        if (!ValueGreaterThan20) {\r\n          dataGridView1.Columns[&quot;HideColumn&quot;].Visible = true;\r\n          ColumnShown = true;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I said its hacky but it works with some caveats. Hope this helps!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446522/current-cell-cannot-be-set-to-an-invisible-cell-in-datagridview-without-datasour/58516304#58516304","title":"Current cell cannot be set to an invisible cell in DataGridView WITHOUT DataSource"}],"owner":{"reputation":554,"user_id":7231208,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81a855a691f682ee29aece54720f1615?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mbjoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7231208/mbjoe"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":95,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"bounty_amount":100,"bounty_closes_date":1572249544,"accepted_answer_id":58516304,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571810156,"creation_date":1571385955,"question_id":58446522,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58446522","body_markdown":"I have a `dgv` C# DataGridView built without DataSource.\r\n\r\nI have a column with index `c` that is set to invisible when the value of a cell of another column changes to a certain value (within the `CellValueChanged` event handler):\r\n\r\n    dgv.Columns[c].Visible = false;\r\n\r\nThe `CellValueChanged` event handler is called after modifying the cell and then clicking on another cell.

I want to re-use **that** `HttpClientBuilder` but on-top of that **add** my own specific configurations, for each unique endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe problem though is that the `HttpCientBuilder` is not immutable with `withXYZ()` methods, nor is there a `copy` or `clone` method on the builder, so I can&#39;t copy the original and change just my specific changes there without altering the base `HttpClientBuilder` and get into conflicts with others that use the same instance of the builder. Be it racing conditions between threads or conflicting configurations between the different endpoints.\r\n\r\nOne place in the Spring Boot project where I have seen them seemingly wanting to do something similar is in `HttpClientConfiguration` of `Spring Cloud Commons` where it creates an own `ApacheHttpClientFactory` which takes the original autowired `HttpClientBuilder` and then sets `disableContentCompression()`, `disableCookieManagement()` and `useSystemProperties()` -- but it seemingly does it to the original instance of the `HttpClientBuilder` which just seems completely wrong to me. It will alter how all the built `HttpClient` works, and not just the one they will later be using in their Ribbon code in `HttpClientRibbonConfiguration` of `Spring Cloud Netflix Ribbon`. A potential bug in hiding? To me it seems like it, since it highly depends on calling order.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas how something like this should be solved?\r\n\r\nThe easy alternative that I could do is to just not try and build upon the given `HttpClientBuilder` from Sleuth, but instead build a completely new one from the ground-up every time I need one, and check if a `HttpTracing` bean is available and use `TracingHttpCientBuilder` instead of `HttpClientBuilder` in that case, but this seems counter-intuitive.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446515/spring-boot-extend-edit-apache-httpclientbuilder-with-different-configurations","title":"Spring Boot: Extend/Edit Apache

Unfortunately, this can&#39;t be adressed with the normal ggplot interface (as far as I know), but you could mess around in the gtable to produce the plot you want.\r\n\r\nConsider the following plot:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(grid)\r\n\r\ng &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)) +\r\n  geom_point() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ Species) +\r\n  theme(strip.background.x = element_rect(colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;white&quot;, \r\n                                          size = 0.5, linetype = &quot;solid&quot;),\r\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = &quot;black&quot;, size = 0.5))\r\ng\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nYou can see that the apparent linewidths of the facet strips and the axes are unequal. We can turn of the clipping by messing around in the gtable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Convert plot to gtable\r\ngt &lt;- ggplotGrob(g)\r\n\r\n# Find the strips\r\nis_strip &lt;- grep(&quot;strip&quot;, gt$layout$name)\r\n\r\n# Turn off clipping at highest level\r\ngt$layout$clip[is_strip] &lt;- &quot;off&quot;\r\n\r\n# Turn off clipping at the strip level\r\ngt$grobs[is_strip] &lt;- lapply(gt$grobs[is_strip], function(strip) {\r\n  strip$layout$clip &lt;- &quot;off&quot;\r\n  strip\r\n})\r\n\r\n# Plot\r\ngrid.newpage(); grid.draw(gt)\r\n```\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nNow the apparent linewidths are the intended linewidths, but it took quite some extra steps to get there.

It just assumes the default, which means the columns will adjust to their content.\r\n\r\nSo the only solution is to work with the Word Open XML. Simplest would probably be to insert the entire table (at least the basic structures) using the OOXML methods of the Word JS API, rather than trying to change (replace) an existing table. \r\n\r\nThe column width, when set as a percentage, is controlled in a number of elements that define the table. This [link][1] to OfficeOpenXML.com may be useful.\r\n\r\nThe following Word Open XML, generated using the COM object model and the property `Table.Range.WordOpenXML`, illustrates the basic table structures of a table formatted as a percent of the page width (`w:tblW`), and cells as a percentage of the table&#39;s width (`w:tcW`). The table had two columns, set to 20% and 80%. Note that Word will minimally adjust the percentages based on its layout algorithm, so the actual percentage used in always an approximation.\r\n\r\nThe `w:gridCol` settings also reflect these proportions.\r\n\r\nBesides the percentages, the `w:type` attribute is important. It tells Word how to interpret the width settings: `w:type=&quot;pct&quot;` specifies &quot;percent&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe values may see quite large, that&#39;s because they&#39;re a ***fifths of a percent***. So 5000 is 100%.\r\n\r\n    &lt;w:tbl&gt;\r\n      &lt;w:tblPr&gt;&lt;w:tblStyle w:val=&quot;TableGrid&quot;/&gt;\r\n               &lt;w:tblW w:w=&quot;5000&quot; w:type=&quot;pct&quot;/&gt;\r\n               &lt;w:tblLayout w:type=&quot;fixed&quot;/&gt;\r\n               &lt;w:tblLook w:val=&quot;04A0&quot; w:firstRow=&quot;1&quot; w:lastRow=&quot;0&quot; w:firstColumn=&quot;1&quot; w:lastColumn=&quot;0&quot; w:noHBand=&quot;0&quot; w:noVBand=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;/w:tblPr&gt;\r\n      &lt;w:tblGrid&gt;&lt;w:gridCol w:w=&quot;944&quot;/&gt;&lt;w:gridCol w:w=&quot;3700&quot;/&gt;&lt;/w:tblGrid&gt;\r\n      &lt;w:tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;w:tc&gt;&lt;w:tcPr&gt;&lt;w:tcW w:w=&quot;1016&quot; w:type=&quot;pct&quot;/&gt;&lt;/w:tcPr&gt;\r\n              &lt;w:p/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/w:tc&gt;&lt;w:tc&gt;&lt;w:tcPr&gt;&lt;w:tcW w:w=&quot;3984&quot; w:type=&quot;pct&quot;/&gt;&lt;/w:tcPr&gt;\r\n              &lt;w:p/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/w:tc&gt;&lt;\r\n      /w:tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;/w:tbl&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://officeopenxml.com/WPtableWidth.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58446490/how-to-set-table-width-percentage-using-office-js/58462658#58462658","title":"How to set table width percentage using office js"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":3879133,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b670a3ccb24e46a1a8efc6e2ef6a0ba0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3879133","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3879133/user3879133"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58462658,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571480361,"creation_date":1571385825,"question_id":58446490,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58446490","body_markdown":"I am working on Office JS word addin project.\r\nI am creating a table with 4 columns.

So it&#39;s retrying, it&#39;s just your expectations are off with how errors are going to be logged. If you want to log errors as they happen *before* the retry, you&#39;d need to use `tap` to produce a side effect before the `retry`:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    source$.pipe(\r\n       tap({ error: err =&gt; console.log(&#39;error: &#39;, err.message) }),\r\n       retry(5),\r\n    )\r\n    .subscribe({\r\n      next: value =&gt; console.log(value),\r\n      error: err =&gt; console.log(&#39;only fires once &#39;, err.message),\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n### Unrelated: You&#39;re doing something odd with async/await there.\r\nAlso, it doesn&#39;t make sense to `await source$.subscribe()`, because in doing so, your function will just return `Promise&lt;Subscription&gt;`. `subscribe` does not return a `Promise`.
