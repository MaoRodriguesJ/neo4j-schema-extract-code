posting a solution, let&#39;s take a look at the input range.\r\n\r\neach letter of the word will be anything inside of [A,Z] or [a-z].\r\n\r\nNow below is the logic that I would like to use in order to calculate whether a given input is - `before`, `inside` or `outside`.\r\n\r\n    1. Let&#39;s initialize two variables - startWord and endWord.\r\n    2. Take input for the above two variables.\r\n    3. Now, I create a map which stores value for each letter constant. As per the question, my values will look something like this:-\r\n       A - 1\r\n       a - 2\r\n       B - 3\r\n       b - 4\r\n       .\r\n       .\r\n       Z = 51\r\n       z = 52.\r\n    4. Now I will calculate value of each word, so for example, value of Apple will be = A+p+p+l+e = 1+32+32+24+10 = 99.\r\n    5. Similarly I will do for Pear.\r\n    6. Now for each user input value, for example Aa. I will make this calculation again, so for Aa its = A+a = 1+2 = 3. And 3 is less then 99. \r\n    7. Now it all comes to Maths, if this value is within the range of startWord and endWord, then I print inside, if its less then answer is before otherwise after.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017520/how-to-check-where-the-input-word-lies-in-terms-of-word-range/58017735#58017735","title":"How to check where the input word lies in terms of word range?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":10398879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-C0nd0P7T2Cw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAnc/qbokNG976SY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nikhil Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10398879/nikhil-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":51,"user_id":10398879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-C0nd0P7T2Cw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAnc/qbokNG976SY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nikhil Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10398879/nikhil-kumar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568925497,"last_edit_date":1568925497,"creation_date":1568924577,"answer_id":58018477,"question_id":58017520,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58018477","body_markdown":"let us assume it as a number line in which firstword is at point X and and secondword is at y.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the question we need to state that the input word lies below x, in between x and y or its beyond y.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, the question arises that how the comparison will happen for different words ?\r\n\r\n*seeing the above example, we can conclude that if  the any character of the first string if bigger than the character at the same position of the other string, then we can say that first string is bigger than than other.*\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n 1.

I&#39;d be willing to bet that the variable KEY is defined as &quot;ZONENAME&quot; somewhere before your dictionary definitions.\r\n\r\nWhat this actually looks like in the program is:\r\n\r\n    gamemap = {\r\n      &quot;a1&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;ZONENAME&quot; : &quot;Town Market&quot;,\r\n        &quot;ZONENAME&quot; : &quot;pizzeria&quot; #  Overwrites Town Market key\r\n        },\r\n      &quot;a2&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;ZONENAME&quot; : &quot;Town Entrance&quot;,\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWrap your Variable names in single or double quotes and I believe you&#39;ll get the behavior you expect from this function, but this might break something else in your program.\r\n\r\n    gamemap = {\r\n      &quot;a1&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;ZONENAME&quot; : &quot;Town Market&quot;,\r\n        &quot;KEY&quot; : &quot;pizzeria&quot;\r\n        },\r\n      &quot;a2&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;ZONENAME&quot; : &quot;Town Entrance&quot;,\r\n        },\r\n      # ...\r\n    }\r\n    def print_location():\r\n        current_place = &quot;You are in the &quot; + gamemap[playerLocation][ZONENAME]\r\n        print(current_place)\r\n\r\nNow when we run\r\n\r\n    playerLocation = &quot;a1&quot;\r\n    ZONENAME = &quot;ZONENAME&quot;\r\n    print_location()\r\n    # prints: You are in the Town Market\r\n\r\n    ZONENAME = &quot;KEY&quot;\r\n    print_location()\r\n    # prints: You are in the Pizzaria\r\n\r\nSee this link to run the code yourself: [https://repl.it/repls/MajesticMeanAutosketch][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://repl.it/repls/MajesticMeanAutosketch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017510/python-3-7-dictionary-giving-wrong-value-as-output/58017857#58017857","title":"Python 3.7 dictionary giving wrong value as output"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10939322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DFStyguXtAQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADU/pIXvJsCw5po/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"code lover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10939322/code-lover"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10939322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DFStyguXtAQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADU/pIXvJsCw5po/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"code lover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10939322/code-lover"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568921912,"last_edit_date":1568921912,"creation_date":1568921587,"answer_id":58017890,"question_id":58017510,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58017890","body_markdown":"It seems you have an extra line in a1 after KEYS, does removing it do anything?\r\n\r\nAlso, you might want to put strings around ZONENAME, KEY, DESCRIPTION etc.\r\n\r\nI would have commented this but I don&#39;t have enough rep :(","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017510/python-3-7-dictionary-giving-wrong-value-as-output/58017890#58017890","title":"Python 3.7 dictionary giving wrong value as output"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12092074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RdQrXlP0CDo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcy07lfYS-1EUl-jdSwIxb1QRdiPQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arda Ozden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092074/arda-ozden"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58017857,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568921912,"creation_date":1568919825,"question_id":58017510,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017510","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating a text-based game in Python (I know, a very common beginner project) and I&#39;ve come across a problem within nested dictionaries.

Have a look at this:\r\n\r\n    def print_location():\r\n        current_place = &quot;You are in the &quot; + gamemap[myPlayer.location][ZONENAME]\r\n        for character in current_place:\r\n            sys.stdout.write(character)\r\n            sys.stdout.flush()\r\n            time.sleep(0.03)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this function is telling the player where they are, printing the ZONENAME variable. This works for most of them. For example, if I go to a2, it prints &quot;You are in the Town Entrance&quot;.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I go to a1, even though the code in that function is the same, instead of printing: &quot;You are in the Town Market&quot;, which is what ZONENAME is for that area, it prints &quot;You are in the pizzeria&quot;. &quot;pizzeria&quot; is the value of KEY for a1, not zonename. \r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s odd is that if I comment out or remove the key, it prints the correct thing: &quot;You are in the Town Market&quot;. \r\n\r\nI have tried adding the KEY value on the other nested dicts, and the problem is persistent. As soon as I add that variable, it prints that instead. It is very confusing. I have also tried changing the name of KEY but that didn&#39;t work either.\r\n\r\nPlease help fix this. If you need any more of the script to look at, I can provide.

Is there another macro used for &quot;non-headers&quot; perhaps?**\r\n\r\nNo.  `AC_CONFIG_HEADERS` is for setting up configuration headers to support your build.  It is rarely used for anything other than building a `config.h` recording the results of certain tests that Autoconf performs, and it is not as flexible as other options in this area.\r\n\r\nIf you have additional files that you want Autoconf to build from templates then you should tell Autoconf about them via `AC_CONFIG_FILES`.  Example:\r\n\r\n    AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile AutoBrightnessCam.service])\r\n\r\nBut if some of the data with which you are filling that template are installation directories then Autoconf is probably not the right place to do this at all, because it makes provision for the installation prefix to be changed by arguments to `make`.  You would at least need to work around that, but the best thing to do is to roll with it instead, and build the `.service` file under `make`&#39;s control.  It&#39;s not that hard, and there are several technical advantages, some applying even if there aren&#39;t any installation directory substitutions to worry about.\r\n\r\nYou can do it the same way that `configure` does, by running the very same template you&#39;re already using through `sed`, with an appropriate script.  Something like this would appear in your `Makefile.am`:\r\n\r\n    SERVICE_SUBS = \\\r\n        s,[@]VARIABLE_NAME[@],$(VARIABLE_NAME),g; \\\r\n        s,[@]OTHER_VARIABLE[@],$(OTHER_VARIABLE),g\r\n    \r\n    AutoBrightnessCam.service: AutoBrightnessCam.service.in\r\n        $(SED) -e &#39;$(SERVICE_SUBS)&#39; &lt; $&lt; &gt; $@\r\n\r\n&gt; **Also, how do I specify that the service file should land (i.e.\r\n&gt; installed) in /etc/systemd/system?**\r\n\r\nYou use [Automake&#39;s standard mechanism for specifying custom installation locations][1].  Maybe something like this:\r\n\r\n    sytemdsysdir = $(sysconfdir)/systemd/system\r\n\r\n    systemdsys_DATA = AutoBrightnessCam.service\r\n\r\n&gt; **Is there perhaps a better way of\r\n&gt; starting this app at boot time without systemd?**\r\n\r\nOn a systemd-based machine, `systemd` is in control of what starts at boot.  If you want the machine to start your application automatically at boot, then I think your options are limited to\r\n\r\n - Configuring systemd to start it\r\n - Configuring something in a chain of programs ultimately started by systemd to start it\r\n - Hacking the bootloader or kernel to start it\r\n\r\nThere is room for diverging opinions here, but I think the first of those is cleanest and most future-proof, and I cannot recommend the last.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Uniform.html#Uniform","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017453/install-systemd-service-using-autotools/58028204#58028204","title":"Install systemd service using autotools"}],"owner":{"reputation":864,"user_id":5446276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKM0T.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5446276/john"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58028204,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569070040,"creation_date":1568919542,"question_id":58017453,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017453","body_markdown":"I have an autotools project which successfully builds and tests an app (https://github.com/goglecm/AutoBrightnessCam).

Every second I give it gallons used so far that day and a timestamp and I want it to output how many gallons it thinks I would use by day&#39;s end.\r\n\r\nI have a training element for each second of every day, and I&#39;m currently training with 3 days of collected data, I have ~250,000 training elements. For training, I&#39;m giving it `input: { gallonsSoFar: &lt;gallons (0-1)&gt;, timestamp: &lt;percentage of day passed&gt; }}` both normalized to be between 0 and 1. And the output given for the training is the actual gallons I had used that day (also normalized).  Notable here is that each day&#39;s worth of training data will have the same output for all its training elements.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that when training with my training data, brain.js converges with 0 iterations to get an error of ~0.0000x.  When tested with data, the network only outputs 1 value no matter what data I give it.  The network&#39;s output is close to the training output for the last day in the training set.

Using ZIP::OutputStream to open a ZIP file stream.\r\n\r\n2.  Going through each of the relevant models in the users account, converting all the records in that model to a CSV, then adding each CSV to the ZIP file.\r\n\r\n3.  Sending the resulting ZIP file to AWS S3.\r\n\r\nHere is some pseudo code to illustrate the process:\r\n\r\n````\r\noutput_stream = Zip::OutputStream.write_buffer do |zos|\t\r\n\r\n    @models_to_backup.each do |model|\r\n       csv = model.convert_to_csv_file\r\n       zos.put_next_entry(&quot;csv_files/#{model.name}.csv&quot;)\r\n       zos.write csv\r\n    end\r\n\r\nend\r\n\r\noutput_stream.rewind\r\nSendFileToS3(output_stream)\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works fine for smaller files, but most users have upwards of 100,000 records.  Thus, as the ZIP::OutputStream is generating, I quickly run into memory issues (I&#39;m hosting the app on Heroku) because the output stream is all being stored in memory until it&#39;s sent.\r\n\r\nIs there a more memory efficient way to create these ZIP files?  Is there a way to stream the ZIP to S3 in batches as it&#39;s created, to avoid creating the entire ZIP file in memory?

`RtlSetProcessIsCritical` (unimportant to what it get&#39;s set) and the commandlineargument get&#39;s compared the application crashes, however if I don&#39;t make a call to `RtlSetProcessIsCritical` the programm works flawlessly for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found out that the problem is between the `RtlSetProcessIsCritical` function and this line `if (!lstrcmp(szArglist[2], L&quot;/init&quot;)) {`\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried to reproduce this &quot;bug&quot; in a other project with the same structer of code but it worked flawlessly there and I&#39;m now out of ideas.\r\n\r\nIf you need the rest of the code you can read it at my Github, links to the 2 files:\r\n\r\n[Main Cpp](https://github.com/Lima-X-Coding/N0T-iLLerka.X/blob/master/Win32.N0T-iLLerka.X/N0TiLLerka/SourceFiles/N0TiLLerka.cpp)\r\n\r\n[Utilities

See here:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n      let file: File = data.file;\r\n\r\n      let reader = new FileReader();\r\n\r\n      reader.onloadend = (e:any) =&gt; {\r\n        this.uploadMessage = 0\r\n        let document = {\r\n          &quot;document_name&quot;: file.name,\r\n          &quot;document&quot;: reader.result,\r\n          &quot;document_filesize&quot;: file.size\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        this.myAPI.saveAttachment(document).subscribe(data =&gt; {\r\n        \r\n          if (data &amp;&amp; data.message){\r\n            this.uploadMessage = data.message;\r\n          }\r\n          if (this.uploadMessage == 100){\r\n            this.dialogRef.close();\r\n          }\r\n        })\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      reader.readAsDataURL(file);\r\n    }  \r\n\r\nThe above approach cut down the memory consumption to about 1GB, still higher than I expected, but manageable. However, to accommodate the client change, I&#39;ve updated the backend to expect a base64 string, rather than raw binary via a `byte[]`.

A user of this app has 2GB and gets the out of memory error in any browser and the upload fails. \r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m curious about is why uploading a 200MB file like this results in multiple GBs worth of memory consumed. I don&#39;t think this has anything to do with Angular, just the FileReader in WebAPI.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017356/uploading-200mb-file-via-filereader-caused-over-4gb-of-memory-to-be-consumed","title":"Uploading 200MB file via FileReader caused over 4GB of memory to be consumed"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-core","razor-pages","defaultmodelbinder"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33460,"user_id":2630078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026ee7e928cc51cce92ab6e92c245ef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kirk Larkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630078/kirk-larkin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568922724,"post_id":58017354,"comment_id":102439749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017354/invalidoperationexception-microsoft-aspnetcore-mvc-modelbinding-binders-complext#comment102439749_58017354"},{"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":5840650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a30995545bccbf72dd34adc331e554d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ahhzeee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5840650/ahhzeee"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":33460,"user_id":2630078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026ee7e928cc51cce92ab6e92c245ef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kirk Larkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630078/kirk-larkin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568922822,"post_id":58017354,"comment_id":102439793,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017354/invalidoperationexception-microsoft-aspnetcore-mvc-modelbinding-binders-complext#comment102439793_58017354"},{"owner":{"reputation":4490,"user_id":10158551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/45RCc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Xing Zou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10158551/xing-zou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568950245,"post_id":58017354,"comment_id":102445855,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017354/invalidoperationexception-microsoft-aspnetcore-mvc-modelbinding-binders-complext#comment102445855_58017354"},{"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":5840650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a30995545bccbf72dd34adc331e554d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ahhzeee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5840650/ahhzeee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569001258,"post_id":58017354,"comment_id":102468064,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017354/invalidoperationexception-microsoft-aspnetcore-mvc-modelbinding-binders-complext#comment102468064_58017354"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":5840650,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a30995545bccbf72dd34adc331e554d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ahhzeee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5840650/ahhzeee"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569375766,"creation_date":1569375766,"answer_id":58090083,"question_id":58017354,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58090083","body_markdown":"Finally figured it out.\r\n\r\nDo the following, \r\n1.

Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n[screenshot of the application][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ed9TV.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017316/identifying-tree-node-elements-with-pywinauto-robotframework","title":"identifying tree node elements with pywinauto-robotframework"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","asp.net-mvc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568930308,"post_id":58017315,"comment_id":102442169,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017315/getting-information-to-only-appear-in-the-row-a-button-was-clicked#comment102442169_58017315"},{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568930397,"post_id":58017315,"comment_id":102442194,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017315/getting-information-to-only-appear-in-the-row-a-button-was-clicked#comment102442194_58017315"},{"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":10496382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bH8PcUAHPRk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DW14ovE9btPamfw649am78JKneLsA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dominik Willaford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10496382/dominik-willaford"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568985144,"post_id":58017315,"comment_id":102460464,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017315/getting-information-to-only-appear-in-the-row-a-button-was-clicked#comment102460464_58017315"},{"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":10496382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bH8PcUAHPRk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DW14ovE9btPamfw649am78JKneLsA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dominik Willaford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10496382/dominik-willaford"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568990222,"post_id":58017315,"comment_id":102463324,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017315/getting-information-to-only-appear-in-the-row-a-button-was-clicked#comment102463324_58017315"},{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568993484,"post_id":58017315,"comment_id":102465071,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017315/getting-information-to-only-appear-in-the-row-a-button-was-clicked#comment102465071_58017315"}],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":10496382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bH8PcUAHPRk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DW14ovE9btPamfw649am78JKneLsA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dominik Willaford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10496382/dominik-willaford"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568918967,"creation_date":1568918967,"question_id":58017315,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017315","body_markdown":"I have created a script so far that detects when the class object .edit has been clicked and then dynamically creates two buttons to display.

most obvious approach is just to have a &quot;template&quot; string that you effectively replace with &quot;as much data as you&#39;ve got&quot;:\r\n\r\n    public static String getTimeRange(String dateString) {\r\n        // Note: you haven&#39;t told us what you want if the input is empty,\r\n        // or longer than a full date/time\r\n        String template = &quot;1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot;;      \r\n        return dateString + template.substring(dateString.length());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI believe this will satisfy all the sample input/output you gave.\r\n\r\nNote that this does no parsing or other validation whatsoever - you may well want to parse the result into a `LocalDateTime` (as cricket_007 says, avoid `Date` and `Calendar` if possible) for validation. For example:\r\n\r\n    private static DateTimeFormatter parser =\r\n        DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss&quot;, Locale.ROOT);\r\n    public static LocalDateTime

&quot;1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot;;      \r\n        String text = dateString + template.substring(dateString.length());\r\n        return LocalDateTime.parse(text, parser);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you *absolutely* have to use `java.util.Date`, which I&#39;d strongly recommend against if at all possible, you can use an appropriate `SimpleDateFormat` which you already appear to know about as you&#39;re using one in the question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017313/is-there-is-a-object-to-get-the-default-date-and-time-in-java/58017475#58017475","title":"Is there is a

trying to create a wrapper as a React component for [this DateTimePicker jQuery plugin][1]. So far it&#39;s working, but I&#39;m trying to set it&#39;s locale and to do that I need to import a specific file from the library.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m doing so at ```require(&#39;gijgo/js/messages/messages.pt-br&#39;)```, however it throws an error ```ReferenceError: gj is not defined```. The object ```gj``` is imported at ```require(&#39;gijgo/js/gijgo&#39;);``` and I already tried doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst gj = require(&#39;gijgo/js/gijgo&#39;);\r\nwindow.gj = gj;\r\nrequire(&#39;gijgo/js/messages/messages.pt-br&#39;)\r\n```\r\nJust like I did to import jQuery (the library gijgo uses it), but it didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nThis is my whole code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React from &quot;react&quot;\r\nimport $ from &#39;jquery&#39;\r\nimport &#39;bootstrap&#39;;\r\nimport { TextInput } from &#39;../Form/Form&#39;\r\n\r\nwindow.jQuery = $;\r\nwindow.$ = $;\r\nrequire(&#39;gijgo/js/gijgo&#39;);\r\nrequire(&#39;gijgo/js/messages/messages.pt-br&#39;)\r\nrequire(&#39;gijgo/css/gijgo.css&#39;);\r\n\r\nexport default class DateTimePicker extends React.Component {\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.$dateTimePicker = $(this.dateTimePicker);\r\n    this.$dateTimePicker.on(&quot;change&quot;, this.props.onChange);\r\n    this.$dateTimePicker.datetimepicker({\r\n      locale: &#39;pt-br&#39;,\r\n      uiLibrary: &#39;bootstrap4&#39;,\r\n      format: &#39;dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM&#39;,\r\n      modal: true,\r\n      footer: true\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillUnmount() {\r\n    this.$dateTimePicker.destroy(&quot;datetimepicker&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;TextInput {...this.props} ref={dateTimePicker =&gt; this.dateTimePicker = dateTimePicker}/&gt;\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to &quot;require something after something else fully loaded?&quot;. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nNote 1: yes, I know jQuery + React = bad, but I like this component and I&#39;m porting an old project to React that uses this library, so I figure it would be nice to have it as a React component. My main goal however, is to have _some_ Date Time Picker component that looks like gijgo&#39;s and works with React, so I&#39;m open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nNote 2: I&#39;m using gijgo through npm (```npm install gijgo --save```)\r\n\r\n**Update 1**\r\n\r\nNote 3: I&#39;m kinda new at React JS development and I&#39;m not _quite_ sure what I&#39;m using for bundling, but the script that runs when I run ```npm start``` or ```yarn start``` is ```react-scripts start```. Also, the error also shows ```__webpack_require__``` and\r\n\r\n```\r\n  779 | };\r\n  780 | \r\n  781 | // Execute the module function\r\n&gt; 782 | modules[moduleId].call(module.exports, module, module.exports, hotCreateRequire(moduleId));\r\n      | ^  783 | \r\n  784 | // Flag the module as loaded\r\n  785 | module.l = true;\r\n````\r\n\r\n**Update 2**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried creating a separate file to import jQuery and setting it globally, so I could stop using ```require``` and use ```import``` instead. Still, I keep getting the same error.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my ```jQuery.js``` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport jquery from &#39;jquery&#39;;\r\nglobal.$= jquery;\r\nglobal.jQuery = jquery;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand here&#39;s my updated imports:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)\r\nimport &#39;../jQuery&#39;\r\nimport &#39;gijgo/js/gijgo&#39;\r\nimport &#39;gijgo/js/messages/messages.pt-br&#39;\r\nimport &#39;gijgo/css/gijgo.css&#39;\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update 3**\r\n\r\nIt didn&#39;t work when I tried using gijgo from ```&lt;script&gt;```, it said ```datetimepicker``` is not recognized. I must be doing something wrong, as I&#39;m having a hard time trying to understand how to mix jQuery with React. I think gijgo is a good library and everything. But for this particular case I actually decided to use [DateTimePicker from material-ui/pickers][2]. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://gijgo.com/datepicker\r\n  [2]:

way to achieve what you want is to use the [Index stats API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html), and filter out the `store.size_in_bytes` value, like this:\r\n\r\n    winlogbeat-6.2.2*/_stats?filter_path=_all.total.store.size_in_bytes\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll get a response like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;_all&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;total&quot;:

is happening because your spans are part of a label that&#39;s associated with an input (you placed the input inside of the label). Clicking on a label associated with an input will focus or trigger the input.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d recommend restructuring your html and using css to fix this. Generally this approach is more robust and accessible than applying event modifiers like `stop` and `prevent`.\r\n\r\nYour structure could look something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;label for=&quot;agreed&quot;&gt;Check here to indicate that you understand:&lt;/label&gt;\r\n&lt;span&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;span&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;input v-model=&quot;agreed&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;agreed&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use CSS and a bit of restructuring to make the spans and the label all appear as one unit. Note that a screen reader will tie the label to the input so having it makes sense on its own is a good idea.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017297/vue-js-clicking-on-span-also-clicks-on-input-how-to-prevent-that/58017841#58017841","title":"Vue.js - clicking on span also clicks on input. how to prevent that?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12191,"user_id":8172857,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SgzUP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Boussadjra Brahim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8172857/boussadjra-brahim"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568922003,"post_id":58017888,"comment_id":102439441,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017297/vue-js-clicking-on-span-also-clicks-on-input-how-to-prevent-that/58017888#comment102439441_58017888"},{"owner":{"reputation":183,"user_id":9370401,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KEa1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HDallakyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9370401/hdallakyan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12191,"user_id":8172857,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SgzUP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Boussadjra Brahim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8172857/boussadjra-brahim"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568922175,"post_id":58017888,"comment_id":102439509,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017297/vue-js-clicking-on-span-also-clicks-on-input-how-to-prevent-that/58017888#comment102439509_58017888"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":183,"user_id":9370401,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KEa1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HDallakyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9370401/hdallakyan"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568921580,"creation_date":1568921580,"answer_id":58017888,"question_id":58017297,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58017888","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to refactor your HTML like this\r\n\r\n     &lt;div class=&quot;pr-container&quot;&gt;\r\n                Please confirm you have read and understood out \r\n                       &lt;span @click=&quot;openConditionsModal($event, &#39;terms&#39;)&quot; class=&quot;pr-default-link&quot;&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/span&gt; and\r\n                       &lt;span @click=&quot;openConditionsModal($event, &#39;policy&#39;)&quot; class=&quot;pr-default-link&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/span&gt;. \r\n                         bla blabladasd\r\n                    \r\n                    &lt;label&gt;\r\n                       &lt;input v-model=&quot;agreed&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot;&gt;\r\n                       &lt;span class=&quot;checkmark&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/label&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017297/vue-js-clicking-on-span-also-clicks-on-input-how-to-prevent-that/58017888#58017888","title":"Vue.js - clicking on span also clicks on input. how to prevent that?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1411,"user_id":10046099,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wBQ5ABdKX3k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq1ZViaxwzPRS3PugEwp_tH9OnarWw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nika Kurashvili","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10046099/nika-kurashvili"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12191,"user_id":8172857,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SgzUP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Boussadjra Brahim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8172857/boussadjra-brahim"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58017841,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568922870,"creation_date":1568918860,"last_edit_date":1568922870,"question_id":58017297,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017297","body_markdown":"I have a code like this.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    &lt;label class=&quot;pr-container&quot;&gt;\r\n        Please confirm you have read and understood out \r\n       &lt;span @click=&quot;openConditionsModal($event, &#39;terms&#39;)&quot; class=&quot;pr-default-link&quot;&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/span&gt; and\r\n       &lt;span @click=&quot;openConditionsModal($event, &#39;policy&#39;)&quot; class=&quot;pr-default-link&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/span&gt;. \r\n         bla blabladasd\r\n                            \r\n       &lt;input v-model=&quot;agreed&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot;&gt;\r\n       &lt;span class=&quot;checkmark&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/label&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I click Terms and Condition or Privacy policy spans, what also happens is `&lt;input v-model=&quot;agreed&quot;&gt;` also gets marked.

dataArray.forEach(function(r) {\r\n    select.addChild(r, r);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n[Options][2] is used to create options for the dropdown list.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you can use `document.createElement()` to create radio buttons with some unique id&#39;s which you can later use to capture data when they submit it.\r\n\r\n**Codepen**: i have created a small codepen to help out with it:\r\nIt can be view here [Codepen Link][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment\r\n  [2]:

Anyways now I need help to populate a html page with the list of names that I have collected from Google Spreadsheet and Simultaneously add 3 radio buttons and a drop-down list respectively. At the end capture data if user submits form.\r\nPlease let me know if anymore clarification is required.\r\n\r\nHere is the outcome by now :-\r\n\r\n[![Out Come][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/u33zz.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017280/dynamically-add-radio-and-dropdown-list-in-html-with-javascript-and-return-data","title":"dynamically add radio and dropdown list in Html with JavaScript and return data back"},{"tags":["ios","swift","performance","boolean"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568918992,"post_id":58017276,"comment_id":102438198,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017276/how-is-if-availableios-13-0-implemented-and-what-effect-does-it-have-on#comment102438198_58017276"},{"owner":{"reputation":1519,"user_id":586006,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mker6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chewie The Chorkie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/586006/chewie-the-chorkie"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568919287,"post_id":58017276,"comment_id":102438299,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017276/how-is-if-availableios-13-0-implemented-and-what-effect-does-it-have-on#comment102438299_58017276"},{"owner":{"reputation":46120,"user_id":2864740,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7a05a144f218bde07b659bc98e1ca7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2864740","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2864740/user2864740"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568919668,"post_id":58017276,"comment_id":102438470,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017276/how-is-if-availableios-13-0-implemented-and-what-effect-does-it-have-on#comment102438470_58017276"},{"owner":{"reputation":46120,"user_id":2864740,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7a05a144f218bde07b659bc98e1ca7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2864740","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2864740/user2864740"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568920199,"post_id":58017276,"comment_id":102438681,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017276/how-is-if-availableios-13-0-implemented-and-what-effect-does-it-have-on#comment102438681_58017276"},{"owner":{"reputation":4550,"user_id":1032372,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDjul.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1032372/shim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568925793,"post_id":58017276,"comment_id":102440900,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58017276/how-is-if-availableios-13-0-implemented-and-what-effect-does-it-have-on#comment102440900_58017276"}],"owner":{"reputation":1519,"user_id":586006,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mker6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chewie The Chorkie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/586006/chewie-the-chorkie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4550,"user_id":1032372,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDjul.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1032372/shim"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":89,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568925334,"creation_date":1568918782,"last_edit_date":1568925334,"question_id":58017276,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58017276","body_markdown":"How fast is `if #available(iOS 13.0, *)`, or checking any iOS version?
