overload resolution, a compiler first has to check that an overload can accept the number of arguments that were provided at the call. This is a process that determines which functions are *viable* for this function call expression.\r\n\r\nThe first overload can only accept exactly two, while the second overload can only accept exactly three. The immediately disqualifies the second overload in both cases. So the overload set contains a single member for both invocations.\r\n\r\nNow a compiler has to see if it can form a conversion sequence from every argument to every parameter type. The `&quot;name&quot;` literal gets converted to a `std::string` via constructor, and a `double` has an implicit conversion to `int`. So forming conversion sequences is a success for the one and only overload in the set. As such, it gets called.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025834/i-do-not-understand-how-this-overload-is-resolution-works/58025901#58025901","title":"I do not understand how this overload is resolution &quot;works&quot;"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1098,"user_id":422005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12c2e55edb5c5fa6905829dab6dca8fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user422005","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/422005/user422005"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568974901,"post_id":58026006,"comment_id":102455281,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025834/i-do-not-understand-how-this-overload-is-resolution-works/58026006#comment102455281_58026006"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1241,"user_id":8349252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/224zf.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kaldrr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8349252/kaldrr"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568973305,"creation_date":1568973305,"answer_id":58026006,"question_id":58025834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58026006","body_markdown":"`double` can get implicitly converted into `int`, which allows the 1st constructor to be called.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make sure someone won&#39;t call it while passing a `double`, you can explicitly delete it.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass c {\r\npublic:\r\n  c(const std::string&amp; n, double d) = delete;\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n};\r\n\r\nint main(){\r\n  c a{&quot;A&quot;, 1); // ok, calls c(const std::string&amp; n, int i);\r\n  //c b{&quot;B&quot;, 1.0); Compile error! tries to call deleted function \r\n  //               c(const std::string&amp; n, double d)\r\n  c b{&quot;C&quot;, static_cast&lt;int&gt;(1.0)}; //ok, calls c(const std::string&amp; n, int i);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025834/i-do-not-understand-how-this-overload-is-resolution-works/58026006#58026006","title":"I do not understand how this overload is resolution &quot;works&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":1098,"user_id":422005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12c2e55edb5c5fa6905829dab6dca8fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user422005","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/422005/user422005"},"last_editor":{"reputation":318351,"user_id":560648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBDFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lightness Races in Orbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560648/lightness-races-in-orbit"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":79,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58025901,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568975476,"creation_date":1568972553,"last_edit_date":1568975476,"question_id":58025834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025834","body_markdown":"I have a C++ class where the constructor is overloaded for different data types.

a solution using recursion and just two Ramda functions:\r\n\r\n1. One is the predicate function - it checks that an object has the required property\r\n2. The second is the transformation function - it transforms the object (omits `children`)\r\n\r\nThese two functions _may_ also be in plain JavaScript. (I leave this to you as an exercise.)\r\n\r\nThe function takes a list of objects:\r\n\r\n1. If the first object satisfies the predicate then transform it and return it.\r\n2. Otherwise reapply the function on a new list which can be either the first object children (if any) or the rest of the original list. (In that order.)\r\n3.

(exception Some much older versions of some browsers had flags to turn off VSync which did effect rAF)\r\n\r\nNote \r\n\r\n- `rAf`, `setTimeout` or `setInterval` are not reliable and can drop frames for many reasons.\r\n- rAF will stop firing if the Tab or Window is hidden or (tab) not focused.\r\n- `setInterval` and `setTimeout` will be throttled if the Tab or Window is hidden or (tab) not focused.\r\n- rAF time argument does not represent the time of the (next displayed) frame, but rather the time that rAF callback is called. \r\n\r\n  That means that...\r\n    - the time between frames if calculated from rAF time argument will float and can not be reliably used as a delta time.\r\n    - the time argument represents the time of the call, not the time of frame being presented to the display, and can be up to  &lt; 1/60 of a second earlier than the rendered content is presented to the display hardware.\r\n\r\n##Local networks\r\n\r\nFor multi player games the server should serve the time so that all players run on a common and reliable time stamp. Clients can project time forward from last time stamp to avoid freezing if network delays packets, but should revert back to synced (server time) time when received.\r\n\r\n##Large networks\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications is distance dependent, even on a perfect point to point network if the client is on the other side of the world the best ping possible is 130ms (near 8 frames @60Hz) due to light travel time. This does not include packet switching and actual route length. Generally the ping time to most distant point on the globe is around 300ms.\r\n\r\nThis delay must be considered for professional games, and is why many multi player games provide local servers, and restrict players from some servers if to far away. 300ms gives closer players a significant advantage.\r\n\r\nRealtime multi-player games using the browsers APIs to host clients will be problematic at best as the browser is an unreliable and inconsistent client host, *mostly* due to the huge range of devices the clients run on.\r\n\r\n\r\n##**BTW** \r\n\r\n`window` is the default `this` (`globalThis`) and as such is not required. eg `window.requestAnimationFrame` is identical to `requestAnimationFrame`\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025810/javascript-multiplayer-game-requestanimationframe-for-game-physics-logic/58049441#58049441","title":"Javascript multiplayer game - requestAnimationFrame for game/physics logic?"}],"owner":{"reputation":328,"user_id":3450112,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AOvym.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3450112/paul"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58049441,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1569157000,"creation_date":1568972463,"question_id":58025810,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025810","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing a Javascript based multiplayer game.\r\nSo far I have the basic server, client and networking ready.\r\n\r\nI did have an issue where my player was moving faster on a 120Hz screen as opposed to a 60Hz screen.

iOS 13 just out I was testing my app in Xcode 11 GM2, it uses the dictionary you can enable on the iPhone to do a word lookup. The performance on iOS12 has been spot on, it is virtually instantaneous.\r\n\r\nHowever, this seems to have changed with iOS 13.  The code below, which is fairly standard, takes 3 seconds to respond!!! This happens on both iOS13 simulators and real devices with iOS13.\r\n\r\nI have not seen anything this having been reported as an issue with iOS13 SDK or Xcode 11. \r\n\r\nCould this be a bug that needs reporting? Or am I doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s making my app look unresponsive.  How do I deal with this?\r\n\r\nThis is easy to reproduce and the same code with an iOS 12.x simulator works normally.\r\n\r\n**My code is below:**\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport UIKit\r\n\r\n//I&#39;m using storyboard with 1 button.\r\n\r\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\r\n    \r\n    @IBOutlet weak var buttonTestUIRefVC: UIButton!\r\n    \r\n    @IBAction func testUIRefVCTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {\r\n        \r\n        if UIReferenceLibraryViewController.dictionaryHasDefinition(forTerm: &quot;test&quot;) {\r\n            let referenceVC = UIReferenceLibraryViewController(term: &quot;test&quot;)\r\n            present(referenceVC, animated: true)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the code above, the bit \r\n`UIReferenceLibraryViewController.dictionaryHasDefinition(forTerm: &quot;test&quot;)` is what introduces the 3 second delay.\r\n\r\nHere is a PORTION of the debug log, I have not seen those &quot;Old state: 1 new state:1&quot; statements before, they only show up in iOS 13. What do they mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-09-20 09:38:09.175923+0100 DictionaryServicesTest[18527:3511667] Creating client/daemon connection: C94E0479-7F79-4E22-895D-7F1FEFB75C8E\r\n2019-09-20

He uses java&#39;s multithreading technology, and the thread pool uses Executors.newFixedThreadPool. The service needs to handle some complex business logic. Complex business logic needs me to support it. I wrote an algorithm module packaged as a jar, and the time for pressure measurement of the algorithm module averaged about 10ms. Of course this is the result in a single-threaded environment. When he puts my module into the program and runs it, when using the pressure test program to test the service, the thread counts the algorithm for more than a few minutes. Of course, this time is the lifetime of the thread. When a single machine uses a program called with the same parameters, the time is still a few milliseconds. So the problem arises. Why is it timed out?\r\n\r\n\r\nMy colleague did not provide me with more details of the program. He thought that the program was time-consuming. I was very angry about his behavior, but the problem always needed to be solved. I don&#39;t know much about the thread scheduling algorithm, he is also. Now I want to count the effective execution time of the thread, but I did not see the relevant method in the java.lang.Thread object, I don&#39;t know if there are other ways to count it.\r\n\r\nI also want to know if there is any other way to explain this

This way you always have the right time and dates.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025794/problems-with-formatting-date-with-moment-js-in-react/58025918#58025918","title":"Problems with formatting date with moment.js in React"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":227,"user_id":11944674,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be124ce5c4f5cc7396cea31c40c1b32a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dickens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11944674/dickens"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568975958,"post_id":58026348,"comment_id":102455803,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025794/problems-with-formatting-date-with-moment-js-in-react/58026348#comment102455803_58026348"},{"owner":{"reputation":3046,"user_id":7845230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/747568d62ae596073da2282166051456?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tarzen chugh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7845230/tarzen-chugh"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":227,"user_id":11944674,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be124ce5c4f5cc7396cea31c40c1b32a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dickens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11944674/dickens"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568978447,"post_id":58026348,"comment_id":102457013,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025794/problems-with-formatting-date-with-moment-js-in-react/58026348#comment102457013_58026348"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3046,"user_id":7845230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/747568d62ae596073da2282166051456?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tarzen chugh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7845230/tarzen-chugh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3046,"user_id":7845230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/747568d62ae596073da2282166051456?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tarzen chugh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7845230/tarzen-chugh"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568974908,"last_edit_date":1568974908,"creation_date":1568974475,"answer_id":58026348,"question_id":58025794,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58026348","body_markdown":"I think you formatting on already formatted date.

Moreover, since API by default uses a GMT Unix timestamp format I decided to format it into &quot;MM-DD-YYYY&quot; to work with date easily. But the problem is when I try to further convert &quot;MM-DD-YYYY&quot; into LT format in moment.js I lose time date in date and by default all time gets 12:00 AM. Is it true that if we try to convert original GMT Unix timestamp format into &quot;MM-DD-YYYY&quot; and then further convert &quot;MM-DD-YYYY&quot; into &quot;LT&quot; we will lose time that was in

For this problem you do not need any explicit for loops, there are suitable list methods to do this for you:\r\n```\r\nlist_ = [&#39;INDIA,CHINA,JAPAN&#39;,&#39;FRANCE,IRELAND,ENGLAND&#39;]\r\nnewlist = &#39;,&#39;.join(list_).split(&#39;,&#39;)\r\n\r\n#Output:\r\n[&#39;INDIA&#39;, &#39;CHINA&#39;, &#39;JAPAN&#39;, &#39;FRANCE&#39;, &#39;IRELAND&#39;, &#39;ENGLAND&#39;]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025793/loop-over-a-list-and-its-sub-strings-seperated-by-comma/58025883#58025883","title":"loop over a list and its sub-strings seperated by comma"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10238327,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-78MBiVYYnec/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/APUIFaNuZEmxNRpjFYt4pMgbwwj9biMbnQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"杨Eugene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10238327/%e6%9d%a8eugene"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568972875,"creation_date":1568972875,"answer_id":58025915,"question_id":58025793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58025915","body_markdown":"    list = [&#39;INDIA,CHINA,JAPAN&#39;,&#39;FRANCE,IRELAND,ENGLAND&#39;]\r\n    newlist = []\r\n    for item in list:\r\n        newlist.extend(item.split(&#39;,&#39;))\r\n    print(newlist)\r\n\r\nThis will produce:\r\n&gt; [&#39;INDIA&#39;, &#39;CHINA&#39;, &#39;JAPAN&#39;, &#39;FRANCE&#39;, &#39;IRELAND&#39;, &#39;ENGLAND&#39;]\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025793/loop-over-a-list-and-its-sub-strings-seperated-by-comma/58025915#58025915","title":"loop over a list and its sub-strings seperated by comma"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":12093443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0S72o.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adarsh Pai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093443/adarsh-pai"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568973449,"creation_date":1568973449,"answer_id":58026055,"question_id":58025793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58026055","body_markdown":"You can use a List Comprehension to achieve this easily\r\n\r\n```\r\nlist = [&#39;INDIA,CHINA,JAPAN&#39;,&#39;FRANCE,IRELAND,ENGLAND&#39;]\r\nprint([word for string in list for word in string.split(&#39;,&#39;)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output**\r\n\r\n```\r\n[&#39;INDIA&#39;, &#39;CHINA&#39;, &#39;JAPAN&#39;, &#39;FRANCE&#39;, &#39;IRELAND&#39;, &#39;ENGLAND&#39;]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025793/loop-over-a-list-and-its-sub-strings-seperated-by-comma/58026055#58026055","title":"loop over a list and its sub-strings seperated by comma"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11675439,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af88267d64debdddc7aa4cc22892d238?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sunny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11675439/sunny"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4571,"user_id":5770501,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FUVQn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arkistarvh Kltzuonstev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5770501/arkistarvh-kltzuonstev"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":6,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568973449,"creation_date":1568972389,"last_edit_date":1568972433,"question_id":58025793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025793","body_markdown":"Can someone help me with below.

However, my best guess is either:\r\n\r\n 1. You haven&#39;t got your value set correctly on your `select` element (your options are not visible in the HTML provided, I assume they are added via some JS?).

\r\nOr should i create separate props based on my deeply nested JSON to overcome this issue?\r\n\r\n  \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025737/is-passing-a-deeply-nested-json-object-ok-to-a-purecomponent-prop-in-react","title":"Is passing a deeply nested JSON object OK to a PureComponent prop in React?"},{"tags":["c#",".net"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":817870,"user_id":17034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cii6b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hans Passant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17034/hans-passant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568978407,"post_id":58025731,"comment_id":102456986,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025730/how-to-determine-if-a-net-assembly-was-built-with-platform-target-anycpu-anycp/58025731#comment102456986_58025731"},{"owner":{"reputation":1008,"user_id":2126375,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1545f71558c01c8e7e2960ac205952f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2126375","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2126375/user2126375"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":817870,"user_id":17034,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cii6b.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hans Passant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17034/hans-passant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568979024,"post_id":58025731,"comment_id":102457271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025730/how-to-determine-if-a-net-assembly-was-built-with-platform-target-anycpu-anycp/58025731#comment102457271_58025731"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1008,"user_id":2126375,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1545f71558c01c8e7e2960ac205952f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2126375","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2126375/user2126375"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1008,"user_id":2126375,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1545f71558c01c8e7e2960ac205952f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2126375","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2126375/user2126375"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568979400,"last_edit_date":1568979400,"creation_date":1568972204,"answer_id":58025731,"question_id":58025730,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58025731","body_markdown":"    /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n    /// Provides basic information about an Assembly derived from its metadata.\r\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n    public class CorFlagsReader\r\n    {\r\n        #region Properties\r\n    \r\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n        /// Gets the major version of the CLI runtime required for the assembly.\r\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;remarks&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;para&gt;\r\n        /// Typical runtime versions:\r\n        /// &lt;list type=&quot;bullet&quot;&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;item&gt;0 for unmanaged PE Files.&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;item&gt;2.0: .Net 1.0 / .Net 1.1&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;item&gt;2.5: .Net 2.0 / .Net 3.0 / .Net 3.5 / .Net 4.0&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;/list&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;/para&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;/remarks&gt;\r\n        public int MajorRuntimeVersion { get; }\r\n    \r\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n        /// Gets the minor version of the CLI runtime required for the assembly.\r\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;remarks&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;para&gt;\r\n        /// Typical runtime versions:\r\n        /// &lt;list type=&quot;bullet&quot;&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;item&gt;0 for unmanaged PE Files.&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;item&gt;2.0: .Net 1.0 / .Net 1.1&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;item&gt;2.5: .Net 2.0 / .Net 3.0 / .Net 3.5 / .Net 4.0&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;/list&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;/para&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;/remarks&gt;\r\n        public int MinorRuntimeVersion { get; }\r\n    \r\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n        /// Gets the processor architecture required for the assembly or \r\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n        /// &lt;returns&gt;Possible return values: X86, Amd64, MSIL &lt;/returns&gt;\r\n        public ProcessorArchitecture ProcessorArchitecture { get; }\r\n    \r\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n        /// If true the PE files does not contain any unmanaged parts.

One can not guarantee the order in which the three will be completed.\r\n\r\nNow the function `loadUserOfferMappings` actually depends upon the data being fetched for roles and projects. So that means `getAllUseroffermappingsByUserId` should be called only after projects and roles are already fetched.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow there are multiple ways to solve this problem:\r\n\r\n1. The most novice way is to check if roles and projects are available before using those in the `getAllUseroffermappingsByUserId`;\r\n\r\n2. More sensible way is to actually call the `loadUserOfferMappings ` method once the roles and projects calls are resolved only.(with observables or promises anything )\r\n\r\n3. One more way can be to maintain the loading state for you promise calls. \r\n  e.g. an asynchronous call be in loading, loaded or error state. So call the `getAllUseroffermappingsByUserId` only when `getRoles` and `getProjects` are in loaded states. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025712/angular-6-not-set-properties-of-class-after-calling-http-request/58025966#58025966","title":"Angular 6: not set properties of class after calling HTTP-request"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":7076740,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OPlv9kPFNUQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC8/bnMewHiF9I8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Se Br","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7076740/se-br"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1568976068,"accepted_answer_id":58025960,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568984971,"creation_date":1568972132,"question_id":58025712,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025712","body_markdown":"I have component with tabs (`ProfileComponent` is parent for others).

Using `fs`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfs.readFile(path.resolve(__dirname, &#39;web3-bundle.js&#39;), &#39;utf8&#39;, function (err, data) {\r\n  if (err) {\r\n    console.error(err);\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  console.log(&#39;data&#39;, data)\r\nview.webContents.executeJavaScript(`\r\n  ${data};\r\n  console.log(Web3);\r\n`)\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can you attach a bundled file into a `BrowserView` in Electron?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025675/electron-how-to-execute-bundled-file","title":"Electron: How to execute bundled file?"},{"tags":["c#","wpf"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1982,"user_id":2029607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/721e7dc1d51f729a9e59f50ed9094d6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"XAMlMAX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2029607/xamlmax"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568972978,"post_id":58025670,"comment_id":102454229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025670/wpf-changing-the-size-of-my-textbox-when-i-cover-it-with-my-cursor#comment102454229_58025670"},{"owner":{"reputation":1368,"user_id":1376549,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9380fc0b7f1f21224c566a984857834c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Llu&#237;s Su&#241;ol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1376549/llu%c3%ads-su%c3%b1ol"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568976420,"post_id":58025670,"comment_id":102455998,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025670/wpf-changing-the-size-of-my-textbox-when-i-cover-it-with-my-cursor#comment102455998_58025670"},{"owner":{"reputation":5811,"user_id":426185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed64e54f32c14d0f11e4e91009703322?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/426185/andy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568983246,"post_id":58025670,"comment_id":102459454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025670/wpf-changing-the-size-of-my-textbox-when-i-cover-it-with-my-cursor#comment102459454_58025670"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":415,"user_id":4991973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c60e56b658a89c0af645bbde45af4aea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bulutay Sara&#231;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4991973/bulutay-sara%c3%a7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568976449,"post_id":58026248,"comment_id":102456016,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025670/wpf-changing-the-size-of-my-textbox-when-i-cover-it-with-my-cursor/58026248#comment102456016_58026248"},{"owner":{"reputation":1982,"user_id":2029607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/721e7dc1d51f729a9e59f50ed9094d6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"XAMlMAX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2029607/xamlmax"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568978972,"post_id":58026248,"comment_id":102457239,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025670/wpf-changing-the-size-of-my-textbox-when-i-cover-it-with-my-cursor/58026248#comment102457239_58026248"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1416,"user_id":9114020,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W7RSH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nehorai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9114020/nehorai"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568974102,"creation_date":1568974102,"answer_id":58026248,"question_id":58025670,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58026248","body_markdown":"Try the following example, you can change the width/height...\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Window.Resources&gt;\r\n    &lt;Style TargetType=&quot;TextBox&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;Setter Property=&quot;Width&quot;

could put the buttons in their own components. I made a quick demo with a simple button. I am sure it works similar with angular material.\r\n\r\nA major advantage is that this also separates functionality instead of making a component class that does everything.\r\n\r\n    import { Component } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    @Component({\r\n      selector: &#39;my-button&#39;,\r\n      template: &#39;&lt;button [style.background]=&quot;this.color&quot; (click)=&quot;toggleColor()&quot;&gt;I am button #1&lt;/button&gt;&#39;\r\n    })\r\n    export class MyButtonComponent  {\r\n      color = &#39;red&#39;;\r\n    \r\n      constructor(){}\r\n    \r\n      toggleColor(){\r\n        if( this.color === &#39;red&#39; )\r\n          this.color = &#39;blue&#39;;\r\n        else\r\n          this.color = &#39;red&#39;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPlay around with it: [https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-y8zf5a][1]\r\n\r\nNote: Personally I would not colour the buttons based on a button-click, but change the buttons class to indicate the availability of the function, which the button calls. So you would have classes like unavailable, processing, available, processed, etc. that reflect the state of the button. These classes would be styled with css.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-y8zf5a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025657/change-colour-of-a-mat-button-when-clicked-in-angular/58027303#58027303","title":"change colour of a mat button when clicked in angular"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":8957025,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a90194ad8c6034232409a5d01a7bdaaa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cvg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8957025/cvg"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569214100,"creation_date":1569214100,"answer_id":58055803,"question_id":58025657,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58055803","body_markdown":"I figured out a way \r\n\r\n.html\r\n```\r\n&lt;div flexLayout=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div flexLayout=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;button mat-flat-button [ngClass]=&quot;this.selected == 1 ? &#39;tab_selected&#39; : &#39;tab_unselected&#39;&quot; (click)=&quot;change(1)&quot;&gt;B2-L1&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;button mat-flat-button [ngClass]=&quot;this.selected == 2 ? &#39;tab_selected&#39; : &#39;tab_unselected&#39;&quot; (click)=&quot;change(2)&quot;&gt;B2-L3&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;button mat-flat-button [ngClass]=&quot;this.selected == 3 ? &#39;tab_selected&#39; : &#39;tab_unselected&#39;&quot; (click)=&quot;change(3)&quot;&gt;B2-L3&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;button mat-flat-button [ngClass]=&quot;this.selected == 4 ? &#39;tab_selected&#39; : &#39;tab_unselected&#39;&quot; (click)=&quot;change(4)&quot;&gt;B2-L4&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n.ts\r\n```\r\nselected\r\nchange(n) {\r\n  this.paletteColour = &#39;warn&#39;;\r\n  this.selected=n;\r\n  console.log(this.selected);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n.css\r\n```\r\n   .tab_selected {\r\n    background-color: grey; \r\n    border-radius: 0 px !important;;  \r\n}\r\n\r\n .mat-button {\r\n  border-radius: 0 px !important;;     \r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you all for the support.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025657/change-colour-of-a-mat-button-when-clicked-in-angular/58055803#58055803","title":"change colour of a mat button when clicked in angular"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2008,"user_id":4182029,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83038aa91f4ab0cd6332a75b803f99bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RMo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4182029/rmo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569261293,"creation_date":1569261293,"answer_id":58067759,"question_id":58025657,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58067759","body_markdown":"Since you mentioned you were specifically using navigation I have another solution for you; You can make angular add a class named `active` when a route is active.

to my (painfull) experience until now, the only way to get a large JavaFX 11+ project with a lot of external dependencies working, which you cannot control, is to keep everything on the classpath

At the end we need wanted an EXE file for windows (the application is only designed for windows). In the first try we also used launch4J within gradle, due the following problem we would also be fine using a BAT file which we could migrate to an exe file instead. \r\n\r\nSo our main goal and question is, how can we create a executable jar file.\r\n\r\nWe made several approaches with different results and we are completly lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAT JAR ##\r\n\r\n\r\nWe made a standalone application for testing purpose:\r\n\r\n    package de.test;\r\n    \r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.TextArea;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.TextField;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main extends Application {\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tlaunch();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {\r\n    \t\tVBox vBox = new VBox();\r\n    \r\n    \t\tButton button = new Button(&quot;Klick&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tTextField textfield = new TextField();\r\n    \t\tTextArea area = new TextArea();\r\n    \t\tarea.setMinHeight(300);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tbutton.setOnAction(event -&gt; area.setText(area.getText() + &quot; --  Klick Version 1.0.8&quot;));\r\n    \t\tvBox.getChildren().addAll(button, textfield,area);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));\r\n    \t\tprimaryStage.setTitle(&quot;Test&quot;);\r\n    \t\tprimaryStage.show();\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**FAT JAR**\r\n\r\nAnd our first try was a **FAT-JAR** with or without a modules-info.java file using the javafx plugin from gradle. Here is our gradle file\r\n\r\n\r\n    plugins {\r\n        id &#39;java&#39;\r\n        id &#39;application&#39;\r\n        id &#39;org.openjfx.javafxplugin&#39; version &#39;0.0.8&#39;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    group &#39;de.test&#39;\r\n    version &#39;1.0.8&#39;\r\n    \r\n    sourceCompatibility = 11\r\n    \r\n    javafx {\r\n        modules = [&#39;javafx.controls&#39;]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    mainClassName = &#39;de.test.Main&#39;\r\n    \r\n    jar {\r\n        manifest {\r\n            attributes &#39;Main-Class&#39;: mainClassName\r\n        }\r\n        from {\r\n            configurations.compile.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    repositories {\r\n        mavenLocal()\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter running **gradle clean jar** we tried to execute the jar with the following command **java -jar ApplicationTest-1.0.8.jar** the result:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Error: Could not find or load main class de.test.Main Caused by:\r\n&gt; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/application/Application\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## FAT JAR with dependencies and module-info.java ##\r\n\r\nThen we tried to add the dependencies for JavaFX like this inside the gradle file\r\n\r\n    compile group: &#39;org.jboss.resteasy&#39;, name: &#39;resteasy-client&#39;, version: &#39;4.3.0.Final&#39;\r\n    compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n    compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-base:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n    compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-controls:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n    compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n    compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd this is the module-info.java discriptor we added to the package de.test:\r\n\r\n    module ApplicationTest.main {\r\n    \r\n    \trequires javafx.controls;\r\n    \r\n    \texports de.test;\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen calling **gradle installDist** we used this command\r\n\r\n&gt; cd build\\install\\ApplicationTest\\lib java --add-modules\r\n&gt; &quot;javafx.controls&quot; --module-path . -jar ApplicationTest-1.0.8.jar\r\n\r\nAt least the application started at this point, but the layout was destroyed with the following info messages:\r\n\r\n&gt; Sep. 20, 2019 8:32:55 VORM. com.sun.javafx.css.StyleManager\r\n&gt; loadStylesheetUnPrivileged INFO: Could not load stylesheet:\r\n&gt; com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css Sep. 20, 2019\r\n&gt; 8:32:55 VORM. com.sun.javafx.css.StyleManager\r\n&gt; loadStylesheetUnPrivileged INFO: Could not load stylesheet:\r\n&gt; com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css\r\n\r\n\r\n[![No layout when using the JAR file][1]][1]\r\n\r\nBy the way: IntelliJ is always working when using the command **gradle clean run**\r\n\r\n[![Using IntelliJ the layout is fine][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n## JLink with module-info.java ##\r\n\r\nThe next approach was using jlink and the following modules-info.java \r\n\r\n    module ApplicationTest.main {\r\n    \trequires javafx.controls;\r\n    \trequires javafx.graphics;\r\n    \r\n    \texports de.test;\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe needed to extend the gradle file a bit as the following\r\n\r\n\r\n    plugins {\r\n        id &#39;java&#39;\r\n        id &#39;application&#39;\r\n        id &#39;org.openjfx.javafxplugin&#39; version &#39;0.0.8&#39;\r\n        id &#39;org.beryx.jlink&#39; version &#39;2.10.4&#39;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    group &#39;de.test&#39;\r\n    version &#39;1.0.8&#39;\r\n    \r\n    sourceCompatibility = 11\r\n    \r\n    mainClassName = &#39;de.test.Main&#39;\r\n    \r\n    javafx {\r\n        version = 11\r\n        modules = [ &#39;javafx.controls&#39;]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    jlink {\r\n        options = [&#39;--strip-debug&#39;, &#39;--compress&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;--no-header-files&#39;, &#39;--no-man-pages&#39;]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    repositories {\r\n        mavenLocal()\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen using **gradle jlink** and executing the **cd build\\image\\bin\\ApplicationTest.bat** file, the application starts **WITH** layout. \r\n\r\nAt this point we where kind of happy. Now we needed to add some dependencies for our application.\r\n\r\nUsing the following dependencies worked perfectly\r\n\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        compile &quot;commons-io:commons-io:2.6&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:2.11.2&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;dom4j:dom4j:1.6.1&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;commons-lang:commons-lang:2.6&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;axis:axis:1.4&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;jaxen:jaxen:1.1.6&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;net.java.dev.jna:platform:3.5.2&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.apache.poi:poi:4.1.0&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.apache.poi:poi-scratchpad:4.1.0&quot;\r\n    \tcompile &quot;com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310:2.9.4&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I add the other dependencies I get different kind of error messages. I tried each dependency alone to isolate the error message.\r\n\r\n## org.jboss.resteasy - resteasy-client - 3.7.0.Final ##\r\n\r\n    Cannot derive uses clause from service loader invocation in: javax/ws/rs/client/FactoryFinder.find().\r\n    Cannot derive uses clause from service loader invocation in: javax/ws/rs/ext/FactoryFinder.find().\r\n    Cannot derive uses clause from service loader invocation in: javax/ws/rs/sse/FactoryFinder.find().\r\n    Cannot derive uses clause from service loader invocation in: javax/xml/bind/ServiceLoaderUtil.firstByServiceLoader().\r\n    \r\n    ApplicationTest\\build\\jlinkbase\\tmpjars\\de.test.merged.module\\module-info.java:154: error: the service implementation type must be a subtype of the service interface type, or have a public static no-args method named &quot;provider&quot; returning the service implementation\r\n        provides javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers with org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.interceptors.CacheControlFeature,\r\n                                                                                       ^\r\n    ApplicationTest\\build\\jlinkbase\\tmpjars\\de.test.merged.module\\module-info.java:155: error: the service implementation type must be a subtype of the service interface type, or have a public static no-args method named &quot;provider&quot; returning the service implementation\r\n    \t\t\t\torg.jboss.resteasy.plugins.interceptors.encoding.ClientContentEncodingAnnotationFeature,\r\n    \t\t\t\t                                                ^\r\n    ApplicationTest\\build\\jlinkbase\\tmpjars\\de.test.merged.module\\module-info.java:156: error: the service implementation type must be a subtype of the service interface type, or have a public static no-args method named &quot;provider&quot; returning the service implementation\r\n    \t\t\t\torg.jboss.resteasy.plugins.interceptors.encoding.MessageSanitizerContainerResponseFilter,\r\n    \t\t\t\t                                                ^\r\n    ...    \t\r\n\t\t                                        ^\r\n    25 errors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency: org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.11.2 ##\r\n\r\n    package org.apache.logging.log4j.spi is not visible\r\n    (package org.apache.logging.log4j.spi is declared in module org.apache.logging.log4j, but module de.test.merged.module does not read it)\r\n    package org.apache.logging.log4j.message is not visible\r\n    (package org.apache.logging.log4j.message is declared in module org.apache.logging.log4j, but module de.test.merged.module does not read it)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency: org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-multipart-provider:3.7.0.Final ##\r\n\r\n    module not found: java.activation\r\n\r\n## Dependecyy: org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-jackson2-provider:3.7.0.Final ##\r\n\r\n\r\n    package javax.ws.rs.ext does not exist\r\n    package javax.ws.rs.ext does not exist\r\n    package javax.ws.rs.ext does not exist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion ##\r\n\r\nWe&#39;re not getting anywhere right now. It probably has something to do with modules-info.java, but the instructions and documentation on this topic are quite complex and often very detailed. We just wanted an application that could be started outside the IntelliJ.\r\n\r\nWe are open for all solutions as long as they work. We don&#39;t need a state of the art solution either, but something from which we can somehow get an EXE in the end (also with the help of an external tool). Our application doesn&#39;t have to be modular, but we neither get it nor solve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## EDIT 1) FAT Jar with 2nd main class ##\r\n\r\nLike in [this aricle][3] we added a second main java class without extending **Application** and put that to the gradle file\r\n\r\n    package de.test;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main {\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tMainFX.main(args);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nand the other class looks like this:\r\n\r\n    package de.test;\r\n    \r\n    import ...;\r\n    \r\n    public class MainFX extends Application {\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tlaunch();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {\r\n        ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand the gradle file looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    plugins {\r\n        id &#39;java&#39;\r\n        id &#39;application&#39;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    group &#39;de.test&#39;\r\n    version &#39;1.0.8&#39;\r\n    \r\n    sourceCompatibility = 11\r\n    \r\n    mainClassName = &#39;de.test.MainFX&#39;\r\n    \r\n    jar {\r\n        manifest {\r\n            attributes &#39;Main-Class&#39;: mainClassName\r\n        }\r\n        from {\r\n            configurations.compile.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    repositories {\r\n        mavenLocal()\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    dependencies {\r\n        compile &quot;commons-io:commons-io:2.6&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:2.11.2&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;dom4j:dom4j:1.6.1&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;commons-lang:commons-lang:2.6&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;axis:axis:1.4&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;jaxen:jaxen:1.1.6&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;net.java.dev.jna:platform:3.5.2&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.apache.poi:poi:4.1.0&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.apache.poi:poi-scratchpad:4.1.0&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310:2.9.4&quot;\r\n    \r\n        compile &quot;org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-multipart-provider:3.7.0.Final&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-jackson2-provider:3.7.0.Final&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.11.2&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-client:3.7.0.Final&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-base:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-controls:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n        compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:11.0.2:win&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is really strange **java -jar ApplicationTest.jar** returns\r\n\r\n&gt;

And also, the packages needed all has been restored. It&#39;s restored folder location is `D:\\a\\1\\s\\webapp\\Websites\\packages` which same with location defined in Nuget.config `..\\packages`\r\n\r\nIn the `Visual Studio Build` log, there has the following message:\r\n\r\n    Considered &quot;..\\ThirdParty\\NuGetPackages\\EntityFramework.6.1.2\\lib\\net45\\EntityFramework.dll&quot;, but it didn&#39;t exist.\r\n    ***\r\n    ***\r\n    Considered &quot;..\\ThirdParty\\NuGetPackages\\EntityFramework.6.1.2\\lib\\net45\\EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll&quot;, but it didn&#39;t exist.\r\n    ***\r\n    ***\r\n    ***\r\n\r\nAccording to these message which displayed in Visual Studio Build task, you can see it is finding the package location under the folder path `..\\ThirdParty\\NuGetPackages`. As normal, this path is controlled by the `&lt;HintPath&gt;... &lt;/HintPath&gt;`.\r\n\r\nNow, it would be very easy to know the error caused: the package location which found during the build does not match with its actually package restored location in `Nuget restore` task.\r\n\r\nAs normal, its default location should be `..\\packages\\...`, which same with default location defined in `Nuget.config`. I assume its local repos path should ever be changed, then its `HintPath` which defined in `csproj` file are also be changed automatically. But, in Nuget.config, its package default location are still keep default. That will cause when package restore, it follow the location defined in `Nuget.config`. But during build time, since it look for the package with the `csproj` &lt;HintPath&gt;... &lt;/HintPath&gt; defined, build can not know the actually package restored location. Then caused these error message.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, there has 2 solutions.\r\n\r\n - Reinstall packages in Visual Studio\r\n\r\nRun the below command to [reinstall all of packages][1], thus the `HintPath` can all changed into default location `..\\packages\\...`, which can sync with defined in Nuget.config.\r\n\r\n    Update-Package -reinstall\r\n\r\nThis logic of this solution is revoke `HintPath` as default location, thus it can keep sync with definition in `Nuget.config`. \r\n\r\nAfter execute the command, the `HintPath` should same look as this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n - Modify the `Nuget.config` file\r\n\r\nThe logic of second solution is [modify the package location definition][3] in `Nuget.config` file. Make it sync with `HintPath`, at this time, the location of the package restored will be the same as the location of the package at build time.\r\n\r\nAdd the following script into Nuget.config file:\r\n\r\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n      &lt;config&gt;\r\n        &lt;add key=&quot;repositoryPath&quot; value=&quot;xxxx&quot; /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/config&gt;\r\n      ... \r\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n\r\nJust try with one solution, then build in Visual Studio locally. After it is succeed, then push it into Azure Devops, build with the same task configuration previously, `use nuget`, `nuget restore`, `VS build`, `publish artifacts`.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/reinstalling-and-updating-packages\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ulvB.png\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-2.1#specify-packages-folder-location","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025621/unable-to-build-a-asp-net-app-in-azure-devops/58082935#58082935","title":"unable to build a asp.net app in azure devops"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":11708158,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a58bd0ad92ff393af587ad43d5c0f011?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11708158/stella"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34,"user_id":11708158,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a58bd0ad92ff393af587ad43d5c0f011?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11708158/stella"},"comment_count":15,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":142,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58082935,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569336744,"creation_date":1568971832,"last_edit_date":1569238191,"question_id":58025621,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025621","body_markdown":"Able to build the app locally, but when am trying to build in azure devops pipeline.It showing below errors\r\n\r\nI have installed EntityFramework and added system.data.entity.design assembly in webconfig file.No luck\r\n\r\n\r\n[Please find pipeline here][1]\r\n\r\n[NuGet Restore task][2]\r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n    webapp\\CaseDatabase.DataAccess\\CaseAssignmentModule\\CaseQueueDbAdapter.cs(10,19): Error CS0234: The type or namespace name &#39;Entity&#39;

playgrounds are a great place to explore the language.  Even though you can&#39;t run the whole code, you can put a few support pieces around it to see what is happening.\r\n\r\n`oldArray` clearly holds some `enum` values.  From your snippet, we can see that one of the values is `.entry`.  I&#39;ve created an `enum` called `State` for exploration purposes and given it a few cases (`entry`, `foo`, `bar`).\r\n\r\nNow throw your snippet into a function and give it an `oldArray` to work with. Add a `print` in the `// Do stuff` section and the truth will be revealed:\r\n\r\n    enum State {\r\n        case entry\r\n        case foo\r\n        case bar\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    func test() {\r\n        let oldArray: [State] = [.entry, .entry, .bar, .entry, .foo]\r\n        \r\n        do {\r\n            oldArray.enumerated().forEach { oldTuple in\r\n                guard case .entry = oldTuple.element else {\r\n                    return\r\n                }\r\n                \r\n                // Do stuff\r\n                print(oldTuple)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    test()\r\n\r\n**Output**\r\n\r\n    (offset: 0, element: __lldb_expr_1.State.entry)\r\n    (offset: 1, element: __lldb_expr_1.State.entry)\r\n    (offset: 3, element: __lldb_expr_1.State.entry)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n&gt; Is this `return` equivalent to a `break`?\r\n\r\nIt returns from the closure if the `guard` condition isn&#39;t met.\r\n\r\n&gt; What is the `guard` condition? Some assignment...?\r\n\r\n`.enumerated` turns `oldArray` into a sequence of `(offset: Int, element: State)` tuples.  So the example array becomes `[(offset: 0, element: .entry), (offset: 1, element: .entry), ...]`.  `forEach` takes each of those tuples in turn and assigns it to `oldTuple`.\r\n\r\nThe `guard` is using *pattern matching* to verify that the current tuple&#39;s `element` value is `.entry` otherwise it exits the closure.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is a bit odd, but it is saying, *to continue beyond this statement, the current tuple&#39;s `element` must be a `.entry` otherwise `return` from the closure and abandon processing this element*.\r\n\r\nSo, this code loops through an array of enums and processes only the ones that are `.entry`.\r\n\r\n&gt; What does the `do` do?\r\n\r\nNothing that we can see from your snippet.  If you comment out `do {` and the corresponding `}` the test still does the same thing.  `do` is usually used with *Error handing* to surround calls that might `throw` an error.  `do` statements are usually used with `catch` statements which then catch the thrown error.  By itself, `do { }` just creates a new scope.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025607/swift-do-return-with-guard-condition/58026138#58026138","title":"Swift do-return with guard condition?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6771,"user_id":419761,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3719d63417e1d046ab9cf6a0a53d22b7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"l33t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/419761/l33t"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58026138,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1568976668,"creation_date":1568971798,"question_id":58025607,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025607","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to translate some `Swift` code to `C#`.

These are referenced as dual to initial free algebras, so I was wondering what Tagless Final was final of. On ncatlab one only finds talk of final coalgebras, not final algebras. \r\n\r\nAsking the Question [What Category are Tagless Final Algebras Final In](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/45565/what-category-are-tagless-final-algebras-final-in/45566) on CS-Theory Stack Exchange I got a very good answer pointing to this blog post [Final Algebra Semantics is Observational Equivalence](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/blog/2017/09/27/final-algebra-semantics-is-observational-equivalence/). So these are indeed final algebras, but not in the same category of algebras as the initial one....\r\n\r\n## Question\r\n\r\nYet, when we look at how _final tagless_ is **used**, we find that it is very often applied for things that look like coalgebras. See for example the two examples of a `Console` or a `UserRepository` in part 1 of [The False Hope of Managing Effects with Tagless-Final in Scala](https://dzone.com/articles/the-false-hope-of-managing-effects-with-tagless-fi). \r\n\r\nSo instead of having Algebras which in category theory are expressed with endofunctors `F` as maps of the form `F(X) ⟹ X`, it looks like many use `final tagless` with Coalgebras which are maps `X ⟹ F(X)`, and represent processes. Are these really the same thing? Or is something else going on here?\r\n\r\n## ADTs and Final Tagless \r\n\r\n\r\n### On Algebras\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start by the explanations of final tagless given by Olivier Blanvillain&#39;s [Scala translation of examples taken from coursework on  in Haskell](https://gist.github.com/OlivierBlanvillain/48bb5c66dbb0557da50465809564ee80). One notices that this starts with an Algebraic Data Type that is indeed the archetype of an Algebraic structure: a Group.\r\n\r\nIn category a group can be built out of a the Polynomial Functor \r\n`F[X] = X&#215;X + X + 1` which takes any type to the type that is either the pair of that type or that type or 1. Then selecting one specific type for X, say A an algebra is a function `F[A] ⟹ A`. The most widely known group is the set of positive and negative natural numbers and 0 denoted ℤ, and so our algebra is:\r\n\r\n```math\r\nℤ&#215;ℤ + ℤ + 1 ⟹ ℤ \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe algebra can be decomposed into 3 function `+: ℤ&#215;ℤ ⟹ ℤ`, `-: ℤ ⟹ ℤ ` and the constant `zero: 1 ⟹ ℤ `. If we vary the type X we get different algebras, and these form a category, with morphisms between them, where the most important one is the initial algebra.\r\n\r\nThe initial algebra is the free one  which allows one to build all the structure without ever loosing any information. In [Scala 3](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/enums/adts.html) we can build the initial algebra for a group like this: \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nenum IExp {\r\n   case Lit(i: Int)\r\n   case Neg(e: IExp)\r\n   case Add(r: IExp, l: IExp)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we can build a simple structure using it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport IExp._\r\nval fe: IExp = Add(Lit(8), Neg(Add(Lit(1), Lit(2))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `fe` structure can then be interpreted by creating functions `IExp =&gt; Int` or `IExp =&gt; String`, which are morphisms in the category of algebras,\r\nwhich one reaches by deconstructing the ADT, and recursively mapping these\r\nto an algebra with for a specific X (eg `String` or `Int`). This morphism is known as a fold. (See the 1997 book [The Algebra of Programming, by Richard Bird and Oege de Moor](https://themattchan.com/docs/algprog.pdf))\r\n\r\nIn Tagless final this is transformed into the trait\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntrait Exp[T] {\r\n  def lit(i: Int): T\r\n  def neg(t: T): T\r\n  def add(l: T, r: T): T\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs is a set of three functions all returning the same type.\r\nExpressions are function applications\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef tf0[T] given (e: Exp[T]): T =\r\n\timport e._\r\n\tadd(lit(8), neg(add(lit(1), lit(2))))\r\n```\r\nand these can be interpreted with a given instance\r\n\t\r\n```\r\ngiven as Exp[Int] {\r\n   def lit(i: Int): Int = i\r\n   def neg(t: Int): Int = -t\r\n   def add(l: Int, r: Int): Int = l + r\r\n}\r\ntf0[Int]  // 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially the interpretation is the implementation of the interface\r\n`Exp` that is `given` (or in Scala 2 `implicit`) in the context.\r\n\r\nSo here we are moving from an algebraic structure expressed from an initial ADT to a final tagless version. (See the discussion on [cstheory on what that is](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/45565/what-category-are-tagless-final-algebras-final-in)).\r\n\r\n\r\n### On Coalgebras\r\n\r\nNow if we take the `UserRepository` example from [The False Hope of Managing Effects with Tagless-Final in Scala](https://dzone.com/articles/the-false-hope-of-managing-effects-with-tagless-fi), we have\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntrait UserRepository {\r\n  def getUserById(id: UserID): User\r\n  def getUserProfile(user: User): UserProfile\r\n  def updateUserProfile(user: User, profile: UserProfile): Unit\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is clearly (for anyone who has read some of Bart Jacobs&#39; work starting with [Objects and Classes Coalgebraically](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.7619&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)) a coalgebra on the state S of `UserRepository`.\r\nA Coalgebra is the dual of an Algebra: the arrows are reversed.\r\nStarting from a Functor F, and a specific type S an coalgebra\r\nis a function `S ⟹ F[S]`\r\n\r\nIn the case of a user repository we can see this to be \r\n\r\n```math\r\nS ⟹ (Uid → User) &#215; (User → Profile) &#215; (User &#215; Profile → S) \r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the functor `F(X)` takes any type `X` to a 3-tuple of functions. \r\nThe coalgebra is such a functor F, a set of states S, and\r\na transition morphism `S ⟹ F(S)`.  We have 2 observational methods `getUserById` and `getUserProfile` and one state changing one `updateUserProfile` also known as a setter. By varying the type of states\r\nwe vary the coalgebra. If we look at all coalgebras on such a functor F, and the morphisms between them, we get a category of coalgebras. Of which the most important one is the final one which gives the structure of all observations on the coalgebras of that functor.\r\n\r\nFor more info on coalgebras and their relation to OO see the work by Bart Jacobs such as his [Tutorial on (co)Algebras and (co)Induction](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40bb/e9978e2c4080740f55634ac58033bfb37d36.pdf) or [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1172265457153392640).\r\n\r\nEssentially we have a process such as a UserRepository or a Console that have state and can change state, whereas it does not make sense to think\r\nof change of state for a number.\r\n\r\nNow it is true that in the Tagless Final example of UserRepository it is Genericised by a Functor `F[_]`, like this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntrait UserRepository[F[_]] {\r\n  def getUserById(id: UserID): F[User]\r\n  def getUserProfile(user: User): F[UserProfile]\r\n  def updateUserProfile(user: User, profile: UserProfile): F[Unit]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs that enough to change UserRepository into an algebra? It does in a way look like the functions all have the same range of type F[_], but does that really work? What if F is the Identity functor? Then we have the previous case.\r\n\r\nGoing the other way, from Final Tagless to an ADT, one should ask what would it be to have an ADT for `UserRepository`? \r\n(I have written something like that myself to model commands to change [a remote RDF database](https://github.com/read-write-web/rww-play/blob/dev/app/rww/ldp/LDPCommand.scala) and found that really helpful, but I am not sure if this is correct mathematically.) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Further References\r\n\r\n * The influential Haskell [Typed Tagless Final Interpreters](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/course/lecture.pdf) lecture notes\r\n * A translation of that article for Scala (Dotty) [Revisiting Tagless Final Interpreters](https://gist.github.com/OlivierBlanvillain/48bb5c66dbb0557da50465809564ee80)\r\n * A blog post [From Object Algebras to Finally Tagless Interpreters](https://oleksandrmanzyuk.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/from-object-algebras-to-finally-tagless-interpreters-2/) makes the case that Object algebras are equivalent to Tagless Final.\r\n * It cites the paper [Extensibility for the Masses, practical extensibility with Object Algebras](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2012/ecoop2012.pdf).\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo advantages claimed of Tagless Final are\r\n\r\n * it makes testing easy: by moving to programming with interfaces one can \r\neasily create mock implementations of the interface to test code such as database access, IO, etc...\r\n * it is extensible: one can easily extend an &#39;algebra&#39; with new methods overcoming what is known as the expression problem. (The expression problem is nicely illustrated in the blog post [From Object Algebras to Finally Tagless Interpreters](https://oleksandrmanzyuk.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/from-object-algebras-to-finally-tagless-interpreters-2/)).\r\n\r\nThe following looks like it could provide a clue:\r\n\r\nThe recent article [Codata in Action](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-17184-1_5) claims that codata (a coalgebraic concept) is the bridge between functional and OO programming, and actually uses the visitor pattern described (also used in [Extensibility for the Masses](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2012/ecoop2012.pdf)) to map between data and codata.
