This is so I can work out if the repo has changed in the last 24 hours for exampple.\r\n\r\nI have searched how to do this, but the examples I come across show how to create an HTTP client and then create a request (so the headers can be added) and then do a `Do` action on it. However As I am using the client directly I do not have that option.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `go-github` states that for conditional requests:\r\n\r\n&gt;  The GitHub API has good support for conditional requests which will help prevent you from burning through your rate limit, as well as help speed up your application. go-github does not handle conditional requests directly, but is instead designed to work with a caching http.Transport. We recommend using https://github.com/gregjones/httpcache for that.\r\n\r\n&gt; Learn more about GitHub conditional requests at https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests. \r\n\r\nI do not know how to add it in my code, any help is greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166420/how-can-i-set-http-request-headers-when-using-go-github-and-an-http-transport","title":"How can I set HTTP request headers when using Go-Github and an http.Transport?"},{"tags":["elasticsearch","elasticsearch-5"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":3518958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1e96e48a228eb268c67aebb62ab1a1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"User3518958","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3518958/user3518958"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569841387,"post_id":58166419,"comment_id":102714711,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166419/adding-a-multifield-with-analyzer-in-existing-field-in-existing-index#comment102714711_58166419"},{"owner":{"reputation":124399,"user_id":4604579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reC2t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Val","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604579/val"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569842049,"post_id":58166419,"comment_id":102715046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166419/adding-a-multifield-with-analyzer-in-existing-field-in-existing-index#comment102715046_58166419"},{"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":3518958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1e96e48a228eb268c67aebb62ab1a1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"User3518958","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3518958/user3518958"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":124399,"user_id":4604579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reC2t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Val","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604579/val"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569842277,"post_id":58166419,"comment_id":102715155,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166419/adding-a-multifield-with-analyzer-in-existing-field-in-existing-index#comment102715155_58166419"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":124399,"user_id":4604579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reC2t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Val","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604579/val"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569842378,"post_id":58166817,"comment_id":102715189,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166419/adding-a-multifield-with-analyzer-in-existing-field-in-existing-index/58166817#comment102715189_58166817"},{"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":3518958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1e96e48a228eb268c67aebb62ab1a1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"User3518958","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3518958/user3518958"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":124399,"user_id":4604579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reC2t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Val","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604579/val"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569855076,"post_id":58166817,"comment_id":102721912,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166419/adding-a-multifield-with-analyzer-in-existing-field-in-existing-index/58166817#comment102721912_58166817"},{"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":3518958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1e96e48a228eb268c67aebb62ab1a1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"User3518958","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3518958/user3518958"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":124399,"user_id":4604579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reC2t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Val","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604579/val"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571770472,"post_id":58166817,"comment_id":103348857,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166419/adding-a-multifield-with-analyzer-in-existing-field-in-existing-index/58166817#comment103348857_58166817"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":3518958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1e96e48a228eb268c67aebb62ab1a1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"User3518958","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3518958/user3518958"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569842199,"creation_date":1569842199,"answer_id":58166817,"question_id":58166419,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58166817","body_markdown":"As mentioned in the comment, the error was because  I was trying to add an analyzer to a &#39;keyword&#39;

If the in-coming content has the same style name(s) applied as already present in the target document, the formatting of in-coming content will change.\r\n\r\nAs shown in an answer, the `PasteAndFormat` with the parameter `Word.WdRecoveryType.wdFormatOriginalFormatting` method when using the Windows Clipboard will override the default behavior and maintain the original formatting.\r\n\r\nWorking via the Clipboard is not always desired or ideal, however. There is another way, which is to change the style name(s) in the source document so that they&#39;re different than in the target document. This approach will work if styles have been used *consistently* in the source document. (Formatting applied manually may still be lost, however.) \r\n\r\nThe following code snippet illustrates the approach for paragraph styles. It creates a new style based on the styles used in the document - the new style is an exact duplicate except for the name.

And I cant get the original text formating there also. Maby it is a wrong aproach?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166396/inserting-one-document-to-another-microsoft-office-interop-word","title":"Inserting one document to another

the comment was: ` I want to generate text from scratch, not starting from a given sentence at inference time. I hope it makes sense.`\r\n\r\nyes, you can do that, that&#39;s just simple code manipulation on top of the ready models, be it BERT, GPT-2 or LSTM based RNN. \r\n\r\nHow? You have to provide random input to the model. Such random input can be randomly chosen word or phrase or just a vector of zeroes. \r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou have mixed up several things here. \r\n\r\nYou can achieve what you want either using LSTM based or transformer based architecture. \r\n\r\nWhen you said you did it with RNN, you probably mean that you have tried LSTM based sequence to sequence model. \r\n\r\nNow, there is attention in your question. So you can use attention to improve your RNN but it is not a required condition. However, if you use transformer architecture, then it is built in the transormer blocks.\r\n\r\nGPT-2 is nothing but a transformer based model. Its building block is a transformer architecture.\r\n\r\nBERT is also another transformer based architecture.\r\n\r\nSo to answer your question, you should and can try using LSTM based or transformer based architecture to achieve what you want. Sometimes such architecture is called GPT-2, sometimes BERT depending on how it is realized.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to read this classic from Karpathy, if you understand it then you have cleared most of your questions:\r\n\r\nhttp://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166356/deep-learning-methods-for-text-generation-pytorch/58179307#58179307","title":"Deep Learning methods for Text Generation (PyTorch)"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11237667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-INvTYTZGbSY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdKZgymRaYBmMwbN_7ZvUPYpWFlnQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"OverclockRo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11237667/overclockro"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26335,"user_id":4685471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/327dc718c142e3ea70e5db4b38050a36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"desertnaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4685471/desertnaut"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58179307,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569981441,"creation_date":1569840546,"last_edit_date":1569850201,"question_id":58166356,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166356","body_markdown":"Greetings to everyone,\r\n\r\nI want to design a system that is able to **generate stories** or poetry based on a large dataset of text, **without being needed to feed a text description/start/summary as input at inference time.**\r\n\r\nSo far I did this using **RNN**&#39;s, but as you know they have a lot of flaws.

Somewhere this is still translated into DATETIME2(7).\r\n\r\nIs there a way, I can land that timezone-aware string as a string in SQL Server?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166326/insert-pandas-with-timezone-aware-columns-as-string-into-sql-server-with-sqlalch","title":"Insert Pandas with timezone-aware columns as string into SQL Server with SQLAlchemy"},{"tags":["spring","spring-boot"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10060,"user_id":5091073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cae416e3ac456b5b33b54438f7f4dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nir Levy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5091073/nir-levy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569840825,"creation_date":1569840825,"answer_id":58166432,"question_id":58166325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58166432","body_markdown":"you can use Spring&#39;s `CommandLineRunner` interface for that:\r\n\r\nfor example (Taken from [this guide][1]):\r\n\r\n    @SpringBootApplication\r\n    public class SpringBootConsoleApplication \r\n      implements CommandLineRunner {\r\n     \r\n        private static Logger LOG = LoggerFactory\r\n          .getLogger(SpringBootConsoleApplication.class);\r\n     \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            LOG.info(&quot;STARTING THE APPLICATION&quot;);\r\n            SpringApplication.run(SpringBootConsoleApplication.class, args);\r\n            LOG.info(&quot;APPLICATION FINISHED&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n      \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void run(String... args) {\r\n            LOG.info(&quot;EXECUTING : command line runner&quot;);\r\n      \r\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; ++i) {\r\n                LOG.info(&quot;args[{}]: {}&quot;, i, args[i]);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-console-app","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166325/run-spring-boot-application-once-and-exit/58166432#58166432","title":"Run Spring Boot application once and exit"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":524,"user_id":6834956,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5617b9cff837e7690c4823bb7676160?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max R.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6834956/max-r"},"last_editor":{"reputation":524,"user_id":6834956,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5617b9cff837e7690c4823bb7676160?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max R.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6834956/max-r"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569849750,"last_edit_date":1569849750,"creation_date":1569840885,"answer_id":58166455,"question_id":58166325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58166455","body_markdown":"I did something similiar with SpringBoot and JCommander as addition, it makes creating CLI applications really easy and provides a lot more additional features than the CommandLineRunner Interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n-&gt; http://jcommander.org/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166325/run-spring-boot-application-once-and-exit/58166455#58166455","title":"Run Spring Boot application once and exit"}],"owner":{"reputation":391,"user_id":691183,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d1cd898a996f17851847af709fb88bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Marx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/691183/marx"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569849750,"creation_date":1569840426,"question_id":58166325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166325","body_markdown":"I have Spring Boot application which works ok.

You can do those things with a cursor variable (see &quot;[Cursor Variables](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/lnpls/static-sql.html#GUID-4A6E054A-4002-418D-A1CA-DE849CD7E6D5)&quot;).\r\n\r\nSo you cannot send an explicit cursor, `c1` or `c2` in your example - you can&#39;t have a procedure that takes an explicit cursor argument.\r\n\r\nYou are allowed to supply a *ref* cursor as a [formal parameter](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/lnpls/plsql-subprograms.html#GUID-9ACD7C7D-861B-4410-AC6F-8536C191E2EF), as you already doing. That could be an open cursor, as you have; or a cursor variable that you then open. But you don&#39;t really seem to want the cursor outside the procedure call, so neither seems quite what you want.\r\n\r\nIf you had a small-ish defined list of cursors you could literally pass the *name* of the cursor as a string, and then use a case statement in the procedure to open the relevant pre-defined cursor:\r\n\r\n    PROCEDURE outer_proc AS\r\n    \r\n      m VARCHAR2(2000):=&#39;&#39;;\r\n    \r\n      CURSOR c1 IS SELECT first_name,last_name FROM employees WHERE salary&lt;1000;\r\n      CURSOR c2 IS SELECT first_name,last_name FROM employees WHERE salary&gt;=1000;\r\n    \r\n      PROCEDURE inner_proc(cur_name IN varchar2,m OUT VARCHAR2) IS\r\n        col1 VARCHAR2(20);\r\n        col2 VARCHAR2(20);\r\n      BEGIN\r\n        CASE cur_name\r\n          WHEN &#39;c1&#39; THEN\r\n            OPEN c1;\r\n            LOOP\r\n              FETCH c1 INTO col1,col2; -- this will only work in the cursor only selects two columns!\r\n              EXIT WHEN c1%NOTFOUND;\r\n              m:=m||col1||&#39; &#39;||col2;\r\n            END LOOP;\r\n            CLOSE c1;\r\n          WHEN &#39;c2&#39; THEN\r\n            OPEN c2;\r\n            LOOP\r\n              FETCH c2 INTO col1,col2; -- this will only work in the cursor only selects two columns!\r\n              EXIT WHEN c2%NOTFOUND;\r\n              m:=m||col1||&#39; &#39;||col2;\r\n            END LOOP;\r\n            CLOSE c2;\r\n        END CASE;\r\n      END;\r\n    \r\n    BEGIN\r\n    \r\n      inner_proc(&#39;c1&#39;,m);\r\n      inner_proc(&#39;c2&#39;,m);\r\n    \r\n    END;     \r\n    /\r\n\r\n... but that&#39;s not scaleable and arguably already worse than what you have now.\r\n\r\nOr pass the cursor *query*, rather than the cursor, into the procedure, and then open and process it with dynamic SQL. As that is what @Wernfried has demonstrated, I won&#39;t go into further detail. The possible downside of that though is that if you already have an explicit cursor that you are trying to reuse then you&#39;re now duplicating that query instead. Oh, and as it&#39;s dynamic, the query itself won&#39;t be parsed until run time, so an error might not be caught as early as you&#39;d like.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - see [@Wernfried&#39;s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58170989/266304) *8-)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166301/sendig-explicit-cursor-as-procedure-parameter/58171864#58171864","title":"Sendig explicit CURSOR as procedure parameter"}],"owner":{"reputation":3598,"user_id":1443324,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9mdB5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sbrbot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1443324/sbrbot"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3598,"user_id":1443324,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9mdB5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sbrbot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1443324/sbrbot"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58171864,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569914348,"creation_date":1569840351,"last_edit_date":1569914348,"question_id":58166301,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166301","body_markdown":"I have the folowing code.

At the end the link has an arrowhead. This works great. However if I create two or more instances of the graph component the arrows only appear in the first graph. \r\n\r\nIf I look at the html syntax all the graphs have the arrow and path templates in place. I thought maybe this was related to that the arrows need unique id&#180;s and when making multiple instances there are many arrow markers with the same id. \r\n\r\nSo I tried making the id&#180;s dynamic with the help of Angular however in that case no arrow was displayed even though the id and marker-end are in place in the html. The code shows how the graph is rendered.\r\n\r\nAny idea why the arrows are only appearing in the first instance of the graph?\r\n\r\n        &lt;ngx-graph [links]=&quot;links&quot; [nodes]=&quot;nodes&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ng-template #nodeTemplate let-node&gt;\r\n                    &lt;svg:g class=&quot;node&quot;&gt;&lt;/svg:g&gt;\r\n                &lt;/ng-template&gt;\r\n        \r\n                &lt;ng-template #linkTemplate let-link&gt;\r\n                    &lt;svg:g class=&quot;edge&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;svg:marker id=&quot;arrow&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 -5 10 10&quot; refX=&quot;8&quot; refY=&quot;0&quot; markerWidth=&quot;4&quot; markerHeight=&quot;4&quot; orient=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;svg:path d=&quot;M0,-5L10,0L0,5&quot; class=&quot;arrow-head&quot; /&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/svg:marker&gt;  \r\n    &lt;svg:path [attr.marker-end]=&quot;url(#arrow)&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/svg:path&gt;                  \r\n                    &lt;/svg:g&gt;\r\n                &lt;/ng-template&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ngx-graph&gt;\r\n\r\nHere is the code with dynamic id&#39;s , the id&#39;s are printed corretly to the dom tree but in this case none arrow heads are displayed:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ng-template #linkTemplate let-link&gt;\r\n                &lt;svg:g class=&quot;edge&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;svg:marker id=&quot;{{link.id}}&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 -5 10 10&quot; refX=&quot;8&quot; refY=&quot;0&quot; markerWidth=&quot;4&quot; markerHeight=&quot;4&quot;\r\n                        orient=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;svg:path d=&quot;M0,-5L10,0L0,5&quot; class=&quot;arrow-head&quot; /&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/svg:marker&gt;                   \r\n                     &lt;svg:path [attr.marker-end]=&quot;&#39;url(#&#39;+ link.id +&#39;)&#39;&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/svg:path&gt;                    \r\n                &lt;/svg:g&gt;\r\n            &lt;/ng-template&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166286/svgmarker-arrowhead-not-always-displayed","title":"svg:marker arrowhead not always displayed"},{"tags":["regex","postgresql","plpgsql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569840352,"post_id":58166284,"comment_id":102714147,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166284/regex-adds-unwanted-curly-braces-to-matched-strings#comment102714147_58166284"},{"owner":{"reputation":500,"user_id":6216235,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/393c557e4c9c7691bcdf18a129e8a2b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S.

you&#39;re showing here is the first half of a function body. Unfortunately `$*` is a global variable, so setting it has an effect on all called functions (e.g. `read_comp`) if they use regexes.\r\n\r\nAlso, that code is written in a slightly bizarre way:\r\n\r\n- I assume the intention was to enable &quot;multiline&quot; matching for the `$comp_buf =~ /$regexp/g` part, but `$*` is set early, so it also affects `$regexp !~ /([^\\\\]|^)(\\\\\\\\)*\\$$/` and the `read_comp` call.\r\n\r\n- The checks for whether `$regexp` already starts/ends with `^`/`$` respectively are broken. For example, `(?:^foo$)` is an anchored regex, but the code would not detect that.\r\n\r\n- `grep ($_ .= &quot;\\n&quot;, ...)` is a baffling abuse of `grep` to emulate `map`. What the code is trying to do is to get the list of lines matched by the regex. However, the way the regex is built it does not match the terminating newline character `&quot;\\n&quot;` on each line, so the code manually adds `&quot;\\n&quot;` to every returned string.\r\n\r\n  The sane way of doing that would be:\r\n\r\n        @found_lines = map $_ . &quot;\\n&quot;, ...;   # or map &quot;$_\\n&quot;, ...\r\n\r\n  Instead of `map` we could use an imperative loop, taking advantage of the fact that `for` aliases the loop variable to the current list element:\r\n\r\n        @temp = ...;\r\n        for (@temp) {\r\n            $_ .= &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        @found_lines = @temp;\r\n\r\n  Instead of a `for` loop we could use `grep` for its side effect of iterating over a list:\r\n\r\n        @temp = ...;\r\n        grep $_ .= &quot;\\n&quot;, @temp;\r\n        @found_lines = @temp;\r\n\r\n  `grep` also aliases `$_` to the current element, so the &quot;filter expression&quot; can modify the list we&#39;re iterating over.\r\n\r\n  Finally, because `.=` returns the resulting string (and strings containing `&quot;\\n&quot;` cannot be false), we can take advantage of the fact that our &quot;filter expression&quot; always returns a true value and effectively get a copy of the input list as the return value from `grep`:\r\n\r\n        @found_lines = grep $_ .= &quot;\\n&quot;, ...  # blergh\r\n\r\nAs for the effect of `$*`: It is a boolean flag (initially false). If set to true, all regexes behave as if `/m` is in effect, i.e. `^` and `$` match at embedded newlines as well as the beginning/end of the string.\r\n\r\nAssuming my interpretation of the code is correct, you should be able to change it as follows:\r\n\r\n- `local ($*);` can be removed.\r\n- `$* = 1;` also needs to go.\r\n- `$comp_buf =~ /$regexp/g` should be changed to `$comp_buf =~ /$regexp/mg`. This is the only place I see where multiline mode makes sense.\r\n- I&#39;d really like to rewrite the last line. Either\r\n\r\n        @found_lines = map &quot;$_\\n&quot;, ($comp_buf =~ /$regexp/g);\r\n\r\n  (functional style), or, if you prefer a more imperative style:\r\n\r\n        @found_lines = ($comp_buf =~ /$regexp/g);\r\n        $_ .= &quot;\\n&quot; for @found_lines;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166262/rewriting-old-program-using-deprecated/58166746#58166746","title":"Rewriting old program using deprecated $*"}],"owner":{"reputation":95,"user_id":4022350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Morti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4022350/morti"},"last_editor":{"reputation":74934,"user_id":1848654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84180c0f3c9c04f8b8f0613fc0129dac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"melpomene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1848654/melpomene"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":137,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"accepted_answer_id":58166746,"answer_count":1,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1569846189,"creation_date":1569840202,"last_edit_date":1569846189,"question_id":58166262,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166262","body_markdown":"We have some really old perl code last updated 1997.

The documentation elaborates somewhat:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.application.sessionending?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.8\r\n\r\n&gt; By default, an application shuts down when the Windows session ends, which occurs when a user logs off or shuts down. When this happens, Windows asks each open application to shut down. However, it is possible that an application may not be ready to shut down when this occurs. For example, an application may have data that is in an inconsistent state, or in the middle of a long-running operation. In these situations, it may be desirable to prevent the session from ending, and may be more desirable to allow users the option to decide whether or not to let the session to end.\r\n\r\nSo session ending is designed for your scenario.\r\n\r\nApplication exit is not.\r\n\r\nThat event will fire quite late on in the process of shutting an app down and does not interrupt that process. It&#39;s for that reason it&#39;s a bad place to put any code you are relying on to save settings. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166253/how-do-i-keep-my-wpf-app-from-terminating-while-handling-application-exit-event/58166618#58166618","title":"How do I keep my WPF app from terminating while handling Application.Exit event when raised due to a system shutdown?"}],"owner":{"reputation":77,"user_id":1804451,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fce825e7658c8449fddc143efbb4b17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"thehan83","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1804451/thehan83"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1569982454,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569982465,"creation_date":1569840183,"question_id":58166253,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166253","body_markdown":"we have an application that needs to save settings when shutting down, including when windows shuts down. We are successfully receiving the `Application.Exit` event in this case, but then, depending on timing the application is simply terminated. It is not like we are doing a lot more than saving two small XML files with settings. Sometimes they get saved, sometimes not, again all depending on timing.\r\n\r\nIs there some maximum amount of time allowed for the application to clean up after receiving a signal that windows is shutting down?\r\n\r\nThe following work-around &quot;works&quot; but I do not understand why:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// In our main application class derived from Application:\r\nprotected override void OnSessionEnding(SessionEndingCancelEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n\te.Cancel = true;\r\n\tthis.Shutdown();\r\n\tbase.OnSessionEnding(e);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to work fine, and allows the application to exit in the same way as it would normally do (it is a minimize-to-tray type of app that uses `ShutdownMode.OnExplicitShutdown` and when quitting from the tray icon we do call Application.Shutdown explicitly).\r\n\r\nSo why does windows not allow time for the application to handle the Exit event? What causes it to force kill the application with seemingly no wait time? Is it because we have no open window left (we hide our main window when it gets minimized to the tray but do not close it)?\r\n\r\nWhat about the work-around?

Currently almost everything is commented out while I concentrate on the latest bit, so many files and tables do not change. At the end of the script is a simple query for about 20 tables, with repeat variants of\r\n\r\n    A5=$(sqlite3 $home/SQL/Cellar_analyse.db &#39;SELECT count(*) FROM table5;&#39;)\r\n    printf &quot;%-8s%10d\\t%-20s\\n&quot; &quot;table5&quot; $A5 &quot;full&quot; &gt;&gt; $tmp/tableStats \r\n\r\nfollowed by \r\n\r\n    cat $tmp/tableStats\r\nso I get a list of the length of all tables.  \r\n\r\nThis morning, when I first woke my machine up, I re-ran the same script as yesterday evening, which was based on a starting point of ``` head -10 file | ```, so there were only 10 records. It took 3 minutes 11 seconds to run, mostly spent calculating tableStats. I then changed &#39;head&#39; to &#39;cat&#39;, thereby increasing to a couple of of thousand records, yet the whole script subsequently ran in 2 seconds. On previous daily experience it will run quickly for the rest of the day (irrespective of machine sleeps), but tomorrow morning it will once again take an age the first time it&#39;s run.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m puzzled. Can anyone explain how and where this partial but not full result is cached? Is it done by the OS (presumably Ubuntu rather than Windows?) or by sqlite?  Is it held in memory or on disk; can the cache be called, accessed or manipulated in any way? What triggers a full rescan?

overflow. It doesn&#39;t matter if the result is casted to `double`, because it happens *after* the product are performed. You should use a bigger type, like `long long` and cast the values *before* the multiplications. In that case, the cast to `double` may even introduce some rounding errors.\r\n\r\n- Assigning the result of `sqrt` to an `int` may also introduce some unwanted rounding errors. You may use `round()` to prevent those.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, you may instead avoid `sqrt` and save some iterations using a different algorithm:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;\r\n\r\nstatic inline long long sq(int x)\r\n{\r\n    return (long long)x * x;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbool is_nonhypotenuse(int x)\r\n{\r\n    long long square_x = sq(x);\r\n\r\n    // Meet in the middle, instead of going up to x\r\n    for (int i = 1, j = x - 1; i &lt;= j; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        long long square_j, target = square_x - sq(i);\r\n\r\n        // Iterates, instead of calculating the square root\r\n        while ( (square_j = sq(j)) &gt; target )\r\n            --j;\r\n        if ( square_j == target )\r\n            return false;\r\n    }\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\n\r\nThe other problem (probably the most important, given the input data) lies in the function used to calculate the powers of 2.\r\n\r\n```C\r\nint powTwo(int exp) {\r\n    int x=2;                    // &lt;-- It should start from 1, here\r\n    for (;exp&gt;0;exp--) {\r\n        x*=2;\r\n    }\r\n    return (x);                 // &lt;-- Effectively returns 2^(exp + 1)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may consider this more general approach, instead.\r\n\r\n```C\r\nlong long int_pow(int base, int exp)\r\n{\r\n    long long result = 1;\r\n    while ( exp )\r\n    {\r\n        if (exp &amp; 1)\r\n            result *= base;\r\n        exp /= 2;\r\n        base *= base;\r\n    }\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOr, given that the base is 2, just use a bit shift \r\n\r\n    int R = b * b - (1 &lt;&lt; a);\r\n\r\nWith those modifications, your program should output the desired value.

analysis is correct. Without lifetime extension, all temporaries are destroyed at the end of the &quot;full expression&quot;, i.e. the `;` at the end of the line. So when you say\r\n\r\n    int retcode = A(NonMovable{}).GetValue().Value();\r\n\r\n(comments and `identity` calls removed for clarity) then everything is okay; the `NonMovable` object is still alive at the time you ask for its value.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when you say\r\n\r\n    auto&amp;&amp; a_obj = A(NonMovable{});\r\n\r\nthen the `NonMovable` is destroyed at the end of the line, and the `A` object will be holding a dangling reference. (As an aside, `auto&amp;&amp;` just lifetime-extends the temporary `A` here -- you may as well just use plain `auto`)\r\n\r\n&gt; My question is: Is it possible to disable the second kind of usage?\r\n\r\nNot really, at least as far as I know. You could add a deleted `A(NonMovable&amp;&amp;)` constructor, but this would also prevent &quot;correct&quot; usage as in the first example. The is exactly the same issue that occurs with `std::string_view` (and will occur with `std::span` in C++20) -- essentially, your `A` class has reference semantics, but is referring to a temporary which has been destroyed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166210/bullet-proofing-c-temporary-lifetimes/58168156#58168156","title":"Bullet-proofing C++ temporary lifetimes?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":328,"user_id":7091875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5553895fe341c842ebba11da4deef8f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikita Petrenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7091875/nikita-petrenko"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569848999,"creation_date":1569848999,"answer_id":58168605,"question_id":58166210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58168605","body_markdown":"So by using collective mind, in the comments under the question we&#39;ve managed to come up with the following implementation of `A`, which might be applicable to some use cases (but not `std::span` or `std::string_view` usage):\r\n```\r\nstruct Dummy;\r\n\r\ntemplate &lt;class T&gt;\r\nclass A {\r\npublic:\r\n    explicit A(const T&amp; value) : value_(value) {}\r\n\r\n    template &lt;class TDummy = Dummy&gt;\r\n    const T&amp; GetValue() const&amp; {\r\n        static_assert(!std::is_same_v&lt;TDummy, Dummy&gt;, \r\n        &quot;Stop and think, you&#39;re doing something wrong!&quot; \r\n        &quot;And in any case, don&#39;t use std::move on this class!&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const T&amp; GetValue() &amp;&amp; {\r\n        return value_;\r\n    }\r\nprivate:\r\n    const T&amp; value_;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if one tries to compile the following code, he will get a descriprive error message:\r\n```\r\nint main() {\r\n    auto&amp;&amp; a_obj = A(NonMovable{});\r\n    // will not compile:\r\n    int retcode = identity(\r\n        identity(a_obj.GetValue())).Value();\r\n    return retcode;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that `decltype((a_obj)) == A&lt;NonMovable&gt;&amp;`, so it binds to the method that produces a compile time error.\r\n\r\nIt satisfies my use cases, but, sadly, this is not a universal solution -- it depends on what one wants from `class A`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166210/bullet-proofing-c-temporary-lifetimes/58168605#58168605","title":"Bullet-proofing C++ temporary lifetimes?"}],"owner":{"reputation":328,"user_id":7091875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5553895fe341c842ebba11da4deef8f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikita Petrenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7091875/nikita-petrenko"},"last_editor":{"reputation":328,"user_id":7091875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5553895fe341c842ebba11da4deef8f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikita Petrenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7091875/nikita-petrenko"},"comment_count":21,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":166,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569849196,"creation_date":1569840036,"last_edit_date":1569849196,"question_id":58166210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58166210","body_markdown":"Revisiting lifetime extension in C++, I found out that there are some patterns that break &quot;decomposability&quot; of C++ expressions.

doubt)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58166210/bullet-proofing-c-temporary-lifetimes","title":"Bullet-proofing C++ temporary
