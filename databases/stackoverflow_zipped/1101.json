So I think is a delay problem with the promises, but Im using the await keyword before, but it doesnt do the &quot;await&quot; function.\r\n\r\n```\r\n async inscripcionAlert(clase) {\r\n    const alert = await this.alertController.create({\r\n      header: &#39;Atenci&#243;n&#39;,\r\n      message: &#39;Confirme para inscribirse a la clase&#39;,\r\n      buttons: [\r\n        {\r\n          text: &#39;Aceptar&#39;,\r\n          handler: async () =&gt; {\r\n            await this.inscripcionServicio.inscripcionAClase(clase, this.username);\r\n            setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n              this.obtenerListadoClases(this.categoria)\r\n            }, 2500);\r\n\r\n\r\n          }\r\n        }, {\r\n          text: &#39;Cancelar&#39;\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    });\r\n    await alert.present();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280405/await-is-not-waiting-for-function-to-complete","title":"await is not waiting for function to complete"},{"tags":["ajax","onmouseover","onmouseclick"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1349,"user_id":10295265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/stakh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sundeep Pidugu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10295265/sundeep-pidugu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570518345,"post_id":58280404,"comment_id":102928657,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280404/i-want-this-to-run-when-i-hover-my-mouse-on-button#comment102928657_58280404"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10549800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c7f13dbc92e275f4540cfc3c77525ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HARSH SINGH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549800/harsh-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2369,"user_id":3118401,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c066b73af214d8e7cf6b52f6ef75314a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marcolz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3118401/marcolz"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570518191,"creation_date":1570510633,"last_edit_date":1570518191,"question_id":58280404,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280404","body_markdown":"When I place my cursor over button, it should open `My_File.txt`, but it&#39;s doing nothing.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Demo&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onmouseover=&quot;showDoc()&quot;&gt;Show Content&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nfunction showDoc()\r\n{\r\n    var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n    xhttp.onreadystatechange = function ()\r\n    {\r\n        if (this.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tdocument.write(this.responseText);\r\n    \t}\r\n    };\r\n    xhttp.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;My_File.txt&quot;, true);\r\n    xhttp.send();\t\t\r\n}\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n    \t\t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280404/i-want-this-to-run-when-i-hover-my-mouse-on-button","title":"i want this to run when i hover my mouse on button"},{"tags":["terraform","terraform-provider-aws"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8962,"user_id":5343387,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15a14cec3014822297a08ed6dfae2563?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt Schuchard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5343387/matt-schuchard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570545120,"post_id":58280400,"comment_id":102941695,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280400/terraform-interpolation-syntax-error-for-data-template-file#comment102941695_58280400"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1331,"user_id":481816,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d64813aef50eccbe84a3278b2270d51?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dude0001","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/481816/dude0001"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1331,"user_id":481816,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d64813aef50eccbe84a3278b2270d51?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dude0001","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/481816/dude0001"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570518848,"last_edit_date":1570518848,"creation_date":1570518423,"answer_id":58281618,"question_id":58280400,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58281618","body_markdown":"Not exactly clear what your template file looks like or what you are trying to do, so here are a couple different answers.\r\n\r\n1.

The excel file could have data in one tab and chart in other. Using File viewer You could add this excel file on any SharePoint page. On one Page You could present the tab to change data (tasks), on other the tab that has the chart. I know..a bit of a workaround but this is one of the simplest solutions I thought of without coding :)\r\n 2. Power BI- this tool for sure may will fit any needs as in this tool You may do almost anything. Of Course You need Power BI server for this.

It depends on your design and goals.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, if the watchdog task is the lowest priority task then it will fail to run (and the watchdog will reset) if any higher priority task becomes stuck or consumes too much of the CPU time.  Consider that if the high priority task(s) is running 100% of the time then that&#39;s probably too much because lower priority tasks are getting starved.  And maybe you want the watchdog to reset if lower priority tasks are getting starved.\r\n\r\nBut that general idea isn&#39;t a complete design.  See [this answer][1], and especially the &quot;Multitasking&quot; section of this article ([https://www.embedded.com/watchdog-timers/][2]) for a more complete watchdog task design.  The article suggests making the watchdog task the highest priority task but discusses the trade-offs of the alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14780682/1401213\r\n  [2]: https://www.embedded.com/watchdog-timers/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280362/wdt-in-a-preemptive-rtos-kernel/58286427#58286427","title":"WDT in a preemptive RTOS kernel"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":64909,"user_id":168986,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqorX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clifford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/168986/clifford"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64909,"user_id":168986,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqorX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Clifford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/168986/clifford"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571678232,"last_edit_date":1571678232,"creation_date":1570540016,"answer_id":58286977,"question_id":58280362,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58286977","body_markdown":"&gt; fail to understand why though,what if high priority tasks keeps running and idle task doest run before timeout.\r\n\r\nWell, that is kind of the point.  If the lowest priority thread (or better, the idle thread) is starved, then your system will be missing deadlines, and is either poorly designed or some unexpected condition has occurred.\r\n\r\nIf it were reset at a high priority or interrupt, then all lower priority threads could be in a failed state, either running busy or never running at all, and the watchdog would be uselessly maintained while not providing any protection whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIt is nonetheless only a partial solution to system integrity monitoring.  It addresses the problem of an errant task hogging the CPU, but it does not deal with the issue of a task blocking and never being scheduled as intended.  There are any number of ways of dealing with that, but a simple approach is to have &quot;software watchdogs&quot;, counters that get reset by each task, and decremented in a high- priority timer thread or handler.  If any thread counter reaches zero, then the respective thread blocked for longer than intended, and action may be taken.  This requires that each thread runs at an interval shorter than its watchdog counter reset value.  For threads that otherwise block indefinitely waiting for infrequent aperiodic events, you might use a blocking timeout just to update the software watchdog.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280362/wdt-in-a-preemptive-rtos-kernel/58286977#58286977","title":"WDT in a preemptive RTOS kernel"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":11953066,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eef8bb6ee9ad7b88a5c8ad6ca37470d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ahmad Anwar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11953066/ahmad-anwar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571678232,"creation_date":1570510334,"question_id":58280362,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280362","body_markdown":"I heard that the best way to use a watch dog timer in a preemptive kernel is to assign it to the lowest task/idle task and refresh it there, I fail to understand why though,what if high priority tasks keeps running and idle task doest run before timeout.\r\n\r\nany clarifications?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280362/wdt-in-a-preemptive-rtos-kernel","title":"WDT in a preemptive RTOS kernel"},{"tags":["firebase","firebase-authentication","google-cloud-storage","firebase-security-rules","firebase-admin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570541714,"post_id":58280361,"comment_id":102939666,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280361/firebase-custom-claims-are-not-update-in-rules#comment102939666_58280361"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":10151066,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-U6ipMg1t8Xg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7ravdldI6Mrq5PKsrLhspUciGiKAQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"flutroid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10151066/flutroid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570519773,"post_id":58280525,"comment_id":102929267,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280361/firebase-custom-claims-are-not-update-in-rules/58280525#comment102929267_58280525"},{"owner":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570541564,"post_id":58280525,"comment_id":102939560,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280361/firebase-custom-claims-are-not-update-in-rules/58280525#comment102939560_58280525"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570511616,"creation_date":1570511616,"answer_id":58280525,"question_id":58280361,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58280525","body_markdown":"What you&#39;re seeing is the expected behavior.  Your backend code that updates the claims doesn&#39;t have the ability to force the client to see those claims immediately.  According to the [documentation][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; After new claims are modified on a user via the Admin SDK, they are\r\n&gt; propagated to an authenticated user on the client side via the ID\r\n&gt; token in the following ways:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - A user signs in or re-authenticates after the custom claims are modified. The ID token issued as a result will contain the latest\r\n&gt; claims.\r\n&gt; - An existing user session gets its ID token refreshed after an older token expires.\r\n&gt; - An ID token is force refreshed by calling currentUser.getIdToken(true).\r\n\r\nThe best you can do is write your client such that a change on the server triggers a change on the client to force a refresh of the ID token that will use the new claims.  But that doesn&#39;t necessarily stop the client from using the old token until it finally expires.\r\n\r\nIf you want to limit uploads, it will be more secure and reliable to use a Cloud Functions trigger on each Storage upload, check to see if the file should be allowed, and delete the file if it violates your rules.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#propagate_custom_claims_to_the_client","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280361/firebase-custom-claims-are-not-update-in-rules/58280525#58280525","title":"Firebase custom claims are not update in rules"}],"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":10151066,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-U6ipMg1t8Xg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7ravdldI6Mrq5PKsrLhspUciGiKAQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"flutroid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10151066/flutroid"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570541820,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570541580,"creation_date":1570510327,"last_edit_date":1570541580,"question_id":58280361,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280361","body_markdown":"I am trying to prevent storage abuse.My goal is like limit a user upload operation per day.So I deploy a storage onFinalize trigger and once a file uploladed the function detect a counter that using firestore is hit the limit or not.If is, store a millisec to CustomUserClaims like this:\r\n\r\n    //the user need to wait after this time to continue upload files (timeToUnlock = currentTime + additionalTime)\r\n    setCustomUserClaims(uid, {\r\n    \ttimeToUnlock: 1570509112055\r\n    })\r\n\r\nAnd compare in rules\r\n\r\n    allow create: if request.time.toMillis() &gt;= request.auth.token.timeToUnlock;\r\n\r\nBut every time when setCustomUserClaims i need to logout and login client again to update claims or claims won&#39;t update it just keeping previous value.I print customClaims to console the parameter are updated but seems parameter in rules are not updated.Anyone have better idea to fix this?

If you are developing a website for customers you might need to deploy a staging version for test/validation purposes. \r\n\r\nI know that gatsby/react internally have some different processing based on the environment, but I was wondering if it&#39;s possible to build and deploy a gatsby website for development/stage purposes using development variables configuration. \r\n\r\n**An example:** I was using two plugins - gatsby-google-tag-manager and gatsby-plugin-facebook-pixel and realized that both configurations relies on NODE_ENV development or production and I currently can not build and deploy a website using development environment.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on that?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280325/gatsby-build-website-for-stage-development-which-command-should-i-use","title":"Gatsby - Build website for stage/development - which command should I use?"},{"tags":["visual-studio"],"owner":{"reputation":1614,"user_id":2077676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRFyJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jamaxack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2077676/jamaxack"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43690,"user_id":209259,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bSPBw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erik Philips","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209259/erik-philips"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570510659,"creation_date":1570509929,"last_edit_date":1570510659,"question_id":58280324,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280324","body_markdown":"Every time when I open `Team Explorer - Changes` the `Stashes` section is opened and I&#39;m not able to see all changed files, so I have to collapse the `Stashes` section.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to set the `Stashes` section **collapsed** by **default**?\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2019 version: 16.3.0\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/96W2P.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280324/collapse-stashes-by-default-in-team-explorer-changes","title":"Collapse Stashes by default in Team Explorer - Changes"},{"tags":["python","django"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5071,"user_id":6615163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hSNqz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"hygull","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6615163/hygull"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570510267,"post_id":58280322,"comment_id":102926390,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280322/dictionary-key-and-string-comparison-in-python#comment102926390_58280322"},{"owner":{"reputation":5071,"user_id":6615163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hSNqz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"hygull","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6615163/hygull"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570510622,"post_id":58280322,"comment_id":102926458,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280322/dictionary-key-and-string-comparison-in-python#comment102926458_58280322"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5071,"user_id":6615163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hSNqz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"hygull","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6615163/hygull"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570510599,"post_id":58280351,"comment_id":102926453,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280322/dictionary-key-and-string-comparison-in-python/58280351#comment102926453_58280351"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2867,"user_id":5099803,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6d1bce3247722e1ae71f2090a342bc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dipen Dadhaniya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5099803/dipen-dadhaniya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2867,"user_id":5099803,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6d1bce3247722e1ae71f2090a342bc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dipen Dadhaniya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5099803/dipen-dadhaniya"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570510727,"last_edit_date":1570510727,"creation_date":1570510202,"answer_id":58280351,"question_id":58280322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58280351","body_markdown":"Change:\r\n\r\n    key=str(key +&#39;-101,&#39;)    # Remove the comma at the end, otherwise key will be &#39;eng-101,&#39;

the template you can access the entire contextual data object, using `#data`.\r\n\r\n(See [Paths and expressions](https://www.jsviews.com/#paths))\r\n\r\nIn a helper function, the `this` object is generally the current `view` object, so you can get the data object as [`this.data`](https://www.jsviews.com/#viewobject@data).\r\n\r\nHere is an example that shows both the above methods:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script id=&quot;myTmpl&quot; type=&quot;text/x-jsrender&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t{{include tmpl=~getTmpl(#data)/}}\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;page&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n

\t$(&quot;#page&quot;).html(html);\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nIncidentally, you can write your example with `{{if}}` tags like this\r\n\r\n    &quot;{{if type === 1 tmpl=&#39;form_field_input_text&#39;}}&quot; +\r\n    &quot;{{else type === 2 tmpl=&#39;form_field_input_select&#39;}}&quot; +\r\n    &quot;{{else type === 3

I have not compiled a JSP page, but I know it is just HTML with some script.  What I can help you with, is just giving you a small heads up that the word &quot;attribute&quot; when used with/about HTML refers to the &quot;assignment-looking-like&quot; things that are inside of an HTML element.  For instance, you are using an HTML &#39;form&#39; element.\r\n\r\nAccording to w3schools.com, which I refer to at least once a day when I&#39;m coding, the HTML form element is allowed the following attributes...  ***The text inside the next &quot;Comment Block&quot; has been word-for-word copied from the following link***: [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; **The Action Attribute** The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.  Normally, the form data is sent\r\n&gt; to a web page on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.\r\n&gt; In the example above, the form data is sent to a page on the server\r\n&gt; called &quot;/action_page.php&quot;. This page contains a server-side script\r\n&gt; that handles the form data:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     &lt;form action=&quot;/action_page.php&quot;&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current\r\n&gt; page.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **The Target Attribute** The target attribute specifies if the submitted result will open in a new browser tab, a frame, or in the\r\n&gt; current window.  The default value is &quot;_self&quot; which means the form\r\n&gt; will be submitted in the current window.  To make the form result open\r\n&gt; in a new browser tab, use the value &quot;_blank&quot;... Example:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     &lt;form action=&quot;/action_page.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Other legal values are &quot;_parent&quot;, &quot;_top&quot;, or a name representing the\r\n&gt; name of an iframe.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **The Method Attribute** The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the form data:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; `&lt;form action=&quot;/action_page.php&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;`&gt;\r\n&gt; **or**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     &lt;form action=&quot;/action_page.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;   [1]: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Point being: ***HTML Form&#39;s may not have*** the &quot;modelAttribute=&#39;user&#39;&quot; line that you have added...\r\n\r\n    &lt;form:form  method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/user-web/processuserregistration.do&quot; modelAttribute=&quot;user&quot; &gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Oracle Documentation, a TLD is the Tag Library Descriptor - and it is used in JSP programming.

Whether you spawn a thread or call an asynchronous function, you do it from this method. Upon starting the operation, your `start()` method should also update the execution state of the operation as reported by the `isExecuting` property. You do this by sending out KVO notifications for the `isExecuting` key path, which lets interested clients know that the operation is now running. Your `isExecuting` property must also provide the status in a thread-safe manner.\r\n\r\n&gt; Upon completion or cancellation of its task, your concurrent operation object must generate KVO notifications for both the `isExecuting` and `isFinished` key paths to mark the final change of state for your operation. (In the case of cancellation, it is still important to update the `isFinished` key path, even if the operation did not completely finish its task. Queued operations must report that they are finished before they can be removed from a queue.) In addition to generating KVO notifications, your overrides of the `isExecuting` and `isFinished` properties should also continue to report accurate values based on the state of your operation.\r\n\r\nNow all of that sounds quite hairy, but it’s actually not that bad. One way is to write a base operation class that takes care of all of this KVO stuff, and [this this answer outlines one example implementation][2].\r\n\r\nThen you can subclass `AsynchronousOperation` instead, and make sure to call `finish` (or whatever triggers the `isFinished` KVO) when the task is done:\r\n\r\n    class UserRegistrationOperation: AsynchronousOperation {\r\n        var registrationRecord: RegistrationRecord\r\n    \r\n        init(registrationRecord: RegistrationRecord) {\r\n            self.registrationRecord = registrationRecord\r\n            super.init()                                // whenever you subclass, remember to call `super`\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        override func main() {    \r\n            self.registrationRecord.state = .pending\r\n\r\n            //Firebase invocation to create a user in Firebase Auth\r\n\r\n            Auth.auth().createUser(withEmail: registrationRecord.user.userEmail, password: registrationRecord.encryptedData) { [weak self] result, error in\r\n                defer { self?.finish() }                // make sure to call `finish` regardless of how we leave this closure\r\n\r\n                guard let result = result, error == nil else {\r\n                    print(&quot;Error occured while user registration process&quot;)\r\n                    self?.registrationRecord.state = .failed    \r\n                    return\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                self?.registrationRecord.user.uid = result.user.uid\r\n                self?.registrationRecord.state = .processed\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere are lots of ways to implement that `AsynchronousOperation` class and [this][2] is just one example. But once you have a class that nicely encapsulates the concurrent operation KVO, you can subclass it and you can write your own concurrent operations with very little changes to your code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operation\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48104095/1271826","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280273/completion-block-is-getting-triggered-even-before-my-operation-completes-in-main/58280562#58280562","title":"Completion block is getting triggered even before my operation completes in main method"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":2736952,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e03301a74055b8c70dc0b584492d8dfa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ajay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2736952/ajay"},"last_editor":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58280562,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570512209,"creation_date":1570509510,"last_edit_date":1570509702,"question_id":58280273,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280273","body_markdown":"I am trying to create user in firebase using OperationQueue and Operation.

The compiler command can either take compile units or a flat file that has the compile units &#39;in order&#39;. For the latter case, I&#39;d like to write a rule that will spit out a file that has the dependencies in the right order.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume a simple makefile below:\r\n```make\r\na.output:\r\n  &lt;a.files&gt;\r\n\r\nb.output: a.output\r\n  &lt;b.files&gt;\r\n\r\nc.output: d.output\r\n  &lt;c.files&gt;\r\n\r\nd.output: d.input\r\n  &lt;d.files&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;d like is a file that contains:\r\n```\r\na.files\r\nb.files\r\nd.files\r\nc.files\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn idea I had was to have a variable in the recipe that can be appended to, like\r\n```make\r\na.output: \r\n  MY_FILES += &lt;a.files&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I don&#39;t think that will work in a recipe context. Does anyone have a decent solution to this problem?\r\n\r\nAlso, I&#39;d like the Makefile to be parallel but obviously it won&#39;t work for this target. How can I specify disabling parallel execution for this specific target or set of targets?\r\n\r\n**EDIT Oct 8 2019**\r\n\r\nTo make it simpler for a person not familiar with Make syntax to write dependencies, I&#39;ve basically let them write out their intent using variables:\r\n```\r\nMODULES += module_a\r\nmodule_a.prerequisites = module_b module c\r\nmodule_a.other_var = some_string_a\r\n\r\nMODULES += module_b\r\nmodule_b.prerequisites = \r\nmodule_b.other_var = some_string_b\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then use a `define` directive to generate the rules necessary for compilation (I was inspired by [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38512489/how-to-write-a-makefile-where-the-compiled-object-files-are-in-a-different-direc)). This means I do have flexibility on what I can create. So, in the previous example, `&lt;a.output&gt;` is actually the target for module_a. This can be a `PHONY` target. `&lt;a.files&gt;` actually represents the variables (`prerequisites` and `other_var` in the example).\r\n\r\nI&#39;m sorry for the miscommunication but what I&#39;m trying to do is write out all the target and dependent `module_x.other_var` in the right order for a given module. I hope that makes it clear. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m currently concatenating a file in the right order which is one of the solutions mentioned below. I was wondering if there&#39;s some other Make magic that I could apply.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280264/writing-out-dependencies-into-a-file-using-make","title":"Writing out dependencies into a file using Make"},{"tags":["react-native","admob"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1175,"user_id":7364894,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d_ZmFNv8bZE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUc/GEFzMOw4u7Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Thakur Karthik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7364894/thakur-karthik"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570513533,"creation_date":1570513533,"answer_id":58280758,"question_id":58280261,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58280758","body_markdown":"It can be done as conditional rendering as follows:\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n     return(\r\n      &lt;View&gt;\r\n        ....\r\n        {!this.state.hasAd &amp;&amp; &lt;showAd/&gt;}\r\n        ....\r\n      &lt;/View&gt;\r\n     )\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280261/how-to-show-admob-ad-block-if-admob-ad-is-empty/58280758#58280758","title":"How to Show Admob ad block if Admob ad is empty?"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":10529782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_AzYAmKGwlM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbA8Jg1fZ-EhA44E2yFiv8omOPTq3w/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rapprogtrain site","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10529782/rapprogtrain-site"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1051,"user_id":10214713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30d986174a6e05955dc870ef323d8547?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alireza Bideli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10214713/alireza-bideli"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570527310,"creation_date":1570509400,"last_edit_date":1570527310,"question_id":58280261,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280261","body_markdown":"I want to make a function which will check if **Admob ad** is empty  show another **Admob ad block**.\r\nHow can I do it ?\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\n//...\r\nclass MediumAdmobAd extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;View&gt;\r\n        {\r\n          !this.state.hasAd ?

test collection has these fields\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;block_number&quot;: 123123,\r\n    &quot;value&quot;: 555.55555\r\n    &quot;transfers&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n

indexes like this (at python code)\r\n```python\r\ntx_collection.create_index(&quot;block_number&quot;)\r\ntx_collection.create_index(&quot;transfers.amount&quot;)\r\ntx_collection.create_index(&quot;value&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Why two similar queries show different speed?\r\n\r\ntwo queries are\r\n\r\n1. `tx_collection.find({&#39;block_number&#39;: {&#39;$gte&#39;: 3243145}}, {&#39;_id&#39;: 0}).sort(&#39;transfers.amount&#39;, -1).limit(100)`\r\n2. `tx_collection.find({&#39;block_number&#39;: {&#39;$gte&#39;: 3243145}}, {&#39;_id&#39;: 0}).sort(&#39;value&#39;, -1).limit(100)`\r\n\r\nAnd execution time test python code is like this\r\n```\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n\r\n    txs = tx_collection.find({&#39;block_number&#39;: {&#39;$gte&#39;: 3243145}}, {&#39;_id&#39;:

-1).limit(100)\r\n\r\n    for tx in txs:\r\n        print(tx)\r\n\r\n    done = time.time()\r\n    print(done - start)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## execution time\r\n- 1st query : about 0.1 sec\r\n- 2nd query : about 10 sec\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are they too different?\r\n\r\nJFYI. the mongdb has 5 sharded and I run this query onto mongos using python code.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Additional test.\r\n\r\nWhen I test below query on mongodb client,\r\n```\r\ndb.getCollection(&#39;transaction&#39;).find({}).sort({&quot;transfers.amount&quot;:1})\r\n```\r\n\r\nit throws error message like\r\n```\r\n&quot;Executor error during find command: OperationFailed: Sort operation used more than the maximum 33554432 bytes of RAM. Add an index, or specify a smaller limit.&quot;,\r\n```\r\n\r\n### It seems like index on `transfers.amount` seems like not working\r\n\r\nWhen I checked with `db.getCollection(&#39;transaction&#39;).getIndexes()`, I confirmed that index on `transfers.amount` itself has been set well, like\r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;v&quot; : 2,\r\n        &quot;key&quot; : {\r\n            &quot;transfers.amount&quot; : 1.0\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;name&quot; : &quot;transfers.amount_1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;ns&quot; : &quot;crossangle.transaction&quot;\r\n    }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280229/why-mongodb-speed-of-sort-by-subdocument-field-so-slow","title":"why mongodb speed of sort by subdocument field so slow?"},{"tags":["python","deep-learning"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":110,"user_id":10701465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f376d22e0c45ab44f64f44c5d4f93c4d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaybeNextTime","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10701465/maybenexttime"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570509572,"post_id":58280223,"comment_id":102926280,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280223/how-can-we-perform-that-testing-in-deep-neural-network#comment102926280_58280223"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":10773854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"New_student","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10773854/new-student"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570509174,"creation_date":1570509174,"question_id":58280223,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280223","body_markdown":"I&#39;m newbie in Neural Networks, I&#39;m trying to understand it step by step and understanding such codes online. \r\n\r\nI have faced these two lines which are used for testing !!  \r\n\r\n    mean_error = tf.reduce_mean(abs(y_pred - batch_y))  # mean_error.eval({X:batch_x}),\r\n                                mean_error_rate = 1 - tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_mean(tf.to_float(tf.equal(tf.sign(y_pred - 0.5), tf.cast(tf.sign(batch_y - 0.5), tf.float32))),1))\r\n\r\nCould anyone explain what does mean these commands ? do they make testing for such inputs ?? \r\n\r\nthank you.

App registrations &gt; My App &gt; Authentication\r\n- Redirect URIs &gt; added URIs for local and production\r\n- Implicit Grant &gt; checked Access tokens and ID tokens\r\n- Supported account types &gt; I have tried this with all 3 settings, currently set to &quot;Accounts in any organizational directory&quot;\r\n2. Certificates &amp; secrets &gt; none\r\n3. API permissions &gt; this initially was only set to defalt &quot;User.Read&quot;.

think the issue is that you are trying to import a class from an unnamed package (any of the classes within the ```Kitchen.jar```) from a class within a named package (```Kitchen.App```).\r\n\r\nJava does not allow the importing of classes from the default (unnamed) package into named packages - this is what is causing the compile time error you are seeing:\r\n\r\nFrom the [Java Language Specification 7.5.1][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; The type must be either a member of a named package, or a member of a\r\n&gt; type whose outermost lexically enclosing type declaration (&#167;8.1.3) is\r\n&gt; a member of a named package, or a compile-time error occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue you can either:\r\n\r\n 1. Ensure that the code shipped in the Kitchen.jar belongs to a named package. If the JAR only contains compiled class files and you don&#39;t have access to the source code then this isn&#39;t an option. If you do have access to the source code and can rebuild this JAR, then you need to put in place a package structure so that the classes are not all sitting in the root of the JAR, e.g:\r\n\r\n    home/util/AbstractFood.java\r\n     \r\n    home/util/Food.java\r\n    \r\n    home/util/Fries.java\r\n    \r\n    home/util/Kitchen.java\r\n    \r\n    home/util/Oven.java\r\n    \r\n    home/util/Potato.java\r\n\r\nwith ```package home.util;``` at the top of each of the files. \r\n\r\nYou should then rebuild the jar and import the classes in your ```App.java``` and ```Oven.java``` using ```import home.util.Kitchen;```, ```import home.util.Oven;``` ,etc.\r\n\r\n 2. Move the code in your named package (```Kitchen```) into the default (unnamed) package. This is not a good idea - we should not be writing code in the default package, but if you can&#39;t execute option 1, this is your only option. What this means is moving your java code (```App.java, Oven.java```) to reside directly in the ```src/main/java``` directory, and also removing any ```package Kitchen``` declaration from the top of these files. You will also need to set ```mainClassName = &#39;App&#39;```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-7.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280194/cant-import-jar-file-dependency-using-gradle-and-intellij/58281059#58281059","title":"Can&#39;t import jar file dependency using Gradle and Intellij"}],"owner":{"reputation":1641,"user_id":7489488,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d045abb9b1a093eef729729702d11cea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user8888","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7489488/user8888"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1641,"user_id":7489488,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d045abb9b1a093eef729729702d11cea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user8888","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7489488/user8888"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58281059,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570602417,"creation_date":1570508873,"last_edit_date":1570525221,"question_id":58280194,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58280194","body_markdown":"Below is my project directory.
