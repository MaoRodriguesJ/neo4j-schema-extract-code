I know that filter expression can be used, but I was wondering if there was a way to design the sort key so that filter is not needed as it is more costly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440597/multiple-comparison-conditions-on-sort-key-for-dynamodb","title":"Multiple Comparison Conditions on Sort Key for DynamoDB?"},{"tags":["gnuradio","gnuradio-companion"],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":8844897,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4B75QR6tG2o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAATaM/F4xQD2Wgt3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"nicholas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8844897/nicholas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571345585,"creation_date":1571345585,"question_id":58440596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440596","body_markdown":"I am running GNU Radio 3.7.13.4 and working in GNU Radio Companion on Ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\nI have a very simple flowgraph where I have a source of type complex (I&#39;ve tried both a signal source and a constant source) which I connect to a transcendental block (of type complex) and then output to a sink of type complex (I don&#39;t think anything after the transcendental block matters).\r\n\r\nI have tried the transcendental block with functions &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;cos&quot; and &quot;exp&quot;.

If so, what is the proper way to do so?**\r\n\r\n## My Attempt ##\r\n\r\nI have read the `reselect` docs section, &quot;Customize equalityCheck for defaultMemoize,&quot; and have read through a number of posts where an attempt at memoizing *arrays* using `reselect` are made. Based on this knowledge, I have attempted to do the following, but to no success:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport _ from &#39;lodash&#39;;\r\nimport { createSelector, createSelectorCreator, defaultMemoize } from &#39;reselect&#39;\r\n\r\nconst createDeepEqualSelector = createSelectorCreator(\r\n  defaultMemoize,\r\n  _.isEqual,\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst getLargeObject = createDeepEqualSelector(\r\n  (state) =&gt; {\r\n    // Get the individual values from state\r\n    const {\r\n      val1, val2, val3, val4, val5, val6, val7, val8, val9, val10\r\n    } = state;\r\n\r\n    // Create a convenient object that contains all of those values to pass down to props\r\n    const constructedObject = {\r\n      val1, val2, val3, val4, val5, val6, val7, val8, val9, val10\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return constructedObject;\r\n  },\r\n  constructedObject =&gt; constructedObject,\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) =&gt; {\r\n  const objProp = getLargeObject(state);\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    objProp,\r\n    // ... other props\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The (Unfortunate) Alternative ##\r\n\r\nIf I do not do things way, I end up with 8+ individual selectors, with a large `createSelector` call. This seems more redundant than necessary, and makes me wonder if there is a better way to do this. As a demonstration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst getVal1 = (state) =&gt; state.val1;\r\nconst getVal2 = (state) =&gt; state.val2;\r\n...\r\n\r\nconst getLargeObject = createSelector(\r\n  [\r\n    getVal1,\r\n    getVal2,\r\n    ...\r\n  ],\r\n  (\r\n    val1,\r\n    val2,\r\n    ...\r\n  ) =&gt; {\r\n    const largeObject = {\r\n      val1,\r\n      val2,\r\n      ...\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return largeObject;\r\n  },\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for your any help you can give!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440588/how-to-memoize-deep-compare-redux-objects-using-reselect-with-createselectorcr","title":"How to Memoize (Deep Compare) Redux Objects Using Reselect with createSelectorCreator()?"},{"tags":["mysql","join"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571346054,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103220990,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103220990_58440586"},{"owner":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571346119,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103221016,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103221016_58440586"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571346266,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103221063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103221063_58440586"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571346338,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103221091,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103221091_58440586"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571346612,"creation_date":1571346612,"answer_id":58440769,"question_id":58440586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58440769","body_markdown":"You need to pivot the meta table.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT c.*,\r\n    MAX(IF(contact_meta_key = &#39;Newsletter&#39;, contact_meta_value, NULL)) AS newsletter,\r\n    MAX(IF(contact_meta_key = &#39;Level&#39;, contact_meta_value, NULL)) AS level\r\nFROM contact AS c\r\nLEFT JOIN contact_meta AS cm ON c.id = cm.id_contact\r\nGROUP BY c.id\r\n```\r\n[DEMO][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/rQpeqK4JmvVda46QC6CHjc/1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows/58440769#58440769","title":"Join 2 tables with different number of rows"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5608705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3897ba10766a80b38d743661c3c352f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5608705/nick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5608705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3897ba10766a80b38d743661c3c352f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5608705/nick"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571350320,"last_edit_date":1571350320,"creation_date":1571349889,"answer_id":58441314,"question_id":58440586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58441314","body_markdown":"The thing is today John has 2 entries in contact_meta but tomorrow it can be 5 and Laura 9, I store many datas in it.

If successful, then I want the screen to change to the home screen. If it fails, then display the message in a `Toast`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what some of my actions look like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function getTokenAPI(username, password) {\r\n  return async function action(dispatch) {\r\n    try {\r\n      dispatch({ type: t.AUTH_GET_TOKEN });\r\n      dispatch(setLoading(true));\r\n\r\n      const { data } = await API.authGetToken(username, password);\r\n      const { success } = data;\r\n\r\n\r\n      if (success) {\r\n        const { access_token, refresh_token } = data;\r\n\r\n        dispatch(setAccessToken(access_token));\r\n\r\n        dispatch(setRefreshToken(refresh_token));\r\n\r\n        await dispatch(setLoading(false));\r\n      } else if (!success) {\r\n        const { errorMessage } = data;\r\n        throw Error(errorMessage);\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (e) {\r\n      dispatch(setError(e.message));\r\n      dispatch(setLoading(false));\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `setError` action sets the `error` key to `true` and sets the `errorMessage`. Here&#39;s what my screen looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { Container, View, Toast } from &#39;native-base&#39;;\r\nimport styles from &#39;./styles&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\nimport { authActions } from &#39;_ducks/auth&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst LoginScreen = props =&gt; {\r\n  const { getToken, navigation } = props;\r\n  const { navigate } = navigation;\r\n\r\n  const navigateToHome = () =&gt; navigate(&#39;Home&#39;);\r\n\r\n  const handleLogin = async () =&gt; {\r\n    const { error, errorMessage } = props;\r\n    await getToken(&#39;sample&#39;, &#39;pass123&#39;);\r\n    if (error) {\r\n      Toast.show({\r\n        text: errorMessage,\r\n        buttonText: &#39;kay&#39;,\r\n      });\r\n    } else {\r\n      navigateToHome();\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Container&gt;\r\n      &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\r\n        &lt;LoginButton onPress={handleLogin} /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/View&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Container&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =&gt; ({\r\n  getToken: () =&gt; dispatch(authActions.getTokenAPI()),\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = state =&gt; ({\r\n  isLoading: state.authReducer.isLoading,\r\n  error: state.authReducer.error,\r\n  errorMessage: state.authReducer.errorMessage,\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default connect(\r\n  mapStateToProps,\r\n  mapDispatchToProps,\r\n)(LoginScreen);\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if there&#39;s an error, then display the toast. If it&#39;s successful, navigate to the home screen. Essentially, `error` will not be `true` quick enough to make the check within `handleLogin` work appropriately.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations on the pattern or process?

The transfer of both needs to be as **efficient** as possible (if that would not be a concern, why using OpenCL, right?).  \r\nI read that OpenCV uses OpenCL internally (`UMat`), and that I could access the `GPU` buffer by accessing `UMat::handle`. However, my attempts for this have been unsuccessful up to now.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to reuse `UMat` buffer as the input for the OpenCL `kernels`, and eventually, produce a result as an image back to another `UMat` for displaying it.\r\n\r\nThe OpenCV framework is only intended to produce an input for the program, in consequence, I am not interested in using OpenCV CL wrapper (`cv::ocl`) but rather use normal OpenCL (`cl::...`). This avoid having the OpenCV framework included/linked in the full software.\r\n\r\n**The question:**\r\n\r\nHow to access OpenCV UMat buffer through OpenCL? \r\n \r\n - Use the UMat buffer as an OpenCL buffer (first option)\r\n - Move UMat buffer to OpenCL buffer within the GPU. (second option)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I have achieved yet:\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n - OpenCL work perfectly standalone\r\n - OpenCV work perfectly standalone\r\n - Converting the UMat::handle to a cl::Buffer compile\r\n - The given buffer doesn&#39;t seem to be valid.\r\n\r\n&gt;

A basic example of what such a table would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n----------------------\r\n| id | name    | age |\r\n----------------------\r\n| 1  | John    | 23  |\r\n| 2  | Mitch   | 15  |\r\n| 3  | Joe     | 33  |\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn reality, Django uses a special user model for this. By default Django has a specific model it uses. More on that [here][1]. Given that you&#39;ve already implemented authentication, you should be well on your way with this. Now, to track the scores of users you could create another model in your app called something like &#39;Score&#39; that may look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\n\r\nclass Score(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(\r\n        get_user_model(),\r\n        on_delete=models.CASCADE,\r\n        related_name=&#39;scores&#39;,\r\n    )\r\n    tries = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()\r\n    successful_tries = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomething along those lines. At this point, pay no mind to the &#39;get_user_model()&#39; method call. This is a new model that tracks scores of users. You can create one by doing `Score.objects.create(user=request.user, tries=10, successful_tries=5)`. Every training session you have you can create a new &#39;Score&#39; object that tracks how many tries you had, and how many were successful tries. You can access all of them using `request.user.scores.all()` (that&#39;s what related_name does). This way, one user can have 0 to infinite &#39;Score&#39; objects they are related to. Each user residing in the users table of your database, and each score residing in the scores table of the database.\r\n\r\nIf this is a little confusing, check out [this blogpost][2] on the topic.

I need help understanding how to reassign my original constant variable to the new prefix they are requesting.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar PREFIX = &#39;=&#39;;\r\n\r\nbot.on(&#39;message&#39;, message=&gt;{\r\n    let args = message.content.substring(PREFIX.length).split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n\r\n    switch(args[0]){\r\n        case &#39;setup&#39;:\r\n            const embed = new Discord.RichEmbed()\r\n            .setTitle(&#39;Step 1 of 1&#39;)\r\n            .setDescription(&#39;Set your Prefix&#39;)\r\n            .setColor(0xF1C40F)\r\n            message.channel.sendEmbed(embed);\r\n            //I want the user to now enter their own PREFIX and have the\r\n            //bot save their responce as the new PREFIX\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I want to happen is when the user types their desired `prefix`, the bot will reassign `prefix` in the code, and delete the bots question and the users response and begin to prompt them with the next question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440490/i-need-help-reassigning-a-variable-in-a-bot-menu","title":"I need help reassigning a variable in a bot menu"},{"tags":["angular","amazon-web-services","graphql","prisma-graphql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":2312335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7i9Df.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mat&#237;as Magni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2312335/mat%c3%adas-magni"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571849118,"post_id":58440486,"comment_id":103379385,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440486/so-prisma-api-server-running-on-aws-ecs-network-error-http-failure-response-fo#comment103379385_58440486"}],"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":2312335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7i9Df.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mat&#237;as Magni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2312335/mat%c3%adas-magni"},"last_editor":{"reputation":54,"user_id":2312335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7i9Df.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mat&#237;as Magni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2312335/mat%c3%adas-magni"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571373228,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571849132,"creation_date":1571345063,"last_edit_date":1571849132,"question_id":58440486,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440486","body_markdown":"I have an API GraphQL server running on AWS ECS and when my app in Angular tries to make a GraphQL query it throws this error on console:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncore.js:6014 ERROR Error: Network error: Http failure response for https://api.masvino.tv: 0 Unknown Error\r\n    at new ApolloError (bundle.esm.js:63)\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1247\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1559\r\n    at Set.forEach (&lt;anonymous&gt;)\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1557\r\n    at Map.forEach (&lt;anonymous&gt;)\r\n    at QueryManager.push../node_modules/apollo-client/bundle.esm.js.QueryManager.broadcastQueries (bundle.esm.js:1555)\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1161\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone-evergreen.js:359)\r\n    at Object.onInvoke (core.js:39698)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis Prisma server connects to a MySQL database running on AWS RDS.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know why this doesn&#39;t happen when my Angular app is running on localhost.

The new schema might look like this:\r\n\r\n    Firestore-root\r\n       |\r\n       --- users\r\n            |\r\n            --- uid\r\n                 |\r\n                 --- email: &quot;name@email.com&quot;\r\n                 |\r\n                 --- id: &quot;userId&quot;\r\n                 |\r\n                 --- friendIds: [&quot;friendIdOne&quot;, &quot;friendIdTwo&quot;, &quot;friendIdThree&quot;]\r\n\r\nThis will work perfectly fine **only** if the size of the document it will not reach the limit. So there are some limits when it comes to how much data you can put into a document. According to the official documentation regarding [usage and limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas):\r\n\r\n&gt; Maximum size for a document: 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, you are limited to 1 MiB total of data in a single document. When we are talking about storing text, you can store pretty much.\r\n\r\nIf you think that the size of the document might get over that limit, then your solution of storing firends as documents in a separate collection will solve your problem.\r\n\r\n&gt; And to add this in the other user document id user (targetedUser) --&gt; bidirectional.\r\n\r\nTo have a bidirectional relationship, in the solution above, you should simply copy the `friendId` in user&#39;s `friendIds` array and `userId` in friend&#39;s `friendIds` array.\r\n\r\n&gt; When some one user delete the other user, we have to delete the id in friendsRelationship collection from currentUser and targetedUser.\r\n\r\nIn the solution above, you should delete the userId from `friendIds` array and the `friendId` from user&#39;s `friendIds` array.\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;d rather do users &gt; id &gt; images (collection) &gt; url, date (fields)... or images &gt; id (generated) &gt; fromUser (id), toUserId (collection) &gt; id ?\r\n\r\nYou can also use in this case an array for storing image references. Again, if you think that the size of the document might get over that limit, the solution of storing images as documents in a separate collection is the solution to go ahead with.\r\n\r\n&gt; How to query all images that current User has received ? Like db.collection(&quot;users&quot;).document(currentUser.uid) ...\r\n\r\nYes, by getting a reference to user document:\r\n\r\n    db.collection(&quot;users&quot;).document(currentUser.uid)\r\n\r\nAnd then reading the `images` array.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440472/firebase-database-architecture-snapchat-like/58482900#58482900","title":"Firebase Database Architecture - Snapchat like"}],"owner":{"reputation":608,"user_id":3723046,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3qgau.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vjardel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3723046/vjardel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571648218,"creation_date":1571344991,"last_edit_date":1571648218,"question_id":58440472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440472","body_markdown":"I want to create an app with Firebase.\r\n\r\nI have two main targets for this app:\r\n\r\n 1.

When you provide a `sort` clause on a query, it is the `mongod` that is actually performing the sort, not the driver or the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\nFor sorting, there are 2 things that can happen, depending on the indexes available:\r\n\r\n1. Sort using the index\r\n2. Sort without an index\r\n\r\nA good rule of thumb is, if you want to sort on a field, the index created for that query needs to _end_ with that field.\r\n\r\nSo if you are querying on _just_ the `timestamp` field, then you only need an index of `timestamp: -1` or `timestamp: 1`. The index can be used for queries with either sort direction.\r\n\r\nIf you are querying on multiple fields, then you want the index to end with `timestamp`. So for the example you provided, you might want an index like `{ user_id: 1, action_id: 1, timestamp: -1 }`, which would support that exact query.\r\n\r\nIf an index does not exist that can be used for sorting, it will happen in memory. However, there is a limitation on in-memory sorts, to prevent degradation of service. As of writing this, [it is 32 MB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/#restrictions). If the sort operation requires more than that, you need to create an index.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440470/when-using-the-mongo-c-driver-does-query-sorting-occur-within-mongo-or-at-the/58440752#58440752","title":"When using the Mongo C# driver, does query sorting occur within Mongo, or at the C# level?"}],"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":11506637,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rGup7JCP9yU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcY0OrC33toPO8YZsltL1UJLQU5Jyg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Extranomical","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11506637/extranomical"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58440715,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571346775,"creation_date":1571344988,"question_id":58440470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440470","body_markdown":"Suppose you want to retrieve a bunch of documents that have a timestamp field from a Mongo database using the C# driver, and you want them sorted by timestamp in decreasing order (-1).\r\n\r\nWhen creating an index, do you need to include the timestamp field in the -1 order, for the queries that sort this way?

In the code above Json.NET actually performs the evaluation during serialization, inside the call to `JsonConvert.SerializeObject`.\r\n\r\n - I wasn&#39;t sure whether the `id` columns were 32-bit or 64-bit integers, so I assumed the larger, for safety.\r\n\r\n - The code assumes none of the record values are [null](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.idatarecord.isdbnull?view=netframework-4.8#System_Data_IDataRecord_IsDBNull_System_Int32_).\r\n\r\n\r\nDemo fiddle [here](https://dotnetfiddle.net/tWxVGF) that mocks up the above using a `DataTable` and `DataTableReader`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440439/creating-nested-json-with-data-from-sqldatareader/58441719#58441719","title":"Creating nested JSON with data from SQLDataReader"}],"owner":{"reputation":566,"user_id":202345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/khWqP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KalC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/202345/kalc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":61649,"user_id":3744182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ab1dca8193d1b5734ba07702e963b6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dbc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3744182/dbc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58441719,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571363915,"creation_date":1571344840,"last_edit_date":1571353285,"question_id":58440439,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440439","body_markdown":"I am new to .NET and trying to achieve what [shape-json][1] does in the Node world.\r\n\r\n**Copied from the shape-json npm page:**\r\n\r\nGiven the following array of objects:\r\n\r\n    var input = [\r\n      {pid: 1, contributor: &#39;jdalton&#39;, projectID: 1, projectName: &#39;lodash&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 1, contributor: &#39;jdalton&#39;, projectID: 2, projectName: &#39;docdown&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 1, contributor: &#39;jdalton&#39;, projectID: 3, projectName: &#39;lodash-cli&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 2, contributor: &#39;contra&#39;,  projectID: 4, projectName: &#39;gulp&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 3, contributor: &#39;phated&#39;,  projectID: 4, projectName: &#39;gulp&#39;},\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nYou can apply a schema like this:\r\n\r\n    var scheme = {\r\n      &quot;$group[contributors](pid)&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;pid&quot;,\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;contributor&quot;,\r\n        &quot;$group[projects](projectID)&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;projectID&quot;,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;projectName&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nTo get a nested JSON like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;contributors&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;jdalton&quot;,\r\n          &quot;projects&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;lodash&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 2,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;docdown&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 3,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;lodash-cli&quot;\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: 2,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;contra&quot;,\r\n          &quot;projects&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 4,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;gulp&quot;\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: 3,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;phated&quot;,\r\n          &quot;projects&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 4,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;gulp&quot;\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn my case, I have a product hierarchy (product class -&gt; product subclass -&gt; product) which I am trying to represent as a nested JSON. \r\n\r\n**Background:** \r\n\r\n - I am getting the data from a MySQL table and reading it into a\r\n   `MySqlDataReader`.\r\n   \r\n - Following this [SO question][2], I have been able to serialize\r\n   the data into a JSON\r\n\r\nI am clueless on how to create a nested JSON like the example above.

I see I can trigger an event when something changes in cosmos db. This is useful. However, in some situations, I expect a document to be changed after a while. A question should have a status change that it has been answered. After a while an order should have a status change &quot;confirmed&quot; and a problem should have status change &quot;resolved&quot; or should a have priority change (to &quot;low&quot;). It is useful to trigger an event when such a change is happening for a certain document. However, it is even more useful to trigger an event when such a change after a (specified) while (like 1 hour) does not happen. A problem needs to be resolved after a while, an order needs to be confirmed after while etc. Can I use change feeds and azure functions for that too? Or do I need something different?

problem is this line of code:\r\n\r\n    canvas.update()\r\n\r\nYou should definitely not be calling `update` inside a function called from an event handler (and running a function via `after` is considered an event handler). It&#39;s completely unnecessary to make your program work and needs to be removed.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening is that your call to `after` adds some work to be done by `mainloop` after a given amount of time. When you call `update`, it performs that work if the given amount of time has elapsed, otherwise it might not do anything at all. \r\n\r\nIf your computer is slow enough, then by the time you call `update` it will be time for the next frame of your animation. That causes `moveCora` to be called again via `canvas.update()` _before the first call returns_. And that is why you get a recursion error.\r\n\r\nI wasn&#39;t able to duplicate the problem on my machine at 16ms, but I was able to reproduce it when I moved the time to 5ms. You must have a machine that takes more than 16ms to move the line and then call `after`. When I remove the call to `canvas.update()` I am able to set the value down to 1ms without a problem. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440630/recursionerror-on-macos-with-tkinter-moving-objects/58441718#58441718","title":"RecursionError on macOS with tkinter moving objects"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7875911,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/752404718271193/picture?type=large","display_name":"Josef L&#225;t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7875911/josef-l%c3%a1t"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77063,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571352901,"creation_date":1571345759,"last_edit_date":1571346292,"question_id":58440630,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440630","body_markdown":"I am learning with tkinter, and that involves fluid motion of shapes.

I know that filter expression can be used, but I was wondering if there was a way to design the sort key so that filter is not needed as it is more costly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440597/multiple-comparison-conditions-on-sort-key-for-dynamodb","title":"Multiple Comparison Conditions on Sort Key for DynamoDB?"},{"tags":["gnuradio","gnuradio-companion"],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":8844897,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4B75QR6tG2o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAATaM/F4xQD2Wgt3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"nicholas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8844897/nicholas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571345585,"creation_date":1571345585,"question_id":58440596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440596","body_markdown":"I am running GNU Radio 3.7.13.4 and working in GNU Radio Companion on Ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\nI have a very simple flowgraph where I have a source of type complex (I&#39;ve tried both a signal source and a constant source) which I connect to a transcendental block (of type complex) and then output to a sink of type complex (I don&#39;t think anything after the transcendental block matters).\r\n\r\nI have tried the transcendental block with functions &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;cos&quot; and &quot;exp&quot;.

If so, what is the proper way to do so?**\r\n\r\n## My Attempt ##\r\n\r\nI have read the `reselect` docs section, &quot;Customize equalityCheck for defaultMemoize,&quot; and have read through a number of posts where an attempt at memoizing *arrays* using `reselect` are made. Based on this knowledge, I have attempted to do the following, but to no success:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport _ from &#39;lodash&#39;;\r\nimport { createSelector, createSelectorCreator, defaultMemoize } from &#39;reselect&#39;\r\n\r\nconst createDeepEqualSelector = createSelectorCreator(\r\n  defaultMemoize,\r\n  _.isEqual,\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst getLargeObject = createDeepEqualSelector(\r\n  (state) =&gt; {\r\n    // Get the individual values from state\r\n    const {\r\n      val1, val2, val3, val4, val5, val6, val7, val8, val9, val10\r\n    } = state;\r\n\r\n    // Create a convenient object that contains all of those values to pass down to props\r\n    const constructedObject = {\r\n      val1, val2, val3, val4, val5, val6, val7, val8, val9, val10\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return constructedObject;\r\n  },\r\n  constructedObject =&gt; constructedObject,\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) =&gt; {\r\n  const objProp = getLargeObject(state);\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    objProp,\r\n    // ... other props\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The (Unfortunate) Alternative ##\r\n\r\nIf I do not do things way, I end up with 8+ individual selectors, with a large `createSelector` call. This seems more redundant than necessary, and makes me wonder if there is a better way to do this. As a demonstration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst getVal1 = (state) =&gt; state.val1;\r\nconst getVal2 = (state) =&gt; state.val2;\r\n...\r\n\r\nconst getLargeObject = createSelector(\r\n  [\r\n    getVal1,\r\n    getVal2,\r\n    ...\r\n  ],\r\n  (\r\n    val1,\r\n    val2,\r\n    ...\r\n  ) =&gt; {\r\n    const largeObject = {\r\n      val1,\r\n      val2,\r\n      ...\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return largeObject;\r\n  },\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for your any help you can give!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440588/how-to-memoize-deep-compare-redux-objects-using-reselect-with-createselectorcr","title":"How to Memoize (Deep Compare) Redux Objects Using Reselect with createSelectorCreator()?"},{"tags":["mysql","join"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571346054,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103220990,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103220990_58440586"},{"owner":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571346119,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103221016,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103221016_58440586"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571346266,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103221063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103221063_58440586"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571346338,"post_id":58440586,"comment_id":103221091,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows#comment103221091_58440586"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571346612,"creation_date":1571346612,"answer_id":58440769,"question_id":58440586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58440769","body_markdown":"You need to pivot the meta table.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT c.*,\r\n    MAX(IF(contact_meta_key = &#39;Newsletter&#39;, contact_meta_value, NULL)) AS newsletter,\r\n    MAX(IF(contact_meta_key = &#39;Level&#39;, contact_meta_value, NULL)) AS level\r\nFROM contact AS c\r\nLEFT JOIN contact_meta AS cm ON c.id = cm.id_contact\r\nGROUP BY c.id\r\n```\r\n[DEMO][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/rQpeqK4JmvVda46QC6CHjc/1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440586/join-2-tables-with-different-number-of-rows/58440769#58440769","title":"Join 2 tables with different number of rows"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5608705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3897ba10766a80b38d743661c3c352f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5608705/nick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5608705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3897ba10766a80b38d743661c3c352f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5608705/nick"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571350320,"last_edit_date":1571350320,"creation_date":1571349889,"answer_id":58441314,"question_id":58440586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58441314","body_markdown":"The thing is today John has 2 entries in contact_meta but tomorrow it can be 5 and Laura 9, I store many datas in it.

If successful, then I want the screen to change to the home screen. If it fails, then display the message in a `Toast`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what some of my actions look like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function getTokenAPI(username, password) {\r\n  return async function action(dispatch) {\r\n    try {\r\n      dispatch({ type: t.AUTH_GET_TOKEN });\r\n      dispatch(setLoading(true));\r\n\r\n      const { data } = await API.authGetToken(username, password);\r\n      const { success } = data;\r\n\r\n\r\n      if (success) {\r\n        const { access_token, refresh_token } = data;\r\n\r\n        dispatch(setAccessToken(access_token));\r\n\r\n        dispatch(setRefreshToken(refresh_token));\r\n\r\n        await dispatch(setLoading(false));\r\n      } else if (!success) {\r\n        const { errorMessage } = data;\r\n        throw Error(errorMessage);\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (e) {\r\n      dispatch(setError(e.message));\r\n      dispatch(setLoading(false));\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `setError` action sets the `error` key to `true` and sets the `errorMessage`. Here&#39;s what my screen looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { Container, View, Toast } from &#39;native-base&#39;;\r\nimport styles from &#39;./styles&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\nimport { authActions } from &#39;_ducks/auth&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst LoginScreen = props =&gt; {\r\n  const { getToken, navigation } = props;\r\n  const { navigate } = navigation;\r\n\r\n  const navigateToHome = () =&gt; navigate(&#39;Home&#39;);\r\n\r\n  const handleLogin = async () =&gt; {\r\n    const { error, errorMessage } = props;\r\n    await getToken(&#39;sample&#39;, &#39;pass123&#39;);\r\n    if (error) {\r\n      Toast.show({\r\n        text: errorMessage,\r\n        buttonText: &#39;kay&#39;,\r\n      });\r\n    } else {\r\n      navigateToHome();\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Container&gt;\r\n      &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\r\n        &lt;LoginButton onPress={handleLogin} /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/View&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Container&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =&gt; ({\r\n  getToken: () =&gt; dispatch(authActions.getTokenAPI()),\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = state =&gt; ({\r\n  isLoading: state.authReducer.isLoading,\r\n  error: state.authReducer.error,\r\n  errorMessage: state.authReducer.errorMessage,\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default connect(\r\n  mapStateToProps,\r\n  mapDispatchToProps,\r\n)(LoginScreen);\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if there&#39;s an error, then display the toast. If it&#39;s successful, navigate to the home screen. Essentially, `error` will not be `true` quick enough to make the check within `handleLogin` work appropriately.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations on the pattern or process?

The transfer of both needs to be as **efficient** as possible (if that would not be a concern, why using OpenCL, right?).  \r\nI read that OpenCV uses OpenCL internally (`UMat`), and that I could access the `GPU` buffer by accessing `UMat::handle`. However, my attempts for this have been unsuccessful up to now.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to reuse `UMat` buffer as the input for the OpenCL `kernels`, and eventually, produce a result as an image back to another `UMat` for displaying it.\r\n\r\nThe OpenCV framework is only intended to produce an input for the program, in consequence, I am not interested in using OpenCV CL wrapper (`cv::ocl`) but rather use normal OpenCL (`cl::...`). This avoid having the OpenCV framework included/linked in the full software.\r\n\r\n**The question:**\r\n\r\nHow to access OpenCV UMat buffer through OpenCL? \r\n \r\n - Use the UMat buffer as an OpenCL buffer (first option)\r\n - Move UMat buffer to OpenCL buffer within the GPU. (second option)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I have achieved yet:\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n - OpenCL work perfectly standalone\r\n - OpenCV work perfectly standalone\r\n - Converting the UMat::handle to a cl::Buffer compile\r\n - The given buffer doesn&#39;t seem to be valid.\r\n\r\n&gt;

A basic example of what such a table would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n----------------------\r\n| id | name    | age |\r\n----------------------\r\n| 1  | John    | 23  |\r\n| 2  | Mitch   | 15  |\r\n| 3  | Joe     | 33  |\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn reality, Django uses a special user model for this. By default Django has a specific model it uses. More on that [here][1]. Given that you&#39;ve already implemented authentication, you should be well on your way with this. Now, to track the scores of users you could create another model in your app called something like &#39;Score&#39; that may look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\n\r\nclass Score(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(\r\n        get_user_model(),\r\n        on_delete=models.CASCADE,\r\n        related_name=&#39;scores&#39;,\r\n    )\r\n    tries = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()\r\n    successful_tries = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomething along those lines. At this point, pay no mind to the &#39;get_user_model()&#39; method call. This is a new model that tracks scores of users. You can create one by doing `Score.objects.create(user=request.user, tries=10, successful_tries=5)`. Every training session you have you can create a new &#39;Score&#39; object that tracks how many tries you had, and how many were successful tries. You can access all of them using `request.user.scores.all()` (that&#39;s what related_name does). This way, one user can have 0 to infinite &#39;Score&#39; objects they are related to. Each user residing in the users table of your database, and each score residing in the scores table of the database.\r\n\r\nIf this is a little confusing, check out [this blogpost][2] on the topic.

I need help understanding how to reassign my original constant variable to the new prefix they are requesting.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar PREFIX = &#39;=&#39;;\r\n\r\nbot.on(&#39;message&#39;, message=&gt;{\r\n    let args = message.content.substring(PREFIX.length).split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n\r\n    switch(args[0]){\r\n        case &#39;setup&#39;:\r\n            const embed = new Discord.RichEmbed()\r\n            .setTitle(&#39;Step 1 of 1&#39;)\r\n            .setDescription(&#39;Set your Prefix&#39;)\r\n            .setColor(0xF1C40F)\r\n            message.channel.sendEmbed(embed);\r\n            //I want the user to now enter their own PREFIX and have the\r\n            //bot save their responce as the new PREFIX\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I want to happen is when the user types their desired `prefix`, the bot will reassign `prefix` in the code, and delete the bots question and the users response and begin to prompt them with the next question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440490/i-need-help-reassigning-a-variable-in-a-bot-menu","title":"I need help reassigning a variable in a bot menu"},{"tags":["angular","amazon-web-services","graphql","prisma-graphql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":2312335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7i9Df.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mat&#237;as Magni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2312335/mat%c3%adas-magni"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571849118,"post_id":58440486,"comment_id":103379385,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440486/so-prisma-api-server-running-on-aws-ecs-network-error-http-failure-response-fo#comment103379385_58440486"}],"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":2312335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7i9Df.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mat&#237;as Magni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2312335/mat%c3%adas-magni"},"last_editor":{"reputation":54,"user_id":2312335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7i9Df.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mat&#237;as Magni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2312335/mat%c3%adas-magni"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571373228,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571849132,"creation_date":1571345063,"last_edit_date":1571849132,"question_id":58440486,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440486","body_markdown":"I have an API GraphQL server running on AWS ECS and when my app in Angular tries to make a GraphQL query it throws this error on console:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncore.js:6014 ERROR Error: Network error: Http failure response for https://api.masvino.tv: 0 Unknown Error\r\n    at new ApolloError (bundle.esm.js:63)\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1247\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1559\r\n    at Set.forEach (&lt;anonymous&gt;)\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1557\r\n    at Map.forEach (&lt;anonymous&gt;)\r\n    at QueryManager.push../node_modules/apollo-client/bundle.esm.js.QueryManager.broadcastQueries (bundle.esm.js:1555)\r\n    at bundle.esm.js:1161\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone-evergreen.js:359)\r\n    at Object.onInvoke (core.js:39698)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis Prisma server connects to a MySQL database running on AWS RDS.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know why this doesn&#39;t happen when my Angular app is running on localhost.

The new schema might look like this:\r\n\r\n    Firestore-root\r\n       |\r\n       --- users\r\n            |\r\n            --- uid\r\n                 |\r\n                 --- email: &quot;name@email.com&quot;\r\n                 |\r\n                 --- id: &quot;userId&quot;\r\n                 |\r\n                 --- friendIds: [&quot;friendIdOne&quot;, &quot;friendIdTwo&quot;, &quot;friendIdThree&quot;]\r\n\r\nThis will work perfectly fine **only** if the size of the document it will not reach the limit. So there are some limits when it comes to how much data you can put into a document. According to the official documentation regarding [usage and limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas):\r\n\r\n&gt; Maximum size for a document: 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, you are limited to 1 MiB total of data in a single document. When we are talking about storing text, you can store pretty much.\r\n\r\nIf you think that the size of the document might get over that limit, then your solution of storing firends as documents in a separate collection will solve your problem.\r\n\r\n&gt; And to add this in the other user document id user (targetedUser) --&gt; bidirectional.\r\n\r\nTo have a bidirectional relationship, in the solution above, you should simply copy the `friendId` in user&#39;s `friendIds` array and `userId` in friend&#39;s `friendIds` array.\r\n\r\n&gt; When some one user delete the other user, we have to delete the id in friendsRelationship collection from currentUser and targetedUser.\r\n\r\nIn the solution above, you should delete the userId from `friendIds` array and the `friendId` from user&#39;s `friendIds` array.\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;d rather do users &gt; id &gt; images (collection) &gt; url, date (fields)... or images &gt; id (generated) &gt; fromUser (id), toUserId (collection) &gt; id ?\r\n\r\nYou can also use in this case an array for storing image references. Again, if you think that the size of the document might get over that limit, the solution of storing images as documents in a separate collection is the solution to go ahead with.\r\n\r\n&gt; How to query all images that current User has received ? Like db.collection(&quot;users&quot;).document(currentUser.uid) ...\r\n\r\nYes, by getting a reference to user document:\r\n\r\n    db.collection(&quot;users&quot;).document(currentUser.uid)\r\n\r\nAnd then reading the `images` array.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440472/firebase-database-architecture-snapchat-like/58482900#58482900","title":"Firebase Database Architecture - Snapchat like"}],"owner":{"reputation":608,"user_id":3723046,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3qgau.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vjardel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3723046/vjardel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571648218,"creation_date":1571344991,"last_edit_date":1571648218,"question_id":58440472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440472","body_markdown":"I want to create an app with Firebase.\r\n\r\nI have two main targets for this app:\r\n\r\n 1.

When you provide a `sort` clause on a query, it is the `mongod` that is actually performing the sort, not the driver or the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\nFor sorting, there are 2 things that can happen, depending on the indexes available:\r\n\r\n1. Sort using the index\r\n2. Sort without an index\r\n\r\nA good rule of thumb is, if you want to sort on a field, the index created for that query needs to _end_ with that field.\r\n\r\nSo if you are querying on _just_ the `timestamp` field, then you only need an index of `timestamp: -1` or `timestamp: 1`. The index can be used for queries with either sort direction.\r\n\r\nIf you are querying on multiple fields, then you want the index to end with `timestamp`. So for the example you provided, you might want an index like `{ user_id: 1, action_id: 1, timestamp: -1 }`, which would support that exact query.\r\n\r\nIf an index does not exist that can be used for sorting, it will happen in memory. However, there is a limitation on in-memory sorts, to prevent degradation of service. As of writing this, [it is 32 MB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/#restrictions). If the sort operation requires more than that, you need to create an index.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440470/when-using-the-mongo-c-driver-does-query-sorting-occur-within-mongo-or-at-the/58440752#58440752","title":"When using the Mongo C# driver, does query sorting occur within Mongo, or at the C# level?"}],"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":11506637,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rGup7JCP9yU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcY0OrC33toPO8YZsltL1UJLQU5Jyg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Extranomical","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11506637/extranomical"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58440715,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571346775,"creation_date":1571344988,"question_id":58440470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440470","body_markdown":"Suppose you want to retrieve a bunch of documents that have a timestamp field from a Mongo database using the C# driver, and you want them sorted by timestamp in decreasing order (-1).\r\n\r\nWhen creating an index, do you need to include the timestamp field in the -1 order, for the queries that sort this way?

In the code above Json.NET actually performs the evaluation during serialization, inside the call to `JsonConvert.SerializeObject`.\r\n\r\n - I wasn&#39;t sure whether the `id` columns were 32-bit or 64-bit integers, so I assumed the larger, for safety.\r\n\r\n - The code assumes none of the record values are [null](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.idatarecord.isdbnull?view=netframework-4.8#System_Data_IDataRecord_IsDBNull_System_Int32_).\r\n\r\n\r\nDemo fiddle [here](https://dotnetfiddle.net/tWxVGF) that mocks up the above using a `DataTable` and `DataTableReader`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440439/creating-nested-json-with-data-from-sqldatareader/58441719#58441719","title":"Creating nested JSON with data from SQLDataReader"}],"owner":{"reputation":566,"user_id":202345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/khWqP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KalC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/202345/kalc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":61649,"user_id":3744182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ab1dca8193d1b5734ba07702e963b6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dbc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3744182/dbc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58441719,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571363915,"creation_date":1571344840,"last_edit_date":1571353285,"question_id":58440439,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58440439","body_markdown":"I am new to .NET and trying to achieve what [shape-json][1] does in the Node world.\r\n\r\n**Copied from the shape-json npm page:**\r\n\r\nGiven the following array of objects:\r\n\r\n    var input = [\r\n      {pid: 1, contributor: &#39;jdalton&#39;, projectID: 1, projectName: &#39;lodash&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 1, contributor: &#39;jdalton&#39;, projectID: 2, projectName: &#39;docdown&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 1, contributor: &#39;jdalton&#39;, projectID: 3, projectName: &#39;lodash-cli&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 2, contributor: &#39;contra&#39;,  projectID: 4, projectName: &#39;gulp&#39;},\r\n      {pid: 3, contributor: &#39;phated&#39;,  projectID: 4, projectName: &#39;gulp&#39;},\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nYou can apply a schema like this:\r\n\r\n    var scheme = {\r\n      &quot;$group[contributors](pid)&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;pid&quot;,\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;contributor&quot;,\r\n        &quot;$group[projects](projectID)&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;projectID&quot;,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;projectName&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nTo get a nested JSON like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;contributors&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;jdalton&quot;,\r\n          &quot;projects&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;lodash&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 2,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;docdown&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 3,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;lodash-cli&quot;\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: 2,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;contra&quot;,\r\n          &quot;projects&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 4,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;gulp&quot;\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: 3,\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;phated&quot;,\r\n          &quot;projects&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n              &quot;id&quot;: 4,\r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;gulp&quot;\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn my case, I have a product hierarchy (product class -&gt; product subclass -&gt; product) which I am trying to represent as a nested JSON. \r\n\r\n**Background:** \r\n\r\n - I am getting the data from a MySQL table and reading it into a\r\n   `MySqlDataReader`.\r\n   \r\n - Following this [SO question][2], I have been able to serialize\r\n   the data into a JSON\r\n\r\nI am clueless on how to create a nested JSON like the example above.
