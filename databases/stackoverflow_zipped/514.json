The only issue I get is when I try to install this particular module and I get an error about ModuleNotFound then when I try again it loads and works fine. The problem is if I want to run it in a script the script will error out. So I would like to fix this  \r\n\r\nI looked into my python directory where it was installed and sure enough the package is there. I noticed that in the initialization file this module is loaded first and then it tries to initiate another module down the line, so I took this out and nothing happened.

The task is to request client data via the Google Analytics Reporting API (v4) and store them to a SQL Backend on a daily basis via an Airflow DAG-structure.\r\n\r\nFor the first account everything works fine.\r\nJust recently I added the second account to the data request routine. \r\nThe problem is that even though both accounts are set to the same &quot;USER-100s&quot; quota limits, I keep getting this error for the newly added account:\r\n\r\n`googleapiclient.errors.HttpError: &lt;HttpError 429 when requesting https://analyticsreporting.googleapis.com/v4/reports:batchGet?alt=json returned &quot;Quota exceeded for quota group &#39;AnalyticsDefaultGroup&#39; and limit &#39;USER-100s&#39; of service &#39;analyticsreporting.googleapis.com&#39; for consumer &#39;project_number:XXXXXXXXXXXX&#39;.&quot;&gt;`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI already set the quota limit &quot;User-100s&quot; from 100 to the maximum of 1000, as recommended in the official Google guidelines (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3/limits-quotas)\r\n\r\nAlso I checked the Google API Console and the number of requests for my project number, but I never exceeded the 1000 requests per 100 seconds so far (see request history account 2), while the first account always works(see request history account 1). Still the above error appeared. \r\n\r\nAlso I could rule out the possibility that the 2nd account&#39;s clients simply have more data.\r\n\r\n[request history account 1][1]\r\n\r\n[request history account 2][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tp76P.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YzMoG.png\r\n\r\nI am now down to a try-except loop that keeps on requesting until the data is eventually queried successfully, like\r\n```python\r\nsuccess = False\r\ndata = None\r\nwhile not success:\r\n    try:\r\n        data = query_data() # trying to receive data from the API\r\n        if data:\r\n            success = True\r\n    except HttpError as e:\r\n        print(e)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not elegant at all and bad for maintaining (like integration tests). In addition, it is very time and resource intensive, because the loop might sometimes run indefinitely.

As long as your target destinations are different in the copy statements, you should be fine injesting data correctly. Pipes in the same regions share the same queue to injest data.

As long as your target table is different in both statements(for both pipes) and does not include purge in any of the pipes, when a file comes int a bucket, it is loaded into both tables gen3_data and gen2_data. You can drop a file and test it out. Let me know if have any problem and we can debug.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n***Q:***\r\nThat is exactly the problem. I want to separate data coming from s3 and for that I have two separate S3 events, hoping snowflake pipes, each can listed to its own event. But both pipes have the same ARN, so separation on this level seems to impossible, or is it?\r\n\r\n***A:***\r\nMaybe I am not understanding this correctly. Do you want to load the same file into both target tables or are you differentiating between files that load into their respective tabes? You can include the prefix in the statement when you are creating the external stage. When a data file is uploaded into the bucket, all pipes that match the stage directory path perform a one-time load of the file into their corresponding target tables.\r\n\r\nFor example: Create two stages\r\nstage for DEV is &quot;`s3://bucket/sub_folder_1`&quot; and for PROD is &quot;`s3://bucket/sub_folder_2`&quot;.\r\n\r\nCreate copy into commands to a target table defined as pointing to respective stages as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n***Q:***\r\nYes, thank you! I figured the solution with prefixes/folders while creating external stages.\r\n\r\nThe initial idea was to utilize two events on s3 side with different prefixes, since we need them for other purposes as well.\r\n\r\nSo there is no way to tell a pipe what queue to listen (ie assign ARN) explicitly, is there?\r\n\r\n***A:***\r\nThat is correct.

Install only Visio 2010 on your development machine (and uninstall 2016). It&#39;s safest to have the lowest version you want your app to run with on your dev machine anyways. Add a reference to Visio 2010&#39;s type library in Excel. Remove the reference to Visio 21016 type library. Visio versions are upward-compatible, so the code should run properly even on the machine with Visio 2016.\r\n\r\nSolution 2. Use late binding. Remove the reference to the Visio from your excel project altogether and use only script-like access. In this case, you will lose auto-completion though. If your app is not a big one, that should not be an issue.\r\n\r\nSolution 3. (if you want to run a specific version).

I believe that part of the problem is the legacy &#39;popup&#39; that is used when the submit button is clicked, I cannot duplicate in any other browsers.\r\n\r\n    import requests\r\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\r\n    consdb_url = &quot;http://192.168.253.85/ConsolidatedProcess.aspx&quot;\r\n\r\n    # this is after logging in\r\n    consdb_content = session.get(consdb_url)\r\n    # print(consdb_content.text)\r\n\r\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(consdb_content.content, &#39;html.parser&#39;)\r\n    payload = {\r\n        &#39;__EVENTARGUMENT&#39;: &#39;&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__EVENTTARGET&#39;: &#39;ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24lbtnSubmit&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__EVENTVALIDATION&#39;: soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;__EVENTVALIDATION&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;__LASTFOCUS&#39;: &#39;&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__VIEWSTATE&#39;: soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;__VIEWSTATE&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;__VIEWSTATEENCRYPTED&#39;: &#39;&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR&#39;: soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlFunctionType&#39;: &#39;1&#39;,\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlFunctionTypeSearchSection&#39;: &#39;0&#39;,\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlStatus&#39;: &#39;0&#39;,\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtEndDate&#39;:\r\n            soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtEndDate&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtStartDate&#39;:\r\n            soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtStartDate&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ScriptManager1&#39;: &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$lbtnSubmit&#39;\r\n    }\r\n    print(payload)\r\n    post = session.post(consdb_url, data=payload)\r\n   \r\n\r\nJS:\r\n```\r\nfunction ConfirmYesNo(x)\r\n        {\r\n            if (x.disabled == false)\r\n            {\r\n                var yesnoStatus;\r\n                yesnoStatus=  confirm(&quot;Are you Sure?&quot;);\r\n                return yesnoStatus;\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHTML Markup:\r\n```\r\n    &lt;a id=&quot;ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lbtnSubmit&quot; style=&quot;color: white; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;&quot; onclick=&quot;return ConfirmYesNo(this);&quot; href=&#39;javascript:WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions(new WebForm_PostBackOptions(&quot;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$lbtnSubmit&quot;, &quot;&quot;, true, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, false, true))&#39;&gt;Submit&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the form is submitted via the browser I expect to see a status populated for the specific item:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;span id=&quot;ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_grdVwFunctionTypeTrans_ctl03_lblSuccess&quot;&gt;Successful&lt;/span&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead the request simply returns the same form, as if nothing was submitted.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417816/submit-aspx-form-data-with-python-requests","title":"Submit aspx form data with Python requests"},{"tags":["c#","unit-testing","moq",".net-core-3.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":141442,"user_id":5233410,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ehMg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nkosi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5233410/nkosi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571311659,"post_id":58417815,"comment_id":103203618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417815/moq-callback-for-generic-method-with-func-parameter#comment103203618_58417815"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":4678110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLH9v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Leosvel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4678110/leosvel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46,"user_id":4678110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLH9v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Leosvel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4678110/leosvel"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571320656,"creation_date":1571243091,"last_edit_date":1571320656,"question_id":58417815,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417815","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to setup a Callback on a generic method of a mocked object that receives a generic Func as a parameter.

new to Java, and new to how Java&#39;s compiling stuff works with its Virtual Machine, so please write your answer in simple terms.\r\n\r\nI am using VSCode (on macOS) to make a Java application. I am using `Eclipse New Java Project` to create my projects, which sets up a file structure like so:\r\n\r\n    TestApp\r\n    │\r\n    │-- .vscode\r\n    │-- bin\r\n    ╵-- src\r\n      ╵-- app\r\n        ╵-- App.java\r\n\r\nNow I am able to compile my simple project, and it prints within vscode:\r\n\r\n    package app;\r\n\r\n    public class App {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Hello!&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHow do I now go about running it similar to an application? I have had a long look around, and found things about creating a `.jar` file, but I don&#39;t get what this is doing.\r\n\r\nIs the `.jar` an executable? When I try click on it I get an error, and after searching that up, I saw that you need to add the main class somehow, and I keep getting lots of errors and nothing is working from the many solutions on Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, how do I compile a Java project so I can open it like an app instead of compiling within vscode every time? Is there an option within vscode which makes this `.jar` and stuff for me?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417800/compiling-java-into-application-in-vscode-on-mac","title":"Compiling Java into application in VSCode on Mac"},{"tags":["android","angular","typescript","firebase","ionic-framework"],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10544000,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IVwP_qPh7Fk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbC6Bw5dNsRGJM1AZ1HAavurvV0zGw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10544000/amp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571243014,"creation_date":1571243014,"question_id":58417799,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417799","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating an application that change user status. user status are located inside an array map. each user have their own array map.

Smart Pointers are still dynamic allocation, however they are able to clean themselves up so that you don&#39;t have to remember too.  That&#39;s why they are preferred over using new/delete (malloc/free, etc), they are much less likely to lead to memory leaks.\r\n\r\nAutomatic allocation is fine when the object lifespan allows it, but if you need the object to persist outside of the function it was declared in, you&#39;ll need dynamically allocated memory.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417793/dynamic-allocation-and-large-data-structures-in-c/58420374#58420374","title":"Dynamic allocation and large data structures in C++"}],"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":1716472,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c9bcb26c7a10c77ed39a7ffcfa91bcf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jef Grailet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1716472/jef-grailet"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571253750,"creation_date":1571242995,"question_id":58417793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417793","body_markdown":"Lately, I learned there is a consensus among C++ programmers that the ```new```, ```delete``` and ```delete[]``` operators should be avoided as often as possible, as already discussed [here][1], [here][2] or [here][3]. While searching, I even stumbled upon an [April Fools&#39; joke][4] stating that these operators would become deprecated in C++20.\r\n\r\nI happen to write and maintain a C/C++ program, written in such language in order to carry on useful libraries and classes written by other programmers. As it must run in quite limited environments (i.e., old Linux distributions with the bare minimum in terms of programs), I can&#39;t rely on features brought C++11 and later versions (such as [smart pointers][5]), and I sticked so far to a mix of C and Java programming habits while expanding my program. Among others, I used quite often dynamic allocation with ```new``` and ```delete``` - which sounds, of course, to be a problem.\r\n\r\nTo ease the maintenance of my code by future programmer(s), I would like to minimize dynamic allocation with said keywords in my code. The problem is that my program has to manage some quite large data structures used for (almost) the entire execution. As a consequence, I struggle to figure out why I should avoid dynamic allocation in these situations.\r\n\r\nTo simplify, consider I have a data structure (modeled as an object) worth 10 Megaoctets which is used for the entire execution of the program and which the size in memory can increase over time. My questions are the following:\r\n\r\n* Is dynamic allocation of the object with ```new``` still a bad practice in this particular context ? What are the better alternatives ?\r\n\r\n* Suppose now I instantiate somewhere in my program a new object without using ```new```, do some operations on it which could slightly change its size, then use a method to insert it in my data structure. How does it work, memory-wise, if automatic allocation (as mentioned [here][1]) is used ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6500313/why-should-c-programmers-minimize-use-of-new\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7620385/why-is-it-a-bad-idea-to-use-new\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22146094/why-should-i-use-a-pointer-rather-than-the-object-itself\r\n  [4]: https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/01/cpp-will-no-longer-have-pointers/\r\n  [5]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/106508/what-is-a-smart-pointer-and-when-should-i-use-one","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417793/dynamic-allocation-and-large-data-structures-in-c","title":"Dynamic allocation and large data structures in C++"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pandas","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1670,"user_id":6043544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fafb6acf4f4504b54e7484bc0c17cc7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6043544/oleg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22275,"user_id":3000206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NaBI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carcigenicate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3000206/carcigenicate"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243349,"post_id":58417791,"comment_id":103178306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple#comment103178306_58417791"},{"owner":{"reputation":1670,"user_id":6043544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fafb6acf4f4504b54e7484bc0c17cc7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6043544/oleg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22275,"user_id":3000206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NaBI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carcigenicate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3000206/carcigenicate"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243385,"post_id":58417791,"comment_id":103178326,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple#comment103178326_58417791"},{"owner":{"reputation":1345,"user_id":10197418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/be8Y6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFuppes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10197418/mrfuppes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243628,"post_id":58417791,"comment_id":103178437,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple#comment103178437_58417791"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1345,"user_id":10197418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/be8Y6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFuppes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10197418/mrfuppes"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571243907,"creation_date":1571243907,"answer_id":58417997,"question_id":58417791,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58417997","body_markdown":"to get your code\r\n```python\r\nany(x in &#39;MTHLY-&#39;+ row[0] for x in sheetnames)\r\n```\r\nrunning properly, your could obtain the sheets names as\r\n```python\r\nsheetnames = [sheet.title for sheet in wb.worksheets]\r\n```\r\nthat would basically replace your current for loop\r\n```\r\nfor sheet in wb.worksheets:\r\n     sheetnames = sheet\r\n     print(sheetnames)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple/58417997#58417997","title":"in &lt;string&gt;&#39;

e.g., with the invocation in your question (had it succeeded), `$PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey(&#39;statustimestamp&#39;)` would indicate `$true`.\r\n\r\n**If you want your parameter value to be `$null` _by omission_**:\r\n\r\nDeclare your parameter simply as `[Datetime] $statustimestamp` and _pass no argument to it_ on invocation; `$statustimestamp` will then *implicitly* be `$null`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Declare a parameter in a script block (which works like a function)\r\n# and invoke the script block without an argument for that parameter:\r\nPS&gt; &amp; { param([Datetime] $statustimestamp) $null -eq $statustimestamp }\r\n\r\nTrue  # $statustimestamp was $null\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**If you want to support _explicitly passing `$null`_ as an argument:**\r\n\r\nThis may be necessary if you declare a _mandatory_ parameter, yet you want to allow `$null` as an explicit signal that a default value should be used.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the **specifics of the parameter declaration currently depend on whether the data type of the parameter is a _reference type_ (such as `[string]` or `[System.IO.FileInfo]`) or a _value type_ (such as `[int]` or `[datetime]`)**.  \r\nYou can inspect a given type&#39;s `.IsValueType` property to learn whether it is a value type (`$true)` or a reference type (`$false`); e.g.: `[datetime].IsValueType` yields `$true`).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the **parameter type is a _reference type_**, you can use the `[AllowNull()]` attribute:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; &amp; { \r\n  param(\r\n    [AllowNull()]\r\n    [Parameter(Mandatory)]\r\n    [System.IO.FileInfo] $Foo  # System.IO.FileInfo is a *reference type*\r\n  )\r\n  $null -eq $Foo \r\n} -Foo $null\r\n\r\nTrue  # $Foo was $null\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the **same technique doesn&#39;t work with _value types_** such as `[DateTime]`, so your **parameter must indeed be typed as `[Nullable[DateTime]`**, as in your question:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; &amp; { \r\n  param(\r\n    [Parameter(Mandatory)]\r\n    [AllowNull()] # Because the parameter is mandatory, this is *also* needed.\r\n    [Nullable[DateTime]] $Foo  # System.DateTime is a *value type*\r\n  )\r\n  $null -eq $Foo \r\n} -Foo $null\r\n\r\nTrue  # $Foo was $null\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: These requirements - needing to pay attention to the difference between value types and reference types and needing to use a `[Nullable[T]]` type - are obscure and uncharacteristic for PowerShell.\r\n\r\n**Doing away with these requirements** in favor of a unified approach (making it work for value types the way it already does for reference types) **is the \r\nsubject of [this proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10817)**.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417780/pass-null-datetime-parameter-in-powershell/58436445#58436445","title":"Pass null datetime parameter in powershell"}],"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":7081415,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9422d2c0e892589f5ad0201875bda15?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alangilbi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7081415/alangilbi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58417820,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571335757,"creation_date":1571242921,"question_id":58417780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417780","body_markdown":"So I have a powershell script that takes region and datetime as input and internally in the script it calls a stored procedure.\r\nThe storeprocedure takes two input region and datetimestamp, the datetimestamp is always null.

They have a lot of functions that come with the software. I think that things like `expand` and `waitForObject` are, but there might be some that are that aren&#39;t as obvious as to what they do. If I haven&#39;t made my question clear enough, I would be more than happy to add as much more detail as needed.\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI&#39;m writing a function library with functions to interact with a window in an app for automated testing. This window consists completely of drop down menus. Most of these windows have almost the same test. Most have &quot;Y - Yes&quot; and &quot;N - No&quot; to select from. Others have &quot;Y - YES&quot; and &quot;N - NO&quot; (don&#39;t get me started on the fact that they&#39;re not the same in the same window). \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve defined objects for all of these drop downs and the options inside the dropdowns but I feel like it would be easiest for other programmers using this library if I set up the functions that interact with these drop downs to use enumerated variables. \r\n\r\nFor example, a function to select a value in drop down one might look something like this:\r\n\r\n    function selectDropDown1(option)\r\n    {\r\n        expand(waitForObject(Field1ComboBox));\r\n        mouseClick(waitForObject(Field1.properties[option].object));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy brain tells me that the default way to do this is to make enumerated variables for each and every drop down menu&#39;s options like this:\r\n\r\n    var Field1 = \r\n    {\r\n        YES: 1,\r\n        NO:  2,\r\n    \r\n        properties:\r\n        {\r\n            1: {name: &quot;Y - Yes&quot;, object: names.Field1ComboBoxItem1},\r\n            2: {name: &quot;N - No&quot;, object: names.Field1ComboBoxItem2}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut since many of these drop down menus have the same options to select from, I feel like there must be a good way to go about defining variables and setting up functions so that I can have a one or two enums that I can use in each function regardless of what field I&#39;m selecting from.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve googled around but I&#39;m not too comfortable with how enums work and I feel like I&#39;m missing some important details that I could be adding to my searches as I&#39;m not getting many useful results. Any help in pointing me in the right direction would be helpful.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a bonus, I&#39;ve been trying to think of a way that I can make this sort of thing work for the different spellings of the drop down options except that most of the objects are defined by their text.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417778/creating-enumerated-variables-for-different-drop-down-fields-in-the-same-window","title":"Creating enumerated variables for different drop down fields in the same window"},{"tags":["java","algorithm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571244292,"post_id":58417774,"comment_id":103178763,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417774/writing-a-long-division-method#comment103178763_58417774"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12135212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/965930607081476/picture?type=large","display_name":"Matin Tahmasebpour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135212/matin-tahmasebpour"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":133,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571243857,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571242899,"creation_date":1571242899,"question_id":58417774,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417774","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to write a long division method in java, this is what I have so far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        public MyBigInteger dividedBy( MyBigInteger  divisor ) throws Exception{\r\n\t\t//if bases are different , throw exception \r\n\t\tif (this.base != divisor.base){\r\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(&quot;Bases must be the same in dividedBy method&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger quotient = new MyBigInteger(0,base);\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger remainder = this.clone();\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger compare=new MyBigInteger(this.base) ;\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger divide=divisor.clone();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\twhile(remainder.compareTo(divisor)&gt;=0) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tint sizeR= this.coefficients.size();\r\n\t\t\tint sizeD=divisor.coefficients.size();\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\tfor(int i=sizeD;i&gt;0;i--) {\r\n\t\t\tcompare.coefficients.add(Integer.valueOf(remainder.coefficients.get(sizeR-i)));\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tif (divisor.compareTo(compare)&lt;0) {\r\n\t\t\tcompare.coefficients.add(Integer.valueOf(remainder.coefficients.get(sizeR-sizeD-1)));\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tquotient=quotient.plus(compare.slowdividedBy(divisor));\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tint sizeC=compare.coefficients.size();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tfor(int j=0;j&lt;sizeR-sizeC;j++) {\r\n\t\t\tdivide.coefficients.add(0);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tremainder=remainder.minus(divide.times(quotient));\r\n\t\t\t\tdivide=divisor;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\treturn quotient;\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\nbut it doesn&#39;t work and I can&#39;t find my problem \r\n\r\nthere are other classes that I used in my method.\r\n\r\n      public MyBigInteger slowdividedBy( MyBigInteger  divisor) throws Exception{\r\n\r\n\t\tif (this.base != divisor.base){\r\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(&quot;Bases must be the same in slowdividedBy method&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger one = new MyBigInteger(1,base);\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger quotient = new MyBigInteger(0,base);\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger remainder = this.clone();\r\n\t\twhile ( remainder.compareTo(divisor) &gt;= 0 ){\r\n\t\t\tremainder = remainder.minus(divisor);\r\n\t\t\tquotient = quotient.plus(one);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn quotient;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic MyBigInteger  minus(MyBigInteger second) throws Exception{\r\n\r\n\t\t//  initialize the result as an empty list of coefficients\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger  result = new MyBigInteger(this.base);\r\n\r\n\t\tif (this.base != second.base){\r\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(&quot;Bases must be the same in minus method.&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t/*\r\n\t\t *    The minus method is not supposed to change the numbers. \r\n\t\t *    But the grade school algorithm sometimes requires us to &quot;borrow&quot;\r\n\t\t *    from a higher coefficient to a lower one.

am running a set of tests using junit and I have created a maven project for it. I use the surefire plugin to run the tests. I wanted to package this project as a self executable jar for the sake of convenience.So I placed all of test classes in the src/main/java directory as recommended for using the maven shade plugin for generating an uber jar. I created a class with a main method and use maven invoker to execute my tests. \r\nThe tests get executed perfectly when I use my ide to run the main method. However, after I package it as a jar , the invoker is unable to locate the pom.xml. If I place a copy of the pom.xml in the same directory as the jar, maven is invoked but it is unable to execute the tests as surefire is unable to locate the tests. \r\n\r\nI would love to know if there is a solution for this or if there is a better approach towards trying to achieve my goal. \r\n\r\n@khmarbaise and everyone else trying to help me , let me describe my scenario a little more in detail. \r\nLets take any api , for example , lastfm api, I would be writing classes for each api end point and every method in each class would be a test. I use junit to execute the tests. I use a junit wrapper called serenity bdd that helps me structure my tests and generate aggregate reports. The maven goal serenity:aggregate would generate an aggregated report of all tests. I am using the maven invoker to run  tests using surefire plugin and then aggregate the tests using serenity. In my eclipse project I simply create a maven run configuration and provide the maven goals. Or else I would use the terminal to run maven from my project base directory. \r\nApart from my class file, I have several resources, like csv files which are inputs for parametric tests a log folder where all log files that are generated get saved and other sample files for testing file upload apis.  I felt that it would be simple to package all of this as a jar and let my developers add this jar as a dependency and run a simple script which runs the jar each time they create and deploy a build. Getting the pom file for invoking maven was trivial in case of eclipse or the command line but not so straight forward when its inside of a package.

way is to make the index list another parameter to the function.  Maintain it as you move down the call tree.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;clean&quot; way is to build it as you return *back* up the tree with a successful result.  Instead of returning a Boolean, return a list of the indices; `None` indicates failure.\r\n\r\nOne important note: do *not* &quot;shadow&quot; a built-in type with a variable name; `set` is both dangerous as a variable name *and* misleading.  Try `coins`, for example.\r\n\r\nBase cases:\r\n\r\n    if (sum == 0) : \r\n        return [n]\r\n    if (n == 0 and sum != 0) : \r\n        return None\r\n\r\nRecursion:\r\n\r\n    include = isSubsetSum(coins, n-1, sum-coins[n-1]):\r\n    if include:\r\n        return include.append(n-1)\r\n\r\nThose are immediate additions for your existing code.  I strongly recommend that you research this problem on line to see how others have solved it.  You waste space and time by passing the entire list and a pointer as parameters; rather, you can start with the last element and work your way back, snipping the end off the list on each call.  This will make your indexing problems much simpler.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417757/return-elements-of-array-in-subset-sum-problem/58418008#58418008","title":"Return elements of array in subset sum problem"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571244132,"creation_date":1571244132,"answer_id":58418043,"question_id":58417757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418043","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s an approach: Instead of `True` and `False` we return the subarray if found, else `None`:\r\n\r\n    def isSubsetSum(sset,n, ssum) : \r\n    \r\n        # Base Cases \r\n        if (ssum == 0) : \r\n            return []\r\n        # not found\r\n        if (n == 0 and ssum != 0) : \r\n            return None\r\n    \r\n        # If last element is greater than sum, then ignore it \r\n        if (sset[n - 1] &gt;

For example the length of a 1-D array is given like:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(a)\r\n    3\r\n\r\nFor a table you could ask what the &quot;size&quot; of a table means--the number of rows?  The number of columns?  The total number of items in the table?  But it sounds like you want the number of *rows*.  In Python, this will almost always be given by `len()` on table-like objects as well (arguably anything that does otherwise is a mistake).  You can consider this by analogy to how you might construct a table-like data structure with simple Python lists, by nesting them:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; t = [\r\n    ...         [1, 2, 3],\r\n    ...         [4, 5, 6],\r\n    ...         [7, 8, 9]\r\n    ...     ]\r\n\r\nHere each &quot;row&quot; is represented by a single list nested in outer lists, so `len(t)` gives th number of rows.  In fact this is just a convention and *can* be broken if need-be.  For example you could also treat the above `t` as list of columns for some column-oriented data.\r\n\r\nBut in Python we typically assume 2-dimensional arrays to be row-oriented unless otherwise stated--to remember you can see that the syntax for a nested list as I wrote above *looks* row-oriented.\r\n\r\nThe logic extends to Numpy arrays and other more complicated data structures built on them such as Astropy&#39;s `Table` or Pandas `DataFrame`s.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417752/astropy-get-table-length/58429959#58429959","title":"Astropy get table length"}],"owner":{"reputation":370,"user_id":3128109,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dad8185d23a2a3e3c0a12ce1fde5f522?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"usernumber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3128109/usernumber"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58429959,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571306575,"creation_date":1571242794,"question_id":58417752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417752","body_markdown":"How can I get the length (i.e. number of rows) of an astropy Table?

Great!\r\n\r\n**The actual question:**\r\nMy main concern here is, that the render prop is obviously a new instance on every re-render. Will this be an issue? Has anyone tried this before?\r\n\r\nAll my google mojo for ErrorBoundary and render-props only brings me to posts about using render-props to render the error rather than the content. So I wonder why no-one ever wrote about this approach or the issue I&#39;m trying to solve here.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a better approach, feel free to post it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417715/errorboundary-using-render-prop-any-concerns-with-this-approach","title":"ErrorBoundary using render prop.. any concerns with this

how is it possible to assign a value to undefined?

How do I do a sweeping code that allows us to convert any column with TRUE FALSE to 1 and 0 without typing 50 lines of `df.somecolumn=df.somecolumn.astype(int)`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417900/data-cleaning-with-pandas-in-python","title":"Data Cleaning with Pandas in Python"},{"tags":["php","regex"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":365176,"user_id":3832970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64323e6cf08401474da3bf770ea13b58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wiktor Stribiżew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832970/wiktor-stribi%c5%bcew"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243507,"post_id":58417899,"comment_id":103178388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417899/regex-replacing-leading-dashes-in-preg-replace-php-7-2#comment103178388_58417899"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11908115,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-txd3ZKHtwzU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfO6CzoXX-mrEABARSmcZYTp0ANHg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tom Friedrichs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908115/tom-friedrichs"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":365176,"user_id":3832970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64323e6cf08401474da3bf770ea13b58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wiktor Stribiżew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832970/wiktor-stribi%c5%bcew"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243723,"post_id":58417899,"comment_id":103178492,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417899/regex-replacing-leading-dashes-in-preg-replace-php-7-2#comment103178492_58417899"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11908115,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-txd3ZKHtwzU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfO6CzoXX-mrEABARSmcZYTp0ANHg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tom Friedrichs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908115/tom-friedrichs"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571243830,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571243447,"creation_date":1571243447,"question_id":58417899,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417899","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to replace leading dashes (all kinds of dashes, not only &#39;-&#39;) with preg_replace.\r\n```\r\n\t$sString = preg_replace(&quot;/(^\\p{Pd})/&quot;,&quot; &quot;, $sString); // all dashes\r\n\t$sString = preg_replace(&quot;/(^\\p{P})/&quot;,&quot; &quot;, $sString); // more special chars\r\n\r\n\t$sString = preg_replace(&quot;/(\\p{Pd}+)$/&quot;,&quot; &quot;, $sString); // trailing dashes, doesn&#39;t work neither\r\n```\r\nThe confusing thing is that it works in [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/r/n4HkNl/1) but not in my code.

The task is to request client data via the Google Analytics Reporting API (v4) and store them to a SQL Backend on a daily basis via an Airflow DAG-structure.\r\n\r\nFor the first account everything works fine.\r\nJust recently I added the second account to the data request routine. \r\nThe problem is that even though both accounts are set to the same &quot;USER-100s&quot; quota limits, I keep getting this error for the newly added account:\r\n\r\n`googleapiclient.errors.HttpError: &lt;HttpError 429 when requesting https://analyticsreporting.googleapis.com/v4/reports:batchGet?alt=json returned &quot;Quota exceeded for quota group &#39;AnalyticsDefaultGroup&#39; and limit &#39;USER-100s&#39; of service &#39;analyticsreporting.googleapis.com&#39; for consumer &#39;project_number:XXXXXXXXXXXX&#39;.&quot;&gt;`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI already set the quota limit &quot;User-100s&quot; from 100 to the maximum of 1000, as recommended in the official Google guidelines (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3/limits-quotas)\r\n\r\nAlso I checked the Google API Console and the number of requests for my project number, but I never exceeded the 1000 requests per 100 seconds so far (see request history account 2), while the first account always works(see request history account 1). Still the above error appeared. \r\n\r\nAlso I could rule out the possibility that the 2nd account&#39;s clients simply have more data.\r\n\r\n[request history account 1][1]\r\n\r\n[request history account 2][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tp76P.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YzMoG.png\r\n\r\nI am now down to a try-except loop that keeps on requesting until the data is eventually queried successfully, like\r\n```python\r\nsuccess = False\r\ndata = None\r\nwhile not success:\r\n    try:\r\n        data = query_data() # trying to receive data from the API\r\n        if data:\r\n            success = True\r\n    except HttpError as e:\r\n        print(e)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not elegant at all and bad for maintaining (like integration tests). In addition, it is very time and resource intensive, because the loop might sometimes run indefinitely.

As long as your target destinations are different in the copy statements, you should be fine injesting data correctly. Pipes in the same regions share the same queue to injest data.

As long as your target table is different in both statements(for both pipes) and does not include purge in any of the pipes, when a file comes int a bucket, it is loaded into both tables gen3_data and gen2_data. You can drop a file and test it out. Let me know if have any problem and we can debug.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n***Q:***\r\nThat is exactly the problem. I want to separate data coming from s3 and for that I have two separate S3 events, hoping snowflake pipes, each can listed to its own event. But both pipes have the same ARN, so separation on this level seems to impossible, or is it?\r\n\r\n***A:***\r\nMaybe I am not understanding this correctly. Do you want to load the same file into both target tables or are you differentiating between files that load into their respective tabes? You can include the prefix in the statement when you are creating the external stage. When a data file is uploaded into the bucket, all pipes that match the stage directory path perform a one-time load of the file into their corresponding target tables.\r\n\r\nFor example: Create two stages\r\nstage for DEV is &quot;`s3://bucket/sub_folder_1`&quot; and for PROD is &quot;`s3://bucket/sub_folder_2`&quot;.\r\n\r\nCreate copy into commands to a target table defined as pointing to respective stages as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n***Q:***\r\nYes, thank you! I figured the solution with prefixes/folders while creating external stages.\r\n\r\nThe initial idea was to utilize two events on s3 side with different prefixes, since we need them for other purposes as well.\r\n\r\nSo there is no way to tell a pipe what queue to listen (ie assign ARN) explicitly, is there?\r\n\r\n***A:***\r\nThat is correct.

Install only Visio 2010 on your development machine (and uninstall 2016). It&#39;s safest to have the lowest version you want your app to run with on your dev machine anyways. Add a reference to Visio 2010&#39;s type library in Excel. Remove the reference to Visio 21016 type library. Visio versions are upward-compatible, so the code should run properly even on the machine with Visio 2016.\r\n\r\nSolution 2. Use late binding. Remove the reference to the Visio from your excel project altogether and use only script-like access. In this case, you will lose auto-completion though. If your app is not a big one, that should not be an issue.\r\n\r\nSolution 3. (if you want to run a specific version).

I believe that part of the problem is the legacy &#39;popup&#39; that is used when the submit button is clicked, I cannot duplicate in any other browsers.\r\n\r\n    import requests\r\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\r\n    consdb_url = &quot;http://192.168.253.85/ConsolidatedProcess.aspx&quot;\r\n\r\n    # this is after logging in\r\n    consdb_content = session.get(consdb_url)\r\n    # print(consdb_content.text)\r\n\r\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(consdb_content.content, &#39;html.parser&#39;)\r\n    payload = {\r\n        &#39;__EVENTARGUMENT&#39;: &#39;&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__EVENTTARGET&#39;: &#39;ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24lbtnSubmit&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__EVENTVALIDATION&#39;: soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;__EVENTVALIDATION&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;__LASTFOCUS&#39;: &#39;&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__VIEWSTATE&#39;: soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;__VIEWSTATE&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;__VIEWSTATEENCRYPTED&#39;: &#39;&#39;,\r\n        &#39;__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR&#39;: soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlFunctionType&#39;: &#39;1&#39;,\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlFunctionTypeSearchSection&#39;: &#39;0&#39;,\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlStatus&#39;: &#39;0&#39;,\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtEndDate&#39;:\r\n            soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtEndDate&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtStartDate&#39;:\r\n            soup.find(&#39;input&#39;, attrs={&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtStartDate&#39;})[&#39;value&#39;],\r\n        &#39;ctl00$ScriptManager1&#39;: &#39;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$lbtnSubmit&#39;\r\n    }\r\n    print(payload)\r\n    post = session.post(consdb_url, data=payload)\r\n   \r\n\r\nJS:\r\n```\r\nfunction ConfirmYesNo(x)\r\n        {\r\n            if (x.disabled == false)\r\n            {\r\n                var yesnoStatus;\r\n                yesnoStatus=  confirm(&quot;Are you Sure?&quot;);\r\n                return yesnoStatus;\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHTML Markup:\r\n```\r\n    &lt;a id=&quot;ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lbtnSubmit&quot; style=&quot;color: white; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;&quot; onclick=&quot;return ConfirmYesNo(this);&quot; href=&#39;javascript:WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions(new WebForm_PostBackOptions(&quot;ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$lbtnSubmit&quot;, &quot;&quot;, true, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, false, true))&#39;&gt;Submit&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the form is submitted via the browser I expect to see a status populated for the specific item:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;span id=&quot;ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_grdVwFunctionTypeTrans_ctl03_lblSuccess&quot;&gt;Successful&lt;/span&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead the request simply returns the same form, as if nothing was submitted.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417816/submit-aspx-form-data-with-python-requests","title":"Submit aspx form data with Python requests"},{"tags":["c#","unit-testing","moq",".net-core-3.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":141442,"user_id":5233410,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ehMg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nkosi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5233410/nkosi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571311659,"post_id":58417815,"comment_id":103203618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417815/moq-callback-for-generic-method-with-func-parameter#comment103203618_58417815"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":4678110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLH9v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Leosvel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4678110/leosvel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46,"user_id":4678110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLH9v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Leosvel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4678110/leosvel"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571320656,"creation_date":1571243091,"last_edit_date":1571320656,"question_id":58417815,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417815","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to setup a Callback on a generic method of a mocked object that receives a generic Func as a parameter.

new to Java, and new to how Java&#39;s compiling stuff works with its Virtual Machine, so please write your answer in simple terms.\r\n\r\nI am using VSCode (on macOS) to make a Java application. I am using `Eclipse New Java Project` to create my projects, which sets up a file structure like so:\r\n\r\n    TestApp\r\n    │\r\n    │-- .vscode\r\n    │-- bin\r\n    ╵-- src\r\n      ╵-- app\r\n        ╵-- App.java\r\n\r\nNow I am able to compile my simple project, and it prints within vscode:\r\n\r\n    package app;\r\n\r\n    public class App {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Hello!&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHow do I now go about running it similar to an application? I have had a long look around, and found things about creating a `.jar` file, but I don&#39;t get what this is doing.\r\n\r\nIs the `.jar` an executable? When I try click on it I get an error, and after searching that up, I saw that you need to add the main class somehow, and I keep getting lots of errors and nothing is working from the many solutions on Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, how do I compile a Java project so I can open it like an app instead of compiling within vscode every time? Is there an option within vscode which makes this `.jar` and stuff for me?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417800/compiling-java-into-application-in-vscode-on-mac","title":"Compiling Java into application in VSCode on Mac"},{"tags":["android","angular","typescript","firebase","ionic-framework"],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10544000,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IVwP_qPh7Fk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbC6Bw5dNsRGJM1AZ1HAavurvV0zGw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10544000/amp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571243014,"creation_date":1571243014,"question_id":58417799,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417799","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating an application that change user status. user status are located inside an array map. each user have their own array map.

Smart Pointers are still dynamic allocation, however they are able to clean themselves up so that you don&#39;t have to remember too.  That&#39;s why they are preferred over using new/delete (malloc/free, etc), they are much less likely to lead to memory leaks.\r\n\r\nAutomatic allocation is fine when the object lifespan allows it, but if you need the object to persist outside of the function it was declared in, you&#39;ll need dynamically allocated memory.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417793/dynamic-allocation-and-large-data-structures-in-c/58420374#58420374","title":"Dynamic allocation and large data structures in C++"}],"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":1716472,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c9bcb26c7a10c77ed39a7ffcfa91bcf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jef Grailet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1716472/jef-grailet"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571253750,"creation_date":1571242995,"question_id":58417793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417793","body_markdown":"Lately, I learned there is a consensus among C++ programmers that the ```new```, ```delete``` and ```delete[]``` operators should be avoided as often as possible, as already discussed [here][1], [here][2] or [here][3]. While searching, I even stumbled upon an [April Fools&#39; joke][4] stating that these operators would become deprecated in C++20.\r\n\r\nI happen to write and maintain a C/C++ program, written in such language in order to carry on useful libraries and classes written by other programmers. As it must run in quite limited environments (i.e., old Linux distributions with the bare minimum in terms of programs), I can&#39;t rely on features brought C++11 and later versions (such as [smart pointers][5]), and I sticked so far to a mix of C and Java programming habits while expanding my program. Among others, I used quite often dynamic allocation with ```new``` and ```delete``` - which sounds, of course, to be a problem.\r\n\r\nTo ease the maintenance of my code by future programmer(s), I would like to minimize dynamic allocation with said keywords in my code. The problem is that my program has to manage some quite large data structures used for (almost) the entire execution. As a consequence, I struggle to figure out why I should avoid dynamic allocation in these situations.\r\n\r\nTo simplify, consider I have a data structure (modeled as an object) worth 10 Megaoctets which is used for the entire execution of the program and which the size in memory can increase over time. My questions are the following:\r\n\r\n* Is dynamic allocation of the object with ```new``` still a bad practice in this particular context ? What are the better alternatives ?\r\n\r\n* Suppose now I instantiate somewhere in my program a new object without using ```new```, do some operations on it which could slightly change its size, then use a method to insert it in my data structure. How does it work, memory-wise, if automatic allocation (as mentioned [here][1]) is used ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6500313/why-should-c-programmers-minimize-use-of-new\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7620385/why-is-it-a-bad-idea-to-use-new\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22146094/why-should-i-use-a-pointer-rather-than-the-object-itself\r\n  [4]: https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/01/cpp-will-no-longer-have-pointers/\r\n  [5]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/106508/what-is-a-smart-pointer-and-when-should-i-use-one","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417793/dynamic-allocation-and-large-data-structures-in-c","title":"Dynamic allocation and large data structures in C++"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pandas","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1670,"user_id":6043544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fafb6acf4f4504b54e7484bc0c17cc7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6043544/oleg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22275,"user_id":3000206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NaBI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carcigenicate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3000206/carcigenicate"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243349,"post_id":58417791,"comment_id":103178306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple#comment103178306_58417791"},{"owner":{"reputation":1670,"user_id":6043544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fafb6acf4f4504b54e7484bc0c17cc7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6043544/oleg"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22275,"user_id":3000206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NaBI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carcigenicate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3000206/carcigenicate"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243385,"post_id":58417791,"comment_id":103178326,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple#comment103178326_58417791"},{"owner":{"reputation":1345,"user_id":10197418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/be8Y6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFuppes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10197418/mrfuppes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571243628,"post_id":58417791,"comment_id":103178437,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple#comment103178437_58417791"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1345,"user_id":10197418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/be8Y6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFuppes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10197418/mrfuppes"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571243907,"creation_date":1571243907,"answer_id":58417997,"question_id":58417791,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58417997","body_markdown":"to get your code\r\n```python\r\nany(x in &#39;MTHLY-&#39;+ row[0] for x in sheetnames)\r\n```\r\nrunning properly, your could obtain the sheets names as\r\n```python\r\nsheetnames = [sheet.title for sheet in wb.worksheets]\r\n```\r\nthat would basically replace your current for loop\r\n```\r\nfor sheet in wb.worksheets:\r\n     sheetnames = sheet\r\n     print(sheetnames)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417791/in-string-requires-string-as-left-operand-not-tuple/58417997#58417997","title":"in &lt;string&gt;&#39;

e.g., with the invocation in your question (had it succeeded), `$PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey(&#39;statustimestamp&#39;)` would indicate `$true`.\r\n\r\n**If you want your parameter value to be `$null` _by omission_**:\r\n\r\nDeclare your parameter simply as `[Datetime] $statustimestamp` and _pass no argument to it_ on invocation; `$statustimestamp` will then *implicitly* be `$null`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Declare a parameter in a script block (which works like a function)\r\n# and invoke the script block without an argument for that parameter:\r\nPS&gt; &amp; { param([Datetime] $statustimestamp) $null -eq $statustimestamp }\r\n\r\nTrue  # $statustimestamp was $null\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**If you want to support _explicitly passing `$null`_ as an argument:**\r\n\r\nThis may be necessary if you declare a _mandatory_ parameter, yet you want to allow `$null` as an explicit signal that a default value should be used.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the **specifics of the parameter declaration currently depend on whether the data type of the parameter is a _reference type_ (such as `[string]` or `[System.IO.FileInfo]`) or a _value type_ (such as `[int]` or `[datetime]`)**.  \r\nYou can inspect a given type&#39;s `.IsValueType` property to learn whether it is a value type (`$true)` or a reference type (`$false`); e.g.: `[datetime].IsValueType` yields `$true`).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the **parameter type is a _reference type_**, you can use the `[AllowNull()]` attribute:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; &amp; { \r\n  param(\r\n    [AllowNull()]\r\n    [Parameter(Mandatory)]\r\n    [System.IO.FileInfo] $Foo  # System.IO.FileInfo is a *reference type*\r\n  )\r\n  $null -eq $Foo \r\n} -Foo $null\r\n\r\nTrue  # $Foo was $null\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the **same technique doesn&#39;t work with _value types_** such as `[DateTime]`, so your **parameter must indeed be typed as `[Nullable[DateTime]`**, as in your question:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; &amp; { \r\n  param(\r\n    [Parameter(Mandatory)]\r\n    [AllowNull()] # Because the parameter is mandatory, this is *also* needed.\r\n    [Nullable[DateTime]] $Foo  # System.DateTime is a *value type*\r\n  )\r\n  $null -eq $Foo \r\n} -Foo $null\r\n\r\nTrue  # $Foo was $null\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: These requirements - needing to pay attention to the difference between value types and reference types and needing to use a `[Nullable[T]]` type - are obscure and uncharacteristic for PowerShell.\r\n\r\n**Doing away with these requirements** in favor of a unified approach (making it work for value types the way it already does for reference types) **is the \r\nsubject of [this proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10817)**.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417780/pass-null-datetime-parameter-in-powershell/58436445#58436445","title":"Pass null datetime parameter in powershell"}],"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":7081415,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9422d2c0e892589f5ad0201875bda15?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alangilbi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7081415/alangilbi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58417820,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571335757,"creation_date":1571242921,"question_id":58417780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417780","body_markdown":"So I have a powershell script that takes region and datetime as input and internally in the script it calls a stored procedure.\r\nThe storeprocedure takes two input region and datetimestamp, the datetimestamp is always null.

They have a lot of functions that come with the software. I think that things like `expand` and `waitForObject` are, but there might be some that are that aren&#39;t as obvious as to what they do. If I haven&#39;t made my question clear enough, I would be more than happy to add as much more detail as needed.\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI&#39;m writing a function library with functions to interact with a window in an app for automated testing. This window consists completely of drop down menus. Most of these windows have almost the same test. Most have &quot;Y - Yes&quot; and &quot;N - No&quot; to select from. Others have &quot;Y - YES&quot; and &quot;N - NO&quot; (don&#39;t get me started on the fact that they&#39;re not the same in the same window). \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve defined objects for all of these drop downs and the options inside the dropdowns but I feel like it would be easiest for other programmers using this library if I set up the functions that interact with these drop downs to use enumerated variables. \r\n\r\nFor example, a function to select a value in drop down one might look something like this:\r\n\r\n    function selectDropDown1(option)\r\n    {\r\n        expand(waitForObject(Field1ComboBox));\r\n        mouseClick(waitForObject(Field1.properties[option].object));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy brain tells me that the default way to do this is to make enumerated variables for each and every drop down menu&#39;s options like this:\r\n\r\n    var Field1 = \r\n    {\r\n        YES: 1,\r\n        NO:  2,\r\n    \r\n        properties:\r\n        {\r\n            1: {name: &quot;Y - Yes&quot;, object: names.Field1ComboBoxItem1},\r\n            2: {name: &quot;N - No&quot;, object: names.Field1ComboBoxItem2}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut since many of these drop down menus have the same options to select from, I feel like there must be a good way to go about defining variables and setting up functions so that I can have a one or two enums that I can use in each function regardless of what field I&#39;m selecting from.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve googled around but I&#39;m not too comfortable with how enums work and I feel like I&#39;m missing some important details that I could be adding to my searches as I&#39;m not getting many useful results. Any help in pointing me in the right direction would be helpful.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a bonus, I&#39;ve been trying to think of a way that I can make this sort of thing work for the different spellings of the drop down options except that most of the objects are defined by their text.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417778/creating-enumerated-variables-for-different-drop-down-fields-in-the-same-window","title":"Creating enumerated variables for different drop down fields in the same window"},{"tags":["java","algorithm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571244292,"post_id":58417774,"comment_id":103178763,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417774/writing-a-long-division-method#comment103178763_58417774"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12135212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/965930607081476/picture?type=large","display_name":"Matin Tahmasebpour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135212/matin-tahmasebpour"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":133,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571243857,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571242899,"creation_date":1571242899,"question_id":58417774,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417774","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to write a long division method in java, this is what I have so far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        public MyBigInteger dividedBy( MyBigInteger  divisor ) throws Exception{\r\n\t\t//if bases are different , throw exception \r\n\t\tif (this.base != divisor.base){\r\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(&quot;Bases must be the same in dividedBy method&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger quotient = new MyBigInteger(0,base);\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger remainder = this.clone();\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger compare=new MyBigInteger(this.base) ;\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger divide=divisor.clone();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\twhile(remainder.compareTo(divisor)&gt;=0) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tint sizeR= this.coefficients.size();\r\n\t\t\tint sizeD=divisor.coefficients.size();\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\tfor(int i=sizeD;i&gt;0;i--) {\r\n\t\t\tcompare.coefficients.add(Integer.valueOf(remainder.coefficients.get(sizeR-i)));\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tif (divisor.compareTo(compare)&lt;0) {\r\n\t\t\tcompare.coefficients.add(Integer.valueOf(remainder.coefficients.get(sizeR-sizeD-1)));\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tquotient=quotient.plus(compare.slowdividedBy(divisor));\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tint sizeC=compare.coefficients.size();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tfor(int j=0;j&lt;sizeR-sizeC;j++) {\r\n\t\t\tdivide.coefficients.add(0);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tremainder=remainder.minus(divide.times(quotient));\r\n\t\t\t\tdivide=divisor;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\treturn quotient;\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\nbut it doesn&#39;t work and I can&#39;t find my problem \r\n\r\nthere are other classes that I used in my method.\r\n\r\n      public MyBigInteger slowdividedBy( MyBigInteger  divisor) throws Exception{\r\n\r\n\t\tif (this.base != divisor.base){\r\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(&quot;Bases must be the same in slowdividedBy method&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger one = new MyBigInteger(1,base);\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger quotient = new MyBigInteger(0,base);\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger remainder = this.clone();\r\n\t\twhile ( remainder.compareTo(divisor) &gt;= 0 ){\r\n\t\t\tremainder = remainder.minus(divisor);\r\n\t\t\tquotient = quotient.plus(one);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn quotient;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic MyBigInteger  minus(MyBigInteger second) throws Exception{\r\n\r\n\t\t//  initialize the result as an empty list of coefficients\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMyBigInteger  result = new MyBigInteger(this.base);\r\n\r\n\t\tif (this.base != second.base){\r\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(&quot;Bases must be the same in minus method.&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t/*\r\n\t\t *    The minus method is not supposed to change the numbers. \r\n\t\t *    But the grade school algorithm sometimes requires us to &quot;borrow&quot;\r\n\t\t *    from a higher coefficient to a lower one.

am running a set of tests using junit and I have created a maven project for it. I use the surefire plugin to run the tests. I wanted to package this project as a self executable jar for the sake of convenience.So I placed all of test classes in the src/main/java directory as recommended for using the maven shade plugin for generating an uber jar. I created a class with a main method and use maven invoker to execute my tests. \r\nThe tests get executed perfectly when I use my ide to run the main method. However, after I package it as a jar , the invoker is unable to locate the pom.xml. If I place a copy of the pom.xml in the same directory as the jar, maven is invoked but it is unable to execute the tests as surefire is unable to locate the tests. \r\n\r\nI would love to know if there is a solution for this or if there is a better approach towards trying to achieve my goal. \r\n\r\n@khmarbaise and everyone else trying to help me , let me describe my scenario a little more in detail. \r\nLets take any api , for example , lastfm api, I would be writing classes for each api end point and every method in each class would be a test. I use junit to execute the tests. I use a junit wrapper called serenity bdd that helps me structure my tests and generate aggregate reports. The maven goal serenity:aggregate would generate an aggregated report of all tests. I am using the maven invoker to run  tests using surefire plugin and then aggregate the tests using serenity. In my eclipse project I simply create a maven run configuration and provide the maven goals. Or else I would use the terminal to run maven from my project base directory. \r\nApart from my class file, I have several resources, like csv files which are inputs for parametric tests a log folder where all log files that are generated get saved and other sample files for testing file upload apis.  I felt that it would be simple to package all of this as a jar and let my developers add this jar as a dependency and run a simple script which runs the jar each time they create and deploy a build. Getting the pom file for invoking maven was trivial in case of eclipse or the command line but not so straight forward when its inside of a package.

way is to make the index list another parameter to the function.  Maintain it as you move down the call tree.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;clean&quot; way is to build it as you return *back* up the tree with a successful result.  Instead of returning a Boolean, return a list of the indices; `None` indicates failure.\r\n\r\nOne important note: do *not* &quot;shadow&quot; a built-in type with a variable name; `set` is both dangerous as a variable name *and* misleading.  Try `coins`, for example.\r\n\r\nBase cases:\r\n\r\n    if (sum == 0) : \r\n        return [n]\r\n    if (n == 0 and sum != 0) : \r\n        return None\r\n\r\nRecursion:\r\n\r\n    include = isSubsetSum(coins, n-1, sum-coins[n-1]):\r\n    if include:\r\n        return include.append(n-1)\r\n\r\nThose are immediate additions for your existing code.  I strongly recommend that you research this problem on line to see how others have solved it.  You waste space and time by passing the entire list and a pointer as parameters; rather, you can start with the last element and work your way back, snipping the end off the list on each call.  This will make your indexing problems much simpler.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417757/return-elements-of-array-in-subset-sum-problem/58418008#58418008","title":"Return elements of array in subset sum problem"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571244132,"creation_date":1571244132,"answer_id":58418043,"question_id":58417757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418043","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s an approach: Instead of `True` and `False` we return the subarray if found, else `None`:\r\n\r\n    def isSubsetSum(sset,n, ssum) : \r\n    \r\n        # Base Cases \r\n        if (ssum == 0) : \r\n            return []\r\n        # not found\r\n        if (n == 0 and ssum != 0) : \r\n            return None\r\n    \r\n        # If last element is greater than sum, then ignore it \r\n        if (sset[n - 1] &gt;

For example the length of a 1-D array is given like:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(a)\r\n    3\r\n\r\nFor a table you could ask what the &quot;size&quot; of a table means--the number of rows?  The number of columns?  The total number of items in the table?  But it sounds like you want the number of *rows*.  In Python, this will almost always be given by `len()` on table-like objects as well (arguably anything that does otherwise is a mistake).  You can consider this by analogy to how you might construct a table-like data structure with simple Python lists, by nesting them:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; t = [\r\n    ...         [1, 2, 3],\r\n    ...         [4, 5, 6],\r\n    ...         [7, 8, 9]\r\n    ...     ]\r\n\r\nHere each &quot;row&quot; is represented by a single list nested in outer lists, so `len(t)` gives th number of rows.  In fact this is just a convention and *can* be broken if need-be.  For example you could also treat the above `t` as list of columns for some column-oriented data.\r\n\r\nBut in Python we typically assume 2-dimensional arrays to be row-oriented unless otherwise stated--to remember you can see that the syntax for a nested list as I wrote above *looks* row-oriented.\r\n\r\nThe logic extends to Numpy arrays and other more complicated data structures built on them such as Astropy&#39;s `Table` or Pandas `DataFrame`s.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417752/astropy-get-table-length/58429959#58429959","title":"Astropy get table length"}],"owner":{"reputation":370,"user_id":3128109,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dad8185d23a2a3e3c0a12ce1fde5f522?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"usernumber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3128109/usernumber"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58429959,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571306575,"creation_date":1571242794,"question_id":58417752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417752","body_markdown":"How can I get the length (i.e. number of rows) of an astropy Table?

Great!\r\n\r\n**The actual question:**\r\nMy main concern here is, that the render prop is obviously a new instance on every re-render. Will this be an issue? Has anyone tried this before?\r\n\r\nAll my google mojo for ErrorBoundary and render-props only brings me to posts about using render-props to render the error rather than the content. So I wonder why no-one ever wrote about this approach or the issue I&#39;m trying to solve here.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a better approach, feel free to post it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417715/errorboundary-using-render-prop-any-concerns-with-this-approach","title":"ErrorBoundary using render prop.. any concerns with this

how is it possible to assign a value to undefined? As I understand, undefined is a primitive type in js, then what is the meaning of undefined = true;?  \r\n  \r\nYou are right, `undefined` is a primitive type, but it isn&#39;t a [*literal*][1].  \r\n  \r\nWhen you access `undefined`, you are accessing a property in the global object.  \r\n  \r\nBefore ES5, this property was writable, and it could be overridden.  \r\n  \r\nBut since ES5, it [was defined as *not writable*](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.1.1.3), and now it cannot be changed.  \r\n\r\nNot being a literal like [`null`][2], [`true` or `false`][3], makes possible to use `undefined` as a binding name for a variable, a parameter on a function or the name of a function, but not in the global scope. It will clash with the built-in `undefined`.  \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n    (function () {\r\n      &#39;use strict&#39;;  \r\n      const undefined = &#39;some value&#39;;  \r\n      console.log(undefined); // &quot;some value&quot;  \r\n    })();\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)\r\n  [2]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/#prod-NullLiteral\r\n  [3]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/#sec-boolean-literals","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417711/javascript-is-is-possible-to-assign-a-value-to-undefined-a-question-from-yo/58417803#58417803","title":"javascript: Is is possible to assign a value to &#39;undefined&#39;?
