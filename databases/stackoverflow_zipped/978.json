Unfortunately, I don&#39;t see such a field in the [docs][2] and [it doesn&#39;t seem to have a way to do this (yet)][3]. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want to rely on updating the invoice after the first time I receive the invoice webhook due to possible race conditions (if the user changes the plan before I receive the webhook, especially in the case when Stripe tries to send the webhook and it fails somehow, and the user changes the subscription plan in the meantime).\r\n\r\n**So I would like to know if someone was able to achieve this** (in a **reliable** way, not through webhooks or updating the invoice **after** it is created) **and how**. \r\n\r\nThe only way I see this would be possible at the moment is with data from the invoice itself, and the only way I see that is with the `lines` field, **retrieving the last line item and using its plan as the invoice plan**.

      if _oper(getattr(obj, _kw), kwargs[kw])\r\n                )\r\n            if mode == &#39;and&#39;:\r\n                if n_objects:\r\n                    ok_objects = ok_objects.intersection(n_objects)\\\r\n                        if ok_objects else set(n_objects)\r\n                else:\r\n                    return set()\r\n\r\n            else:\r\n                ok_objects.update(n_objects)\r\n        return ok_objects\r\n\r\n    # feel free to add a `get_or_create`, `create`, etc. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you attach an instance of this class as attribute to your `MyData` class and make sure all new objects are added to it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyData:\r\n    # initiate the object manager\r\n    objects = ObjectManager()\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, uid, name, color):\r\n        self.uid = uid\r\n        self.name = name\r\n        self.color = color\r\n\r\n        # populate the list of query-able attributes on creation\r\n        # of the first instance\r\n        if not len(self.objects):\r\n            self.objects.set_attributes(self)\r\n        # add any new instance to the object manager\r\n        self.objects.add(self)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can import your feature vector:\r\n```python\r\nDATA = [\r\n    {&#39;uid&#39;: 1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;brad&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;red&#39;},\r\n    {&#39;uid&#39;: 2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;sylvia&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\r\n]\r\nfor dat in DATA:\r\n    myData(**dat)\r\n```\r\nor create new instances:\r\n```python\r\nd1 = MyData(uid=10, name=&#39;john&#39;, color=&#39;yellow&#39;)\r\n```\r\nand make use of the manager to filter your objects:\r\n```python\r\nprint([md.name for md in MyData.objects.filter(uid__ge=10)])\r\n# &gt; [&#39;john&#39;]\r\nprint([md.name for md in MyData.objects.filter(mode=&#39;and&#39;,uid__ge=1,name__eq=&#39;john&#39;)])\r\n# &gt; [&#39;john&#39;]\r\nprint([md.name for md in MyData.objects.filter(mode=&#39;or&#39;,uid__le=4,name__eq=&#39;john&#39;)])\r\n# &gt; [&#39;john&#39;, &#39;brad&#39;, &#39;sylvia&#39;]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you cannot or don&#39;t want to change the class you want an object manager for, and you are willing to monkey patch around (note that I&#39;m **not** advertising this!) you can even create a `ObjectManager` that can be hooked to an arbitrary class (built-in types won&#39;t work though) after definition or even initiation of some instances.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to monkey patch `__init__` of the target class and add the `objects` attribute upon init of an instance of your `ObjectManager`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport gc\r\nimport inspect\r\nimport collections\r\nimport operator\r\nimport wrapt  # not standard lib &gt; pip install wrapt\r\n\r\nclass ObjectManager(collections.MutableSet):\r\n    def __init__(self, attach_to):\r\n        self._object_attributes = None\r\n        # add self as class attribute\r\n        attach_to.objects = self\r\n        # monkey patch __init__ of your target class\r\n        @wrapt.patch_function_wrapper(attach_to, &#39;__init__&#39;)\r\n        def n_init(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):\r\n            wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\r\n            c_objects = instance.__class__.objects\r\n            if not c_objects:\r\n                c_objects.set_attributes(instance)\r\n            c_objects.add(instance)\r\n        # make sure to be up to date with the existing instances\r\n        self._theset = set(obj for obj in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(obj, attach_to))\r\n        # already fetch the attributes if instances exist\r\n        if self._theset:\r\n            self.set_attributes(next(iter(self._theset)))\r\n        ...\r\n        # the rest is identical to the version above\r\n```\r\nSo now this is how you would use it:\r\n```python\r\nclass MyData:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, uid, name, color):\r\n        self.uid = uid\r\n        self.name = name\r\n        self.color = color\r\n\r\n# create some instances\r\nDATA = [\r\n    {&#39;uid&#39;: 1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;brad&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;red&#39;},\r\n    {&#39;uid&#39;: 2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;sylvia&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\r\n]\r\nmy_datas = []\r\nfor dat in DATA:\r\n    my_datas.append(myData(**dat))  # appending them just to have a reference\r\n# say that ONLY NOW you decide you want to use an object manager\r\n# Simply do:\r\nObjectManager(MyData)\r\n# and you are done:\r\nprint([md.name for md in MyData.objects.filter(mode=&#39;or&#39;,uid__le=4,name__eq=&#39;john&#39;)])\r\n# &gt; [&#39;brad&#39;, &#39;sylvia&#39;]\r\n# also any object you create from now on is included:\r\nd1 = MyData(uid=10, name=&#39;john&#39;, color=&#39;yellow&#39;)\r\nprint([md.name for md in MyData.objects.filter(mode=&#39;or&#39;,uid__le=4,name__eq=&#39;john&#39;)])\r\n# &gt; [&#39;brad&#39;, &#39;sylvia&#39;, &#39;john&#39;]\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309731/doing-class-objects-filter-pattern-in-python/58349504#58349504","title":"Doing Class.objects.filter(...) pattern in

So from a learning point of view it might be interesting.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to use Django to read the data, that is in your list, then this would probably be much better concerning Django compatibility as my code.\r\nIt all depends on what your goal is.

If we can stop the evaluation for now, we can pass the expression unevaluated to the `filter` function.\r\n\r\nBut we can delay expression evaluation until required if we enclose the expression in a function. That&#39;s the idea.\r\n\r\nThe function interface would be `filter(lambda: id &gt; 1)` if we could implement it.\r\nThis interface will be super versatile because any Python expression can be passed and abused.\r\n\r\nThe implementation;\r\n\r\nif we invoke the lambda or any other function with the expression `id &gt; 1`, Python looks up the name `id` in the local, enclosing, global scope or `builtins` depending on the context where the function is invoked.\r\n\r\nIf we can introduce an object with the name `id` somewhere in the look-up path before Python finds `id` in the `builtins` we can redefine the semantics of the expression.  \r\n\r\nI&#39;m gonna do it with `eval` which evaluates expressions in the given context.\r\n\r\n    DATA = [\r\n        {&#39;id&#39;: 1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;brad&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;red&#39;},\r\n        {&#39;id&#39;: 2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;sylvia&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    def myfilter(a_lambda):\r\n        return filter(lambda obj: eval(a_lambda.__code__, obj.copy()),\r\n        DATA)\r\n\r\nI pass a `dict.copy` to `eval` because `eval` modifies it&#39;s `globals` object.\r\n\r\nSee it in action in the context of `Model` class\r\n\r\n    In [1]: class Data(Model):\r\n       ...:     name = str()\r\n       ...:     id = int()\r\n       ...:     color = str()\r\n       ...: \r\n    \r\n    In [2]: Data.objects.create(**{&quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;brad&quot;, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;red&quot;})\r\n    \r\n    In [3]:     Data.objects.create(**{&quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;sylvia&quot;, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;blue&quot;})\r\n    \r\n    In [4]:     Data.objects.create(**{&quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;paul&quot;, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;red&quot;})\r\n    \r\n    In [5]:     Data.objects.create(**{&quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;brandon&quot;, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;yello&quot;})\r\n    \r\n    In [6]:     Data.objects.create(**{&quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;martin&quot;, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;green&quot;})\r\n    \r\n    In [7]:     Data.objects.create(**{&quot;id&quot;: 6, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;annie&quot;, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;gray&quot;})\r\n    \r\n    In [8]: pprint([vars(obj) for obj in Data.objects.filter(lambda: id == 1)])\r\n    [{&#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;brad&#39;}]\r\n     \r\n    In [9]: pprint([vars(obj) for obj in Data.objects.filter(lambda: 1 &lt;= id &lt;= 2)])\r\n    [{&#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;brad&#39;},\r\n     {&#39;color&#39;: &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;sylvia&#39;}]\r\n    \r\n    In [10]: pprint([vars(obj) for obj in Data.objects.filter(lambda: color == &quot;blue&quot;)])\r\n    [{&#39;color&#39;: &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;sylvia&#39;}]\r\n     \r\n    In [11]: pprint([vars(obj) for obj in Data.objects.filter(lambda: &quot;e&quot; in color and (name is &quot;brad&quot; or name is &quot;sylvia&quot;))])\r\n    [{&#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;brad&#39;},\r\n     {&#39;color&#39;: &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;sylvia&#39;}]\r\n     \r\n    In [12]: pprint([vars(obj) for obj in Data.objects.filter(lambda: id % 2 == 1)])\r\n    [{&#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;brad&#39;},\r\n     {&#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 3, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;paul&#39;},\r\n     {&#39;color&#39;: &#39;green&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: 5, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;martin&#39;}]\r\n The `Data` class inherits from `Model`. The `Model` gives `Data` the `__init__` method and a class attribute named `objects` that points to a `MetaManager` instance which is a descriptor. \r\n\r\nThe `MetaManager` returns a `Manager` instance to sub classes of `Model` upon access of `objects` attribute from the subclass. The `MetaManger` identifies the accessing class and passes that to the `Manager` instance.\r\nThe `Manager` handles object creation, persistence and fetch.\r\n\r\nThe db is implemented as a class attribute of `Manager` for simplicity. \r\n\r\nTo stop abuse with global objects via functions the `filter` function raises an exception if a lambda is not passed.\r\n\r\n    from collections import defaultdict\r\n    from collections.abc import Callable\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class MetaManager:\r\n        def __get__(self, obj, objtype):\r\n            if obj is None:\r\n                return Manager(objtype)\r\n            else:\r\n                raise AttributeError(\r\n                    &quot;Manger isn&#39;t accessible via {} instances&quot;.format(objtype)\r\n                )\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class Manager:\r\n        _store = defaultdict(list)\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self, client):\r\n            self._client = client\r\n            self._client_name = &quot;{}.{}&quot;.format(client.__module__, client.__qualname__)\r\n    \r\n        def create(self, **kwargs):\r\n            self._store[self._client_name].append(self._client(**kwargs))\r\n    \r\n        def all(self):\r\n            return (obj for obj in self._store[self._client_name])\r\n    \r\n        def filter(self, a_lambda):\r\n            if a_lambda.__code__.co_name != &quot;&lt;lambda&gt;&quot;:\r\n                raise ValueError(&quot;a lambda required&quot;)\r\n    \r\n            return (\r\n                obj\r\n                for obj in self._store[self._client_name]\r\n\r\n                if eval(a_lambda.__code__, vars(obj).copy())\r\n            )\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class Model:\r\n        objects = MetaManager()\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self, **kwargs):\r\n            if type(self) is Model:\r\n                raise NotImplementedError\r\n    \r\n            class_attrs = self.__get_class_attributes(type(self))\r\n    \r\n            self.__init_instance(class_attrs, kwargs)\r\n    \r\n        def __get_class_attributes(self, cls):\r\n            attrs = vars(cls)\r\n            if &quot;objects&quot;

Two threads have access to the same variable, and they are both modifying the variable. The outcome of your program depends on which one reaches the code that changes the variable first.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible solutions, depending on how you want the problem to be resolved:\r\n\r\n1. **If you don&#39;t need all threads to share the same value**, or if the object is small and cheap to copy, make a copy of the variable you are passing before you pass it, by passing `deepcopy(embed)` instead of `embed` - see [the solution posted by @user1438644](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58309927/463213) for code.\r\n\r\n2. **If you want all threads to share the same value**, or if it is expensive to make copies of the object, you will need to create a lock with `my_lock = threading.Lock()`, and when you get to the race condition part of your program (i.e., the part that modifies the shared variable), surround it with a context manager `with my_lock:`, which acquires the lock at the start and returns the lock when finished.

Clearly, the database needs to tell you how it wants to refer to the chicken.\r\n\r\nIn Postgres, you can simply use Knex&#39;s `.returning` function to make it explicit that you want the new row&#39;s `id` column returned to you after a successful insert. That&#39;ll make the first part of your query look like this:\r\n```\r\nknexInstance\r\n  .insert(newUser)\r\n  .into(&#39;users&#39;)\r\n  .returning(&#39;id&#39;)\r\n```\r\n_Note: not all databases support this in the same way. In particular, if you happen to be developing locally using SQLite, it will return the **number of rows affected by the query**, not the id, since SQLite doesn&#39;t support SQL&#39;s `RETURNING`. Best is just to develop locally using Postgres to avoid nasty surprises._\r\n\r\nOk, so we know which chicken we&#39;re after. Now we need to make sure we&#39;ve waited for the right id, then go ahead and use it:\r\n```\r\n.then(([ userId ]) =&gt; knexInstance\r\n  .insert({ user_id: userId,\r\n            date: knex.fn.now(),\r\n            amount: userConstants.INITIAL_QUOTA_AMOUNT })\r\n  .into(&#39;quotas&#39;)\r\n)\r\n```\r\nOr however you choose to populate that second table.\r\n\r\n_Note: `DATE` is a SQL keyword. For that reason, it doesn&#39;t make a great column name. How about `created` or `updated` instead?_\r\n\r\n## Responding with sensible data\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s basic &quot;I have the ID, let&#39;s insert to another table&quot; strategy. However, you actually want to be able to respond with the user that was created... this seems like sensible API behaviour for a 201 response.\r\n\r\nWhat you _don&#39;t_ want to do is respond with the entire user record from the database, which will expose the password hash (as you&#39;re doing in your first code block from your question). Ideally, you&#39;d probably like to respond with some UI-friendly combination of both tables.\r\n\r\nLuckily, `.returning` also accepts an array argument. This allows us to pass a list of columns we&#39;d like to respond with, reducing the risk of accidentally exposing something to the API surface that we&#39;d rather not transmit.\r\n```\r\nconst userColumns = [ &#39;id&#39;, &#39;username&#39;, &#39;glasses&#39; ]\r\nconst quotaColumns = [ &#39;amount&#39; ]\r\n\r\nknexInstance\r\n  .insert(newUser)\r\n  .into(&#39;users&#39;)\r\n  .returning(userColumns)\r\n  .then(([ user]) =&gt; knexInstance\r\n    .insert({\r\n      user_id: user.id,\r\n      date: knex.fn.now(),\r\n      amount: userConstants.INITIAL_QUOTA_AMOUNT\r\n    })\r\n    .into(&#39;quotas&#39;)\r\n    .returning(quotaColumns)\r\n    .then(([ quota ]) =&gt; res.status(201)\r\n      .json({\r\n        ...user,\r\n        ...quota\r\n      })\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Async/await for readability\r\n\r\nThese days, I&#39;d probably avoid a promise chain like that in favour of the syntactic sugar that `await` provides us.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n  const [ user ] = await knexInstance\r\n    .insert(newUser)\r\n    .into(&#39;users&#39;)\r\n    .returning(userColumns)\r\n  const [ quota ] = await knexInstance\r\n    .insert({\r\n      user_id: userId,\r\n      date: knex.fn.now(),\r\n      amount: userConstants.INITIAL_QUOTA_AMOUNT\r\n    })\r\n    .into(&#39;quotas&#39;)\r\n    .returning(quotaColumns)\r\n\r\n  res\r\n    .status(201)\r\n    .json({\r\n      ...user,\r\n      ...quota\r\n    })\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n  next(Error(&quot;Something went wrong while inserting a user!&quot;))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## A note on transactions\r\n\r\nThere are a few assumptions here, but one big one: we assume that both inserts will be successful. Sure, we provide some error handling, but there&#39;s still the possibility that the first insert will succeed, and the second fail or time out for some reason.\r\n\r\nTypically, we&#39;d do multiple insertions in a transaction block. Here&#39;s how Knex handles this:\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n  const userResponse = await knexInstance.transaction(async tx =&gt; {  \r\n    const [ user ] = await tx.insert(...)\r\n    const [ quota ] = await tx.insert(...)\r\n    return {\r\n      ...user,\r\n      ...quota\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  res\r\n    .status(201)\r\n    .json(userResponse)\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n  next(Error(&#39;...&#39;))\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is good general practice for multiple inserts that depend on each other, since it sets up an &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach: if something fails, the database will go back to its previous state.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309710/insert-into-relationship-table-using-id-created-at-user-registration/58311819#58311819","title":"Insert into relationship table using id created at user registration"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11278781,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10218295197673363/picture?type=large","display_name":"TecDvr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11278781/tecdvr"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3515,"user_id":122643,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b8d53dbc30a2db40a85586731e8c5bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rich Churcher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/122643/rich-churcher"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58311819,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570663744,"creation_date":1570643686,"last_edit_date":1570663744,"question_id":58309710,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58309710","body_markdown":"I have two tables as seen below\r\n\r\n![tables in database][1]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbF1h.png\r\n\r\nThe first table is for users and is populated via a registration form on the client side.

I don&#39;t know that why the object loaded from binary data go to fixed position like (-1.072, -0.685, 0) instead what I saved. Much strange thing is, that I already check the position of variable ```load```, Vector3 of ```input``` and Vector3 data before data saved, are really same. Even ```Debug.Log``` said that this object makes proper position but that&#39;s not same position before saving in game scene.\r\nI, really don&#39;t know about this. This makes me very nervous. plz help me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309701/in-unity-instantiate-object-from-binary-data-already-saved-have-problem","title":"In Unity, Instantiate object from Binary Data already saved have problem"},{"tags":["angular","angular-changedetection"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12092038,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GWT2RTE-lfA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf6mLbBuG1i5sj_azNT1d35ITzWYA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Loy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092038/loy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570646179,"creation_date":1570646179,"answer_id":58310280,"question_id":58309696,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58310280","body_markdown":"Not sure but it might be worth looking towards ngZone.runOutsideAngular ().

like to know why I need to cast both my visitable object and my visitor to dynamics in order for double dispatch to work without repeated overloads of the Accept method. If I cast either to dynamic but not the other, the generic base class&#39;s visit method is called. But if I cast both, then sub-classes&#39; visit methods are called.\r\n\r\nI have implemented the standard visitor pattern with generics. I have a visitor interface as follows:\r\n\r\n    public interface ITreeVisitorVoid&lt;TPayload&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        void Visit(ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt; tree);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have a base implementation of the visitor interface:\r\n\r\n    public abstract class TreeVisitorVoidBase&lt;TPayload&gt; : BaseClass, ITreeVisitorVoid&lt;TPayload&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        protected virtual void DefaultOperation(ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt; tree) { }\r\n\r\n        public virtual void Visit(ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt; tree)\r\n        {\r\n            DoOpAndVisitAllChildren(tree, DefaultOperation);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected void DoOpAndVisitAllChildren(ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt; tree, Action&lt;ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt;&gt; operation)\r\n        {\r\n            operation(tree);\r\n            IEnumerable&lt;ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt;&gt; children = tree.Children;\r\n            foreach (ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt; child in children)\r\n            {\r\n                child.Accept(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd I have a base Tree class which has an accept method:\r\n\r\n        public virtual void Accept(ITreeVisitorVoid&lt;TPayload&gt; visitor)\r\n        {\r\n            (visitor as dynamic).Visit(this as dynamic);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIf I cast just one or none of the objects to a dynamic, then the base Visit method is always called. Only when I cast both will the overloading happen dynamically at runtime. In other words this won&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n            (visitor as dynamic).Visit(this);\r\n\r\nNeither will this:\r\n\r\n            visitor.Visit(this as dynamic);\r\n\r\nBased on some reading I did I can see that overload resolution happens at compile time for non-dynamic types. \r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6789783/overload-resolution-of-virtual-methods\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/42587/double-dispatch-in-c\r\n\r\nNow, I understand why, based on that reading, the object `this` must be cast to a dynamic- otherwise the overload will resolve at compile time and we&#39;re doomed. However, I&#39;m a little confused as to why the cast on the visitor calling object itself is necessary. I thought polymorphism would give me that for free. Of course, the sub-classes don&#39;t truly *override* the Visit method, so I&#39;m guessing something like this is happening:\r\n\r\n - At compile time, the tree is a dynamic, but the visitor is typed as the base class `ITreeVisitorVoid&lt;TPayload&gt;`.\r\n\r\n - This base class only has a Visit method defined over the base tree type `ITreeBase&lt;TPayload&gt;`\r\n\r\n - At runtime, then, the base visitor class&#39;s visit method is called. But since it is marked virtual, some &quot;overrides&quot; table is checked to see if there&#39;s an override. Which there isn&#39;t.\r\n\r\n - So since an override isn&#39;t found, the base method is used\r\n\r\n - Meanwhile, any over-*loaded* Visit method in a subclass is overlooked\r\n\r\n - On the other hand, when the visitor itself is cast to a dynamic, it forces the program to look at *all* visit methods defined on the `runtime` type. Which will then pick up any overloads that exist.\r\n\r\n&gt; So My Question Can Be Equivalently Stated as: Is the above explanation\r\n&gt; correct? And if not, what is going on?\r\n\r\nAn example of such an overload in my codebase, buried a couple of levels down the in the hierarchy, is the following:\r\n\r\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n    /// Count only the leaf nodes of the tree in question, not the intermediate nodes\r\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n    class LeaftCounterVisitorImpl&lt;TPayload&gt; : NodeCounterVisitorBase&lt;TPayload&gt;, INodeCounterVisitor&lt;TPayload&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        public virtual void Visit(ILeafBase&lt;TPayload&gt; leaf)\r\n        {\r\n            if (leaf == null)\r\n            {\r\n                Log.ErrorFormat(&quot;Skipping over null leaf during leaf counting operation&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            Count++;\r\n        }\r\n

I was under the impression that const variables cannot be edited. How would I go about this?\r\n\r\nAs others have pointed out, you can&#39;t, at least not directly. And it&#39;s not good programming to even try.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;Here are the directions for m_vin which is a member variable of an Object named Vehicle: m_vin, a const int which represent a unique VIN–Vehicle Identification Number (no two vehicles can ever exist with the same m_vin).\r\n\r\nMost likely your instructor is asking you to construct different objects with differing `const int m_vin`. If you do that you don&#39;t need to edit them after construction since each object is initialized with a different vin.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; In my program I am required to edit m_vin;\r\n\r\nHowever, assuming this is sort of a programming challenge, you can change a const member variable by instantiating a new object initialized with the different value. This is best done in a friend function so you can access private variables.\r\n\r\nOne way to accomplish this is using placement new together with a constructor that has all values needed to initialize the object. First save copies of all the values in the object locally. Use `std::move` for dynamic values. Next, call the destructor on the object. Then use placement new with the argument list needed to reconstruct the object with the new const value.\r\n\r\nThe following code replaces m_vin with a different value.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;memory&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    struct Foo {\r\n        const int m_vin;\r\n        std::string stuff;\r\n        Foo(int m_vin_, std::string stuff_) : m_vin{ m_vin_ }, stuff{ stuff_ } {}\r\n        ~Foo() {}\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        Foo foo1(1, &quot;SomeString&quot;);\r\n        int ci = 42  // modify ci\r\n        std::string stuff = foo1.stuff;\r\n        foo1.~Foo();                // in case there is any dynamic objects in Foo\r\n        new(&amp;foo1) Foo(ci, stuff);\r\n        std::string x = foo1.stuff;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nBut be warned. You should also use `std::launder` to guarantee the const member will be correctly read. This sort of hack, while legal (I think), harms the readability of the code. People reading the code will, reasonably, assume that const member variables will not change after they are constructed. So don&#39;t do it other than to pacify an instructor with a weird request.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309690/easiest-way-to-modify-a-const-variables-value/58313067#58313067","title":"Easiest way to modify a const variable&#39;s value"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12022312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b879edb41536a81ebe8d8d0a9b2a6dfa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MichaelConnors1017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12022312/michaelconnors1017"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12022312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b879edb41536a81ebe8d8d0a9b2a6dfa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MichaelConnors1017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12022312/michaelconnors1017"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":6,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571023089,"creation_date":1570643606,"last_edit_date":1570649127,"question_id":58309690,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58309690","body_markdown":"For my CS class I have a variable ```const int m_vin```, throughout my code I am required to edit this value.

Let&#39;s assume there is a single endpoint, and the result is a _very_ large JSON document (multiple gigabytes).\r\n\r\nOne the one hand, I&#39;m streaming my response to the client using http chunked encoding. This allows me to not hold the entire response object in python all at once - i can serialize and send chunks of the json at a time. (Side note, I plan to use https://jsonlines.org to avoid the json envelope in the near future.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I&#39;d like to use nginx proxy caching to hold the entire response on disk, and when the same request comes in, I don&#39;t have to stress the python server since nginx can just serve the static file from disk.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my question: `proxy_buffering` within nginx appears to be required to be `on` for nginx response caching to work, but `off` for chunked encoding (streaming) response to stream immediately. I can&#39;t seem to find if nginx has a buffer size that flushes the buffer to the client (and the cache) every so often - I&#39;d be very happy for a pointer to that information.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get both of the things I want here? Serving a streaming response, but caching that entire response for the next request? Should I explore other options, like varnish?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for any help/advice/pointers!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309640/nginx-streaming-response-to-client-but-also-caching","title":"nginx - streaming response to client, but also caching"},{"tags":["php"],"owner":{"reputation":1868,"user_id":607846,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/969d957d597e253d658a5f6cce8b6123?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Baz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/607846/baz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570643561,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570643388,"creation_date":1570643388,"question_id":58309639,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58309639","body_markdown":"    $surnames = array(&quot;Smith.png&quot;,&quot;&#211; R&#237;.png&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    $surnames2 = array();\r\n    foreach ($surnames as $i) \r\n        array_push($surnames2,pathinfo($i, PATHINFO_FILENAME));\r\n    \r\n    echo var_dump($surnames);\r\n    echo var_dump($surnames2);\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    array(2) {\r\n      [0]=&gt;\r\n      string(9) &quot;Smith.png&quot;\r\n      [1]=&gt;\r\n      string(10) &quot;&#211; R&#237;.png&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    array(2) {\r\n      [0]=&gt;\r\n      string(5) &quot;Smith&quot;\r\n      [1]=&gt;\r\n      string(4) &quot; R&#237;&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhy is the &#211; being stripped away in the `$surname2`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309639/pathinfo-confused-by-space-in-file-name","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"pathinfo confused by space in file name"},{"tags":["c"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":98771,"user_id":21926,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6e61d47f9a6ec0a7a286835e51f3332?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Unimportant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/21926/unimportant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570649343,"post_id":58309637,"comment_id":102983405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309637/how-to-reverse-the-words-in-string-with-dot-delimiter-in-c-maintaining-the-dot-i#comment102983405_58309637"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":98771,"user_id":21926,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6e61d47f9a6ec0a7a286835e51f3332?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Unimportant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/21926/unimportant"},"last_editor":{"reputation":98771,"user_id":21926,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6e61d47f9a6ec0a7a286835e51f3332?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Unimportant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/21926/unimportant"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570653711,"last_edit_date":1570653711,"creation_date":1570650410,"answer_id":58311279,"question_id":58309637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311279","body_markdown":"This is how I would do it (omitting error checking):\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n    {\r\n        char str[100];\r\n        char *c;\r\n    \r\n        scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, str);\r\n    \r\n        while ((c = strrchr(str, &#39;.&#39;))) {\r\n            *c = 0;\r\n            printf(&quot;%s.&quot;, c + 1);  \r\n        }\r\n        printf(&quot;%s\\n&quot;, str);\r\n    \r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $ ./a.out\r\n    this.is.a.test.for.stackoverflow\r\n    stackoverflow.for.test.a.is.this","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58309637/how-to-reverse-the-words-in-string-with-dot-delimiter-in-c-maintaining-the-dot-i/58311279#58311279","title":"how to reverse the words in string with dot delimiter in c maintaining the dot in output"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":31330,"user_id":149530,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b6c8b04130af49735de5be666d67c00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Foukarakis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/149530/michael-foukarakis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570654926,"creation_date":1570654926,"answer_id":58312254,"question_id":58309637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312254","body_markdown":"Well, there&#39;s two glaring errors:\r\n\r\n1.
