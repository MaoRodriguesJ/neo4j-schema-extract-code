It is available in **Excel 2010 Professional Plus and later versions**. My demonstration is using **Excel 2016**.\r\n\r\nSteps are:\r\n\r\n 1. Load both tables being the `time series of cash-flow` and your `2-column output table` to the power query editor, then you should have:\r\n\r\n[![Tables][2]][2]\r\n\r\n 2. For the **first table**, merged the `Period` column with `Cashflow` column with semicolon `;` as the delimiter;\r\n 3. Transpose the column/table, then merge the columns with comma `,` as the delimiter;\r\n 4. Add a custom column use this formula `=&quot;Connector&quot;` which will fill the column with the word `Connector`, then you should have:\r\n\r\n[![Table 1 - Final][3]][3]\r\n\r\n 5. For the **second table**, also add a custom column use the same formula `=&quot;Connector&quot;` which will fill the column with the word `Connector`;\r\n 6. Merge the second table with the first table using the `Custom` column as the connection, then expand the new column to show the `Merged` column from the first table, then you should have:\r\n\r\n[![Table 2 - merged][4]][4]\r\n\r\n 7. Remove the `Custom` column, then split the `Merged` column by delimiter comma `,` and **put the results into Rows**;\r\n 8. Split the `Merged` column again by delimiter semicolon `;` to separate the `Period` and `Cashflow` from the first table;\r\n 9. Add a custom column to calculate the `New Period` being `=[Period]+[Merged.1]`;\r\n 10. Add another custom column to calculate the `Cashflow` being `=[#&quot;# Tran&quot;]*[Merged.2]`, then you should have something like the following:\r\n\r\n[![Table 2 - added columns][5]][5]\r\n\r\n 11. Group/sum the `Cashflow` column by `New Period`.\r\n\r\n[![Table 2 - Final][6]][6]\r\n\r\nOnce done you can **Close &amp; Load** the result to a new worksheet (by default). If you want to show the `# Trans` column in the final output, you can make a duplicate of your second table before making any changes, and then merge it with the final output table by the `Period` column to show the corresponding number of transactions.\r\n\r\nHere are the power query M codes for the first table:\r\n\r\n    let\r\n        Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=&quot;Tbl_CFS&quot;]}[Content],\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source,{{&quot;Period&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;Cashflow&quot;, Int64.Type}}),\r\n        #&quot;Merged Columns1&quot; = Table.CombineColumns(Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;, {{&quot;Period&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Cashflow&quot;, type text}}, &quot;en-AU&quot;),{&quot;Period&quot;, &quot;Cashflow&quot;},Combiner.CombineTextByDelimiter(&quot;;&quot;, QuoteStyle.None),&quot;Merged&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Transposed Table&quot; = Table.Transpose(#&quot;Merged Columns1&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Merged Columns&quot; = Table.CombineColumns(Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Transposed Table&quot;, {{&quot;Column1&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Column2&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Column3&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Column4&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Column5&quot;, type text}, {&quot;Column6&quot;, type text}}, &quot;en-AU&quot;),{&quot;Column1&quot;, &quot;Column2&quot;, &quot;Column3&quot;, &quot;Column4&quot;, &quot;Column5&quot;, &quot;Column6&quot;},Combiner.CombineTextByDelimiter(&quot;,&quot;, QuoteStyle.None),&quot;Merged&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Added Custom&quot; = Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Merged Columns&quot;, &quot;Custom&quot;, each &quot;Connector&quot;)\r\n    in\r\n        #&quot;Added Custom&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd here are the codes for the second table:\r\n\r\n    let\r\n        Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=&quot;Tbl_Total&quot;]}[Content],\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source,{{&quot;Period&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;# Tran&quot;, Int64.Type}}),\r\n        #&quot;Added Custom&quot; = Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;, &quot;Custom&quot;, each &quot;Connector&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Merged Queries&quot; = Table.NestedJoin(#&quot;Added Custom&quot;, {&quot;Custom&quot;}, Tbl_CFS, {&quot;Custom&quot;}, &quot;Tbl_CFS&quot;, JoinKind.LeftOuter),\r\n        #&quot;Expanded Tbl_CFS&quot; = Table.ExpandTableColumn(#&quot;Merged Queries&quot;, &quot;Tbl_CFS&quot;, {&quot;Merged&quot;}, {&quot;Merged&quot;}),\r\n        #&quot;Removed Columns&quot; = Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;Expanded Tbl_CFS&quot;,{&quot;Custom&quot;}),\r\n        #&quot;Split Column by Delimiter&quot; = Table.ExpandListColumn(Table.TransformColumns(#&quot;Removed Columns&quot;, {{&quot;Merged&quot;, Splitter.SplitTextByDelimiter(&quot;,&quot;, QuoteStyle.Csv), let itemType = (type nullable text) meta [Serialized.Text = true] in type {itemType}}}), &quot;Merged&quot;),\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type1&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Split Column by Delimiter&quot;,{{&quot;Merged&quot;, type text}}),\r\n        #&quot;Split Column by Delimiter1&quot; = Table.SplitColumn(#&quot;Changed Type1&quot;, &quot;Merged&quot;, Splitter.SplitTextByDelimiter(&quot;;&quot;, QuoteStyle.Csv), {&quot;Merged.1&quot;, &quot;Merged.2&quot;}),\r\n        #&quot;Changed Type2&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Split Column by Delimiter1&quot;,{{&quot;Merged.1&quot;, Int64.Type}, {&quot;Merged.2&quot;, Int64.Type}}),\r\n        #&quot;Added Custom1&quot; = Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Changed Type2&quot;, &quot;New Period&quot;, each [Period]+[Merged.1]),\r\n        #&quot;Added Custom2&quot; = Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Added Custom1&quot;, &quot;Cashflow&quot;, each [#&quot;# Tran&quot;]*[Merged.2]),\r\n        #&quot;Grouped Rows&quot; = Table.Group(#&quot;Added Custom2&quot;, {&quot;New Period&quot;}, {{&quot;Sum&quot;, each List.Sum([Cashflow]), type number}})\r\n    in\r\n        #&quot;Grouped Rows&quot;\r\n\r\nAll steps are using built-in functions so should be straight forward and easy to execute.

It will take a big of managing state of your other running tasks and how general you want your setup to be.\r\n\r\nTaking your example at face-value and ignoring memory leak concerns you could accomplish the behavior you describe with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst takeLatestByKeyA = (patternOrChannel, saga, ...args) =&gt; fork(function*() {\r\n  const tasks = {};\r\n  while (true) {\r\n    const action = yield take(patternOrChannel)\r\n    if (tasks[action.payload.a]) {\r\n      yield cancel(tasks[action.payload.a]) // cancel is no-op if the task has already terminated\r\n    }\r\n    tasks[action.payload.a] = yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis assumes that `payload.a` is a valid object key and that you&#39;re not concerned with cleaning up the `tasks` object. You can add code to do that if necessary, and augment the helper to be more general if `action.payload.a` if you&#39;ll be using this for something more than just comparing `action.payload.a` but I&#39;ll leave that to you.\r\n\r\nFor running code when a task is cancelled you can do so in a finally block as per the docs [2]:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction* myGenerator() {\r\n  try {\r\n    // your code\r\n  } finally {\r\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\r\n      // do cleanup\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[1] https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/#takelatestpattern-saga-args\r\n\r\n[2] https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/advanced/TaskCancellation.html ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275260/takelatest-task-cancelling-based-on-some-arguments-of-action-payload/58276273#58276273","title":"takeLatest task cancelling based on some arguments of action payload"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12178410,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7w-NWVY41dE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rde0TBryRwI2dYd9JlwRm7Fi_uzZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sadq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12178410/sadq"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1212,"user_id":1007303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/affa8195b52419bcf7cffb5cf4b82681?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gene Z.

I would like to declare some simple short-hand references to these external variables right before declaring the list, but I don&#39;t want these reference variables to become global variables.\r\n\r\nThis all probably sounds very confusing, so here is an example:\r\n\r\n    prj = book.OverrideLevel.PROJECT\r\n    ent = book.OverrideLevel.ENTITY\r\n    elm = book.OverrideLevel.ELEMENT\r\n\r\n    list = [OvrType( 3, prj, &quot;OutTypes&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 4, prj, &quot;FilePrefix&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 5, ent, &quot;FileSuffix&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 6, ent, &quot;World&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 7, ent, &quot;Anim&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 8, ent, &quot;Armature&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 9, ent, &quot;MeshData&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 10, elm, &quot;General&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 11, elm, &quot;ObjPrefix&quot; ),\r\n    \t\tOvrType( 12, elm, &quot;ObjSuffix&quot; ) ]\r\n\r\nIn the example, I want to avoid defining any globals other than `list`. Since this is happening in the global scope, `prj`, `ent`, and `elm` will also become global variables. Is there any way to avoid this in Python? Perhaps by defining the list as empty (`list = []`), then creating a +1 scope, and defining the list contents there? I&#39;m just not sure how to do this.\r\n\r\nOne thing I&#39;ve considered is to create a function, then call it immediately:\r\n\r\n    list = []\r\n    def BuildList():\r\n    \r\n    \tprj = book.OverrideLevel.PROJECT\r\n    \tent = book.OverrideLevel.ENTITY\r\n    \telm = book.OverrideLevel.ELEMENT\r\n\r\n        global list    \r\n    \tlist = [OvrType( 3, prj, &quot;OutTypes&quot; ),\r\n    \t\t\t.... ]\r\n    \r\n    BuildList()\r\n\r\nWould there be a better way? I know some languages allow you to add scopes manually for any reason needed. But since Python is so text-driven (spacing=scope), I wasn&#39;t sure if something like that would be permitted.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any

based on the comment below\r\n\r\nGiven you have:\r\n\r\n    kernel = createTheKernelVarBasedOnWhatYouWant() #shape (784, 64)\r\n    bias = createTheBiasVarBasedOnWhatYouWant() #shape (64,)\r\n\r\nMake a simple function copying the code from `Dense`:\r\n\r\n    def custom_dense(x):\r\n        inputs, kernel, bias = x\r\n\r\n        outputs = K.dot(inputs, kernel)\r\n        outputs = K.bias_add(outputs, bias, data_format=&#39;channels_last&#39;)\r\n        return outputs\r\n\r\nUse the function in a `Lambda` layer:\r\n\r\n    layer = Lambda(custom_dense)\r\n    hiddens = layer([x, kernel, bias])\r\n\r\n&gt; Warning: `kernel` and `bias` must be produced from a Keras layer, or come from an `kernel = Input(tensor=the_kernel_var)` and `bias = Input(tensor=bias_var)`\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nIf the warning above is bad for you, you can always use `kernel` and `bias` &quot;from outside&quot;, like:\r\n\r\n    def custom_dense(inputs):\r\n        outputs = K.dot(inputs, kernel) #where kernel is not part of the arguments anymore\r\n        outputs = K.bias_add(outputs, bias, data_format=&#39;channels_last&#39;)\r\n        return outputs\r\n\r\n    layer = Lambda(custom_dense)\r\n    hiddens = layer(x)\r\n\r\nThis last option makes it a bit more complicated to save/load models. \r\n\r\n##Old answer\r\n\r\nYou should probably use a Keras Dense layer and set its weights in a standard way:\r\n\r\n    layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, name=&#39;the_layer&#39;)\r\n    layer.set_weights([np.random.rand(784, 64), np.random.rand(64)])\r\n\r\nIf you need that these weights are not trainable, before compiling the keras model you set:\r\n\r\n    model.get_layer(&#39;the_layer&#39;).trainable=False\r\n\r\nIf you want direct access to the variables as tensors, they are:\r\n\r\n    kernel = layer.kernel    \r\n    bias = layer.bias\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of other options, but that depends on your exact intention, which is not clear in your question. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models) and [keras functional api](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional).\r\n\r\nCustom layers allow you to build any layer you want in a way that is compatible with Keras, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyDenseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):\r\n    def __init__(self, num_outputs):\r\n        super(MyDenseLayer, self).__init__()\r\n        self.num_outputs = num_outputs\r\n    \r\n    def build(self, input_shape):\r\n        self.kernel = self.add_weight(&quot;kernel&quot;, \r\n

TF 1.x, it was possible to build layers with custom variables. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\ndef make_custom_getter(custom_variables):\r\n    def custom_getter(getter, name, **kwargs):\r\n        if name in custom_variables:\r\n            variable = custom_variables[name]\r\n        else:\r\n            variable = getter(name, **kwargs)\r\n        return variable\r\n    return custom_getter\r\n\r\n# Make a custom getter for the dense layer variables.\r\n# Note: custom variables can result from arbitrary computation;\r\n#       for the sake of this example, we make them just constant tensors.\r\ncustom_variables = {\r\n    &quot;model/dense/kernel&quot;: tf.constant(\r\n        np.random.rand(784, 64), name=&quot;custom_kernel&quot;, dtype=tf.float32),\r\n    &quot;model/dense/bias&quot;: tf.constant(\r\n        np.random.rand(64), name=&quot;custom_bias&quot;, dtype=tf.float32),\r\n}\r\ncustom_getter = make_custom_getter(custom_variables)\r\n\r\n# Compute hiddens using a dense layer with custom variables.\r\nx = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 784), name=&quot;inputs&quot;)\r\nwith tf.variable_scope(&quot;model&quot;, custom_getter=custom_getter):\r\n    Layer = tf.layers.Dense(64)\r\n    hiddens = Layer(x)\r\n\r\nprint(Layer.variables)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe printed variables of the constructed dense layer will be custom tensors we specified in the `custom_variables` dict:\r\n```python\r\n[&lt;tf.Tensor &#39;custom_kernel:0&#39; shape=(784, 64) dtype=float32&gt;, &lt;tf.Tensor &#39;custom_bias:0&#39; shape=(64,) dtype=float32&gt;]\r\n```\r\nThis allows us to create layers/models that use provided tensors in `custom_variables` directly as their weights, so that we could further differentiate the output of the layers/models with respect to any tensors that `custom_variables` may depend on (particularly useful for implementing functionality in [modulating sub-nets](https://distill.pub/2018/feature-wise-transformations/), [parameter generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10301), [meta-learning](https://github.com/deepmind/learning-to-learn), etc.).\r\n\r\nVariable scopes used to make it easy to nest all off graph-building inside scopes with custom getters and build models on top of the provided tensors as their parameters. Since sessions and variable scopes are no longer advisable in TF 2.0 (and all of that low-level stuff is moved to `tf.compat.v1`), what would be **the best practice** to implement the above using Keras and TF 2.0?\r\n\r\n(Related [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33125).)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275253/tensorflow-2-0-keras-layers-with-custom-tensors-as-variables","title":"TensorFlow 2.0 Keras layers with custom tensors as variables"},{"tags":["html","css","angular","angular7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8437,"user_id":248703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAvW6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alessandro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/248703/alessandro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570473245,"post_id":58275247,"comment_id":102917092,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275247/remove-the-delay-in-expand-collapse-of-a-table-row-in-angular-7#comment102917092_58275247"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11378593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff08aa981b810aa7531660b109478f9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"manged","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11378593/manged"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8437,"user_id":248703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAvW6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alessandro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/248703/alessandro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570510065,"post_id":58275247,"comment_id":102926356,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275247/remove-the-delay-in-expand-collapse-of-a-table-row-in-angular-7#comment102926356_58275247"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11378593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff08aa981b810aa7531660b109478f9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"manged","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11378593/manged"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570473047,"creation_date":1570473047,"question_id":58275247,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275247","body_markdown":"When I use tables, there is a delay in expanding/collapsing of accordions.

most cases, the necessary dependencies just occur automatically as a result of your references. If the configuration for one resource refers directly or indirectly to another, Terraform automatically infers the dependency between them without the need for explicit `depends_on`.\r\n\r\nThis works because module variables and outputs are also nodes in the dependency graph: if a child module resource refers to `var.foo` then it indirectly depends on anything that the value of that variable depends on.\r\n\r\nFor the rare situation where automatic dependency detection is insufficient, you can still exploit the fact that module variables and outputs are nodes in the dependency graph to create indirect _explicit_ dependencies, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariable &quot;storage_account_depends_on&quot; {\r\n  # the value doesn&#39;t matter; we&#39;re just using this variable\r\n  # to propagate dependencies.\r\n  type    = any\r\n  default = []\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource &quot;azurerm_storage_account&quot; &quot;test&quot; {\r\n  name                     = &quot;diagnostics${azurerm_resource_group.management.name}&quot;\r\n  resource_group_name      = &quot;${azurerm_resource_group.management.name}&quot;\r\n  location                 = &quot;${azurerm_resource_group.management.location}&quot;\r\n  account_tier             = &quot;Standard&quot;\r\n  account_replication_type = &quot;LRS&quot;\r\n\r\n  tags = {\r\n    environment = &quot;diagnostics&quot;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  # This resource depends on whatever the variable\r\n  # depends on, indirectly. This is the same\r\n  # as using var.storage_account_depends_on in\r\n  # an expression above, but for situations where\r\n  # we don&#39;t actually need the value.\r\n  depends_on = [var.storage_account_depends_on]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you call this module, you can set `storage_account_depends_on` to any expression that includes the objects you want to ensure are created before the storage account:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule &quot;diagnostic_logs&quot; {\r\n  source = &quot;./modules/diagnostic_logs&quot;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule &quot;storage_account&quot; {\r\n  source = &quot;./modules/storage_account&quot;\r\n\r\n  storage_account_depends_on = [module.diagnostic_logs.logging]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in your `diagnostic_logs` module you can configure indirect dependencies for the `logging` output to complete the dependency links between the modules:\r\n\r\n```\r\noutput &quot;logging&quot; {\r\n  # Again, the value is not important because we&#39;re just\r\n  # using this for its dependencies.\r\n  value = {}\r\n\r\n  # Anything that refers to this output must wait until\r\n  # the actions for azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting.example\r\n  # to have completed first.\r\n  depends_on = [azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting.example]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your relationships can be expressed by passing actual _values_ around, such as by having an output that includes the id, I&#39;d recommend preferring that approach because it leads to a configuration that is easier to follow. But in rare situations where there are relationships between resources that cannot be modeled as data flow, you can use outputs and variables to propagate explicit dependencies between modules too.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275233/terraform-depends-on-with-modules/58277124#58277124","title":"Terraform depends_on with modules"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9734720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"El so","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9734720/el-so"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58277124,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570482257,"creation_date":1570473000,"question_id":58275233,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275233","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new at terraform and I created a custom azure policies on module structure.\r\neach policy represents a custom module. \r\nOne of the modules that I have created is enabling diagnostics logs for any new azure resource created. \r\nbut, I need a storage account for that.

It wraps any expression so that it can be used as a Layer. This wrapping does not lead to (trainable) parameters. E.g., if you want to perform a calculation on your input (like scaling it by a factor or subtracting the mean, etc), you describe it as a function, wrap it in a Lambda Layer and that&#39;s it. No extra parameters are necessary for the wrapping.\r\n\r\nHowever, such an expression can also be passing your input through other keras layers. If you wrap entire layers like that, the wrapped layers then can have parameters themselves and still have when they are being wrapped.\r\n\r\nNote that the wrapping in your example seems to be done to include the non-keras tf code. An alternative would have been to create a new subclass of `tf.keras.layers.Layer` and making the tf-specific things when implementing its `call` method and/or just using the functional model API.

Building an app in MVC. I need a way to build an array minus values that are sent to a controller. I am able to easily do this in a simple console app, but the .Except method doesn&#39;t seem to function the same when using it in a controller. \r\n\r\nI have a static array in small method. I send some values the method and use the Except method to create a new array. Works exactly as it should. \r\n         \r\n\r\n     \r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            string[] sublines = new string[] { &quot;BI/PD&quot;, &quot;Hired&quot;, &quot;PIP&quot;, &quot;Medical Payments&quot; };\r\n            results(sublines);\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static void results(string[] values)\r\n        {\r\n            string[] subLineVales = new string[] { &quot;BI/PD&quot;, &quot;Hired&quot;, &quot;Non-Owned&quot;, &quot;PIP&quot;, &quot;Addtl-PIP&quot;, &quot;Medical Payments&quot;, &quot;UM PD&quot;, &quot;UM CSL&quot;, &quot;UIM CSL&quot;, &quot;Terrorism&quot; };\r\n            int count = subLineVales.Length;\r\n           \r\n\r\n            string[] DifferArray = subLineVales.Except(values).ToArray();\r\n\r\n            foreach (var item in DifferArray)\r\n            {\r\n                Console.Write(item);\r\n                Console.ReadLine();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new array excludes values in the &quot;values&quot; array parameter. \r\n\r\nSecond, I take this same approach and send specific values in an array to an MVC controller. \r\n\r\n      public ActionResult MyAction(string[] rid, string[] subLineNames, string[] lineGuids, string uniqline, string uniqpolicy, string uniqlinetype)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            string[] sublineArray = new string[] { &quot;BI/PD&quot;, &quot;Hired&quot;, &quot;Non Owned&quot;, &quot;PIP&quot;, &quot;Addtl PIP&quot;, &quot;Medical Payments&quot;, &quot;UM PD&quot;, &quot;UM CSL&quot;, &quot;UIM CSL&quot;, &quot;Terrorism&quot; };\r\n            string[] subLineValues = sublineArray.Except(subLineNames).ToArray(); //Fills array with sublineArray.

Not sure if Windows bug or not, and looking for a solution anyways.\r\n\r\nI think I have a bit of a complex issue which requires a process to reproduce. What ends up happening is this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe app uses the system title bar (Not a view extended into the titlebar), and on my machine, the system setting to allow accent colors in the title bar is disabled. This is why the caption buttons are blue (the system accent color) but the actual title bar is black. What I expect, and what should happen (as I will prove) is that the caption buttons (minimize, maximize, close) should be black, as the rest of the title bar is.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things I tried doing to solve the issue (when I first noticed this in my actual application) was to set the background color of the buttons to transparent. This is what happens:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nEntirely white! Okay, now for a reproducible example.\r\n\r\n- Create a new UWP application. I used C#, and am not sure this matters, but for completeness, I recommend you do the same.\r\n- Make sure you disable accent color in the title bar in system settings\r\n- Run the default app and notice the behavior of the title bar. *This is the expected behavior, as the caption buttons are black (in dark theme). This is why I believe what I am experiencing is unintended*\r\n- I added Acrylic effect to the XAML page because I had thought this was the issue. It doesn&#39;t seem to be, but just for completeness, use the following XAML and C# (changing App1 to your app name, of course):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;Page\r\n    x:Class=&quot;App1.MainPage&quot;\r\n    xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&quot;\r\n    xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&quot;\r\n    xmlns:local=&quot;using:App1&quot;\r\n    xmlns:d=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008&quot;\r\n    xmlns:mc=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006&quot;\r\n    mc:Ignorable=&quot;d&quot;\r\n    Background=&quot;{ThemeResource SystemControlAcrylicWindowMediumHighBrush}&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;Grid&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/Grid&gt;\r\n&lt;/Page&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.IO;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime;\r\nusing Windows.ApplicationModel.Core;\r\nusing Windows.Foundation;\r\nusing Windows.Foundation.Collections;\r\nusing Windows.UI;\r\nusing Windows.UI.ViewManagement;\r\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml;\r\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls;\r\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives;\r\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Data;\r\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Input;\r\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Media;\r\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Navigation;\r\n\r\n// The Blank Page item template is documented at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=402352&amp;clcid=0x409\r\n\r\nnamespace App1\r\n{\r\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n    /// An empty page that can be used on its own or navigated to within a Frame.\r\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n    public sealed partial class MainPage : Page\r\n    {\r\n        public MainPage()\r\n        {\r\n            this.InitializeComponent();\r\n\r\n            ApplicationViewTitleBar formattableTitleBar = ApplicationView.GetForCurrentView().TitleBar;\r\n            CoreApplication.GetCurrentView().TitleBar.ExtendViewIntoTitleBar = false;\r\n            formattableTitleBar.ButtonBackgroundColor = Colors.Transparent;\r\n            formattableTitleBar.ButtonInactiveBackgroundColor = Colors.Transparent;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should now see what I have in my second screenshot.

After one minute you would know.\r\n\r\nThe second question is: Why would you want to create a new task every single time an aspect&#39;s advice is being executed? Would that really be faster than synchronous execution? From your aspect name `ControllerLogger` I conclude that all it does it logging. But anyway, maybe your logging is so slow that it actually makes sense to make it asynchronous. Usually you can configure that for your logging framework already, so the aspect would not need to take care of it.\r\n\r\nFinally the answer to your question: I have never tried that before myself but it took me two minutes to test:\r\n\r\n  * Add a statement like `System.out.println(Thread.currentThread() + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + Thread.currentThread().getId());` to both your aspect advice and a target method.\r\n  * Run without `@Async` / `@EnableAsync`. Note the results.\r\n  * Run again with `@Async` / `@EnableAsync`. Note the results.\r\n\r\nFor me I saw something like this before:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThread[main,5,main] -&gt; 1\r\nThread[main,5,main] -&gt; 1\r\nThread[main,5,main] -&gt; 1\r\nThread[main,5,main] -&gt; 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this after activating asynchronous execution (3 aspect advices executed):\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThread[main,5,main] -&gt; 1\r\nThread[SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor-1,5,main] -&gt; 18\r\nThread[SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor-2,5,main] -&gt; 25\r\nThread[SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor-3,5,main] -&gt; 26\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the answer is: Yes, aspect advices like `@Before` or `@After` for Spring AOP will be executed asynchronously.\r\n\r\nBe careful with `@Around` advices, though, because if the target methods (and thus also the around advice) returns a type other than `void` or `Future` (as documented in the [`@Async` annotation&#39;s Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Async.html)), you will get runtime exceptions because the asynchronously executed advice will return `null` to the intercepted method first. So you would see an exception like this:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; \r\norg.springframework.aop.AopInvocationException: Null return value from advice does not match primitive return type for: public int spring.aop.MyController.doSomething(java.lang.String,int)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.CglibAopProxy.processReturnType(CglibAopProxy.java:362)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.CglibAopProxy.access$000(CglibAopProxy.java:84)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.CglibAopProxy$DynamicAdvisedInterceptor.intercept(CglibAopProxy.java:658)\r\n\tat spring.aop.MyController$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$c28d13a5.doSomething(&lt;generated&gt;)\r\n\tat spring.aop.DemoApplication.main(DemoApplication.java:28)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo be sure to use `@Async` + `@Around` only in cases for which asynchronous execution actually makes sense and for which the annotation was designed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update:** The exception above will only appear for methods returning primitive types, e.g. if your method returns an `int` and an around advice is executed and calling `JoinPoint.proceed()`. If the same method would return `Integer` instead, the around advice would execute without an error, but return `null`, which is something your caller does not expect and would potentially break your program. So as I said, be careful how to use this with `@Around`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** Even if the target method returns a `Future` but the around advice returns something other, e.g. `Object`, `proceed()` will return `null`. Only if you make the around advice also have a return type of `Future`, it actually works and the caller can handle the future as expected and after waiting for `isDone()` actually receives the expected result.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275121/will-an-aspect-be-executed-asynchronously-if-i-put-async-method-on-it/58279169#58279169","title":"Will an aspect be executed

give you a hand.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what&#39;s happening:\r\n\r\n 1. You create 5 numbers in the `random` array. You may not have noticed it, but they are numbered 0 to 4 (SFML is sitting on C++, and then it means that arrays starts at zero here).\r\n 2. Every second, you update the number stocked in the 3rd place of your `random` array.\r\n 3. Then it goes wrong: instead of updating the corresponding number in the `numbers` array, you cycle it with `push_back` and `erase`.\r\n\r\nUnderstand me here: `push_back` create a new element at the end of the vector, while `erase` removes an element from the vector and then &quot;sort out things&quot; so there&#39;s not number gap in the index of the vector.\r\n\r\nEffectively, you&#39;re handling `random` right, but when you try to update `number` you cycle through it. Like this:\r\n\r\n    seconds:       1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n\r\n\r\n    array content: 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n      (vertical)   1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n                   2 3 4 5 6 7\r\n                   3 4 5 6 7 8\r\n                   4 5 6 7 8 9\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure how clear I&#39;m making this, but if you look at the array content, you&#39;ll see that by erasing and creating a new value at the end, you&#39;re cycling through the positions [2-4] of the array. That&#39;s why in your gif not all numbers are updated wrong, only 3 of them.\r\n\r\nThe obvious solutions would be to stop erasing and pushing back in the `numbers` array. You can update it the same way you updated the `random` array. It&#39;ll be fine.\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n    if (second == 1)\r\n        {\r\n        random.at(2)-=1;\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; random[2] &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n        numbers[2].setString(to_string(random[2]));\r\n        clock.restart(); \r\n    }\r\n\r\nHave fun.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275118/decreasing-value-in-vectors-with-sfml/58285917#58285917","title":"Decreasing value in vectors with SFML"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10915866,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e58fe7a557e989e62133e82a7247ec28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Furkan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10915866/furkan"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58285917,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570556841,"creation_date":1570472477,"question_id":58275118,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275118","body_markdown":"I created 5 numbers using vector with SFML, but I want the second one to fall one by one at intervals of 1 second.

Any help on how I can divide the images into blocks and then compare each block with corresponding blocks of other images so that I have a final image with blocks with the maximum pixel information among all set of images.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275116/image-blocking-and-comparing-blocks-with-other-images","title":"image blocking and comparing blocks with other images?"},{"tags":["machine-learning","scikit-learn","classification","random-forest"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":26335,"user_id":4685471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/327dc718c142e3ea70e5db4b38050a36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"desertnaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4685471/desertnaut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570485190,"post_id":58275113,"comment_id":102921530,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275113/proper-use-of-class-weight-parameter-in-random-forest-classifier#comment102921530_58275113"},{"owner":{"reputation":331,"user_id":3616293,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf7556b4227065cec9496375d64fea3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3616293/arun"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":26335,"user_id":4685471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/327dc718c142e3ea70e5db4b38050a36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"desertnaut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4685471/desertnaut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570734483,"post_id":58275113,"comment_id":103017187,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275113/proper-use-of-class-weight-parameter-in-random-forest-classifier#comment103017187_58275113"}],"owner":{"reputation":331,"user_id":3616293,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf7556b4227065cec9496375d64fea3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3616293/arun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6787,"user_id":6347629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxdJr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Venkatachalam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6347629/venkatachalam"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570515645,"creation_date":1570472439,"last_edit_date":1570515645,"question_id":58275113,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275113","body_markdown":"I have a multi-class classification problem for which I am trying to use a Random Forest classifier.

Would really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nI have 4 genes(features) and my classification here is binary(0 and 1). After a lot of back and forth, I have finalized on using LDA to do my classification. I have different studies each comparing the same two classes and I trained my model using these 4 genes on each of these studies. \r\n\r\nI want to visualize the LDA scores in the form of points plot. Something like below, where each section represents a different study/dataset. Samples of that dataset on the X axis and the LD1 value I get using - \r\n`lda_model = lda(formula = class ~ ., data = train)\r\npredict(lda_model,train)` on the Y axis. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\nSince I trained a different model on each dataset, we can clearly see the the decision boundary (which I assume is the black line) for each dataset is different and on a different scale. However, I want to scale the values on the Y axis is such a way that all my datasets are on the same scale and I can represent this plot with a single decision boundary( again, something I can clearly draw on the plot, like the red line).\r\n\r\nThe LD1 values here are - a(GeneA) + b(GeneB) + c(GeneC) + d(GeneD) - mean(a(GeneA) + b(GeneB) + c(GeneC) + d(GeneD)). This is done for each dataset individually. However, this is not exactly equal to (a(GeneA) + b(GeneB) + c(GeneC) + d(GeneD) + intercept) which we can get using logistic regression. I am trying to find that value or some method which can scale my Y axis across all the datasets using LDA.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2KVv.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275098/scale-lda-decision-boundary","title":"Scale LDA decision boundary"},{"tags":["java","exe","launch4j"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":111935,"user_id":1531124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqlof.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GhostCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531124/ghostcat"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570472719,"post_id":58275096,"comment_id":102916843,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275096/how-to-make-a-safe-executable#comment102916843_58275096"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12178354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBohe368VGKf_0MYybIVUD-TBhCX01HF560CUYK=k-s128","display_name":"Felix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12178354/felix"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":111935,"user_id":1531124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqlof.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GhostCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531124/ghostcat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570489721,"post_id":58275096,"comment_id":102922642,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275096/how-to-make-a-safe-executable#comment102922642_58275096"},{"owner":{"reputation":111935,"user_id":1531124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqlof.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GhostCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531124/ghostcat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570495024,"post_id":58275096,"comment_id":102923568,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275096/how-to-make-a-safe-executable#comment102923568_58275096"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12178354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBohe368VGKf_0MYybIVUD-TBhCX01HF560CUYK=k-s128","display_name":"Felix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12178354/felix"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":111935,"user_id":1531124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqlof.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GhostCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531124/ghostcat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570498002,"post_id":58275096,"comment_id":102924083,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275096/how-to-make-a-safe-executable#comment102924083_58275096"},{"owner":{"reputation":111935,"user_id":1531124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqlof.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GhostCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531124/ghostcat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570498998,"post_id":58275096,"comment_id":102924283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275096/how-to-make-a-safe-executable#comment102924283_58275096"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12178354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBohe368VGKf_0MYybIVUD-TBhCX01HF560CUYK=k-s128","display_name":"Felix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12178354/felix"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":111935,"user_id":1531124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqlof.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GhostCat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531124/ghostcat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570499741,"post_id":58275096,"comment_id":102924405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275096/how-to-make-a-safe-executable#comment102924405_58275096"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12178354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBohe368VGKf_0MYybIVUD-TBhCX01HF560CUYK=k-s128","display_name":"Felix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12178354/felix"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570472382,"creation_date":1570472382,"question_id":58275096,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275096","body_markdown":"I have been using Launch4j to create an executable based on my code from java.

For instance, you could use create a simple Wiki and store the documents, using the name of the document as the key.\r\n\r\nThere isn&#39;t a fundamental reason you couldn&#39;t use S3 for the same use case.  S3 is an object store, which is another way of storing objects given an individual key.\r\n\r\nSo, if your solution isn&#39;t doing complicated queries in dynamo using filter expressions, or other logic, you can probably just change the store, and treat each key/value pair as an S3 item stored with the key name.\r\n\r\nThere are some big caveats here.  Not the least of which is you&#39;ll probably run into S3&#39;s eventual consistent nature sooner or later if you&#39;re updating data, or even looking to see if a key exists before using it.  It&#39;s nearly impossible to tell if S3 or Dynamo is a better fit for your application&#39;s needs given the details provided.\r\n\r\nThe bigger question:  Why are you changing data stores?  If you have problems with Dynamo, it&#39;s best to ask about this problems.

Those facts are gathered before the playbook boots up, and thus your `environment:` happens after fact gathering, which explains why `ansible_env` does not contain it\r\n\r\nYou have a few paths forward, depending on what you prefer:\r\n\r\n* Explicitly re-gather facts inside the playbook (or even change your playbook to `gather_facts: no` and invoke `setup:` manually)\r\n* Stop looking for the environment in `ansible_env`, with the trust that it is actually there, and just use the commands which need the environment variable\r\n* Explicitly declare a separate fact to make that variable available to both the `environment:` and to the ansible tasks\r\n\r\nIf you want the first one, it would look like:\r\n\r\n    -\r\n      name: Deploy Team Services Playbook\r\n      hosts: all\r\n      gather_facts: no\r\n      environment:\r\n        whatever: goes here\r\n      pre_tasks:\r\n      - setup:\r\n      roles:\r\n      - and so forth\r\n\r\nYou can confirm the second via:\r\n\r\n    - name: ensure $KUBECONFIG is set\r\n      shell: echo $KUBECONFIG\r\n\r\nAnd the third would look like:\r\n\r\n    - hosts: all\r\n      environment:\r\n        alpha: beta\r\n      vars:\r\n        alpha: beta\r\n      roles:\r\n      - # now {{ alpha }} is available to ansible and as $alpha in `commands:`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275059/unable-to-set-environment-variables-for-use-in-ansible-roles/58279996#58279996","title":"Unable to set environment variables for use in ansible roles"}],"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":9481731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"AhmFM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9481731/ahmfm"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6329,"user_id":2123530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/37a7fba006184897e8d74f1795e2835b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"β.εηοιτ.βε","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2123530/%ce%b2-%ce%b5%ce%b7%ce%bf%ce%b9%cf%84-%ce%b2%ce%b5"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58279996,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570506918,"creation_date":1570472215,"last_edit_date":1570473423,"question_id":58275059,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275059","body_markdown":"I have playbook running fine when I have environment variables and tasks defined in one single playbook without roles. \r\n\r\nBut when I structure my project into roles, I see that running tasks is not finding the environment variables that are set from the original playbook.  \r\nAny hint how to set env variables so they are available for all roles inside a playbook?\r\n\r\nDo I need to specify the environment variables in `tasks/main.yaml` file?, if yes how should do this exactly? \r\n\r\n```\r\ncat playbook.yaml \r\n-\r\n  name: Deploy Team Services Playbook\r\n  hosts: all\r\n  environment:\r\n    PATH: &quot;{{ ansible_env.PATH }}:/usr/local/bin&quot;\r\n    KUBECONFIG: &quot;{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.kube/config/{{ ansible_env.USER }}.kubeconfig&quot;\r\n  roles:\r\n    - prereq1_setup\r\n    - prereq2_k8s\r\n```\r\n\r\nprereq1_setup\\tasks\\main.yaml\r\n\r\n```\r\n      - name: &quot;Validate kubeconfig set?&quot;\r\n        shell: echo {{ ansible_env.KUBECONFIG }}\r\n        failed_when: &quot;&#39;KUBECONFIG&#39; not in ansible_env&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove works if I don&#39;t use roles and directly add tasks below. currently, am getting error as \r\n\r\noutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|TASK [prereq1_setup : Validate kubeconfig set?] *****************************************************\r\nfatal: [target1]: FAILED! =&gt; {&quot;msg&quot;: &quot;The task includes an option with an undefined variable.

Modifying the prototype of an object you don&#39;t fully control tends to be considered a code-smell since it can lead to unexpected issues down the road.\r\n\r\nWhen I&#39;ve been in your shoes before, I&#39;ve gone the route of creating helper functions that pre-build nocks. I usually put them with the same test helpers that create other factories. \r\n\r\nFor your code, as an example, I would create something like:\r\n\r\n    export function nockAuthForBaseService(param1: string, param2: string) {\r\n      return nock(&#39;http://some-base-server.com/&#39;)\r\n        .get(&#39;/permission&#39;)\r\n        .reply(200, { permission: param1 })\r\n        .get(&#39;/group&#39;)\r\n        .reply(200, { group: param2 });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen I can call and reuse this factory from various tests to DRY them up.\r\n\r\nWether you pass in an existing nock instance or not if fully up to you. I&#39;ve never had the scenario where the interceptors I wanted nocked were reused across services so it made it nicer for my code to have the helper know the base URL.

It depends really on your business needs and your design but I would suggest putting all Product model information(at least the properties that should be public) in the ProductCreated event. This would be ProductId, ProductName, ProductCategory and some others( if you have something like ProductDescription, ProductCode and whatever is in the model of Product).\r\n\r\nWhoever is listening to this event could that decide if they want to save the whole model in their storage or just a subset of that model. This is of course based on need of that particular event consumer.\r\n\r\nThis approach is good if you have or will in future have multiple consumers of the Event you publish. If not and you have only 1 then you can remove the properties which you don&#39;t need in the read model.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need a second event for transferring a subset of data as you described.
