The previous limit of 10 also applies to each operation.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you create a batched write request with 3 write operations and that your security rules use 2 document access calls to validate each write. In this case, each write uses 2 of its 10 access calls and the batched write request uses 6 of its 20 access calls.\r\n\r\nExceeding either limit results in a permission denied error.\r\n\r\nSome document access calls may be cached, and cached calls do not count towards the limits.\r\n\r\nI think that some parameter could be causing the abortion of these connections.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223342/google-firestore-scalability-limit/58244589#58244589","title":"Google Firestore Scalability Limit"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":1985123,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13d75c6546e174b3075fb2423cc3f402?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Raj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1985123/raj"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570237550,"creation_date":1570120166,"question_id":58223342,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58223342","body_markdown":"As per the Google Firebase documentation, Firestore will support upto 1,000,000 simultaneous connections and 10,000 writes per second per database.

I am looking to write a Python script and for it to be run on Jenkins as part of some automated testing I wish to do. My script interacts with an API and hence imports the &#39;requests&#39; module on Python. It works fine using the Python interpreter on my local machine but I have had issues when I have tried using the Jenkins Python script builder and so I am looking for a way around this.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I have looked around the internet for solutions but as my knowledge on this topic is limited I have found it difficult to understand certain ideas that have been mentioned on the web. One lead I have had is related to the use of virtual environments on Jenkins, but as its something I&#39;ve never used, I have struggled implementing it. I have installed the ShiningPanda Plugin on Jenkins, but I am unsure how to use it.\r\n\r\nAny help given is greatly appreciated

am building a distributed application that heavily relies on HTTPS calls, both internally as well as externally. AWS CloudFront is already implemented in front of the API servers, but I&#39;d like to have also in-app caching to avoid unnecessary HTTP calls - even to CloudFront.\r\n\r\nPrimarily I was considering custom in-app caching for HTTP responses. Most caching libraries (for Node) are built in a way that cache TTL is constant or varies by key, while HTTP responses from external services may vary. This would require me to read the Cache-Control headers from the response and react appropriately. However it&#39;s feels like reinventing a wheel. (For the records, I considered projects like [cached-request][1] and [lru-cache][2])\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be relying an existing HTTPS Cache, like Squid, and route all external requests through Squid server and let Squid do all caching decisions. Squid could be installed on every server as a local cache. Unfortunately all external HTTP requests are actually HTTPS, so Squid is not able to cache anything.\r\n\r\nI found a project called [mitmproxy][3], but it does not do caching either.\r\n\r\nIn the end: Are there any production-grade solutions for &quot;client-side&quot; HTTPS caching on the app server?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cached-request\r\n  [2]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache\r\n  [3]: https://mitmproxy.org/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223314/what-production-grade-https-sidecar-caches-are-available-if-any","title":"What production-grade https sidecar caches are available, if any?"},{"tags":["java","javafx","javafx-3d"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32096,"user_id":3956070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqUhH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jos&#233; Pereda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3956070/jos%c3%a9-pereda"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570126964,"post_id":58223312,"comment_id":102824800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223312/how-to-make-the-ends-of-cylinder-transparent-in-javafx#comment102824800_58223312"},{"owner":{"reputation":378,"user_id":1744657,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e67d3dabe1937118ac97a8d2888dd056?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jameslfc19","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1744657/jameslfc19"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":32096,"user_id":3956070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqUhH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jos&#233; Pereda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3956070/jos%c3%a9-pereda"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570178702,"post_id":58223312,"comment_id":102839334,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223312/how-to-make-the-ends-of-cylinder-transparent-in-javafx#comment102839334_58223312"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":32096,"user_id":3956070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqUhH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jos&#233; Pereda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3956070/jos%c3%a9-pereda"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570183137,"creation_date":1570183137,"answer_id":58234111,"question_id":58223312,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58234111","body_markdown":"One possible way to get transparency is by using a png as the diffuse image, with some transparent pixels.\r\n\r\nWhile this works, if you apply over a built-in JavaFX `Cylinder`, you won&#39;t get the expected result, because the Cylinder applies the same image to _both_ the vertical tube and the two cap faces. So this won&#39;t work for your case.\r\n\r\nThere could be an option to remove the caps from the cylinder mesh and get just a _tube_, but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t export its triangle mesh.\r\n\r\nSo far, the best option is to create directly the mesh of a tube, and for that we can reuse the mesh of the Cylinder by checking the open source code at the (new) [OpenJDK/JFX](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/modules/javafx.graphics/src/main/java/javafx/scene/shape/Cylinder.java#L402) GitHub repository.\r\n\r\nThe following method creates a `TriangleMesh` of a Tube of height `h`, radius `r`, with `div` divisions (producing `2 * div` triangles).

However I get one line for each code with a value in the original table (see the results below).\r\n\r\nUsing CROSS APPLY seems to be the way to go (it&#39;s commented out in my code sample) but I have hit a few problems with it:\r\n\r\n1. I cannot fathom how it works, so adapting online examples to my scenario has involved some guess work.\r\n2. I entered (what I think are) the correct references within the command according to another post on this site here:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/20632582/pivot-a-table-on-a-value-but-group-the-data-on-one-line-by-another\r\nwhere they claimed that both values within VALUES need to be the same datatype for the unpivoting process to work.  However setting &#39;value&#39; to varchar(10) stops the SUM function from working within the PIVOT statement.  Running it as decimal/float produces all NULL results.\r\n3. With &#39;value&#39; set decimal including the GROUP BY statement does produce one line of data, however (as in point 2) all code values are NULL.\r\n\r\nHope all this makes sense.

It uses a `Done` channel within requests to let the handler know if - say the client disconnects - and thus the handler should abort also. [For example](https://github.com/vjeantet/ldapserver/blob/master/examples/complex/main.go#L238).\r\n\r\nSince a `Done` channel is the old way of handling cancelation - and my desire to support cancelation chaining - I created a `context.Context` from this channel like so:\r\n\r\n    func doneContext(p context.Context, done &lt;-chan bool) (\r\n        ctx context.Context, cancel context.CancelFunc,\r\n    ) {\r\n    \tctx, cancel = context.WithCancel(p)\r\n    \tgo func() {\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;-done\r\n    \t\t\tcancel() // done closed, so cancel our context\r\n    \t}()\r\n    \treturn\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis assumed that the `done` channel would be closed for both:\r\n\r\n- client disconnects; **and**\r\n- successful handlers (that run fully to completion)\r\n\r\nThe first proved true - the second did not. Successful handler calls would **not** trigger the `done` channel to be close - and thus I was leaking go-routines.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTo solve this - and since I was canceling my own `context.Context` at the completion of the handler -  successful or not e.g.\r\n\r\n    // convert the client request&#39;s Done channel into a context.Context\r\n\tctx, cancel := doneContext(context.Background(), m.Done)\r\n\tdefer cancel() // clean-up context: rain or shine\r\n\r\nI updated `doneContext`&#39;s go routine like so:\r\n\r\n    go func() {\r\n    \t\tselect {\r\n    \t\tcase &lt;-done:\r\n    \t\t\tcancel() // done closed, so cancel our context (like before)\r\n\r\n    \t\tcase &lt;-ctx.Done():\r\n                // when our context is canceled, recover the go-routine (even if done never closes)\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    }()\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n- is this the correct way to upgrade an old-style `done` channel into a more modern `context.Context`\r\n- should I be concerned that the external package I&#39;m using is not closing the `done` channel?\r\n  - i.e. will `GC` collect this channel, even if it is never closed?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223267/generate-context-context-from-done-channel-gc-of-unclosed-channels","title":"generate context.Context from Done channel &amp; GC of unclosed channels"},{"tags":["json","xml","go","enums","marshalling"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10661,"user_id":965900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bxecf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mkopriva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/965900/mkopriva"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570120718,"post_id":58223262,"comment_id":102822235,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223262/custom-marshaling-in-go-strange-issue#comment102822235_58223262"},{"owner":{"reputation":10661,"user_id":965900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bxecf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mkopriva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/965900/mkopriva"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570120891,"post_id":58223262,"comment_id":102822305,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223262/custom-marshaling-in-go-strange-issue#comment102822305_58223262"},{"owner":{"reputation":10661,"user_id":965900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bxecf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mkopriva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/965900/mkopriva"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570121189,"post_id":58223262,"comment_id":102822417,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223262/custom-marshaling-in-go-strange-issue#comment102822417_58223262"},{"owner":{"reputation":45645,"user_id":13860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bdc06836b7bcec9fce2c5c6e5242192?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Flimzy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13860/flimzy"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570121214,"post_id":58223262,"comment_id":102822426,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223262/custom-marshaling-in-go-strange-issue#comment102822426_58223262"},{"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":11869461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tNYETRt85Vc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reswQ_iiZbSbtY0EpXqOvZxksDFVQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ialam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869461/ialam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570176395,"post_id":58223262,"comment_id":102838390,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223262/custom-marshaling-in-go-strange-issue#comment102838390_58223262"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":8496766,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1941938429402414/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kasper Gyselinck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8496766/kasper-gyselinck"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66,"user_id":8496766,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1941938429402414/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kasper Gyselinck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8496766/kasper-gyselinck"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570175460,"creation_date":1570119833,"last_edit_date":1570175460,"question_id":58223262,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58223262","body_markdown":"I&#39;m encoding some custom enum values to xml and json.

Sometimes I add it when forms don&#39;t format how I want and other times I remove it for the same reason. Sometimes it makes too much spacing between rows, depending on which classes are used on input elements. I usually try to do without it, letting fields automatically wrap as needed depending on their size (grid cells used). That avoids micro-managing row breaks.\r\n\r\nBut this is all organic trial-and-error, and it also acts different on different browser brands and versions. I waste a lot of time with trial-and-error experimentation and would like a more exacting explanation on what it does and why. This includes both &quot;horizontal&quot; forms and regular forms. Maybe it acts funny because *other* elements are coded wrong, but there&#39;s no feedback telling us that. Checkboxes and radio buttons especially tend to alter how form-group acts.\r\n\r\nIs this organic approach the New Way of the Web? Maybe I&#39;m just old-fashioned; younger developers seem okay with mass trial-and-error, where UI coding resembles a genetic algorithm (AI). I&#39;m surprised the industry puts up with all the hours doing this dance. *Somebody* is paying more.

One way to tell is to use the DUMP function.  So you could start with a query like:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT dump(column_name)\r\nFROM your_table\r\nWHERE column_name LIKE &#39;SPACE%&#39;\r\n```\r\nThat should help you find the offending character, however, that doesn&#39;t fix your problem.  Instead, I would use something like REGEXP_REPLACE:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(column_name, &#39;[^A-z]&#39;)\r\nFROM your_table\r\n```\r\nThat should take care of any non-printing characters.  You may need to play with the regular expression if you expect numbers or symbols in your string.

Grab a copy of [ngrams8k][1] and you use it to identify the issue. For example, here we have the text, &quot; SPACE&quot; with a preceding space and trailing CHAR(160) (HTML BR tag). CHAR(160) looks like a space in SSMS but isn&#39;t &quot;trimable&quot;. For example consider this query:\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @string VARCHAR(100) = &#39; SPACE&#39;+CHAR(160);\r\n    SELECT &#39;&quot;&#39;+@string+&#39;&quot;&#39;\r\n\r\nUsing [ngrams8k][1] you could do this:\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @string VARCHAR(100) = &#39; SPACE&#39;+CHAR(160);\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n      ng.position,\r\n      ng.token,\r\n      asciival = ASCII(ng.token)\r\n    FROM   dbo.ngrams8k(@string,1) AS ng;\r\n\r\n**Returns:**\r\n\r\n    position   token   asciival\r\n    ---------- ------- -----------\r\n    1                  32\r\n    2          S       83\r\n    3          P       80\r\n    4          A       65\r\n    5          C       67\r\n    6          E       69\r\n    7            &#160;     160\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the first character (position 1) is CHAR(32), that&#39;s a space. The last character (postion 7) is not a space. \r\nKnowing that CHAR(160) is the issue you could fix it like so:\r\n\r\n    SET @string = REPLACE(LTRIM(@string),CHAR(160),&#39;&#39;)\r\n\r\nIf you are using SQL Server 2017+ you can also use `TRIM` which does a whole lot more than just LTRIM-and-RTRIM-ing. For example, this will remove \r\nleading and trailing tabs, spaces, carriage returns, line returns and HTML BR tags. \r\n\r\n    SET @string = SELECT TRIM(CHAR(32)+CHAR(9)+CHAR(10)+CHAR(13)+CHAR(160) FROM @string)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/nasty-fast-n-grams-part-1-character-level-unigrams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223189/sql-how-to-remove-a-space-character-from-a-string/58226871#58226871","title":"SQL - How to remove a space character from a string"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":4587266,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6296c870444aa5fcac642cfa11aa6498?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dwhybrow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4587266/dwhybrow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58226871,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570136635,"creation_date":1570119538,"last_edit_date":1570132438,"question_id":58223189,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58223189","body_markdown":"I have a table where the max length of a column (varchar) is 12, someone has loaded some value with a space, so rather than &#39;SPACE&#39; it&#39;s &#39;SPACE &#39;\r\n\r\nI want to remove the space using a script, I was positive RTRIM or REPLACE(myValue, &#39; &#39;, &#39;&#39;) would work but LEN(myValue) shows there is still and extra character?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223189/sql-how-to-remove-a-space-character-from-a-string","title":"SQL - How to remove a space character from a string"},{"tags":["synchronization","mouseevent","touch-event"],"owner":{"reputation":101,"user_id":1247639,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lzn58.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aman Kejriwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1247639/aman-kejriwal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570119536,"creation_date":1570119536,"question_id":58223188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58223188","body_markdown":"I have two webpages that I need to control together using mouse and touchsreen at different times.

User is not allowed to perform any of the updates to the tasks that are not assigned to him.\r\n\r\nIs there any universal annotation approach to check the status and lock down all rest post end points.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223167/restriction-lock-down-all-post-delete-rest-api-end-points-based-on-the-condition","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"Restriction/lock down all Post/Delete Rest API end points based on the condition"},{"tags":["ios","swift","ios13"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570124874,"post_id":58223164,"comment_id":102823927,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223164/xcode-broken-uiview#comment102823927_58223164"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":4330767,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lCuPhO8emVE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/uIdd5BFX5eE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"marko calvocruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4330767/marko-calvocruz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570125287,"post_id":58223265,"comment_id":102824114,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223164/xcode-broken-uiview/58223265#comment102824114_58223265"},{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":8302102,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kj72.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iliya Kisliy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8302102/iliya-kisliy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":357,"user_id":4330767,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lCuPhO8emVE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/uIdd5BFX5eE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"marko calvocruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4330767/marko-calvocruz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570126839,"post_id":58223265,"comment_id":102824743,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223164/xcode-broken-uiview/58223265#comment102824743_58223265"},{"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":4330767,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lCuPhO8emVE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/uIdd5BFX5eE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"marko calvocruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4330767/marko-calvocruz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570127758,"post_id":58223265,"comment_id":102825188,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223164/xcode-broken-uiview/58223265#comment102825188_58223265"},{"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":4330767,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lCuPhO8emVE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/uIdd5BFX5eE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"marko calvocruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4330767/marko-calvocruz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570127845,"post_id":58223265,"comment_id":102825229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223164/xcode-broken-uiview/58223265#comment102825229_58223265"},{"owner":{"reputation":357,"user_id":4330767,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lCuPhO8emVE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/uIdd5BFX5eE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"marko calvocruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4330767/marko-calvocruz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570129401,"post_id":58223265,"comment_id":102825850,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223164/xcode-broken-uiview/58223265#comment102825850_58223265"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":8302102,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kj72.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iliya Kisliy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8302102/iliya-kisliy"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570119839,"creation_date":1570119839,"answer_id":58223265,"question_id":58223164,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223265","body_markdown":"You&#39;re presenting this ViewController modally.

But trying to pass it the data via this method isn&#39;t going so well.\r\n\r\n**console.log of download_list example**\r\n\r\n    [&quot;b01&quot;, &quot;1._s16&quot;, &quot;2._s17&quot;, &quot;3._s18 &quot;, &quot;4._s19&quot;, &quot;5._s20&quot;, &quot;6._s21&quot;, &quot;s01&quot;, &quot;s02&quot;, &quot;s03&quot;, &quot;s04&quot;, &quot;s05&quot;, &quot;s06&quot;, &quot;s08&quot;, &quot;s09&quot;, &quot;s10&quot;, &quot;s11&quot;, &quot;s14&quot;, &quot;s17&quot;, &quot;s18&quot;]\r\n\r\n**jQuery**\r\n\r\n    map.on(&quot;boxzoomend&quot;, function(e) {\r\n        var download_list = [];\r\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; bulk_list.length; i++) {\r\n            if (e.boxZoomBounds.contains(bulk_list[i].latlng)) {\r\n                download_list.push(bulk_list[i].name);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        if (confirm(&quot;Download the microbial community data for the following samples:&quot; + download_list.toString())) { //alert(&quot;Download Beginning&quot;);\r\n            $.ajax({\r\n                type: &quot;POST&quot;,\r\n                url: &quot;zip_download.php&quot;,\r\n                data: {download_list: download_list}\r\n            });\r\n    \t\t\r\n        } else {}\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n**PHP**\r\n\r\n    $sample_name_list = $_REQUEST[&#39;download_list&#39;];\r\n    \r\n    echo ($sample_name_list);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223152/passing-jquery-array-to-php-script-through-confirm-window-via-ajax","title":"Passing Jquery Array to PHP script through Confirm window via ajax"},{"tags":["angular","download","observable"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":156,"user_id":4217823,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vXtlE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"brieucdlf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4217823/brieucdlf"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570120036,"creation_date":1570120036,"answer_id":58223310,"question_id":58223150,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223310","body_markdown":"You can do :\r\n\r\n    window[&#39;saveAs&#39;](response, &#39;filename&#39;);\r\n\r\n[edit1]\r\nLook at this post as well: [post][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2897619/using-html5-javascript-to-generate-and-save-a-file","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223150/downloading-a-file-does-not-work-in-subscribe-after-get-request/58223310#58223310","title":"Downloading a file does not work in subscribe after GET request"}],"owner":{"reputation":87,"user_id":3457142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9e9948edc91c1a1e9a9e5b99685b3d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brittany","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3457142/brittany"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570120036,"creation_date":1570119423,"question_id":58223150,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58223150","body_markdown":"I am attempting to download a PDF that is generated by my server when a user clicks on a download button.

You need a way to set that value so when the user clicks again then the postback has the same data it had the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next step would be to save the page &#39;state&#39; somewhere and send it back and forth with each request. You already do this somewhat with ViewBag, but generally we use Model Binding for this. If you continue with tutorials you should find Model Binding soon.  This tutorial does happen to save the SearchTerm.

*I set about asking this question wrongly, so I am starting again, beginning with the specifics of the issue I am wrestling with, rather\r\n&gt; than the general features of the issue.*\r\n\r\nI have an object in which the values are strings. They pretty much need to be strings because they are extracted from HTML5 custom `data-*` attributes and I really don&#39;t want to start writing javascript inside HTML attributes, like it&#39;s 1999.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example of one of the custom `data-*` attributes:\r\n\r\n    data-event=&quot;{&#171;eventListener&#187; : &#171;transitionend&#187;, &#171;eventAction&#187; : &#171;showText&#187;}&quot;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it&#39;s basically a JSON string, slightly modified, so that it can take the form of an HTML attribute value.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to parse that custom `data-*` attribute and translate it into the following javascript:\r\n\r\n    parentElement.addEventListener(&#39;transitionend&#39;, showText, false);\r\n\r\nTo do this, I need to:\r\n\r\n 1. Replace the `&#171;` and `&#187;` characters with the `&quot;` character\r\n 2. `JSON.parse` the resulting value into an object\r\n 3. Create the `useCapture` parameter if it doesn&#39;t exist (as in this example)\r\n 4. Then it&#39;s straightforward (almost) for me to create the `addEventListener` statement\r\n\r\nIn fact - of course - I end up with this statement:\r\n\r\n    parentElement.addEventListener(&#39;transitionend&#39;, &#39;showText&#39;, false);\r\n\r\nwhich doesn&#39;t work because I can&#39;t invoke `&#39;showText&#39;` - it&#39;s just a string, it doesn&#39;t point to a function.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to fix this is to create this statement, instead:\r\n\r\n    parentElement.addEventListener(&#39;transitionend&#39;, eval(&#39;showText&#39;), false);\r\n\r\nwhich **is** equivalent to:\r\n\r\n    parentElement.addEventListener(&#39;transitionend&#39;, showText, false);\r\n\r\nThe only thing that&#39;s holding me back is my uncertainty over whether `eval()` should really never be used or whether it should simply mostly be avoided - and, despite normal warnings, ***this unusual situation*** is an acceptable situation in which to  deploy `eval()`.\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\n**Question:** Is it misguided or inadvisable in Javascript to take a string which happens to be the name of a function and to access and execute that function by using `eval()` on the string?\r\n\r\nIf it is inadvisable, what is the alternative, when I know the name of a function and I wish to insert it into an event handler?\r\n\r\nIf I&#39;m better off avoiding this:\r\n\r\n    parentElement.addEventListener(&#39;transitionend&#39;, eval(&#39;showText&#39;), false);\r\n\r\nwhat should I be using instead?\r\n\r\nOr... is it entirely acceptable to use `eval()` in *some* situations - and this is one of them?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223137/what-is-the-alternative-to-using-evalmyfunctionname-as-a-callback-in-an-event","title":"What is the alternative to using eval(myFunctionName) as a callback in an Event Listener?"},{"tags":["hyperledger-fabric","hyperledger","hyperledger-explorer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":198,"user_id":10235572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GHyJ8IXwXqA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASw/9a4UUPCTnWk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mohammed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10235572/mohammed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570429940,"post_id":58223130,"comment_id":102896786,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223130/hyperledger-explorer-docker-setup-is-not-working-with-the-hyperledger-fabric#comment102896786_58223130"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":9196921,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/550d8435c678215856cf65a0638ecde0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9196921/gins"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":198,"user_id":10235572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GHyJ8IXwXqA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASw/9a4UUPCTnWk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mohammed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10235572/mohammed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570615931,"post_id":58223130,"comment_id":102966152,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223130/hyperledger-explorer-docker-setup-is-not-working-with-the-hyperledger-fabric#comment102966152_58223130"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":8874164,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c081c8bb0d2e3acba0b97874080068d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nekia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8874164/nekia"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570649602,"creation_date":1570649602,"answer_id":58311090,"question_id":58223130,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311090","body_markdown":"First of all, I recommend trying to use explorer docker images with fabric-samples/first-network.\r\n\r\n    # After bringing up fabric-samples/first-network\r\n    \r\n    # Copy artifacts into the path which is mounted on explorer container\r\n    $ cp -a /some/where/fabric-samples/first-network/crypto-config/* examples/net1/crypto/\r\n    \r\n    # Edit connection profile to change secret key file name\r\n    $ vi examples/net1/connection-profile/first-network.json\r\n    $ git diff examples/\r\n    diff --git a/examples/net1/connection-profile/first-network.json b/examples/net1/connection-profile/first-network.json\r\n    index 45fff11..6f790b1 100644\r\n    --- a/examples/net1/connection-profile/first-network.json\r\n    +++ b/examples/net1/connection-profile/first-network.json\r\n    @@ -37,7 +37,7 @@\r\n                            &quot;mspid&quot;: &quot;Org1MSP&quot;,\r\n                            &quot;fullpath&quot;: true,\r\n                            &quot;adminPrivateKey&quot;: {\r\n    -

In this case, you may want to take a look at Joi (https://github.com/hapijs/joi) that has a very robust set of rules and is very flexible should you need to change your logic in the future\r\n\r\nThe way you typically work with Joi, you would start with defining the &quot;schemas&quot; (which is Joi language for &quot;validation rules&quot;) working your way from the &quot;leaf&quot; objects and up until you get to the root. Your code might look like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst prohibitedTerms = [&#39;select&#39;, &#39;from&#39;, &#39;yellow cat&#39;]\r\n\r\nconst orderBySchema = Joi.string().required().invalid(prohibitedTerms)\r\nconst conditionsParamSchema = Joi.string().required().invalid(prohibitedTerms)\r\nconst selectParamSchema = Joi.string().required().invalid(prohibitedTerms)\r\n\r\nconst whereParamSchema = Joi.object({\r\n  conditions: Joi.array().items(conditionsParamSchema).required(),\r\n  operator: Joi.string().optional\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst querySchema = Joi.object({\r\n  select: Joi.array().items(selectParamSchema).required(),\r\n  where: Joi.array().items(whereParamSchema).optional(),\r\n  orderBy: Joi.array().items(orderBySchema).optional()\r\n})\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nconst myData = &lt;something that needs to be validated&gt;\r\nconst { error, value } = querySchema.validate(myData)\r\nif (error) {\r\n  // Raise alarm about invalid input, possible injection etc. \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou probably have noticed repetitive `Joi.string().required().invalid(prohibitedTerms)` - this is done just for illustration, normally this type of repetitive schema definition would be declared as a common constant and reused.\r\n\r\nAt first, it may seem that this approach is far more verbose than the &quot;straight&quot; validation by hand and requires more work than it should. In reality, separating validation rules from the actual code makes it far more flexible and maintainable solution - and far more readable, too. Normally the schemas would be defined in their own shared module and imported whenever the data needs to be checked.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223126/validate-an-object-if-contains-sql-statements-in-its-fields/58245447#58245447","title":"Validate an object if contains SQL Statements in its fields"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":11499911,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b0ead9c65c498e027338ddcdf525b43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"basel.ai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11499911/basel-ai"},"last_editor":{"reputation":48,"user_id":11499911,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b0ead9c65c498e027338ddcdf525b43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"basel.ai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11499911/basel-ai"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58245447,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570251272,"creation_date":1570119289,"last_edit_date":1570217247,"question_id":58223126,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58223126","body_markdown":"I have the following structure of an object `queryParams`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default interface Query {\r\n    select: SelectParam[];\r\n    where?: WhereParam[];\r\n    orderBy?: OrderByParam[];\r\n}\r\nexport interface SelectParam {\r\n    field: string;\r\n}\r\nexport interface WhereParam {\r\n    conditions: ConditionsParam[];\r\n    operator?: string;\r\n}\r\nexport interface ConditionsParam {\r\n    prop: string;\r\n}\r\nexport interface OrderByParam {\r\n    prop: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI need to validate its fields, even the nested ones or the ones that are arrays of object, if it contains an SQL injected statements into them.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m doing the validation this way, which I think that it&#39;s not efficient nor dynamic .. is there a better way to do that?\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst res = queryParams.select.find(i =&gt;\r\n            (i.aggregator ?

One or more `?` or `&amp;` characters, followed by\r\n 2. group #1: one or more characters that aren&#39;t `=` or `&amp;`, followed by\r\n 3. an `=`, followed by\r\n 4. group #2: zero or more characters that aren&#39;t `&amp;`\r\n \r\nGroup #1 captures the parameter names and group #2 captures their values.\r\n\r\nAs for the callback function (`function(a,key,value) { ...`) passed to `replace`, let&#39;s ask MDN:\r\n\r\n&gt;  You can specify a function as the second parameter. In this case, the function will be invoked after the match has been performed. The function&#39;s result (return value) will be used as the replacement string. … Note that the function will be invoked multiple times for each full match to be replaced if the regular expression in the first parameter is global.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The arguments to the function are as follows:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;   - **`match`** – The matched substring.\r\n&gt;   - **`p1, p2, ...`** – The *n*th string found by a parenthesized capture group, provided the first argument to `replace()` was a `RegExp` object.\r\n&gt;   - …\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; (Source: [MDN: `String.prototype.replace` – Specifying a function as a parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#Specifying_a_function_as_a_parameter))\r\n\r\n(I&#39;ve omitted the rest as it doesn&#39;t pertain to our question.)\r\n\r\nWhat this tells us is that the function is called for every match, i.e. every parameter name-value pair in the string, and that the second argument (`p1`, or `key` in your code) holds the string captured by group #1 and the third argument (`p2`/`value`) holds the string captured by group #2.\r\n\r\nThe code you&#39;ve found is really using `replace` for its side-effect: It&#39;s a really simple way to iterate all of the matches in a string.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/l7BZ9.png\r\n[2]: https://regexper.com/#%2F%5B%3F%26%5D%2B%28%5B%5E%3D%26%5D%2B%29%3D%28%5B%5E%26%5D*%29%2Fgi\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## A better way\r\n\r\nAs noted in the blog post you linked to, if you&#39;re targeting current browsers, instead of parsing the query string manually you should use [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams/URLSearchParams), which is intended for this exact purpose:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const query = &#39;?foo=1&amp;bar=2&#39;;\r\n\r\n    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(query);\r\n\r\n    // Get a specific param\r\n    const foo = searchParams.get(&#39;foo&#39;);\r\n    console.log(&#39;got foo:&#39;, foo);\r\n\r\n    // Iterate over all params\r\n    searchParams.forEach((val, key) =&gt; console.log(key, &#39;is&#39;, val));\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nURLSearchParams works in [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=urlsearchparams), including MS Edge ≥ 17 (but not IE). The also exist [polyfills](https://github.com/ungap/url-search-params) for older browsers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58223113/returning-url-parameters-values-using-regular-expression-in-javascript/58223678#58223678","title":"Returning URL parameters values using regular expression in Javascript"}],"owner":{"reputation":77,"user_id":5426865,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWPNK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Newbie_Android","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5426865/newbie-android"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58223678,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570121941,"creation_date":1570119255,"question_id":58223113,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58223113","body_markdown":"While I was looking for a way to return url parameter values, I&#39;ve come across this bit of code. \r\n\r\n   Reference: https://html-online.com/articles/get-url-parameters-javascript/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    function getUrlParts(href) {\r\n    \tvar partsSet = {};\r\n    \tvar parts = href.replace(/[?&amp;]+([^=&amp;]+)=([^&amp;]*)/gi, function(a,key,value) {\r\n            partsSet[key] = value;\r\n        });\r\n        return partsSet;\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n\r\nI managed to use this code to achieve what I wanted to do however I don&#39;t understand it.
