Since you are not removing any element for vector `A` or `B` so terminating condition will never satisfy.

I am also using a proxy server.  I have been testing this repeatedly as I refine how I process the data.  All morning, it worked fine.  The code that I used to authenticate the proxy server is code I have also used in another script that gets data from an API, one that I ran over and over without trouble.  However, today I came back from lunch, ran the same code that I had not changed, and got this error:\r\n\r\nProxyError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host=XXX, port=443): Max retries exceeded with url:XXX (Caused by ProxyError(&#39;Cannot connect to proxy.&#39;, error(&#39;Tunnel connection failed: 407 Proxy Authentication Required&#39;,)))\r\n\r\nI also got this when trying to connect to google so it&#39;s not just that site.  My internet is working fine and I am able to do proxy authentication from the command line PowerShell and get this same data.\r\n\r\nI have read many other posts about this problem and tried their suggestions, however all of them appear to be about someone who couldn&#39;t get it working to begin with, not someone that had it working and then it suddenly stopped worked.  \r\n\r\nHere is the original proxy authentication code, which has been working for weeks:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproxy = urllib2.ProxyHandler({&#39;http&#39;: &#39;http://XXX/Username:password@proxyurl:proxyport&#39;})\r\nauth = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler()\r\nopener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy, auth, urllib2.HTTPHandler)\r\nurllib2.install_opener(opener)\r\nurl = &quot;https://api.com&quot;\r\nrequest_headers = { &quot;Content-Type&quot; : &quot;application/json&quot;, &quot;authorization&quot; : accessToken, } &#39;Access token generated elsewhere in code\r\n\r\nr = requests.get(url = URL, headers = request_headers)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\n--Various ways of formatting the proxy URL, username and password\r\n\r\n--Adding verify=false to requests.get\r\n\r\n--Setting ```proxies = { &#39;http&#39; : &#39;Username:Password@proxyip:proxyport&#39; } ``` and then adding proxies = proxies to requests.get\r\n\r\n--time.sleep to wait and try again (it just kept retrying and retrying forever)\r\n\r\n--Using requests.Session()\r\n\r\n--Alternating http vs https: for the proxy \r\n\r\n--Using http instead of https for the API address--this didn&#39;t give the error, but also didn&#39;t provide me with any data and got me a response 407 (but returned as a variable, not as an error), probably because that&#39;s not the right address\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that only when trying to correct this problem did I realize that I&#39;d been using an old password, which I changed a couple of weeks ago. How it was able to ignore this all morning, I don&#39;t know.  However correcting the password in all of the things I&#39;ve tried doesn&#39;t make a difference.  Was it somehow storing old proxy settings and then at some point it refreshed and kicked me off and now I can&#39;t get back in?  Again my internet is working fine and I can log into the proxy server via PowerShell.   \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140440/proxy-suddenly-not-working-max-retries-exceeded-with-url","title":"Proxy suddenly not working--max retries exceeded with URL"},{"tags":["css","yaml","amazon-cognito"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7699594,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5e4lQxenEZw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJo/K4nRBh4bD0w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Marc Munic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7699594/marc-munic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569618091,"post_id":58140684,"comment_id":102668792,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140436/customize-aws-cognito-sign-in-page-css-through-cognitoconfig-yaml-file/58140684#comment102668792_58140684"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4030,"user_id":2528083,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7DC1A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Atul Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2528083/atul-sharma"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569614226,"creation_date":1569614226,"answer_id":58140684,"question_id":58140436,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58140684","body_markdown":"You can modify the css classes provided and use AWS CLI to push updates.\r\n\r\n    background-customizable\r\n    banner-customizable\r\n    errorMessage-customizable\r\n    idpButton-customizable\r\n    idpButton-customizable:hover\r\n    inputField-customizable\r\n    inputField-customizable:focus + few more. \r\n\r\nAWS provides the list of classes used on cognito user pool UI which you can modify.\r\n\r\nuse `--css &quot;.classname{field : value}&quot;` with `aws cognito-idp set-ui-customization` command to update. \r\n\r\nLike :- \r\n\r\n    aws cognito-idp set-ui-customization --user-pool-id &lt;your-user-pool-id&gt; --client-id \r\n    &lt;your-app-client-id&gt; --image-file &lt;path-to-logo-image-file&gt; --css &quot;.label-\r\n    customizable{ color: &lt;color&gt;;}&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140436/customize-aws-cognito-sign-in-page-css-through-cognitoconfig-yaml-file/58140684#58140684","title":"Customize AWS cognito sign in page CSS through cognitoConfig.yaml file"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7699594,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5e4lQxenEZw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJo/K4nRBh4bD0w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Marc Munic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7699594/marc-munic"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569614226,"creation_date":1569612444,"question_id":58140436,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58140436","body_markdown":"I am automating the creating userpool process in AWS Cognito.

Examples of my current thinking about client code organisation are in there. YMMV.\r\n\r\n1. &quot;One class per file&quot; is more of a Java style guideline than Python. Python modules are a legitimate and important level in the code hierarchy, and you shouldn&#39;t worry about having more than one function or class in the same module. You could put all the model classes in a `.models` module, and then `from .models import (Account, Order, Category)` in `__init__.py`.\r\n\r\n2. More-or-less common practice for client libraries seems to be to have a `client` module, containing something like a `MyServiceClient` class. (eg [the Segment client](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-python/blob/master/analytics/client.py)). This is where the networking logic goes. If you want to have the public interface be module-level functions, you can do some clever stuff with creating a default client and having the functions call methods on that.\r\n\r\nFunctions should be `snake_case`, classes should be `PascalCase`. Doing anything else tends to cause more confusion than benefit.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the big question you&#39;re dealing with is trying to choose between the &quot;Active Record&quot; pattern (`some_account.set_order_comment(comment)`), and the &quot;Data Mapper&quot; pattern (`set_order_comment(account, comment)`). Either will work and they each have their benefits and drawbacks. I&#39;ve found the data mapper pattern -- using smart functions to manipulate fairly simple data classes -- simpler to begin with.\r\n\r\nI find it helpful to design the public interface concurrently with something that uses that interface. In the calling code, you can write what you&#39;d like to have to call, and then implement the client code &quot;outside-in&quot;.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140435/how-to-organize-python-api-module-to-make-it-neat/58215010#58215010","title":"How to organize Python API module to make it neat?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":105,"user_id":2880688,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc246883adcaea613b24a067aacb2205?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Anonymouse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2880688/anonymouse"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570363341,"post_id":58252597,"comment_id":102883001,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140435/how-to-organize-python-api-module-to-make-it-neat/58252597#comment102883001_58252597"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1025,"user_id":6515755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1064376696971764/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ryabchenko Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6515755/ryabchenko-alexander"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1025,"user_id":6515755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1064376696971764/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ryabchenko Alexander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6515755/ryabchenko-alexander"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570465552,"last_edit_date":1570465552,"creation_date":1570312204,"answer_id":58252597,"question_id":58140435,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58252597","body_markdown":"1)  no upper case in names of .py file  (also try to avoid `_`)\r\nso your files should be \r\n\r\n    __init__.py\r\n    account.py\r\n    order.py\r\n    category.py\r\n    requests.py\r\n\r\n2) if you want to use like `cool_site.Account` you need to add to `__init__.py`\r\n\r\n    from .account import Account\r\n    from .order import Order\r\n    from .category import Category\r\n    \r\n    __all__ = [\r\n        &#39;Account&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Order&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Category&#39;,\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n3) `SetOrderComment` is bad name, use `set_order_comment`\r\n\r\n\r\n4) If you write a python wrapper for communication with API, make method that do authorisation and other other stuff that is same in every API request.

Right now, my library directory looks close to this:\r\n\r\n- `__init__.py`\r\n- `Account.py`\r\n- `Order.py`\r\n- `Category.py`\r\n- `requests.py`\r\n\r\nIn `__init__.py`, I have something like this:\r\n```\r\nfrom .Account import Account\r\nfrom .Order import Order\r\nfrom .Category import Category\r\nfrom . import requests\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows to use `import cool_site` and then `cool_site.Account(…)` and so on, but it has a following problem: when I play around with my code in IDLE, the object is then called `cool_site.Account.Account`, which I feel is bad.\r\n\r\n### 1. Is there any way to avoid class name duplication and still have separate file for every class?\r\n\r\nThe next thing I don&#39;t feel great about is my code organization. Right now, my `Account` class takes credentials on initialization, creates a `requests.Session` object and then handles all communication with server, i.e. searching for orders and so on. This `Account` class instance will then pass itself to all other instances, for example to `Order` - so the order&#39;s instance will have `.account` property holding the `Account` instance which created it. When another class instance itself has to do something, for example change an order&#39;s comment (by calling `o.comment = &#39;new comment&#39;`, so by `@comment.setter` decorator in the `Order` class), it forwards that to an Account object which is passed to it on initialization, and then uses for example `self.account.set_order_comment(new_comment)`. This method will then use all the web requests to achieve that goal.\r\n\r\n### 2. Is it better to hold server communication logic in one class or to spread different aspects of it to classes that are affected by them?\r\n\r\nThe last thing I&#39;d like to ask about is how and where to keep low-level request templates. Right now I have it in `cool_site.requests` submodule, and there are different functions for different requests, for example `SetOrderComment` for the case mentioned above (it&#39;s a function, so it should be lowercase, but in this case I think it resembles a class in a way - is that OK?). The `Account.set_order_comment` will use it like this:\r\n```\r\nr = cool_site.requests.SetOrderComment(order.id, new_comment)\r\nresponse = self._session.request(**r)\r\n```\r\nbecause this function returns a dict with arguments to `Session.request` function from `requests` library.

This is what I have tried:\r\n\r\n    for item in converted_data:\r\n    \tfor key, value in item.items():\r\n    \t\tif type(value) == dict:\r\n                #Implement\r\n                pass\r\n    \t\telif type(value) == list:\r\n                #Implement\r\n    \t\t\tpass\r\n    \t\telse:\t\r\n    \t\t\toutfile.write(&quot;    {}  :  {},\\n&quot;.format(key, value))\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even before finishing it I see it is a wrong approach that would make something this simple very complicated. I have looked at SO but didn&#39;t find questions similar to my problem. So, how should I do this?\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t need to be the file to be exactly like I suggested. I just need it to be both human- and machine-readable. \r\n\r\nI will be grateful for any suggestions as to how to solve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140373/how-to-format-a-list-of-nested-dictionaries-for-writing-to-a-file-in-a-human-rea","title":"How to format a list of nested dictionaries for writing to a file in a human readable form"},{"tags":["macos","ubuntu"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":598683,"user_id":15168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtEI9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Leffler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569612411,"post_id":58140372,"comment_id":102667219,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140372/how-to-use-ubuntu-commands-in-macos-x#comment102667219_58140372"},{"owner":{"reputation":317293,"user_id":440558,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZYta.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Some programmer dude","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440558/some-programmer-dude"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569612481,"post_id":58140372,"comment_id":102667230,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140372/how-to-use-ubuntu-commands-in-macos-x#comment102667230_58140372"},{"owner":{"reputation":598683,"user_id":15168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtEI9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Leffler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569612726,"post_id":58140372,"comment_id":102667296,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140372/how-to-use-ubuntu-commands-in-macos-x#comment102667296_58140372"},{"owner":{"reputation":77802,"user_id":89817,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df253c3b6533949ea94f31f328f3e769?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Davisson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/89817/gordon-davisson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569617996,"post_id":58140372,"comment_id":102668758,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140372/how-to-use-ubuntu-commands-in-macos-x#comment102668758_58140372"}],"owner":{"reputation":2607,"user_id":3732958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93dfeb2c9272a13d94a4b4f1dc74f219?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2121","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732958/user2121"},"last_editor":{"reputation":119164,"user_id":4342498,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3j88.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NathanOliver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4342498/nathanoliver"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569612652,"creation_date":1569612034,"last_edit_date":1569612652,"question_id":58140372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58140372","body_markdown":"I am new to macOS and Ubuntu and I would like to learn how to execute Ubuntu or macOS commands from C++.

However the documentation is not clear what concrete values are acceptable for `type`:\r\n\r\n[`public void setReplacement (String pkg, String type, String name, Object replacement)`][1] \r\n\r\n&gt; type\tThe type name, e.g. string. See Resources.getResourceTypeName(int).\r\n\r\nTracing back the path through the AOSP sources what values can be returned by `Resources.getResourceTypeName(int)` and therefore are a valid resource type name you end up in the file [Resource.cpp](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/e80b45506501815061b079dcb10bf87443bd385d/tools/aapt2/Resource.cpp#L47) and it&#39;s `StringPiece to_string(ResourceType type)` method. It contains all possible resource type names. At the moment therefore the following values are allowed:\r\n\r\n    &quot;^attr-private&quot;\r\n    &quot;anim&quot;\r\n    &quot;animator&quot;\r\n    &quot;array&quot;\r\n    &quot;attr&quot;\r\n    &quot;bool&quot;\r\n    &quot;color&quot;\r\n    &quot;configVarying&quot;\r\n    &quot;dimen&quot;\r\n    &quot;drawable&quot;\r\n    &quot;font&quot;\r\n    &quot;fraction&quot;\r\n    &quot;id&quot;\r\n    &quot;integer&quot;\r\n    &quot;interpolator&quot;\r\n    &quot;layout&quot;\r\n    &quot;menu&quot;\r\n    &quot;mipmap&quot;\r\n    &quot;navigation&quot;\r\n    &quot;plurals&quot;\r\n    &quot;raw&quot;\r\n    &quot;string&quot;\r\n    &quot;style&quot;\r\n    &quot;styleable&quot;\r\n    &quot;transition&quot;\r\n    &quot;xml&quot;\r\n\r\nIn your case you used `&quot;string-array&quot;` which would be consistent with the xml tag the resource was defined it. However as you can see this type is not a valid resource type name. The correct resource type therefore in your case is `&quot;array&quot;`.\r\n\r\nTherefore you should change the type to `&quot;array&quot;` for the following two lines:\r\n\r\n

I am really not sure what I am doing wrong, but when I put the same data into barplot I get the correct plot, but I am unable to make the modifications I want in my plot.  What I am trying to do is take a set of mitochondrial genome sequence data and create a barplot of average SNPs per Region number.  I then want the bars to be colored by the gene name and finally I would like to place a second x axis label below the region number labeling which has the gene name with the color.  Note that this is quite a bit of data so my region number (x) goes from 1 to 19524, and my average goes from 0 to around 20,000 (y) depending on the region of course.\r\n\r\nWhen I plot it in barplot it looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nand in ggplot it looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code I am currently using looks like this:\r\nAs you can see I am not done with the ggplot figuring out how to do the additional x-axis lables I want, but since I cannot get all the bars to show up it seems a bit invalid to try to get more on these at this moment.\r\n\r\n    data2&lt;-aggregate(data_sub[, 7], list(data_sub$regnum), mean)\r\n    barplot(names=data2$Group.1, height = data2$x, width = 30, ylim=c(0,24000), xlim=c(0,19525))\r\n    ggplot(data=data_sub) +\r\n      geom_bar(aes(x=regnum, y=Coverage,fill = as.factor(mtDNA_sequence_Gene)), stat = &quot;summary&quot;, fun.y = &quot;mean&quot;, width=5)   +  \r\n        scale_x_discrete( expand = c(0, 0)) \r\n\r\nIt would be hard to create a fake dataset for this data due to the fact that I think the amount of data may be a big part of the problem.  But hopefully, someone will have some ideas for me :)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140324/r-function-barplot-is-working-but-ggplot2-is-not","title":"R function barplot is working but ggplot2 is not"},{"tags":["python","pandas","loops","for-loop","nltk"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":4947891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f5b6df3e5bd9d60f114ff781ef4db9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vatsal gosar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4947891/vatsal-gosar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569678047,"post_id":58140322,"comment_id":102678254,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140322/create-pandas-dataframe-with-results-from-python-for-loop#comment102678254_58140322"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":121,"user_id":11893426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/071c6fbbba985a7ecce8474faa9d3055?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11893426/andrew"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569612277,"post_id":58140370,"comment_id":102667191,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140322/create-pandas-dataframe-with-results-from-python-for-loop/58140370#comment102667191_58140370"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569612033,"creation_date":1569612033,"answer_id":58140370,"question_id":58140322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58140370","body_markdown":" - Create a `list` of `dicts` by adding two lines of code, as shown below.\r\n - Create a `dataframe` from `sentiments_list`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nsentiments_list = list()  # add this line\r\n\r\nfor chapter in chapters:\r\n    sentence_list = tokenize.sent_tokenize(chapter)\r\n    sentiments = {&#39;compound&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.0, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.0}\r\n\r\n    for sentence in sentence_list:\r\n        vs = analyzer.polarity_scores(sentence)\r\n        sentiments[&#39;compound&#39;] += vs[&#39;compound&#39;]\r\n        sentiments[&#39;neg&#39;] += vs[&#39;neg&#39;]\r\n        sentiments[&#39;neu&#39;] += vs[&#39;neu&#39;]\r\n        sentiments[&#39;pos&#39;] += vs[&#39;pos&#39;]\r\n\r\n    sentiments[&#39;compound&#39;] = sentiments[&#39;compound&#39;] / len(sentence_list)\r\n    sentiments[&#39;neg&#39;] = sentiments[&#39;neg&#39;] / len(sentence_list)\r\n    sentiments[&#39;neu&#39;] = sentiments[&#39;neu&#39;] / len(sentence_list)\r\n    sentiments[&#39;pos&#39;] = sentiments[&#39;pos&#39;] / len(sentence_list)\r\n\r\n    sentiments_list.append(sentiments)  # add this line\r\n    \r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(sentiments_list)  # add this line\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `df` output:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n compound       neg       neu       pos\r\n 0.221757  0.041515  0.868262  0.090243\r\n 0.095772  0.062664  0.842964  0.094400\r\n 0.058558  0.063476  0.862181  0.074400\r\n 0.128009  0.037605  0.890349  0.072081\r\n-0.008435  0.077031  0.849608  0.073338\r\n 0.200253  0.027412  0.910294  0.062235\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140322/create-pandas-dataframe-with-results-from-python-for-loop/58140370#58140370","title":"Create pandas dataframe with results from Python &#39;for loop&#39;"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":11878847,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hxZsR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11878847/nmb"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58140370,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569612253,"creation_date":1569611812,"question_id":58140322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58140322","body_markdown":"New to Python and trying to create a simple pandas dataframe from this for loop.

I have a source code to introduce to people to have some demos on it. However, my biggest issue is the source code security.\r\n\r\nDepending on my findings, compiling the python files with `cython` is one of the best option to secure my source code. There are actually few problems that I need to ask.\r\n\r\n**1)** I am pretty newbie in cython, exactly one day of researching about it, is it really the best option to secure my source code?\r\n\r\n**2)** If cython is not the best option, I am not experienced with *C/C++*, are there any options to do so?\r\n\r\n**3)** I have read that, practically, it is really hard to decompile the `.pyd` (I&#39;m using Windows) files. Is it really the case?\r\n\r\n**4)** After I got the `.pyd` file, I am planning to have a `main.py` to run it, and then using `pyinstaller` to have a standalone `.exe` file to distribute my code. Is it a viable option?\r\n\r\n**5)** Different than above, could you suggest me further thins that I have not listed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your precious ideas and sparing your time to enlight me further.

But even if this is possible, I could not figure out a way to do it correctly.\r\n - MessageHandler- I think a per-route message handler is not ideal, but I could use dependency injection to retrieve the _metaData and then...append this object data to the posted data? This feels hacky and I&#39;m not very enthusiastic about this type of solution.\r\n - Dependency Injection- I could give PostModel a reference to the service during its own instantiation, however the Controller and the Model live in separate projects, with the Model project not having a Unity Container dependency at present.  Instead, it relies on the Controller project and other referencing projects to use their own DI to pass any required data.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is some kind of action-level Attribute I&#39;m not aware of that would benefit me here, or maybe one of the above was on the right track?   I have to believe there is a way to pass/access dynamic server-side data during deserialization or at least by validation of the Model that I&#39;m just not aware of or thinking of the proper way to do.\r\n\r\nTwo additional notes:\r\n\r\n - I am using Asp.Net WebAPI and do not have access to Core WebAPI attributes, filters, etc.\r\n - The Post action is in ProjectA but PostModel is in ProjectB.  ProjectA references projectB, but the inverse is not true.

You should try to create smaller functions, with one -or maybe 2- level. Moreover on recursive functions, the less it uses variable, the less it will eat your stack. Small functions often \r\nlead to functions that individually have smaller memory footprint.\r\n\r\nThe C, unlike python, is not seen as a _try something and see if it works_. Your second opendir may cause issues. let&#39;s say it opens the directory `/home/users/toto/work`. You opened your directory, and just after you will call do_ls which .... will open `/home/users/toto/work` an other time. Having the same directory opened twice... well, I have no idea if it works, but it is not good. Do not use opendir to see if a file is a directory, use `stat ( man 2 )`\r\n\r\nYou never close your directories. You won&#39;t be able to use your find on a big tree. In C you have to release manually every ressources that is not a chunk of memory stack.\r\n\r\nUsing a recursive function in that case is not a problem, in my opinion it is easier to implement this kind of program recursively. But it would be better to open a directory, store all it&#39;s content, close the directory, and then read through the stored content. So you always keep as few directory as possible.\r\n\r\nCreate a function that is dedicated to concatenante path components ( and which will ), when beginning, smalls functionnalities like this are often kinda boring to debug and you may want to have a dedicated and easy to test function to do this job.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140286/how-to-implement-the-find-function-in-unix-using-recursive-function-with-c/58141186#58141186","title":"How to implement the find() function in Unix using recursive function (with C)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7953573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff106111fcdfc33330776ddccb8e6e1c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S.Ryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7953573/s-ryan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7953573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff106111fcdfc33330776ddccb8e6e1c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S.Ryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7953573/s-ryan"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569617910,"creation_date":1569611655,"last_edit_date":1569611899,"question_id":58140286,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58140286","body_markdown":"[find [path]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/JO5KP.png\r\n\r\nThe way what i want it is shown in the attached picture.\r\nI use Mac Terminal.\r\nAll i want to do is show the path with find function.\r\n\r\nI want to implement the UNIX-find() command in C language.\r\nThere&#39;s a code i wrote, but I don&#39;t understand any of it, and I think it&#39;s too messy, so I&#39;ll ask you guys for help.\r\nIsn&#39;t there a simpler code and one that&#39;s easier to understand?\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\r\n\r\n    #define MAX_SIZE 1024\r\n    \r\n    void do_ls(char[], char[]);\r\n    void print_error(int, char[]);\r\n    \r\n    int main( int ac, char *av[] )\r\n    {\r\n        if( ac == 1 ) {\r\n            print_error(1, NULL);\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            printf(&quot;%s\\n&quot;, av[1]);\r\n            do_ls(av[1], av[1]);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void do_ls( char path[], char dirname[] ) { // recursive func\r\n        \r\n        DIR *dir_ptr;\r\n        struct dirent *direntp;\r\n        char buffer[MAX_SIZE] = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        \r\n        strcat(buffer, path);\r\n        \r\n        if((dir_ptr = opendir(dirname)) == NULL) {\r\n            print_error(2, dirname);\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            chdir(dirname);\r\n            while((direntp = readdir(dir_ptr)) != NULL) {\r\n                if(opendir(direntp-&gt;d_name) != NULL) {\r\n                    if(strcmp(direntp-&gt;d_name, &quot;.&quot;) != 0 &amp;&amp; strcmp(direntp-&gt;d_name, &quot;..&quot;) != 0) {\r\n                        strcat(buffer, &quot;/&quot;);\r\n                        strcat(buffer, direntp-&gt;d_name);\r\n                        printf(&quot;%s\\n&quot;, buffer);\r\n                        do_ls(buffer, direntp-&gt;d_name);\r\n                        strcpy(buffer, dirname);\r\n                        if(strcmp(buffer, &quot;.&quot;) != 0) {\r\n                            strcpy(buffer, &quot;./&quot;);\r\n                            strcat(buffer, dirname);\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                else {\r\n                    printf(&quot;%s/%s\\n&quot;, buffer, direntp-&gt;d_name);\r\n                    if(strcmp(buffer, &quot;.&quot;) != 0) {\r\n                        chdir(&quot;..&quot;);\r\n                        strcpy(buffer, &quot;.&quot;);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void print_error(int error_num, char dirname[]) {\r\n        switch(error_num) {\r\n            case 1:\r\n                printf(&quot;usage : find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ...

I am trying to determine if the bills are potentially accurate. The only data I have is the actual bill itself. Here&#39;s where things get complicated. There are four scenarios, each with their own nuances:\r\n\r\nScenario 1 Nuances:\r\n\r\n 1. Base Fee of $10 * the amount of items bought * the number of deliveries (maximum amount of items bought would be 10 and the maximum number of deliveries would be 7)\r\n 2. If the amount of items bought exceeds 1, the total bill is discounted by 20%\r\n 3. If the boxes are recycled, the total bill is further discounted by 15%\r\n 4. If the good is over 15 pounds, an additional charge of $10 will be assessed per each item over 15 pounds (maximum amount of items would be 10)\r\n 5. If there is no adequate port for delivery, an additional $50 per hour will be charged per delivery (maximum hours would be 3)\r\n\r\nScenario 2 Nuances:\r\n\r\n 1. Business that share a port of delivery for the second service will be charged $11 per item\r\n 2. If the business does not share a port of delivery, the fee is $13 per item. Each additionally delivery for a business that does not share a port is $15 per delivery, in addition to each item costing $13 (maximum deliveries would be 7 and maximum amount of items would be 8).\r\n\r\nYou see where I am going with all of this. The next two scenarios are just as lengthy. Sadly, no information besides the total bill is given. We don&#39;t know which scenario the bill belongs to, the number of items, etc., just a single column of the invoice. How would I go about determining all potential costs from each scenario to maybe index the invoice and see if there is a match? Any help on this would be amazing.\r\n\r\nI tried creating an index where I wrote out multiple scenarios. For example, a column with the number of items, the number of deliveries, a discount for &gt; 1 item bought, a recycling discount, etc... After attempting this for two hours, I realized this may not be the best method. My first row would be 1 item, 1 delivery, 0% discount for &gt; 1 item bought, and 0% discount for recycling. Next would be 2 items bought, 1 delivery, 20% discount for &gt; 1 item bought, 0% discount for recycling. This is seemingly impossible to do for everything.\r\n\r\nMy expected output is &quot;Y&quot; if the invoice total matches one of the potential costs from the index, &quot;N&quot; if not.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140266/billing-variance-analysis-with-many-scenarios-vba","title":"Billing Variance Analysis With Many Scenarios - VBA"},{"tags":["ios","node.js","reactjs","safari"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4030,"user_id":2528083,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7DC1A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Atul Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2528083/atul-sharma"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569614692,"creation_date":1569614692,"answer_id":58140778,"question_id":58140265,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58140778","body_markdown":"The error most probably is occurring `due to mismatch in TLS versions` supported by the device &amp; Cloudfront. \r\n\r\nOlder devices works on TLS v1.1 or later, while the latest one on TLS v1.2 or newer.  \r\n\r\nMake sure while creating the Cloudfront cdn you have selected the correct configuration required.
