I have a follow up question based on [How To Setup Subdomains on iis][1]\r\n\r\nI am using IIS 8, and I am looking to point my subdomain to my current default website. Currently we have `www.mydomain.com`, and I setup a subdomain in our DNS A Record that is `account.mydomain.com` pointing to the same IP address of `mydomain.com`.\r\n\r\nI figured the way to create the subdomain is now to go to Site Bindings under the Default Website in IIS and add a site binding with the hostname `account.mydomain.com` but I am getting an error that says the server IP address cannot be found. The reason I didn&#39;t want to create a new Site in IIS is because we have certain properties and permissions that are setup.\r\n\r\nEventually we will be changing the IP Address of `www.mydomain.com` to be pointing to something new, but for the time being we need `account.mydomain.com` to point to the same location as `www.mydomain.com`\r\n\r\nImages for reference -\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4069278/how-to-set-up-subdomains-on-iis-7\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vXiJx.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zexPN.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222365/create-a-subdomain-and-point-it-to-domain-location","title":"Create a subdomain and point it to domain location"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","aws-lambda","yaml","amazon-cloudformation"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":12144992,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BD3Da.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Seth E","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12144992/seth-e"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570120805,"creation_date":1570120805,"answer_id":58223502,"question_id":58222357,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223502","body_markdown":"This should work using `!Join` and without the `${}`\r\n\r\n```\r\nScheduleExpression: !Join [&quot;rate (&quot;, !FindInMap [ QuiesceLambda, LambdaEvaluationPeriodMin ], &quot; minutes)&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have not tested this, so you may need to tweak it a bit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222357/how-do-you-sub-in-variables-to-a-string-in-yaml/58223502#58223502","title":"How do you sub in variables to a string in yaml?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":8571176,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lJDJx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GreatWhite","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8571176/greatwhite"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570202698,"creation_date":1570202698,"answer_id":58239303,"question_id":58222357,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58239303","body_markdown":"Suppose you have a mapping like\r\n\r\n    Mappings:\r\n      AnyName:\r\n        QuiesceLambda: \r\n           LambdaEvaluationPeriodMin: 5\r\n\r\nTo use 5 from the map and to define the string **rate(5 minutes)** you could use Join.\r\n\r\n    ScheduleExpression: !Join\r\n                        - &#39;&#39;\r\n                        - - &#39;rate(&#39;\r\n                          - !FindInMap [&#39;AnyName&#39;, &#39;QuiesceLambda&#39;, &#39;LambdaEvaluationPeriodMin&#39;]\r\n                          - &#39; minutes)&#39;\r\n\r\n&gt; **Note**: !FindInMap takes 3 arguments not 2.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222357/how-do-you-sub-in-variables-to-a-string-in-yaml/58239303#58239303","title":"How do you sub in variables to a string in yaml?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12160110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2684127368299928/picture?type=large","display_name":"Darren Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12160110/darren-li"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570202698,"creation_date":1570116397,"question_id":58222357,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222357","body_markdown":"This is my current parameter that I am working with for AWS Cloudformation.\r\n\r\n```ScheduleExpression: &quot;rate(5 minutes)&quot;```\r\n\r\nI want the &quot;5&quot; to be parameterized to a mapping I created by ```!FindInMap [ QuiesceLambda, LambdaEvaluationPeriodMin ]```\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to work.

`string` is an alias for `AnsiString`, as far as D2007 is concerned, there is no functional difference and the IDE feels free to substitute the more commonly used `string` in place of the actual type used. This can be thought of as a short sight but the experiment you perform is conclusive regarding whether the `AnsiString` type can be forced, this is not about your code but the IDE&#39;s.\r\n\r\nNothing needs to be done if only the package would be migrated. Because when compiled under XE7, the IDE cannot substitute `string` with `AnsiString` as the former is an alias for `UnicodeString` since D2009.\r\n\r\nHowever if consumers of the package are also to be migrated, you need to use a distinct type. Like\r\n\r\n    type\r\n      MyAnsiString = type AnsiString;\r\n\r\nNote that you won&#39;t be able to pass one of the types as a var parameter for the other ([link](http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Data_Types,_Variables,_and_Constants_Index_(Delphi))) but this will probably be of no consequence when used as a parameter for an event handler.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222355/how-to-set-an-ansistring-param-in-an-event-handler/58241970#58241970","title":"How to set an AnsiString param in an event handler?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3517,"user_id":4528159,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5XgW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fabrizio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4528159/fabrizio"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":100,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58241970,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570216043,"creation_date":1570116392,"question_id":58222355,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222355","body_markdown":"I&#39;m preparing some parts of a Delphi 2007 project to easily migrate to Delphi XE7. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve switched a parameter&#39;s type of an event handler from `string` to `AnsiString` (This particular event handler must work with `AnsiString`).\r\n\r\n**Runtime package:**\r\n\r\n      TMyAnsiStringFunction = function(const APar : AnsiString) : AnsiString of object;\r\n      TMyTestComponent = class(TComponent)\r\n      private\r\n        FMyAnsiStringFunction : TMyAnsiStringFunction;\r\n      published\r\n        property MyAnsiStringFunction : TMyAnsiStringFunction read FMyAnsiStringFunction write FMyAnsiStringFunction;\r\n      end;\r\n\r\n**Designtime package:**\r\n\r\n    procedure Register;\r\n    begin   \r\n      RegisterComponents(&#39;MyComponents&#39;, [TMyTestComponent]);\r\n    end;\r\n\r\nWhen I doubleclick on the `MyAnsiStringFunction` from the _Object Inspector_, it automatically creates a function with a `string` param and a `string` resulting type instead of `AnsiString`:\r\n\r\n      TForm1 = class(TForm)\r\n        MyTestComponent1: TMyTestComponent;\r\n        function MyTestComponent1MyAnsiStringFunction(const APar: string): string;\r\n      private\r\n        { Private declarations }\r\n      public\r\n        { Public declarations }\r\n      end;\r\n\r\nIf I manually change the param and resulting type from `string` to `AnsiString`, then I get the following error while saving changes:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; The MyTestComponent1MyAnsiStringFunction method referenced by\r\n&gt; MyTestComponent1.MyAnsiStringFunction has an incompatible parameter\r\n&gt; list.

If the command returns a non-zero value, the kubelet kills the Container and restarts it.\r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n&gt;The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a Container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a Container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.\r\n\r\nFro another point of view:\r\n\r\n__Pod is a top-level resource in the Kubernetes REST API.__ \r\n\r\nAs per docs:\r\nPods are ephemeral. They are not designed to run forever, and when a Pod is terminated it cannot be brought back. In general, Pods do not disappear until they are deleted by a user or by a controller.\r\nInformation about controllers can find [here][1]: \r\n&gt;So the best practise is to use controllers like describe above. You’ll rarely create individual Pods directly in Kubernetes–even singleton Pods. This is because Pods are designed as relatively ephemeral, disposable entities. When a Pod gets created (directly by you, or indirectly by a Controller), it is scheduled to run on a Node in your cluster. The Pod remains on that Node until the process is terminated, the pod object is deleted, the Pod is evicted for lack of resources, or the Node fails.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n&gt;Restarting a container in a Pod should not be confused with restarting the Pod. The Pod itself does not run, but is an environment the containers run in and persists until it is deleted\r\n&gt;\r\nBecause Pods represent running processes on nodes in the cluster, it is important to allow those processes to gracefully terminate when they are no longer needed (vs being violently killed with a KILL signal and having no chance to clean up). Users should be able to request deletion and know when processes terminate, but also be able to ensure that deletes eventually complete. When a user requests deletion of a Pod, the system records the intended grace period before the Pod is allowed to be forcefully killed, and a TERM signal is sent to the main process in each container. Once the grace period has expired, the KILL signal is sent to those processes, and the Pod is then deleted from the API server. If the Kubelet or the container manager is restarted while waiting for processes to terminate, the termination will be retried with the full grace period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the frontend to the cluster’s shared state through which all other components interact.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you use the Kubernetes API to create a Deployment, you provide a new desired state for the system. The Kubernetes Control Plane records that object creation, and carries out your instructions by starting the required applications and scheduling them to cluster nodes–thus making the cluster’s actual state match the desired state.\r\n\r\nHere you can find information about [processing pod termination][2].\r\n\r\nThere are different probes:\r\nFor example for HTTP probe:\r\n\r\n- even if your app isn’t an HTTP server, you can create a lightweight HTTP server inside your app to respond to the liveness probe. \r\n- Command\r\n- For command probes, Kubernetes runs a command inside your container. If the command returns with exit code 0 then the container is marked as healthy.\r\n\r\nMore about [probes and best practices][3].\r\n\r\nHope this help.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/#pods-and-controllers\r\n  [2]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#termination-of-pods\r\n  [3]: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-setting-up-health-checks-with-readiness-and-liveness-probes\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222334/is-container-where-liveness-or-readiness-probess-config-are-set-to-a-pod-check/58269858#58269858","title":"Is container where liveness or readiness probes&#39;s config are set to a &quot;pod check&quot; container?"}],"owner":{"reputation":247,"user_id":5036005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zmg4H.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dom Krulak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5036005/dom-krulak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":247,"user_id":5036005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zmg4H.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dom Krulak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5036005/dom-krulak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58225618,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570452341,"creation_date":1570116325,"last_edit_date":1570170350,"question_id":58222334,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222334","body_markdown":"I&#39;m following this task [Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes][1] \r\nand it&#39;s unclear to me whether a container where the check is made is a container only used to check the availability of a pod?

The table has few functionalities like sorting, filtering. The difficulty is to sort the data based on the column which I am displaying in the table and for that I want to get raw data instead of observable to sort. \r\n\r\n    @Select(UserState.userList)

I understand your question correctly, making your form in run time isn&#39;t an problem but you want to design also in that form size.\r\nYou could just set your form&#39;s height and width properties according to your resolution.\r\nLike for 1366x768, width-1366 height-768.\r\nYes, Resolution differences will be a major problem and I don&#39;t see anything you can do other than building an

Keywords are like: Honda, Fox, and Puffy.\r\n\r\nIf an element matches 2 or more keywords, then it clicks on the element.\r\n\r\n\r\n```c#\r\ndo\r\n            {\r\n                driver.Navigate().Refresh();\r\n                try\r\n                {\r\n                    driver.FindElement(By.LinkText(&quot;Breed Crewneck&quot;));\r\n                    elementFound = true;\r\n                }catch(NoSuchElementException error)\r\n                {\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;No such element found!&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            } while (elementFound == false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my current code. It only looks through the page for a LinkText element. This is **NOT** viable, as it requires a specific string; the LinkText option cannot use keywords. Additionally, it is a true/false conditional statement.

I tried searching up how to get an index for RangeIndex and there isn&#39;t much on this particular object.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222250/attributeerror-rangeindex-object-has-no-attribute-stop","title":"AttributeError: &#39;RangeIndex&#39; object has no attribute &#39;stop&#39;"},{"tags":["java","android","firebase","firebase-realtime-database"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2605,"user_id":11514534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10ca983c4ac8bcb07661de28130b991?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"second","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11514534/second"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570116389,"post_id":58222247,"comment_id":102820154,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222247/firebase-realtime-database-very-high-download-usage#comment102820154_58222247"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":100,"user_id":12032861,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/decf8af9d42e4b767d4c68fcfaac38b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jonyiash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12032861/jonyiash"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570118916,"post_id":58222361,"comment_id":102821473,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222247/firebase-realtime-database-very-high-download-usage/58222361#comment102821473_58222361"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":114654,"user_id":807126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNqK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Doug Stevenson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/807126/doug-stevenson"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570116404,"creation_date":1570116404,"answer_id":58222361,"question_id":58222247,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58222361","body_markdown":"The only bit of code that matters here is the query that gets a listener attached:\r\n\r\n    mDatabaseRef.child(&quot;FalMetinleri&quot;).addListenerForSingleValueEvent()\r\n\r\nWhat this is doing is fetching *everything* under the node &quot;FalMetinleri&quot;.

is meant to run on the Primary Node only as it is a single-source for fetching. This means it will not scale to a distributed/parallel solution such as Sqoop. Also if you hypothetically have 3 nodes in a NiFi cluster but 10 in a Hadoop cluster with Sqoop, naturally you&#39;ll get more parallelism in the latter.\r\n\r\nHowever, NiFi has the `GenerateTableFetch -&gt; ExecuteSQL` pattern for this. Instead of a single processor on a single node doing the full fetch, GenerateTableFetch will instead generate a number of flow files that each contain a SQL statement to fetch a &quot;page&quot; of data from the table. You can then use ExecuteSQL to actually fetch the rows.\r\n\r\nGenerateTableFetch still runs only on the primary node, but it does not fetch the rows itself; instead you&#39;d distribute the flow files among the cluster nodes using either a `Remote Process Group -&gt; Input Port` on the same cluster, or in recent versions of NiFi you can use a Load-Balanced Connection between GenerateTableFetch and ExecuteSQL.\r\n\r\nOnce the flow files are distributed among the cluster, each node can run ExecuteSQL on them in parallel and fetch a page of data at a time for downstream processing.\r\n\r\nFor the output format, as of NiFi 1.8.0 there is ExecuteSQLRecord which allows you to output the rows in any format that has a RecordSetWriter, which includes Avro, JSON, CSV, XML, Free-text (for custom textual formats), and you can even script your own for more complex, proprietary, or currently unsupported formats. For completeness there is also a QueryDatabaseTableRecord processor, but for this answer I&#39;d like to discourage you from using it to solve your use case :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222239/nifi-increasing-querydatabasetable-performance-to-outperform-sqoop/58222900#58222900","title":"NiFi - Increasing QueryDatabaseTable performance to outperform Sqoop"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":894,"user_id":6948225,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVZPd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lars G Olsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6948225/lars-g-olsen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570219801,"creation_date":1570219801,"answer_id":58242671,"question_id":58222239,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58242671","body_markdown":"In my opinion 1M rows per hour is waaaay too slow for a Netezza system. \r\n\r\n - External tables/unload should be 50-100 times faster\r\n - single Select though ODBC to a fast client (I have used powercenter and SAS) 5-10 times faster\r\n\r\nPlease note that minimum query time on Netezza is close to 1/8 second, which means you need to get full value for ‘money’ in each query (quite possible btw) and I suspect that you framework tries to ‘over optimize’ this behind the scenes:)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222239/nifi-increasing-querydatabasetable-performance-to-outperform-sqoop/58242671#58242671","title":"NiFi - Increasing QueryDatabaseTable performance to outperform Sqoop"}],"owner":{"reputation":1244,"user_id":3213111,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fab61b522d1f7634d253887cfa3bc22e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bp2010","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3213111/bp2010"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58222900,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570219801,"creation_date":1570116043,"question_id":58222239,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222239","body_markdown":"I am using QueryDatabaseTable to read from a PDA/Netezza table that has about 70 million rows.\r\n\r\nNifi is set up as a single node instance with `bootstrap.conf` edited to give 16g RAM.\r\n\r\nQueryDatabase table is using defaults except for \r\n\r\n - `Max Rows Per Flow File`: 1000000\r\n - `Output Batch Size`: 10\r\n\r\nThe result is that it is taking quite long, 1.5 hours for the full 70M, or approx. 1M records p/minute.\r\n\r\n1.

Is this possible?  \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222239/nifi-increasing-querydatabasetable-performance-to-outperform-sqoop","title":"NiFi - Increasing QueryDatabaseTable performance to outperform Sqoop"},{"tags":["powershell"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14580,"user_id":2102693,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD3s8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bill_Stewart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2102693/bill-stewart"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570116489,"post_id":58222234,"comment_id":102820215,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222234/how-can-i-recursively-move-files-multiple-times-with-powershell#comment102820215_58222234"},{"owner":{"reputation":1845,"user_id":2486496,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rpd3r.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"gravity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2486496/gravity"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570117501,"post_id":58222234,"comment_id":102820733,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222234/how-can-i-recursively-move-files-multiple-times-with-powershell#comment102820733_58222234"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13537,"user_id":645128,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nbtn9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ryyker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/645128/ryyker"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13537,"user_id":645128,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nbtn9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ryyker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/645128/ryyker"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570117879,"last_edit_date":1570117879,"creation_date":1570116493,"answer_id":58222382,"question_id":58222234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58222382","body_markdown":"This excerpt is from a PowerShell script:  \r\n\r\n&gt; .SYNOPSIS     Script to delete or list old files in a folder  \r\n \r\n&gt; .DESCRIPTION   Script ***to delete files older than x-days***.

The ideal thing is to get values once using `getValues()` and work on the 2D array that is returned ([Documentation here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#setValues(Object)))\r\n\r\nAnother thing, when you called `body.replaceText(&#39;%DESCRIPTION_STRING1%&#39;, item1 )`, `item1`, `item2` &amp; `item3` were all 2D arrays, so using them in replace would not have worked, which is why I asked what you want to do with them. \r\n\r\nLastly, I think an alternative to `body.replaceText()` would be to extract the body&#39;s text and do all the searches on that string and then replacing the entire body with the result. This would mean less calls to the API.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222220/copying-data-from-sheets-to-docs-and-generating-a-new-document/58233228#58233228","title":"Copying data from sheets to docs and generating a new document"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11927273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dFryUVqQ4Kk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/AzpLqOncvDU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"LauraM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11927273/lauram"},"last_editor":{"reputation":568,"user_id":11869748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qh4YQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZektorH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869748/zektorh"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58233228,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570182572,"creation_date":1570115962,"last_edit_date":1570117794,"question_id":58222220,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222220","body_markdown":"I&#39;m at that beginner-to-intermediate state in programming where I know enough to piece something together that can be rather complex but perhaps I don&#39;t go about it the best way, get stumped, and its definitely not optimized.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve build an invoice generator that takes the data inputted from a sheet and translates it to the same template in google docs.

The trigger will thus be fired *before* there are members.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it is likely *not* a good idea at all to define such field. If you later remove a member from a group, or add other members, it will be hard to update all the members accordingly. A person might still be a member of a different group. It is a form of *data duplication*, and it turns out that synchronizing data, is usually a harder problem than it looks.\r\n\r\nIt therefore is better to either add a property to your `Person` model, or annotate your `objects` queryset.\r\n\r\n# Option 1: Add a property\r\n\r\nWe can add a property that checks if the `Person` is a member of a group. This will perform a query to the database, for each person where we query this:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person(models.Model):\r\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n    \r\n    @property\r\n    def is_group_member(self):\r\n        return &lt;b&gt;Group.objects.filter(members=self).exists()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n# Option 2: Customize the `objects` manager\r\n\r\nWe can annotate the `objects` manager, such that it will run a subquery for each `Person` in the queryset. We can add this for example to the `objects` manager:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from django.db.models import Exists, OuterRef\r\n\r\nclass PersonManager(models.Manager):\r\n\r\n    def get_queryset(self):\r\n        from app.models import Group\r\n        return super().get_queryset().annotate(\r\n            &lt;b&gt;is_group_member=Exists(Group.objects.filter(members=OuterRef(&#39;pk&#39;)))&lt;/b&gt;\r\n        )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nWe can then add the manager to the `Person` class:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person(models.Model):\r\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n    \r\n    &lt;b&gt;objects = PersonManager()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222170/django-filter-with-manytomanyfield/58222295#58222295","title":"Django filter with manytomanyfield"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12160056"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58222295,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570127867,"creation_date":1570115846,"question_id":58222170,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58222170","body_markdown":"This is my models\r\n\r\n    class Person(models.Model):\r\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n        is_group_member = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n    \r\n    class Group(models.Model):\r\n        members = models.ManyToManyField(Person)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @receiver(post_save, sender=Group)       \r\n    def set_group_member_type(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\r\n        if created:\r\n            # change the all group members&#39; type\r\n\r\nI am trying to update `is_group_member` field with signal.\r\n\r\nWhen a group is created with members, then i will filter and retrieve all the person who are group member, then i will change the `is_group_member` value to True\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me to achieve this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222170/django-filter-with-manytomanyfield","title":"Django filter with manytomanyfield"},{"tags":["react-native","react-navigation","react-navigation-drawer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1175,"user_id":7364894,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d_ZmFNv8bZE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUc/GEFzMOw4u7Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Thakur Karthik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7364894/thakur-karthik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570119409,"post_id":58222168,"comment_id":102821670,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222168/how-to-determine-active-route-in-drawernavigator-to-tint-the-active-menu-item-an#comment102821670_58222168"},{"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":9057867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94f1b957aae2dcc16d020a16a990e334?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jo Momma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9057867/jo-momma"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1175,"user_id":7364894,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d_ZmFNv8bZE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUc/GEFzMOw4u7Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Thakur Karthik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7364894/thakur-karthik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570139085,"post_id":58222168,"comment_id":102829500,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222168/how-to-determine-active-route-in-drawernavigator-to-tint-the-active-menu-item-an#comment102829500_58222168"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":9057867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94f1b957aae2dcc16d020a16a990e334?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jo Momma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9057867/jo-momma"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570143799,"creation_date":1570143799,"answer_id":58227948,"question_id":58222168,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227948","body_markdown":"I figured out a way to do it but I wonder if there is a better/simpler way than what I came up with.

I have written a custom drawer menu and added it to the **contentComponent** config for my navigator. I don&#39;t know how to determine which page/screen is active from within the custom menu. Here is my code for the **DrawerNavigator**:\r\n\r\n    const DrawerNavigator = createDrawerNavigator({\r\n        &quot;Search Locations&quot;: {\r\n            screen: SearchLocationsScreen,\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;About&quot;: {\r\n            screen: AboutScreen\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;Favorites&quot;: {\r\n            screen: FavoritesScreen\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;Sign In&quot;: {\r\n            screen: SignIn\r\n        },\r\n    }, {\r\n        contentComponent: props =&gt; &lt;CustomDrawerComponent {...props} /&gt;\r\n    });\r\n\r\nIt may be important to note that my **DrawerNavigator** is nested inside a **StackNavigator**.

page and I want to go to the &quot;Sign In&quot; page everything works as expected). However, if I&#39;m on the &quot;Search Locations&quot; page and I click on the &quot;Search Locations&quot; menu item, I want to simply close the drawer. I also want to tint the active page&#39;s icon/label. My problem is, from inside the **DrawerMenu.js** file, I don&#39;t know how to determine what page I&#39;m currently on to do this. \r\n\r\nAm I implementing this correctly? I&#39;m new to React Native.

I am trying to limit request sizes that Undertow accepts. Would like to have a limit for all types, POSTs, PUTs, multipart, non-multipart etc. There&#39;s `UndertowOptions.MAX_ENTITY_SIZE` that I think I should be able to use. I have added:\r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    public class UndertowConfiguration {\r\n\r\n        @Bean\r\n        public UndertowServletWebServerFactory undertowServletWebServerFactory() {\r\n            UndertowServletWebServerFactory factory = new UndertowServletWebServerFactory();\r\n\r\n            factory.addBuilderCustomizers((UndertowBuilderCustomizer) builder -&gt; {\r\n                builder.setServerOption(UndertowOptions.MAX_ENTITY_SIZE, 100L);\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            return factory;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut this does not work in practice. I am testing by sending requests to my REST @Controller, but request size does not seem to have a limit. \r\n\r\nAlso when I debug, `io.undertow.server.HttpServerExchange.getMaxEntitySize()` returns 52428800. So it looks like my configuration is not sticking.\r\n\r\nAlso tried a bit differently \r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    public class UndertowConfiguration implements WebServerFactoryCustomizer&lt;UndertowServletWebServerFactory&gt; {\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void customize(UndertowServletWebServerFactory factory) {\r\n            factory.addBuilderCustomizers((UndertowBuilderCustomizer) builder -&gt; {\r\n                builder.setServerOption(UndertowOptions.MAX_ENTITY_SIZE, 100L);\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhich was maybe closer to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-developing-web-applications.html#boot-features-programmatic-embedded-container-customization example, but the results were the same.\r\n\r\nAlso tried application.property `server.undertow.max-http-post-size=100` or `server.undertow.max-http-post-size=1KB` but that one did not do anything either.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** \r\nDid a small minimal application to replicate the problem: https://github.com/jansu76/gs-spring-boot/tree/undertow-testing/complete\r\n\r\nIt is a fork from helloworld spring application from https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/\r\n\r\nI have \r\n\r\n- changed config to use Undertow instead of Tomcat\r\n- set application property to limit max post size: `server.undertow.max-http-post-size=10` https://github.com/jansu76/gs-spring-boot/blob/undertow-testing/complete/src/main/resources/application.properties#L1\r\n- used UndertowServletWebServerFactory to set port to 9090 and also limit post size with `UndertowOptions.MAX_ENTITY_SIZE`: https://github.com/jansu76/gs-spring-boot/blob/undertow-testing/complete/src/main/java/hello/UndertowConfiguration.java\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n    cd complete\r\n    ./gradlew build\r\n    java -jar build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar\r\n    cd src/test/resources/\r\n    ./test-post.sh\r\n\r\nScript should do a large POST request to the application, which should be limited by Undertow max post size config. But it is not.\r\n\r\nIt seems UndertowServletWebServerFactory sets port to 9090 but UndertowOptions.MAX_ENTITY_SIZE = 100 has no effect. `server.undertow.max-http-post-size=10` sets some max entity size values for some time, but those are overwritten in `io.undertow.servlet.handlers.ServletInitialHandler.handleRequest:181` which overwrites maxEntitySize value from 10 to 10485760.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58222154/unable-to-use-undertowservletwebserverfactory-to-limit-max-entity-size","title":"Unable to use UndertowServletWebServerFactory to limit MAX_ENTITY_SIZE"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css","vue.js"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":153,"user_id":10886581,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73fd4e2eeabbb24f6ff080c9bd9df199?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Natixco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10886581/natixco"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570119405,"creation_date":1570119405,"answer_id":58223147,"question_id":58222150,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223147","body_markdown":"You can&#39;t scroll, because your content fits in the screen width, but even if you make your div longer, it would just grow.
