Each cell has two text view, chapterTitleTextView and chapterBodyTextView. I&#39;ve added placeholders to both text views like so: \r\n\r\n\r\n    class CustomWriterPageCell: UICollectionViewCell, UITextViewDelegate {\r\n\r\n        // When the user taps on a text view\r\n        func textViewDidBeginEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {\r\n        \r\n            if textView.textColor == .gray {\r\n            \r\n                textView.text = nil\r\n                textView.textColor = .black\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        // When the user taps out of a text view or taps on the done button in the toolbar\r\n        func textViewDidEndEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {\r\n        \r\n            // If the chapter title text view is empty\r\n            if chapterTitleTextView.text.isEmpty {\r\n            \r\n                chapterTitleTextView.text = &quot;Chapter Title&quot;\r\n                chapterTitleTextView.textColor = .gray\r\n            \r\n            }\r\n            // If the chapter body text view is empty\r\n            if chapterBodyTextView.text.isEmpty {\r\n            \r\n                chapterBodyTextView.text = &quot;Chapter Body&quot;\r\n                chapterBodyTextView.textColor = .gray\r\n            \r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHow this works is that, the text color is initially gray and there is some text, when the user taps on the text view, the color changes to black and the text in the text view is removed.\r\n\r\nNow there is this problem with using dequeueReusableCell, it’s that it reuses the cells, this caused problem number 1: Whatever I type on the text view in the first cell appears on the 4th cell, to solve this problem I had to create 2 global lists to hold whatever I type and this gets displayed in the text views of the cells, here’s the code:\r\n\r\nGlobal Lists:\r\n\r\n    var chapterTitleText = Array(repeating: &quot;&quot;, count: 4) // To store the chapter title text\r\n    var chapterBodyText = Array(repeating: &quot;&quot;, count: 4) // To store the chapter body text\r\n\r\n**The following code snippet is inside the textViewDidEndEditing from earlier**\r\n\r\n    // Append the chapter body text to the chapterBodyText array\r\n    let titleText = chapterTitleTextView.text\r\n    let titleRow = textView.tag //This the indexPath.row\r\n    chapterTitleText[titleRow] = titleText!\r\n        \r\n    // Append the chapter title text to the chapterTitleText array\r\n    let bodyText = chapterBodyTextView.text\r\n    let bodyRow = textView.tag\r\n    chapterBodyText[bodyRow] = bodyText!\r\n\r\n**And in cellForItemAt:**\r\n\r\n    cell.chapterBodyTextView.tag = indexPath.row\r\n    cell.chapterTitleTextView.tag = indexPath.row\r\n            \r\n    cell.chapterTitleTextView.text = chapterTitleText[indexPath.row]\r\n    cell.chapterBodyTextView.text = chapterBodyText[indexPath.row]\r\n\r\nThis got rid of problem number 1 (text in the text views duplicating). But then I got a new problem, remember the placeholder text I was talking about? When I type something in the one of the textviews of the first cell, the text color of the text view in the fourth cell changes. I’ll add a GIF replicating the problem to help readers understand:\r\n\r\n[![Video replicating the problem][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pYNR2.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038770/dequeuereusablecell-causes-text-to-change-color","title":"dequeueReusableCell causes text to change color"},{"tags":["ios","swift","sandbox"],"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":10910772,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iM9-bu8vqyg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPE/ZItYhUKrCxQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"HemOdd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10910772/hemodd"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569056327,"creation_date":1569056327,"question_id":58038768,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58038768","body_markdown":"I have upgraded my iOS to version 13.0.

Mapping is like this:\r\n\r\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/customclass&quot;)\r\n    Resource&lt;CustomClass&gt; custom() {\r\n        return new Resource&lt;CustomClass&gt;(new CustomClass());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Resolved [org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageNotWritableException: Could not marshal [Resource { content: CustomClass(a=10, string=abc), links: [] }]: null; nested exception is javax.xml.bind.MarshalException\r\n     - with linked exception:\r\n    [com.sun.istack.internal.SAXException2: class test.CustomClass nor any of its super class is known to this context.\r\n    javax.xml.bind.JAXBException: class test.CustomClass nor any of its super class is known to this context.]]\r\n\r\nI&#39;m pretty sure that there is nothing wrong with my CustomClass. If I use the following mapping instead\r\n\r\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/customclass&quot;)\r\n    CustomClass custom() {\r\n        return (new CustomClass());\r\n    }\r\nthen it works fine.\r\n\r\nIt also works fine if I try to marshal things manually (by settings things up inside of a main method and then running it). It&#39;s also fine then if I wrap the instance of CustomClass inside of a Resource instance.\r\n\r\nAs far I understand the issue is that the marshaller in SpringApplication is using context that just knows about HATEOAS Resource and I need to some how make it aware of CustomClass.\r\n\r\nI tried to use something like this (from https://stackoverflow.com/a/40398632)\r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    public class ResponseResolver  {\r\n        @Bean\r\n        public Marshaller marshaller() {\r\n            try {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;getting marshaller&quot;);\r\n                JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(CustomClass.class, Resource.class);\r\n                return context.createMarshaller();\r\n            } catch (JAXBException e) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nbut that didn&#39;t work (there was a lot of guessing on my part here, since I don&#39;t know that much about the inner workings of Spring Boot).\r\n\r\nA promising reply was also in https://stackoverflow.com/a/14073899 , but ContextResolver wasn&#39;t in my projects classpath.\r\n\r\nI also considered wrapping Resource&lt;CustomClass&gt; inside of a another class and then using XmlSeeAlso annotation, but that would mess up my XML and would be somewhat ugly hack.\r\n\r\nSo is it possible to define a custom JAXBContext that SpringApplication would be able to pick up?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038696/how-to-use-an-explicitly-specified-marshaller-in-spring-boot","title":"How to use an explicitly specified marshaller in Spring Boot"},{"tags":["node.js","angular","angular7","google-speech-api"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":810,"user_id":191275,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35dbc40f6770bd42064a6b9621536fe6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kunal Deo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/191275/kunal-deo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569083276,"creation_date":1569083276,"answer_id":58042124,"question_id":58038691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58042124","body_markdown":"You can use [Obvi][1] to learn how to build a client side Cloud Speech API client over WebRTC.

Which source is most appropriate depends entirely on your real use-case, e.g. creating a stream from a strict collection with `Source.from()` or asynchronously pulling new elements out of a data structure with `Source.unfoldAsync` plus many more. Doing it this way ensures that the requests are only emitted when the time is right according to the downstream capacity or rate throttling.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038664/limit-number-of-messages-sent-within-time-interval/58047005#58047005","title":"Limit number of messages sent within time interval"}],"owner":{"reputation":19896,"user_id":470184,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DzXRW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"blue-sky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/470184/blue-sky"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58047005,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569137217,"creation_date":1569055469,"question_id":58038664,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58038664","body_markdown":"Using below code I&#39;m attempting to limit the amount of messages send to an actor within a specified time frame.

starters this function declaration is incorrect because there is no type specifiers for parameters.\r\n\r\n    void update(w,x,y,z){ \r\n       w = z+2;\r\n       x = x+1;\r\n       y = y+2;\r\n       z = w+1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you want to update passed to the function objects then they should be passed by reference through pointers.\r\n\r\nThe function can look the following way\r\n\r\n    void update( unsigned int *w, unsigned int *x, unsigned int *y,unsigned int *z )\r\n    { \r\n       *w = *z+2;\r\n       *x = *x+1;\r\n       *y = *y+2;\r\n       *z = *w+1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt; /*update method could be of any type*/\r\n\r\nThe function can not be declared like for example\r\n\r\n    void update( void *w, void *x, void *y, void *z );\r\n\r\nbecause within the function you need to know the actual types of the arguments.\r\n\r\nYou could define the function the following way\r\n\r\n    void update( void *w, void *x, void *y, void *z, void sum( void *item, void *value ) );\r\n\r\nThat is with one addition parameter that has a function type. The corresponding function used as an argument could cast the pointer to the required type and perform the addition.\r\n\r\nAlso these calls of `printf` are incorrect\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;%lu\\t %lu\\t %lu\\t %lu\\n&quot;,a[0],a[1],a[2],a[3]);\r\n    printf(&quot;%lu\\t %lu\\t %lu\\t %lu\\n&quot;,a[0],a[1],a[2],a[3]);\r\n\r\nbecause there are used wrong conversion format specifiers for objects of the type unsigned int. Use `%u` instead of `%lu`.\r\n\r\nPay attention to that the functions `pass` and `update` shall be declare before their calls for example before the function `main`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038614/is-there-a-way-to-update-return-elements-in-an-array-from-a-method/58039189#58039189","title":"Is there a way to update/return elements in an array from a method?"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9979887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KiMhT74WWQg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/LkUW-lkOXpk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"User","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9979887/user"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9979887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KiMhT74WWQg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/LkUW-lkOXpk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"User","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9979887/user"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58038675,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569065068,"creation_date":1569055043,"last_edit_date":1569064806,"question_id":58038614,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58038614","body_markdown":"I would normally just use pointers but in this situation I am kind of stuck.

Currently working with the following to get these data but I am only able to either get the a) first instance, or b) null values:\r\n\r\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bsoup\r\n    import requests as reqs\r\n\r\n    other_stat_list = []\r\n\r\n    page_to_parse = &#39;https://fbref.com/en/matches/033092ef/Northampton-Town-Lincoln-City-August-4-2018-League-Two&#39;\r\n    \r\n    page = reqs.get(page_to_parse)\r\n    status_code = page.status_code\r\n    status_code = str(status_code)\r\n    parse_page = bsoup(page.content, &#39;html.parser&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\n    find_other_stats = parse_page.find_all(&#39;div&#39;, id=&quot;team_stats&quot;)\r\n    for stat in find_other_stats:\r\n        add_other_stats = stat.find_next(&#39;strong&#39;).get_text()\r\n        other_stat_list.append(add_other_stats)\r\n        print(add_other_stats)\r\n\r\nI had a similar problem before, where not all div instances were captured. I ran a recursion to capture all the children in the code:\r\n\r\n    find_other_stats = parse_page.find_all(&#39;div&#39;, id=&quot;team_stats&quot;)\r\n    all_other_stats = find_other_stats[0].find_all(&#39;div&#39;, recursive=False)\r\n    for stat in all_other_stats:\r\n        add_other_stats = find_next(&#39;strong&#39;).get_text()\r\n         other_stat_list.append(add_team)\r\n\r\nHowever a variant of this produces nulls as well, so not sure why the recursion is not working.\r\n\r\nExpecting to get &#39;53%&#39; and ideally &#39;8 of 15 -. I can parse the values themselves, but capturing them looks to be tougher than I expected.

noticed a few mistakes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate _fetchData(state: any) {\r\n  requestData(\r\n    state.sales, // that should be state.data (state is the state of ReactTable)\r\n    state.pageSize,\r\n    state.page\r\n...\r\n```\r\nNext, I&#39;ve noticed that you do pagination after fetching the data. But using `manual` with `onFetchData` is for handling pagination on the **server**. For example, with `page` and `pageSize` you could pass these parameters to your API. That&#39;s the whole point of pagination! \r\n\r\nAn example from the documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nonFetchData={(state, instance) =&gt; { //onFetchData is called on load and also when you click on &#39;next&#39;, when you change page, etc.\r\n    // show the loading overlay\r\n    this.setState({loading: true})\r\n    // fetch your data\r\n    Axios.post(&#39;mysite.com/data&#39;, {\r\n      //These are all properties provided by ReactTable\r\n      page: state.page,\r\n      pageSize: state.pageSize,\r\n      sorted: state.sorted,\r\n      filtered: state.filtered\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you&#39;re fetching all of them at once (why though? can&#39;t your API on the server handle pagination? this way, you won&#39;t have to wait ages before the results are returned), then I suggest you let ReactTable do the work.\r\n\r\nThat is, you just do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;ReactTable\r\n  columns={columns}\r\n  data={data}\r\n/&gt;\r\n```\r\nReactTable will take care of pagination. And now, you may use your query to the API in `ComponentDidMount`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCould you please instead try to put all the logic in the onFetchData. I could be wrong but it seems to me you misunderstood the instructions in the documentation. `OnFetchData` is called at `ComponentDidMount`, it&#39;s not telling you that you have to put your function there.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate _fetchData(state, instance) {\r\n\r\n  const { page, pageSize } = state\r\n\r\n  fetch(`http://localhost:50335/api/RK`)\r\n    .then(response =&gt; response.json())\r\n    .then(data =&gt;\r\n         let sales = data\r\n         this.setState({\r\n           sales: sales.slice(pageSize * page, pageSize * page * pageSize),\r\n           pages: Math.ceil(sales.length / pageSize)\r\n         });\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs for Typescript, from what I gather, Typescript doesn&#39;t have enough information to infer the type of what your Promise returns.\r\n\r\nSo you have to explicitly annotate Promises generic type parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn new Promise&lt;{ sales: object; pages: number; }&gt;((resolve, reject) =&gt; { ... }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038591/unable-to-implement-react-table-sever-data-loading/58039914#58039914","title":"Unable to implement React-table sever data loading"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":7781854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e62142e59734bdd0f0a34db53343a78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Americo Perez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7781854/americo-perez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569106650,"creation_date":1569054805,"question_id":58038591,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58038591","body_markdown":"I am testing the React-table server side data to render a huge amount of data fetched from an web api without crashing the browser.

subtracting 2. For example, to generate the sequence which starts in the third column you have to sum `(3 - 2)*m` which is simply `m`. \r\n\r\nI hope its clear. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038573/fill-the-diagonal-and-diagonal1-in-a-matrix/58038850#58038850","title":"Fill the diagonal and diagonal+1 in a matrix"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":9144522,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76508da673378122fca497ae2c67c2dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jesper.Lindberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9144522/jesper-lindberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569059170,"post_id":58039065,"comment_id":102479052,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038573/fill-the-diagonal-and-diagonal1-in-a-matrix/58039065#comment102479052_58039065"},{"owner":{"reputation":1079,"user_id":11117265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e6da25bc075b2e32f540f5add1d5711?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"yarnabrina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11117265/yarnabrina"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":72,"user_id":9144522,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76508da673378122fca497ae2c67c2dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jesper.Lindberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9144522/jesper-lindberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569059488,"post_id":58039065,"comment_id":102479109,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038573/fill-the-diagonal-and-diagonal1-in-a-matrix/58039065#comment102479109_58039065"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1079,"user_id":11117265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e6da25bc075b2e32f540f5add1d5711?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"yarnabrina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11117265/yarnabrina"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569058990,"creation_date":1569058990,"answer_id":58039065,"question_id":58038573,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58039065","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t like this solution, but it does the job:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\nelement_on_diagonal &lt;- 0.5\r\nelement_above_and_below_diaginal &lt;- 0.2\r\n\r\na &lt;- diag(x = element_on_diagonal,\r\n          nrow = 10)\r\n\r\nfor(i in seq_len(length.out = ncol(x = a)))\r\n{\r\n  temp &lt;- sapply(X = setdiff(x = seq(from = (i - 2),\r\n                                     to = (i + 2)),\r\n                             y = i),\r\n                 FUN = function(j) if (j %in% 1:10) j else if (j != 0) j %% 10 else 10)\r\n  a[temp, i] &lt;- element_above_and_below_diaginal\r\n}\r\n\r\na\r\n#&gt;

I am using css-grid system to position my elements. That works just fine but I am having a hard time with a simple slide-in animation. I am trying to slide in a div wrapped in a router-link this is again wrapped in a transition. I have given the router link a class of link-1 so that I can position it in the grid-template-areas. The div with a class of box-2 has the same animation attached to it and it works exactly like I want it to. The difference is that the animation breaks with the div wrapped in a router-link. I am really stuck here and I have tried switching the position:relative to absolute and so on the link-1 and box-1 but the animation still breaks.

To do so, class `MedDetailFragment` should look like :\r\n\r\n    public class MedDetailFragment extends Fragment {\r\n\r\n        public MedDetailFragment() {\r\n            // Required empty public constructor\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    \tpublic static MedDetailFragment newInstance(Medicine med) {\r\n            Bundle bundle = new Bundle();\r\n            bundle.putParcelable(&quot;medicine&quot;, med);\r\n            MedDetailFragment medDetailFragment  = new MedDetailFragment();\r\n            medDetailFragment.setArguments(bundle);\r\n            return medDetailFragment;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Nullable\r\n        @Override\r\n        public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n\r\n            ViewGroup root = (ViewGroup) inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_med_detail, container, false);\r\n\r\n            Bundle bundle = getArguments();\r\n\r\n            Medicine medicine = bundle.getParcelable(&quot;medicine&quot;);\r\n\r\n            return root;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand in class `MedListFragment` you should simply replace the two lines\r\n\r\n    MedDetailFragment medDetailFragment = new MedDetailFragment();\r\n    medDetailFragment.setArguments(bundle);\r\n\r\nwith just a single line of code:\r\n\r\n    MedDetailFragment medDetailFragment = MedDetailFragment.newInstance(med);\r\n\r\nThis approach encapsulates the mechanism within `MedDetailFragment` class, it&#39;s much simpler and easy to debug.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038568/getarguments-return-null-when-passing-data-between-fragments/58039058#58039058","title":"getArguments return null when passing data between fragments"}],"owner":{"reputation":321,"user_id":1799794,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b79c880035d0e45937d4e452a2a07229?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Henry Gunawan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1799794/henry-gunawan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2567,"user_id":10182897,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hhPlJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ashish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10182897/ashish"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58038710,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569071182,"creation_date":1569054616,"last_edit_date":1569054702,"question_id":58038568,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58038568","body_markdown":"I have 2 fragments called MedListFragment and MedDetailFragment.

few techniques apply\r\n\r\n1)   Rather than outputting multiple string literals to `std::cout`, combine all the literals into one, and output that.   Bear in mind that a pair of string literals following each other are combined.   For example, the construct `&quot;ab&quot;  &quot;cd&quot;`  becomes `&quot;abcd&quot;`\r\n\r\n2)   Eliminate any variables that are not needed.   In your case, your read to `amount`, do an assignment `x = amount`, and then never use `amount` again.   This means there is an opportunity to eliminate either `amount` (read directly to `x` and proceed from there) or `x`  (don&#39;t assign `x = amount`, and then do all operations on `amount`).\r\n\r\n3)    If you are reusing logic that only differs by an index such as `result[0] = x/values[0]`  and later `result[1] = x/values[1]`  then consider a loop.\r\n\r\n4)    If you have multiple strings to be output (you do!) consider placing them in an array too - then access elements of that array if the loops too.\r\n\r\n5)    Don&#39;t be afraid to break statements into pieces and re-order operations if it allows you to rationalise.\r\n\r\n6)     If we are doing   `x = x op y`  change that to `x op = y`.   For example, change `amount = amount % values[i]` to `amount %= values[i]`.\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting all that together, you get.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        int amount = 0;                 \r\n        int result[4] = { 0, 0, 0, 0 };\r\n        int values[4] = { 25, 10, 5, 1 };\r\n        const char *denom[4] = {&quot;quarter(s),&quot;,\r\n                                 &quot;dime(s),&quot;,\r\n                                 &quot;nickel(s), and&quot;, \r\n                                 &quot;pennie(s)!&quot;\r\n                               };\r\n   \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Welcome to this super advanced (not) coin change calculator!\\n&quot;     \r\n                     &quot;Please enter the amount in cents: &quot;;           \r\n        std::cin &gt;&gt; amount;\r\n\r\n        for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)\r\n        {\r\n            result[i] = amount / values[i];\r\n            amount %= values[i];\r\n        }\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Optimal change: &quot;;\r\n        for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)\r\n        {\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; result[i] &lt;&lt; denom[i] &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut we can go further.   In the above, I&#39;ve broken the initialisation of `denom` into multiple lines for clarity, but they can be done in one line, but they can be combined into a single line (at some cost of readability)\r\n\r\n        const char *denom[4] = {&quot;quarter(s),&quot;, &quot;dime(s),&quot;, &quot;nickel(s), and&quot;, &quot;pennie(s)!&quot;};\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving done this, we see that can combine the two loops into one if we move the output statement that is between them, and then not actually need the array `result` (elements are only calculated in the loop, and then output).   So we can eliminate that array, and make it a single variable - local to the loop.\r\n\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Optimal change: &quot;;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)\r\n        {\r\n            int result = amount / values[i];\r\n            amount %= values[i];\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; denom[i] &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHaving done that, look inside the loop, and note that `result` is only calculated so  we can output it.   So eliminate it by changing the loop to\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)\r\n        {\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; amount/values[i] &lt;&lt; denom[i] &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;\r\n            amount %= values[i];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving done all that, we get\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        int amount = 0;                 \r\n        int values[4] = { 25, 10, 5, 1 };\r\n        const char *denom[4] = {&quot;quarter(s),&quot;, &quot;dime(s),&quot;, &quot;nickel(s), and&quot;, &quot;pennie(s)!&quot;};\r\n   \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Welcome to this super advanced (not) coin change calculator!\\n&quot;     \r\n                     &quot;Please enter the amount in cents: &quot;;           \r\n        std::cin &gt;&gt; amount;\r\n        \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Optimal change: &quot;;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)\r\n        {\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; amount/values[i] &lt;&lt; denom[i] &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;\r\n            amount %= values[i];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nIn doing the above, I&#39;ve focused on making your code shorter.   I have taken liberties with changing the order in which operations are done, but the output produced will be the same.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58038554/how-can-i-make-this-c-code-shorter-im-a-beginner/58038920#58038920","title":"How can I make this C++ code shorter?
