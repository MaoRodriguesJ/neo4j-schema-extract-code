NASM is an assembler, not a compiler; the instructions it assembles are set by the source file, not command-line options.  (The error message is assuming people are using `ld` on compiler output, not hand-written asm.)\r\n\r\nRecompile = redo generating the asm instructions, not reassemble the same asm with different options.  The compiler is your brain.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. Do all mov instructions need to be rewritten with the &quot;rel&quot; keyword\r\n\r\n**No, you can just use `default rel`** at the top of your file like a normal person instead of modifying every addressing mode to explicitly use `[rel foo]`.\r\n\r\n&gt; 2. and 3. Are there any other instruction types that need special handling?\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s nothing to do with the `mov` instruction, everything to do with the addressing mode.  All instructions (including LEA) use the same ModR/M + optional SIB + disp0/8/32 encoding for addressing modes.  (Except for one form of `mov` which can use a 64-bit absolute address when loading/storing AL/AX/EAX/RAX.  But you don&#39;t want that either.)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou also need to **avoid any use of addresses as 32-bit absolute immediate operands**.  So if you&#39;re putting an address into a register, you need a RIP-relative LEA instead of the more efficient 5-byte mov-immediate that you could use in position-dependent code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n;; putting a label address into a register\r\ndefault rel\r\n    mov edi, my_string     ; optimal in position-dependent executables on Linux\r\n    lea rdi, [my_string]   ; optimal otherwise, best you can do for PIC/PIE\r\n\r\n    mov rdi, my_string     ; Never use: 64-bit absolute is inefficient\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only time you should use 64-bit absolute addresses is in `.data` or `.rodata` for the contents of a jump table or other pointers to static addresses.  Not in code; use RIP-relative instead.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nObviously you have to avoid `[disp32 + reg]` addressing modes like `[array + rdi]` or `[array + rdx*4]`.  **The only RIP-relative addressing mode is `[RIP + rel32]`**; other modes still use the 32-bit displacement as a sign-extended 32-bit absolute value (so it can be a constant offset like 1024, not an address at all).\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47300844/mach-o-64-bit-format-does-not-support-32-bit-absolute-addresses-nasm-accessing (MachO64 never allows 32-bit absolute, so it&#39;s the same restrictions as a Linux/ELF PIC object)\r\n\r\n&gt; I know that R_X86_64_32S indicates 32-bit addressing, but I don&#39;t have any 32-bit addressing in my code.\r\n\r\n`[abs foo]` is a disp32 sign-extended to 64.  That&#39;s why the relocation type is 32**S**.  By contrast, `mov edi, foo` uses `R_X86_64_32`.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not 32-bit address-size, but the absolute address still has to be encoded as a 32-bit signed integer.  Which isn&#39;t allowed in a PIE/PIC object which has to be relocatable anywhere in 64-bit address space.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43367427/32-bit-absolute-addresses-no-longer-allowed-in-x86-64-linux (about PIE vs. non-PIE executables, but still has useful comments about 32-bit absolute addresses)\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47300844/mach-o-64-bit-format-does-not-support-32-bit-absolute-addresses-nasm-accessing\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8194141/how-to-print-a-number-in-assembly-nasm/32853546#32853546 shows how to call libc functions from NASM PIE/PIC code, through the PLT or `gcc -fno-plt` style with `call [rel printf wrt ..got]`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPIC libraries are expected to support symbol interposition.  See [Sorry state of dynamic libraries on Linux](https://web.archive.org/web/20171111043629/http://www.macieira.org/blog/2012/01/sorry-state-of-dynamic-libraries-on-linux/) for more.\r\n\r\n**If you want efficient internal access to your own `global` symbols  (without going through GOT)**, you may need to define weak aliases for them that have &quot;hidden&quot; ELF visibility.  Or simply put 2 labels at the same place, one global one hidden.

It compiles to an object file using the following string:  \r\n\r\n\tsudo nasm -felf64 Test_File.asm\r\n\r\nI link with ld:\r\n\r\n\tsudo ld -shared Test_File.o -o Test_File.so\r\n\r\nand I get the following errors:  \r\n\r\n\tRelocation R_X86_64_32S against &#39;.data&#39; can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC\r\n\r\n\tld: final link failed: Nonrepresentable section on output\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the NASM compiler does not have a -fPIC option.  \r\n\r\nAfter reading many resources on writing position-independent code for 64-bit shared libraries in Linux, I understand the issue very well, but I still don&#39;t have a clear idea of what instruction changes I need to make to be position-independent in 64-bit NASM.  For example, do all instructions involving named variables need to be &quot;rel&quot; -- for example, movsd xmm0,[rel abc] instead of movsd xmm0,[abc]?  I know that R_X86_64_32S indicates 32-bit addressing, but I don&#39;t have any 32-bit addressing in my  code.  \r\n\r\nAlso, there are significant differences between 32-bit and 64-bit on how position independent code is written, and some of the resources concentrate only on 32-bit code.  Even Section 9.2 Writing NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD and Linux/ELF Shared Libraries in the NASM manual is not clear on how 64-bit code must be altered for position-independent code.  That section focuses on 32-bit code (using the global offset table), which is not (based on other research) used for 64-bit code.  \r\n\r\n1.\tThe file is headed with [BITS 64] and [default rel], as required.  \r\n\r\n2.\tThe data section is declared as section .data align=16\r\n\r\n3.\tEvery variable in the .data section is defined as dq, for example,   number: dq 0.  \r\n\r\n4.\tThe top of the file contains the exports in this format:  global ABC:function.  \r\n\r\nI suspect that only data movement instructions would be affected -- math instructions would not.  For the external calls to realloc, I added the wrt ..plt special symbol, but I still get the same errors.  \r\n\r\nHere are my questions:\r\n\r\n1.\tDo all mov instructions need to be rewritten with the &quot;rel&quot; keyword, for example, mov rax,[rel abc]  instead of mov rax,[abc]?  \r\n\r\n2.\tDo lea instructions need to be changed (e.g., lea rdi,[rel abc])?  \r\n\r\n3.\tAre there any other instruction types that need special handling?\r\n\r\nI am not posting the entire (very long) nasm code listing here because I&#39;m not looking for line-by-line analysis.  I just want to know what instruction types (for example, mov, cmp, jmp, lea) need to be rewritten for 64-bit relative addressing, and how.  Does it involve only accesses to variables defined in the data section (e.g., mov rcx,[abc] where abc is defined in the data section as abc: dq 0).  \r\n\r\nTo summarize, my question is: what changes do I need to make for position-independent code for 64-bit NASM, since the NASM compiler does not have a fPIC option?   I certainly don&#39;t mean line-by-line, but what types of instructions need to be added or rewritten.  \r\n\r\nThanks very much.  \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106310/nasm-linux-shared-object-error-relocation-r-x86-64-32s-against-data","title":"NASM Linux shared object error: Relocation R_X86_64_32S against &#39;.data&#39;"},{"tags":["json","go","struct","encoding"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1795357,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f85b0ef93603bc344ed36172ee2d98a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ajoseps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1795357/ajoseps"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569444749,"post_id":58106352,"comment_id":102603518,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106307/how-do-i-marshal-a-struct-with-an-embdedded-struct-field-to-be-a-flat-json-objec/58106352#comment102603518_58106352"},{"owner":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1795357,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f85b0ef93603bc344ed36172ee2d98a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ajoseps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1795357/ajoseps"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569445344,"post_id":58106352,"comment_id":102603718,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106307/how-do-i-marshal-a-struct-with-an-embdedded-struct-field-to-be-a-flat-json-objec/58106352#comment102603718_58106352"},{"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1795357,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f85b0ef93603bc344ed36172ee2d98a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ajoseps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1795357/ajoseps"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569445749,"post_id":58106352,"comment_id":102603836,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106307/how-do-i-marshal-a-struct-with-an-embdedded-struct-field-to-be-a-flat-json-objec/58106352#comment102603836_58106352"},{"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1795357,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f85b0ef93603bc344ed36172ee2d98a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ajoseps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1795357/ajoseps"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569445854,"post_id":58106352,"comment_id":102603866,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106307/how-do-i-marshal-a-struct-with-an-embdedded-struct-field-to-be-a-flat-json-objec/58106352#comment102603866_58106352"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"last_editor":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569445100,"last_edit_date":1569445100,"creation_date":1569444608,"answer_id":58106352,"question_id":58106307,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58106352","body_markdown":"Use an anonymous field to flatten the JSON output:\r\n\r\n\r\n    type City struct {\r\n        City string `json:&quot;City&quot;`\r\n        Size int        `json:&quot;Size&quot;`\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    type Location struct {\r\n    \tCity     // &lt;-- anonymous field has type, but no field name\r\n    \tState string `json:&quot;State&quot;`\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `MarshalJSON` method is ignored in the question because code encodes a `Location` value, but the `MarshalJSON` method is declared with a pointer receiver.

blockwise selection with a jagged right edge indeed only works at the end of lines. **In the &quot;middle&quot;, you&#39;re stuck with a rectangular block selection that then includes trailing whitespace.**\r\n\r\nUnless you switch to a completely different approach (the comments already mention [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors), which lets you select multiple places and then you can interactively edit all of those in parallel), you have to live with that.\r\n\r\nDepending on the command that is applied to the blockwise selection, the trailing whitespace (or even any other characters you inadvertently capture) doesn&#39;t necessarily harm.\r\n\r\nTo append a character (say, `$`) to all middle words in your example, I would use the [vis.vim plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1195)&#39;s `:B` command to work on the selection only, moving to the end of the word with the `E` motion, then appending the character with `a$`:\r\n\r\n    :&#39;&lt;,&#39;&gt;B normal! Ea$\r\n\r\nIn this, the whitespace is kept, and everything to the right of the selection moves one character right.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106302/selecting-visual-block-in-the-middle-of-a-sentece-accross-multiple-lines-in-vim/58113002#58113002","title":"Selecting visual block in the middle of a sentece accross multiple lines in Vim"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12104234,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d93da70a6b7c54a393e9fbe0709c4d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jilocoiner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12104234/jilocoiner"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569487875,"creation_date":1569444326,"question_id":58106302,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106302","body_markdown":"So, let&#39;s imagine I have this code:\r\n\r\n\r\n    print $this_one   = &quot;1&quot;;\r\n    print $this_tu    = &quot;2&quot;;\r\n    print $this_three = &quot;3&quot;;\r\n\r\nand I want to select the middle part using the visual block mode:\r\n\r\n    $this_one   \r\n    $this_tu    \r\n    $this_three \r\n\r\nand perhaps append something etc. but that&#39;s not important now.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am facing is that I don&#39;t know how to select that.\r\n\r\nIf it were something like:\r\n\r\n    print $this_one;\r\n    print $this_tu;\r\n    print $this_three;\r\n\r\nI would just press Ctrl + v then j j and $ and it would be done.\r\n\r\nBut what if it is in the middle and the words end up on a different columns?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106302/selecting-visual-block-in-the-middle-of-a-sentece-accross-multiple-lines-in-vim","title":"Selecting visual block in the middle of a sentece accross multiple lines in Vim"},{"tags":["r","rselenium"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4115,"user_id":6037369,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hiR0q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yifyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6037369/yifyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569446796,"post_id":58106299,"comment_id":102604147,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106299/rselenium-extract-text-from-site#comment102604147_58106299"}],"owner":{"reputation":621,"user_id":3357059,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82861d2bb0878de3660843804412e33e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3357059","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3357059/user3357059"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569444307,"creation_date":1569444307,"question_id":58106299,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106299","body_markdown":"I need to copy and paste the text from a website.

Local variables (whether declared with `Dim`, ...or not declared at all) live inside that procedure scope, and have no way out.\r\n\r\nThe next higher-up scope level is *module scope*. Variables declared in that scope are accessible to all procedures in the module. Use the `Private` keyword to declare them (`Dim` is also legal, but I prefer to reserve it for locals, since `Private` isn&#39;t legal at procedure level) - consider using a *meaningful* identifier name, too... &quot;coll&quot; doesn&#39;t say much about *what it&#39;s for*:\r\n\r\n    Option Explicit\r\n    Private RowNumbers As Object\r\n\r\nAnd then you can initialize it in the `Initialize` handler:\r\n\r\n    Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()\r\n        Set RowNumbers = CreateObject(&quot;System.Collections.ArrayList&quot;)\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nProbably also a good idea to explicitly wipe it out in the `Terminate` handler too, since that&#39;s a .NET object (FWIW this isn&#39;t a VBA array at all and has nothing to do with arrays):\r\n\r\n    Private Sub UserForm_Terminate()\r\n        Set RowNumbers = Nothing\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nThe next higher-up scope level is *global scope*, but once you understand how to pass parameters between procedures, and when to use module scope variables, you pretty much never need any globals. For completleness&#39; sake, a global variable would be declared in a *standard module*, using the `Public` keyword (`Global` works too, but makes things confusing since what we call &quot;global&quot; is really just &quot;project-scope&quot;, and besides `Public` is much more clearly antagonizing `Private`, so it&#39;s good for consistency).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you added `Option Explicit` to the top of your modules, VBA would refuse to compile code that uses undeclared variables - and that would have highlighted `coll` and, likely, `NumberIndex` as well.\r\n\r\nSee if [Rubberduck](http://www.rubberduckvba.com/) inspections flag other issues (disclaimer: I manage that open-source project).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106241/passing-an-array-between-click-subs-in-vba/58106399#58106399","title":"Passing an array between click Subs in VBA"}],"owner":{"reputation":70,"user_id":11625533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb1436dbdfe05c8c049cc876be3f4f99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"grand2019","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11625533/grand2019"},"last_editor":{"reputation":53116,"user_id":1188513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNdZG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mathieu Guindon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1188513/mathieu-guindon"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569447842,"creation_date":1569444008,"last_edit_date":1569444320,"question_id":58106241,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106241","body_markdown":"I am trying to declare and populate an array variable (coll), but wish to access the contents of the array in another Sub (UnassignButton_Click()).

Once that occurs, API GW sends the request to the VPC Link based on the uri configured in the Integration Request. I&#39;m not super familiar with Terraform, but it looks like you are sending it to:\r\n&gt;http://aws_lb.myapis.dns_name:8000\r\n\r\nI also see that you have &quot;request parameters&quot; defined in terraform(but maybe commented out?):\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n\r\n    //  request_parameters = {\r\n    //    &quot;integration.request.path.nmapscan&quot; = &quot;method.request.path.nmapscan&quot;\r\n    //  }\r\n\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nI would check that after deployment, the Integration Request in the API GW Console shows that this is being routed to the proper route. Without knowing for sure, I&#39;m assuming your application path is actually http://aws_lb.myapis.dns_name/nmapscan:8000 and that&#39;s not being passed correctly to the NLB because it isn&#39;t properly mapping for some reason in the Integration Request.\r\n\r\nAll of that being said, the easiest way to see what the URI is when the request is being sent to the NLB is to enable API Gateway execution logs, and enable full request/response data on those logs. It will give you something similar to this:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n\r\n    (32e76dc1-2e80-11e9-b849-1d4cbf2f1403) Endpoint request body after transformations: {&quot;resource&quot;:&quot;/testproxy&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/testproxy&quot;,&quot;httpMethod&quot;:&quot;GET&quot;,&quot;headers&quot;:[TRUNCATED]\r\n    (32e76dc1-2e80-11e9-b849-1d4cbf2f1403) Sending request to [TRUNCATED]\r\n\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nI truncated for brevity but you can see the path definition there. It will be useful to look at that to narrow down where the error is originating.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58089140/aws-api-gateway-404-page-not-found-error-when-invoking-endpoint-url/58103291#58103291","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106225/aws-api-gateway-method-request-path-parameter-not-working/58108659#58108659","title":"AWS API Gateway Method request path parameter not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":96,"user_id":9419418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1654d8480c7ef2acb3bb70ed2ac1d9a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dmn0972","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9419418/dmn0972"},"last_editor":{"reputation":96,"user_id":9419418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1654d8480c7ef2acb3bb70ed2ac1d9a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dmn0972","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9419418/dmn0972"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58108659,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569468758,"creation_date":1569443932,"last_edit_date":1569468758,"question_id":58106225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106225","body_markdown":"I am trying to configure API Gateway to route requests to a specific route on my backend GO microservice. I am using a `GET` request method with a `VPC_LINK` integration with an `NLB`, which routes to my backend microservice running in `Fargate`. This is a simple `REST` api written in `GO`. On the service side, in my handler, I put a catch all response for my stage route and then a &quot;Hello World&quot; response for the `/nmapscan` route, which is what I am trying to hit. However, when I try to hit my backend service with the invocation url, I keep getting the catch all response, despite the request path appearing correct in my request response output. I am new to API Gateway and I have a feeling I am missing something simple. Also, when I ran the container locally, I attached a shell and ran `curl localhost:8000/v1/nmapscan` and got the correct &quot;Hello World!&quot; response.

That just doesn&#39;t make sense.\r\n\r\n- All Device Acquisitions vs. All Device Loss counts do not correspond to Total Active Devices - for example difference between &#39;All Device Acquisitions&#39; &amp; &#39;All Device Loss&#39; can be positive, meaning you gained more devices then lost, yet &#39;Total Active Devices&#39; for that day shows lower then previous day which indicates you lost devices.\r\n\r\n- Total Active Users trends do not correspond to Total Active Devices, again Total Users can show increases, but Total Devices for that day can show a loss.\r\n\r\nCurious if anyone else has noticed this and any other confusing stats and how to best make sense of this. \r\n\r\nAlso wondering if these stats can still be trusted or is Google tweaking things and having issues.

When you define the SQL UDF function, you can also accept an array of type anything, but I am not sure if it can work and SQL UDF can perform what we want with an array.  It seems based on the Javascript UDF documentation all parameters are named and typed and known up front. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to accomplish this using a BigQuery UDF, it has to be dynamic like Oracle decode and fit any scenario you put in front of it not static knowing what you are decoding","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106202/how-to-implement-generic-oracle-decode-function-in-bigquery","title":"How to implement generic Oracle DECODE function in BigQuery?"},{"tags":["h2o"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2870,"user_id":2085461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1362749253c8eded063e3bbe93efebac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"TomKraljevic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2085461/tomkraljevic"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569444066,"creation_date":1569444066,"answer_id":58106255,"question_id":58106200,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58106255","body_markdown":"No, there is no way to produce a jupyter notebook instead.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can write your own jupyter notebook to drive H2O using the python client api.\r\n\r\nHere are some references:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/algo-params/ntrees.html\r\nhttp://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-py/docs/index.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106200/is-there-a-way-to-get-jupyter-notebook-out-of-h2o/58106255#58106255","title":"is there a way to get jupyter notebook out of H2O"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12121496,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDTx_dbnECF8DdEqC2ZC-DNayr34viMMQHRzL6cB0M=k-s128","display_name":"Ezana Aimero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12121496/ezana-aimero"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569485777,"accepted_answer_id":58106255,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569444066,"creation_date":1569443828,"question_id":58106200,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106200","body_markdown":"i am building a model using H2O. is there a way H2O can produce Jupyter notebook instead of seeing the predicted model using H2O flow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106200/is-there-a-way-to-get-jupyter-notebook-out-of-h2o","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"is there a way to get jupyter notebook out of H2O"},{"tags":["java","javafx","filter","tableview","nstableviewcell"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":70,"user_id":10615480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-utY_AsjQR8Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbDSzCWf-WDok7nasUukM8bg18bmew/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Outreagous ONE","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10615480/outreagous-one"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569453937,"post_id":58107602,"comment_id":102605829,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106199/filter-a-tableview-leaves-some-data-in-a-specific-column/58107602#comment102605829_58107602"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2167,"user_id":5844477,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/801ce427cdcbac7f648471e75d6d818e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sai Dandem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5844477/sai-dandem"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569452684,"creation_date":1569452684,"answer_id":58107602,"question_id":58106199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58107602","body_markdown":"Yes as you mentioned the problem is from updateItem method.

Try the following:\r\n\r\n    &lt;toggle-button\r\n      color=&quot;rgba(9, 90, 6, 1)&quot;\r\n      @change=&quot;SaveConfigFinalSemana($event)&quot;\r\n      name=&quot;email&quot;

`value` and `srcEvent` properties present on the emitted object:\r\n\r\n    SaveConfigFinalSemana: function($event) {\r\n      console.log($event.value);\r\n      console.log($event.srcEvent);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you need the DOM event `target` property and the `name` property of `target`, you could access it like:\r\n\r\n    SaveConfigFinalSemana: function($event) {\r\n      console.log($event.srcEvent.target);\r\n      console.log($event.srcEvent.target.name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is an [example][2] in action.\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Apparently Apple has fixed an old bug, causing problems with apps that used this &#39;workaround&#39;.\r\n\r\nI have tested this on iOS 12.4.2, iOS 13.1.2, tvOS 13.0, macOS 10.14.6 and macOS 10.15 GM.\r\n\r\n    let info = CKSubscription.NotificationInfo()\r\n    info.shouldSendContentAvailable = true\r\n    // info.soundName = &quot;&quot; // Don&#39;t set this property\r\n    // info.alertBody = &quot;&quot; // And also leave this this property alone\r\n    let subscription = CKQuerySubscription(recordType: &quot;yourRecordType&quot;, predicate: NSPredicate(value: true), subscriptionID: &quot;yourSubscription&quot;, options: [CKQuerySubscription.Options.firesOnRecordUpdate, CKQuerySubscription.Options.firesOnRecordDeletion])\r\n    subscription.notificationInfo = info\r\n\r\n    // You must first delete the old subscription to change the sound name            \r\n    let deleteOperation = CKModifySubscriptionsOperation(subscriptionsToSave: nil, subscriptionIDsToDelete: [&quot;yourSubscription&quot;])      \r\n    yourContainer.privateCloudDatabase.add(deleteOperation)\r\n\r\n    let createOperation = CKModifySubscriptionsOperation(subscriptionsToSave: [subscription], subscriptionIDsToDelete: nil)\r\n    createOperation.addDependency(deleteOperation)        \r\n    yourContainer.privateCloudDatabase.add(createOperation)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106180/ios-13-1-doesnt-receive-silent-ckquerysubscription-notifications/58241940#58241940","title":"iOS 13.1 doesn&#39;t receive silent CKQuerySubscription notifications"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1313,"user_id":1226962,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9073634c3dc50421a13dd18ca885f49b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"powertoold","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226962/powertoold"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570640798,"post_id":58289616,"comment_id":102979586,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106180/ios-13-1-doesnt-receive-silent-ckquerysubscription-notifications/58289616#comment102979586_58289616"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7245,"user_id":433950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14d0327bcafee0a960a4fecb30ac808c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"the Reverend","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/433950/the-reverend"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7245,"user_id":433950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14d0327bcafee0a960a4fecb30ac808c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"the Reverend","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/433950/the-reverend"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570655401,"last_edit_date":1570655401,"creation_date":1570548834,"answer_id":58289616,"question_id":58106180,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58289616","body_markdown":"Silent Notifications stopped working for my app as well in iOS 13.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n - On my iOS 12 devices and MacBook, silent notifications kept working correctly.\r\n - Recreated subscriptions multiple times without success.       \r\n - Checked all steps in\r\n   https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1917/_index.html\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Ely&#39;s answer, I immediately went to check if I had a soundName set for the notification.

am using JSONata for performing JSON to JSON transformation.\r\n\r\nFor some unique reasons, I want to merge two JSONata expressions :\r\n\r\nAs an example : \r\n\r\n**Parent Expression:**\r\n```\r\nvar script = `\r\n{\r\n      &quot;data&quot;:\r\n      {\r\n          &quot;name&quot; : data.payload.Name.(FirstName &amp; &#39; &#39; &amp; LastName),    \r\n          &quot;alias&quot;: data.payload.Name.(Salutation &amp; &#39; &#39; &amp; FirstName),\r\n          &quot;active&quot;: data.payload.Status = &#39;New&#39; ? true : false,\r\n          &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;Have good day ,&quot; &amp; data.payload.Name.FirstName &amp; &quot;!&quot;\r\n       }       \r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso I have few simple assignment kind of JSONata expression like :\r\n\r\n**Expression 1 :**\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   &quot;source&quot; : source\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Expression 2 :**\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;data&quot;: {\r\n     &quot;email&quot; : data.payload.Email\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to add above two expressions to expressions defined using `script`.\r\n\r\nSo after adding these two expressions, I should be able to get :\r\n```\r\nvar script = `\r\n{\r\n      &quot;source&quot;: source,\r\n      &quot;data&quot;:\r\n      {\r\n          &quot;name&quot; : data.payload.Name.(FirstName &amp; &#39; &#39; &amp; LastName),    \r\n          &quot;alias&quot;: data.payload.Name.(Salutation &amp; &#39; &#39; &amp; FirstName),\r\n          &quot;active&quot;: data.payload.Status = &#39;New&#39; ? true : false,\r\n          &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;Have good day ,&quot; &amp; data.payload.Name.FirstName &amp; &quot;!&quot;,\r\n          &quot;email&quot;: data.payload.Email\r\n       }       \r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow do I do using javascript/JSONata ?\r\n\r\n**Background and constraints :** \r\n\r\n 1. Child Expressions (expression 1 and 2 in the example) (that is supposed to be added into Parent expression) will always be simple assignment like `&quot;a&quot; : x.y.z or &quot;b&quot; : x`.\r\n\r\n 2. Child Expressions may already be present in parent expression. In that case, it replaces assignment.\r\n\r\n 3. Also I want to delete some json paths from parent expression (ofcouse , if it is present) like If delete path `data.Email`.\r\n\r\n**What I have done ? :**\r\n\r\n- I tried to convert JSONata script to JSON by putting values under double quotes and encoding value using escape() function. \r\n- Once I have JSON, I look for path mentioned in child expression (like data.Email)\r\n      - If path exists : replace its value\r\n      - If path does not exist : create path and assign value\r\n      - If path is supposed to be deleted : simply delete it.\r\n\r\n- Once I have done processing above JSON,\r\nI convert it to JSONata script by removing quotes using bunch of regex and then applying unescape() method for decoding.\r\n\r\n- The problem with this approach is :\r\n     - It is not reliable (regex matching and replacement is not fullproof)\r\n     - I am not sure whether every JSONata (which does not declare any functions) can be converted to valid JSON always.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106179/merging-two-jsonata-expressions","title":"Merging two JSONata expressions"},{"tags":["scala","apache-spark","spark-streaming"],"owner":{"reputation":1747,"user_id":1825027,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gDLob.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Savitsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1825027/alex-savitsky"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569443699,"creation_date":1569443699,"question_id":58106176,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106176","body_markdown":"I have an use case of a DStream that contains data with several levels of nesting, and I have a requirement to persist different elements from that data into separate HDFS locations.

In reality, I have about 10 different jobs all waiting to complete sequentially, and would probably see a big improvement in execution time if I&#39;d be able to run them all in parallel.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106176/transform-and-persist-spark-dstream-into-several-separate-locations-in-parallel","title":"Transform and persist Spark DStream into

is built on top of Ignite Cache, so yes, you can replicate the same functionality in .NET:\r\n\r\n1. Create a cache\r\n2. Use [Continuous Query](https://apacheignite-net.readme.io/docs/continuous-queries) as a consumer, call ICache.Remove to ensure that every item is processed only once\r\n3. Add data to cache on producers with [Data Streamers](https://apacheignite-net.readme.io/docs/data-streamers) or just use `ICache.Put` / `PutAll`\r\n\r\nBelow is the code for continuous query listener:\r\n```\r\nclass CacheEventListener&lt;TK, TV&gt; : ICacheEntryEventListener&lt;TK, TV&gt;\r\n{\r\n    private readonly string _cacheName;\r\n\r\n    [InstanceResource]  // Injected automatically.\r\n    private readonly IIgnite _ignite = null;\r\n\r\n    private ICache&lt;TK, TV&gt; _cache;\r\n\r\n    public CacheEventListener(string cacheName)\r\n    {\r\n        _cacheName = cacheName;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void OnEvent(IEnumerable&lt;ICacheEntryEvent&lt;TK, TV&gt;&gt; events)\r\n    {\r\n        _cache = _cache ?? _ignite.GetCache&lt;TK, TV&gt;(_cacheName);\r\n\r\n        foreach (var entryEvent in events)\r\n        {\r\n            if (entryEvent.EventType == CacheEntryEventType.Created &amp;&amp; _cache.Remove(entryEvent.Key))\r\n            {\r\n                // Run consumer logic here - use another thread for heavy processing.\r\n                Consume(entryEvent.Value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we deploy this to every node with a single call:\r\n```\r\nvar consumer = new CacheEventListener&lt;Guid, string&gt;(cache.Name);\r\nvar continuousQuery = new ContinuousQuery&lt;Guid, string&gt;(consumer);\r\ncache.QueryContinuous(continuousQuery);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, `OnEvent` is called once per entry on the primary node for that entry. So there is one consumer per Ignite node. We can increase effective number of consumers per node by offloading actual consumer logic to other threads, using `BlockingCollection` and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd one last thing - we have to come up with a unique cache key for every new entry. Simplest thing is `Guid.NewGuid()`, but we can also use `AtomicSequence`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106173/ignitequeue-in-apache-ignite-net/58112131#58112131","title":"IgniteQueue in Apache Ignite.NET"}],"owner":{"reputation":194,"user_id":742578,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/927a6dcbf8bc84d458edc6fc67ffdd76?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rishabh Jain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/742578/rishabh-jain"},"last_editor":{"reputation":194,"user_id":742578,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/927a6dcbf8bc84d458edc6fc67ffdd76?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rishabh Jain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/742578/rishabh-jain"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58112131,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569525689,"creation_date":1569443684,"last_edit_date":1569519865,"question_id":58106173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106173","body_markdown":"We are using Ignite.NET and don&#39;t have option to use Ignite Java API (team skills, technology affinity etc).

It should be \r\n```\r\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you pretty much need something like this \r\n```&lt;Router&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;Link to={&quot;/bbc-news&quot;}&gt;BBC&lt;/Link&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;Link to={&quot;/cnbc&quot;}&gt;CNBC&lt;/Link&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n        &lt;Route\r\n          key={&quot;fbbc-news&quot;}\r\n          path=&quot;/bbc-news&quot;\r\n          render={p =&gt; &lt;Channel channelName=&quot;BBC&quot; channelString=&quot;bbc-news&quot; /&gt;}\r\n        /&gt;\r\n        &lt;Route\r\n          key={&quot;cnbc&quot;}\r\n          path=&quot;/cnbc&quot;\r\n          render={p =&gt; &lt;Channel channelName=&quot;CNBC&quot; channelString=&quot;cnbc&quot; /&gt;}\r\n        /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere Channel component renders whats inside the channel. the `key` in Route is important, because it makes React properly trigger componentDidMount, which calls the thunk action which fetches (that one is perfect).\r\nThen to access the results from fetch, which you have placed in Redux =&gt;\r\n```\r\nconst mapStateToProps = state =&gt; ({ json: state.json });\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need a lot of the things you had, so I have removed them, like the onClick, which was trying to do react routers job ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106122/routing-within-an-app-using-react-router-to-move-to-another-page/58107028#58107028","title":"routing within an app using react router to move to another page"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11937523"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569479760,"creation_date":1569443368,"question_id":58106122,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106122","body_markdown":"- I am trying to use router in my app\r\n- so I used react-router-dom, but I am facing issues,\r\n- researched and found this link but still not helping me.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/55552147/invariant-failed-you-should-not-use-route-outside-a-router\r\n\r\n- can you tell me how to use route and link\r\n- i need to redirect to another page.\r\n- providing my code snippet  and sandbox below.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/still-smoke-uf731\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language-all: lang-or-tag-here --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let Channel = ({ channelName, channelString, onClick, active }) =&gt; (\r\n      &lt;div onClick={onClick} className=&quot; col-lg-2 col-md-4 col-sm-6 &quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div&gt;router&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;Router&gt;\r\n          &lt;Link to={&quot;/here&quot;}&gt; here&lt;/Link&gt;\r\n          &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n            &lt;Route path=&quot;/auth&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Router&gt;\r\n        &lt;div\r\n          className=&quot;channel-button&quot;\r\n          style={{\r\n            backgroundColor: active === channelString ?

The UI has a form that gathers all the data and then the associated controller pushes that data through Newtonsoft to produce JSON.  The problem is the child tables keep appearing as &quot;null&quot; in the JSON and I think I&#39;ve set up my partial views incorrectly.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the base model, `NPPR_Provider`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n [Table(&quot;NPPR_Provider&quot;, Schema =&quot;AD&quot;)]\r\n    public class NPPR_Provider : Provider\r\n    {\r\n        //...\r\n        public NPPR_ServLocation NPPR_ServLocation { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvider&#39;s direct child is `NPPR_ServLocation`.  The other properties I omitted were just primary and foreign keys.  The base class &quot;Provider&quot; simply provides all the column names shared between the different types of provider my company has.\r\n\r\n`NPPR_ServLocation`&#39;s fields display fine in the resulting JSON, but it&#39;s children do not.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class NPPR_ServLocation\r\n    {\r\n        [Key]\r\n        public int ServLocationId { get; set; }\r\n        public int NPPRProvId { get; set; }\r\n        public string EnrollmentType { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        //... more column names that work as intended\r\n\r\n        //Child Tables:\r\n        public List&lt;NPPR_Address&gt; Address { get; set; }\r\n        public List&lt;NPPR_NPIAssociations&gt; NPIAssociations { get; set; }\r\n        //... more table names that do not work as intended\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe table names work fine for fetching data, so I don&#39;t think the problem is there.  It&#39;s in setting the data where I&#39;m running into this problem.  All of these tables appear as &quot;null&quot; in the resulting JSON.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how, for example, the NPI Associations model is passed from the primary view to its specific partial:\r\n\r\nPrimary view:\r\n```\r\nusing Company.Namespace.Application.Models\r\n@model NPPR_Provider\r\n\r\n&lt;section class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    @using (Html.BeginForm(&quot;NPPRJsonFile&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, FormMethod.Post, new { @class = &quot;form-horizontal&quot;, @id=&quot;NPPRTemplateForm&quot;, @onsubmit=&quot;validateNPPRTemplate(event)&quot; }))\r\n    {\r\n        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()\r\n        @Html.ValidationSummary(true, String.Empty, new { @class = &quot;text-danger&quot; })\r\n        @Html.Partial(partialFormsDir + &quot;ServiceProvider&quot;)\r\n        @Html.Partial(partialFormsDir + &quot;ServiceLocation&quot;)\r\n        @Html.Partial(partialFormsDir + &quot;NPIAssoc&quot;, Model.NPPR_ServLocation.NPIAssociations)\r\n        //... etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the NPIAssoc cshtml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@using Company.Namespace.Application.Models\r\n@model List&lt;NPPR_NPIAssociations&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;h3 class=&quot;aetna-brand-heading&quot;&gt;NPI Associations&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot; id=&quot;npiHTML&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-2&quot;&gt;\r\n        @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.NPI, htmlAttributes: new { @class = &quot;control-label&quot; })\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4&quot;&gt;\r\n        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.NPI, new { htmlAttributes = new { id = &quot;NPI&quot;, @class = &quot;form-control&quot;, maxlength = 10, required = true } })\r\n        &lt;small class=&quot;help-block&quot;&gt;Ten digit identifier, numeric values only&lt;/small&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    // ...etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the associated model:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Table(&quot;NPPR_NPIAssociations&quot;, Schema = &quot;AD&quot;)]\r\n    public class NPPR_NPIAssociations : NPI_Associations\r\n    {\r\n        [Key]\r\n        public int NPIAssocId { get; set; }\r\n        public int ServLocationId { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\npublic abstract class NPI_Associations\r\n    {\r\n        [Display(Name = &quot;NPI Association&quot;)]\r\n        [Required]\r\n        [RegularExpression(&quot;^[0-9]*$&quot;)]\r\n        [StringLength(10)]\r\n        public string NPI { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnd finally, the controller itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic ActionResult NPPRJsonFile(NPPR_Provider provider)\r\n        {\r\n            string nppr_file = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(provider);\r\n            ViewData[&quot;nppr_json&quot;] = nppr_file;\r\n            return View(&quot;NPPRJsonFile&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason, when I fill out the form and submit, all of the child tables of `NPPR_ServLocation` are coming into the JSON as &quot;null&quot;.  Not the fields with in them, the models themselves.  Even with all the input fields properly filled in.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;NPPR_ServLocation&quot;:{\r\n    &quot;ServLocationId&quot;:0,\r\n    &quot;NPPRProvId&quot;:0,\r\n    &quot;EnrollmentType&quot;:&quot;I&quot;,\r\n    &quot;ProviderLocationId&quot;:null,\r\n    &quot;ProviderTypeCode&quot;:&quot;29&quot;,\r\n    &quot;OrganizationType&quot;:&quot;H&quot;,\r\n    &quot;Address&quot;:null,\r\n    &quot;IRSTaxAssociations&quot;:null,\r\n    &quot;NPIAssociations&quot;:null,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see, starting at `Address`, they&#39;re all null.  And they&#39;re all set up the same way NPIAssociations is set up as I showed above.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106108/child-objects-in-partial-keeps-coming-up-as-null","title":"Child objects in partial keeps coming up as null"},{"tags":["java","c#","apache-httpclient-4.x","qliksense"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12120186,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/906f0f50f8724767f5142bf60f019828?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"luke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12120186/luke"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12122430,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/846844952178885/picture?type=large","display_name":"tekgeek88","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12122430/tekgeek88"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569464880,"creation_date":1569443269,"last_edit_date":1569464880,"question_id":58106107,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58106107","body_markdown":"I am currently working on authorizing the Qlik API proxy using Java.

Without doing anything else, clicking again let&#39;s it work fine.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have a debug message in my `onClick`, so it looks something like this\r\n\r\n                        onClick={(e) =&gt; {\r\n                            console.log(&quot;ONclicked! &quot; + this.props.alt);\r\n                            // e.stopPropagation();\r\n                            // various callbacks\r\n                        }}&gt;\r\n\r\nI also have similar `console.log` debug messages on all of the button&#39;s parents, *all the way up to the root React element* (i.e. clicking anywhere on the page shoots out a message, except when clicking on this particular button the first time). Even the root element does not register anything on the first click..\r\n\r\nNone of these messages appear on the first click.\r\n\r\nAgain, *without doing anything else*, just clicking one more time in the same spot fires the `onClick` as expected.\r\n\r\nOther questions about &quot;first click not working&quot; I&#39;ve seen are all about the state not updating on the first click. In my case I&#39;m not even trying to update the state, I don&#39;t seem to be getting the `onClick` called at all.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve looked through all the commits for this version and still haven&#39;t been able to figure out the problem. Any ideas on what can cause this behavior? The weirdest part to me is that the second click works, while the first doesn&#39;t seem to do anything. But nothing about the state/DOM is changing between the first and second click (since the first click doesn&#39;t seem to be registered at all). I think this rules out things like a misconfigured `pointer-events` CSS rule?\r\n\r\nEdit: \r\n\r\nUpon further exploration, it seems that the first click actually triggers `onMouseEnter`, which seems totally nuts lol... But I added a `console.log` to `onMouseEnter` and it&#39;s definitely triggering exactly when I make the first click, and NOT on subsequent clicks.\r\n\r\nEdit 2:\r\n\r\nBut this mouseEnter thing only happens in Firefox, not Chrome. But the first click not working bug is in both browsers.\r\n\r\nEdit 3:\r\n\r\n`onMouseDown` is firing properly, but `onClick` still only happens on the second time the button is clicked (at which point `onMouseDown` has fired twice).\r\n\r\nAlso, double checked and confirmed that I don&#39;t use `stopPropagation` anywhere which seems to be a common source of this problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106099/react-onclick-not-firing-on-first-click-second-click-behaves-as-expected-simpl","title":"React onClick not firing on first click, second click behaves as expected (simple debug message doesn&#39;t appear until second click)"},{"tags":["reactjs","gatsby"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7168,"user_id":5385381,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/48SvP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ksav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5385381/ksav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569446077,"post_id":58106094,"comment_id":102603936,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106094/why-does-component-not-show-correct-values-on-screen-when-inside-xhr-readystate#comment102603936_58106094"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":443,"user_id":6014489,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ue4oG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zeke Hernandez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6014489/zeke-hernandez"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569445159,"creation_date":1569445159,"answer_id":58106458,"question_id":58106094,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58106458","body_markdown":"```Posts``` should be a part of the State of this React component.\r\nBy the time ```onreadystatechange```is called, ```Posts``` is no longer a thing that React is watching to determine whether or not this component re-renders or not.

It&#39;s a home burglar alarm system with telegram messaging and blackouts+internet outages detection.\r\nEach PHP script has a role, one for sensor monitoring, another for triggering alarm when armed and sensor alerted, another to detect blackouts, one to listen to telegram, another to manage telegram outbound queue, it may look like much stuff, but the real write activity is only for sensor monitoring (each alert is recorded even when not armed).\r\nAnyway, I have WAL journaling mode enabled.\r\nEach script includes common files, a config file, a functions file, and the db.inc.php file containing the following lines of code:\r\n\r\n    $db = new SQLite3(dirname(__FILE__).&quot;/DB/db.sqlite&quot;);\r\n    $db-&gt;exec(&quot;PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000&quot;);\r\n    $db-&gt;exec(&#39;PRAGMA journal_mode = wal;&#39;);\r\n\r\nJust one of the scripts occasionally returns the database locked warning, it&#39;s the one which manages the telegram outbound queue so that no more than one message per second is sent. The send_telegram() function called by any script needing to notify something saves the outgoing message in a DB table, whith a &quot;sent&quot; flag initially set to 0:\r\n\r\n    $db-&gt;exec(&quot;INSERT INTO telegram_outbound (to_id, message, sent) VALUES (&#39;$chatid&#39;,&#39;&quot;.SQLite3::escapeString($msg).&quot;&#39;,0)&quot;);\r\n\r\n(sometimes locked warning is triggered by this statement)\r\n\r\nAlso, the same script checks if internet is offline, or if it&#39;s come back up, by pinging a URL, and saves this with\r\n\r\n    $db-&gt;exec(&quot;INSERT INTO internet_outages (status) VALUES ($status)&quot;);\r\n\r\n(sometimes this triggers the warning)\r\n\r\nThe queue script checks the database each second with:\r\n\r\n    $outbox=$db-&gt;query(&quot;SELECT to_id, message, id, time FROM telegram_outbound WHERE sent=0 ORDER BY id&quot;);\r\n\r\nand calls the API URL.\r\nAfter doing so, it updates the outbound message with:\r\n\r\n    $db-&gt;exec(&quot;UPDATE telegram_outbound SET sent=1,time=datetime(&#39;now&#39;,&#39;localtime&#39;) WHERE id={$message[2]} LIMIT 1&quot;);\r\n\r\n(sometimes this causes warning)\r\n\r\nNone of these statements are run in an &quot;excessive&quot; manner, all of them only occur when there is something going on, we&#39;re not talking about a busy chatroom.\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t happen often, on the contrary it might be once every two weeks, but I think that with a small load, and with WAL enabled, this should never ever occur.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to at least debug this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106079/php-returns-warning-sqlite3exec-database-is-locked-even-in-wal-journal-mod","title":"PHP returns Warning: SQLite3::exec(): database is locked even in WAL journal_mode"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pyqt5","pyinstaller","py2exe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1168,"user_id":9705687,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v7dmz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"bfris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9705687/bfris"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569454498,"post_id":58106077,"comment_id":102605934,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58106077/pyqt5-application-is-not-working-just-cmd-flashing-when-built-with-pyinstaller#comment102605934_58106077"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":7121993,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/986dd1706608dfe69dc6b8fb5a5e6441?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bonana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7121993/bonana"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569452801,"creation_date":1569452801,"answer_id":58107619,"question_id":58106077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58107619","body_markdown":"Maybe it&#39;s not complete answear to why PyInstaller or py2exe is not working, but I&#39;ve found way to deploy my exe properly.

This is for an internal testing purpose. \r\n\r\nSo the end result is to have an executable which will launch multiple instances of my server(another windows executable) on multiple ports. My ideal approach would be to have &quot;n&quot; go routines that launch the command &quot;myserver.exe .\\config.json port+n&quot; on ports ranging from &quot;port+0&quot; to &quot;port+n&quot; so that I would have &quot;n&quot; servers up and running. I am figuring out a way to launch my server and keep listening until I want the program to end. \r\n\r\nI have my server as an windows executable which serves on a port mentioned while launching it. It works fine when I launch it manually. It can be launched as : \r\n\r\n    C:\\Install\\myServer.exe C:\\Install\\Configuration.json 8079 \r\n\r\nThe above command starts the server and listens to the port 8079. I would like to launch multiple instances of the same server on different ports.

I can see that the command to start my server has been executed but I donot see any services when I open the services.msc neither when I do a get-service powershell command.

did indeed directly solve the problem - here&#39;s how:\r\n\r\n - Keras binary classification expects labels (&#39;targets&#39;) shaped as `(batch_size, 1)`. Reason: the goal of the final layer is to output _predictions_, which will be compared against _labels_ to compute metrics (loss, accuracy, etc) - and labels are shaped `(batch_size, 1)`\r\n - Above is also why `to_categorical` was a problem - see snippet from [docs](https://keras.io/utils/#to_categorical) below; for binary classification, one-hot encoding is redundant, as `binary_crossentropy` directly compares labels against predictions as supplied\r\n - Keras `Dense` expects inputs to be 2D: `(batch_size, input_dim)`. Your reshaping was making the input 3D: `(batch_size, 1, input_dim)`\r\n - Above is also why `shape=(1, no_terms)` --&gt; `shape=(no_terms,)` helped; both are, in fact, correct for the data shapes you were feeding at the time. The full batch shape simply includes the batch dim: `(batch_size, no_terms)` (`no_terms == input_dim`)\r\n - Lastly, for binary classification, use `loss=&#39;binary_crossentropy&#39;` - and never mean square error for classification problems (unless for very specific reasons)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Consider an array of 5 labels out of a set of 3 classes {0, 1, 2}:\r\n&gt; labels\r\narray([0, 2, 1, 2, 0])\r\n# `to_categorical` converts this into a matrix with as many\r\n# columns as there are classes.
